I finally did it today. This game literally took me back in time to where I was playing The Complete Saga on the DS and the Wii. It was a much needed ""one last time"" event that took me back before I become a legal adult.

Now I will get into what I view as the pros and cons of the game. SPOILERS?Pros: 1. Lego humor has never been funnier2. The game is open world3. Ship combat is fun4. The visuals are stunning 5. There is so much to do6. Taking a capital ship is fun7. There are so many details in this game8. Can't believe I have to say this but in today's gaming industry we finally have a game that isn't a mess at launch 9. Side quests are fun Cons: 1. My biggest gripe is that when it comes to the actual missions they feel lacking in content, they could have added more from each episode for sure. My biggest issue with this is that there is no level for the opening battle scene from Revenge of the Sith, that was my favorite level in Complete Saga. That may just be me though 2. This isn't really a con for me because I am definatly a more casual gamer, and this is a game for children, but the game is very easy. If your tired of Dark Souls and Elden Ring and just want to relax look no further. This game is for sure worth the 2 year delay and the $60Edit: After taking the Death Star this game is better"

Feels like the government or some other agency should take a look at this sort of scam thing. Why i said its a scam? because it influence my buying decision when i first bought the game.

One of the few times Deluxe Content is actually worth it plus Pre-order. I've played these from the first installment and mastered every game since then going on almost 20 years. This game truly captures the familiar vibes while adding its own modern twists. Gameplay is pretty smooth and the combat reminds me a little bit of DMC / GOW. I love how you can do Mute Voices with Retro Graphics. Performance runs like water even on an older PC and the graphics are crisp. Runs about as well as Consoles. I played on there first before getting early access here. You can do Controller as well as Keyboard and Mouse. I rate this: 100% True JediMay the Force be with you and God Speed.

I know people wanted it to be, but it isn’t. The mechanics are different, the levels are different, the style is different, everything is different except for the story. There have been a lot of complaints about the level design being “too easy” or the levels are too short. Again, I want to point out that LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga came out 15 years ago and LEGO and Travelers Tales have changed their format, level design, and overall gameplay a few times over since then. I personally did not want a “remastered” game, I wanted a new game, one that would change the formula of LEGO games. I would say that this game definitely does that. To be clear, at the writing of this review, I have completed 6 of the 9 films on story mode alone (1,2,3,4,5,7).Looking to the complaint of the short levels, I will agree, the levels are significantly shorter in this game than in the past. That does not mean, however, that there is less content. In addition, I think the voice actors do a great job of summarizing the Star Wars story with letting direct quotes and general set pieces direct the story. The one thing that seems to be more interesting about this game is that the open world is very integrated into the story. You have to go from one mission to the other (for the most part) by traveling to the planets yourself, or the different areas of said planets. The story definitely feels shorter, but I would say it reminds me of a “spark notes” version of Star Wars, especially with the voice acting in the game adding depth to the story. The mumble mode is a fun nostalgic call back to the old games, but in my unpopular opinion, it does not work for this game. The reason why it worked in the old games was because the characters mouths don’t move, but they are fully voice acted with detailed mouth movement. The Clone Wars voice actors sound phenomenal in the prequel trilogy and would highly recommend playing through with mumble mode off. Of course, I will play some stuff with mumble mode on for funs sake.For those worried about trekking over everywhere to get to missions, there is a designated area in the menu to play just the missions again once it has been played through on story mode. This game still has a lot of unlockables, lots of upgrading, and plenty of time to spend hanging out in the Star Wars universe. The combat in this game is really new and exciting with “combos” being implemented as well as interesting mechanics with both lightsabers and blasters.Overall, I would say this game is an exciting, fun, new aspect of not only the Star Wars franchise, but also LEGO games in general.10/10Pro:Fun nostalgic callback to my childhoodInteresting new levelsOpen world is refreshing and seamless into the storyCompletionist dreamVoice Acting is wonderful (Prequel trilogy with Clone Wars voice acting is *wonderful*Mumble modeCons:Levels/Story is slightly shorter than previous installments of LEGO gamesOpen world can be overwhelming when starting offSome small bugstl;dr – game is super fun, “this is where the fun begins”10/10"

Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga includes the Story of all 9 Movies in a compressed way. The cutscenes are cut down to the very basic information’s of the Story, which isn’t a bad thing directly, since the Lego games were never meant for long drawn out cutscenes. It can be hard to follow what’s going on thou in case you haven’t seen the Movies. Over the course of the Story, you visit all Iconic locations from the franchise like you would expect. You can choose to either begin the game at Episode 1, 4 or 7, depending on the order you want to experience them.                       The gameplay is mostly the same as in the old games, destroy everything and loot studs! The game isn’t too hard and you don’t lose to much in case you die, its designed to be a relaxing, enjoyable experience and they definitely succeed with that. But thankfully, they did improve the game systems. The 380 Characters you can unlock are sorted into different categories like Jedi, Hero, Scavenger, Bounty Hunter, Droid etc. Each category has different skills you can invest into which can be upgraded in 3 Tiers each on top. You get skill points by collecting Special Bricks in each level, which are rewarded for different goals and challenges.The combat system also got a general overhaul and is now more versatile compared to the old games.   Beside that you can also collect Mini-kits, Vehicles and of course, new Characters. The levels feel bigger to me like in the old games and more open ended. Each is filled with a ton of Stuff to do, if you enjoy collecting Items and upgrades, you will find your happiness here. And like in the old games, the levels are designed in a way, that not everything can be looted the first time you visit a location. Some items need talents or Characters you will only obtain later to reach.                The Graphic is a lovely mix of detailed Lego Models and Bricks/Structures and a more real general atheistic of the environments, which works out flawlessly in my eyes. The Audio is really good, it sounds like you would Star Wars expect to sound.                          If you enjoyed the old Lego games, you will immediately feel at home in the Skywalker Saga, all the new features, and a game that can be enjoyed solo or in coop with a friend, with the good Lego Humor on top guarantees a good time. If you are new to the Series and/or just found the game because you are a Star Wars fan and you are on the lookout for a relaxing game that can keep you busy for hours, or just for a while after a long day, I can fully recommend Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga to you as well!"

Well, it probably won't be a real review. I think it will be more of a story about me and the initial conflict about the game.I've been putting off this „review“ for weeks because I don't even know exactly why this is so important to me and I just can't find the right words.It may well be that this has something to do with the partly negative reviews, which I can also understand somewhere. But also because I was a bit disappointed with the game myself at first and I needed some distance from the game to think about it. After all, I've been waiting for this game for a long time and I'm really looking forward to it. Admittedly, it's also one of the few games that I bought right after it was released.I downloaded the game, started it and then went to the menu. Let's see what has changed. Yes, hello, what is that? That's a menu, a real one. No longer such a spartan menu as in the other Lego games where you can only adjust the volume, effects and a few graphic settings. Yes oops. I can adjust a lot of things. That's amazing. I really like that. A few settings made and off you go. Hm, now I have to decide which level or which part to start with. Well, since I'm as old as the Star Wars films themselves, I went with the ""classic"" variety, the order of release. So in this case Episode IV. So the first level and... ""wow, what's that,"" that looks mega. That's absolutely amazing what had an effect on me graphically and playfully. I would not have expected that in my life. So get into the fray and diligently cut up and tear down everything that comes in my way and yikes, what's up now? As ? Why is the level over now? I've only just played what feels like 5 minutes? What's happening ? , I look at the cutscene when my wife comes home and says: oh cool, the new Lego Star Wars. And how is it ? Yeah, um, I don't know, I said. Actually totally great, but I just played a level and it was over after what felt like 5 minutes. How can that be ? It wasn't like that in The Complete Saga. Exactly, that wasn't it and that's what made it so difficult for me and somehow I didn't enjoy it anymore. Of course, I then took a closer look at what had been written about the game so far and especially the negative reviews and the more I read, the “worse” things got for me too. At some point I didn't feel like playing the game anymore that I really left it there for days.One morning when I opened Steam at work I came across these two videos:When I watched these videos it kind of “clicked” for me and when I got home in the evening I grabbed my kids and said, listen, you have to play the new Lego Star Wars now.How you make your kids play Lego Star Wars... Well, I wouldn't necessarily call it that. I'd rather say I've changed the  priorities a bit, but joking aside, I asked them if they wanted to do that because I assumed they weren't averse to it anyway and because they've also enjoyed playing Lego games so far.But since I didn't want to buy the game again, family sharing and my own score had to be used and I couldn't continue playing myself for the time being. But it doesn't matter, it was a good thing because after a short time I heard the first giggles, laughter and phrases like ""oh, how cool is that"" or ""that's mega"" from the rooms.Unlike my son, who, like his father, first destroys everything in the area to see what is left at the end and only then deals with the rest, my daughter prefers to spend time exploring Tatooine, taking her time in peace to stroll around the area and see what there is to discover, who to talk to and what else you can do. In the following days, more and more friends joined them. It got louder, wilder and more and more difficult to get the kidz away from the game.What I mean to say is that Lego games are actually primarily designed for children, even though the games have been enjoying increasing popularity among (younger) adults for quite some time. Nevertheless, one shouldn't forget that children (by that I don't mean all adults for the moment) have a different point of view and also value other things. For the moment, a child doesn't really care if R2D2 suddenly can't hoover anymore, as long as it's even aware of it. For me, the character editor has never been relevant, except for the respective achievement. Others do, and that's fine, but there will certainly be reasons from the developers that some things in the game just aren't the way we used to be. Maybe even licensed. I think you can't always have everything, no matter how nice it is.When I asked them what they think of the game, everyone said it's the coolest Lego (Star Wars) game they've played. Yes, but what about The Complete Saga? I mean how does it compare to that?The answers were quite simple and unanimous.  They are just two different games and they have nothing to do with each other.The point that was so decisive and important for me. Considering the game as a sequel, remake or whatever, apart from the technical changes/innovations, it's fair to say it's bad.But that's not it. In no way.It is a new, independent and, above all, different game that should not be compared. Even if it's a bit difficult at times. But if you can do that, then the game is also a lot of fun.The Star Wars story is told more in the cutscenes. These are, in this case, also shortened to be suitable for children and the dialogues actually only consist of the well-known quotes. Strictly speaking, Lego Star Wars doesn't actually tell a story, but is more of a commentary track that emphasizes silly jokes. These jokes usually consist of the characters suddenly deviating from the script and doing something different, unexpected or stupid.So if you haven't seen the films, it can happen that these references aren't funny without an explanation and don't make any sense in relation to the story either. The game is clearly aimed at fans, but it's also suitable for children.The Skywalker Saga is a Lego game I've been expecting in 2022 and have been wanting for years.The fact that Lego games aren't perfect, that one or the other doesn't work that well and that the level of difficulty isn't particularly demanding is simply part of it for me and it doesn't bother me in the least.✅ Extremely extensive game✅ large open world✅ great design✅ typical Star Wars music✅ Slapstick humor✅ funny animation✅ new melee mode / combos✅ new collectibles✅ different skills✅ high replay value❌ Missions could be a little bit longer❌ Puzzles repeat themselves❌ maybe a little too easy❌ Gameplay not motivating in the long run❌ Camera position not always optimal"

Unfortunately, elements were often used more than once, especially in the collectibles and also for space battles, some quests and blue bricks.Unfortunately, there are also some small bugs in the levels. For example, sometimes you can not complete some challenges or the level simply does not go on because certain cut scenes are not triggered.Conclusion:In the end I can say that Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga is a game that convinced me and can offer a lot of fun if you are interested in Lego or Star Wars games. I bought it at release, played the main story once and now set out to complete it to 100% and can say it was worth every penny for me. If you are not sure if you should buy it then maybe wait until it is reduced and give it a chance.Overall I would give the game a rating of 8.5/10."

It's humor and zany cutscenes have devolved since the older games, but the tradeoff is a complete rework including redone levels, an excellent combat system and an expansive galaxy that has a decently immersive effect.First, the Story: The story does a more accurate job of retelling the saga with tons of decent voiceacting (you can turn off voice acting with mumble mode to have an older LEGO experience. I will say though, mumble mode isn't single mumbles, they mumble out entire sentences, so it feels a little weird), the cutscenes work with or without voiceacting which is a surreal dynamic experience that the devs get my kudos on, but the levels themselves are really short and kind've disappointing. They introduce ""level challenges"", there are 3 in every level and they're alternative ways of going about each one. They're fun in general, but if you're trying to 100% they can be a nightmare sometimes. Minikits have been reduced from 10 to 5 per level, which was debatably my favorite part about replaying a level. Overall, cutscene and immersion-wise, the levels are fun to play and have the same great puzzle-solving they've always had, replayability is quite low though.First-Time through 9/10Free-Play 100% 6/10 (basically, thank god they're short)Now Galaxy-Mode was easily the most fun I've had through the whole experience. Instead of collecting gold bricks to a grand total of 250, (using the Marvel Avengers game as the mold here since it's the last one I 100%'d, god it sucked), there are 1,160 bricks, (known as ""kyber bricks"") that are collectable through completing level challenges, collecting minikits, getting ""true jedi"" on each level, doing side quests among 33 planets, destroying kyber comets, smuggling, doing bounty hunts, and puzzles on each and every planet. It was a ton of fun to mark each planet off the list as I collected each planets' worth. Some quests can only be done if you've progressed through the story up until that point, or until you've done other side quests. Personally, I recommend playing the base game all the way through 4-6, 1-3, 7-9, THEN doing galaxy-mode, so there will be less holdups. In advance, there was only 1 planet that gave me trouble and it was Endor, my guess is, the fire VFX would keep spawning as you loaded new areas, and it wouldn't unload areas you're not in anymore so the constant fire VFX made it a laggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. (However, entering a village hut loading zone, then exiting refreshed the lag, which led me to believe it was fire VFX that wouldn't unload.) Other than that, the quests and puzzles are really fun to complete.9/10, it is the after-story experience you want.I'll wrap it up here with the UI, combat/upgrade system, and the red bricks rework.So the UI for the most part is pretty straightforward, might take a bit of learning but once you have it down, it all makes sense, stuff goes where it should go, changing characters is a bit messy and if you have OCD about how you want your free-play characters organized, that might be a huge problem because thats the only place where the UI falters heavily. Once you play, you'll figure out what I mean.The combat system is EXTREMELY intricate, you have a third person firing mode with guns and saber-throwing. There's also cover you can hide behind (and rebuild if it gets destroyed) and shoot from if you want to play that way. The biggest highlight though is the melee combat system. You initiate combat with a standard attack which can then go into changeups like heavy attacks, uppercut moves, and spike moves, depending on which corresponding button you press. These changeups become extremely prevalent in the lightsaber boss duels which make you feel like you control how the corresponding movie-scene flows.The red brick rework has been made easier to manage and deal with, you don't collect red bricks, instead you collect ""Data cards"" (1 per particular planet) in galaxy mode. They aren't specific to certain extras, you get the data card and choose which extra you want. (I recommend not buying anything until you get your first data card and do the stud multiplier route, things are hella expensive this time around so I'd say focus on getting all multipliers before you buy anything else) That being said ""Stud magnet"" and ""Fast build"" aren't extras anymore, they're ""Upgrades""The upgrade system integrates things like collecting studs, building faster, sprinting quicker, having more health, doing more damage, etc. which is where kyber bricks come in, as they are used as it's currency, plus an additional stud fee. (Now this is the exception to my advice about ""not buying anything"", buy upgrades when you can) There are core upgrades and class upgrades for specific character types, (Jedi, Hero, Bounty Hunter, Scoundrel, Scavenger, Villain, Dark Side, Astromech Droids, and Protocol Droids.) all of which have their own abilities and uses.All of these features really make the experience flow a lot smoother and are a perfect 10/10 for me.TL;DR: buy the game if you've been wanting a decent Lego Star Wars game, things are different for the better, mumble mode is there, and if you get deluxe, you get classic character packs (if nostalgia is your thing) among other misc. character packs. red bricks have been changed into a more easily flowing system, and the combat = good.Big word of advice: once you're in galaxy mode, buy the rumor for the character ""Grummgar"", complete all the missions to get him and you get to run really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fast around some of these bigger planets to complete your side quests."

I pre-ordered The Skywalker Saga a few days before its release; and at 100 hours of the game played, all 9 episodes completed, and 900 Kyber Bricks collected, I feel I can give an informed review. I will be judging the game on individual metrics, and then I'll give my final score.Exploration - 10/10If I could only mention one aspect of this game at exceeded my expectations, it would certainly be the vast galaxy laden with puzzles, side missions, and collectibles. I would hazard a guess that the average player will spend upwards of 200 hours achieving 100% completion of this game. The developers give the player the freedom to explore hub worlds immediately after discovering the planet; this allowed me to take frequent breaks from the episodic story to pursue all of the hidden collectibles throughout the worlds. In my opinion, the most fun part of this game is exploring the hub worlds. It is a completionist's paradise.Progression - 7/10I really appreciate when developers put time into erecting a progression system in their game - especially in an open-world genre; this allows players to work towards an eventual goal as they complete missions. In the early game, I looked forward to acquiring faster sprint speeds and stud magnet ranges. Later, I looked closer at the class-specific abilities and started investing in the Bounty Hunter and Dark Jedi. I wasn't expecting much in the way of a progression system from this game and was pleasantly surprised when I learned one was implemented. That said, I can't score the game too highly as I feel that most of the abilities are not particularly impressive. Once I had collected 500 Kyber Bricks, I was able to unlock all of the useful abilities, after which my interest in collecting more Kyber Bricks diminished. I still fully intend on obtaining all 1166, but the short-term rewards are lackluster at this point.Story - 3/10I must say the story missions in this game were a chore to play. I started off with the Phantom Menace and quickly learned that the enjoyable part of the game was exploring the hub worlds, not advancing through the tediously scripted missions. I felt like for almost the entire story mode, I was traveling between checkpoints as main characters spouted the dialogue from the movies, switching classes to interact with the same darn button puzzles, or engaging in ""intense"" light-saber combat with the bosses. I was told the combat system in this game was to be more advanced, and while it technically is more complex than the original Lego Star Wars games, the developers gave up on the puzzles integrated with the boss fights. It is simply a slashing fest for five minutes for every boss: Maul, Dooku, Grievous, Anakin, Vader, Sidious, Kylo, etc. In most boss fights, once the boss reaches a certain threshold, they will run away; and it usually takes several minutes to catch up with them. This really breaks the urgency of combat. And this often occurs 2-3 times per boss. The space combat is much more enjoyable as there are no breaks in combat. You simply search and destroy the given targets until the mission is over. Luckily, there are other aspects of this game that make up for the missions' shortcomings.Movies - 9/10So glad to see that the wit of Lego games as persisted all of these years. There were many occasions I audibly laughed at the humor throughout the movies in this game. My only complaint is that you cannot access the movies anywhere in the menus. In previous installments, you could purchase and watch the movies in the shop at your leisure. It made it difficult to share funny moments with my friends/family, as I would have to find a clip on YouTube of the scene I was on just to show it.Performance - 8/10As this game has just released, I am going to cut it some slack on occasional bugs I encountered throughout playing it. I experienced only one crash in the entire game - when I attempted to equip the Shore Trooper character in my first hour of game play. The only serious bug I repeatedly encountered is the Trade Federation Battleship occupying the center of space battles when it wasn't supposed to be there. It had no substance, so it was still possible to complete the missions. Graphically, the game is beautiful. I never experienced frame drops at 3840/2160p 60hertz. (RTX 3060ti) My one complaint with the graphical settings is the FOV status. I felt way too close to my character throughout this game. I would have appreciated an in-game setting to adjust this.Overall Rating - 37/50 or 74%I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the hub worlds in this game, solving all of the puzzles, collecting all of the Kyber Bricks and Data Cards, unlocking all of the characters. To supplement the boredom of the story missions, I listened to Ben Shapiro podcasts while I played with the sound off. I wouldn't say this lives up to the glories of The Complete Saga, but did anyone actually think it could be that good? No, I don't think so. But this game still is a lot of fun a deserves the attention that any Lego Game gets.Final RecommendationsStart with Episode 7 and unlock the scavenger items as Rey. You get them early on, and multiple puzzles require them to be completed. You don't have to finish episode 7. Just get the gear and jump back to one of the good trilogies. Don't try to 100% every hub world immediately, some Kyber Bricks and Characters can only be obtained after completing a side mission that is started on another planet. Once you've obtained all of the Kyber Bricks visible on the map, you've done all you can do for the time. Also, make sure to check inside interiors on the map. Kyber Bricks do not appear on the tracker until you're in the building."

It's been a while since I played a lego game so maybe it's the nostalgia talking, but there seems to be something (or multiple somethings) missing from this installment. While a lot of new ideas were tried, it seems to have come at the cost of enjoyable content and 'real' gameplay.The worlds, while detailed, personally feel to lack some charm in previous titles and instead feel designed to maximize the time it takes to do anything to pad the game. Many world objects that I believe would have been 'lego based' in older games have been rendered realistically/geometrically to the point that in some areas the characters themselves are the only lego objects on screen.The move to voiced characters has also led to a fall off in cutscene quality. Whereas in the past they were very expressive and creative in getting across the plot, now much of it is just through dialogue. I do appreciate however that they allow the option to return to the classic 'mumble voice' mode.Finally the difficulty seems far too easy. I know this is a childrens game so I'm not expecting dark souls but it is literally almost impossible to die even without any upgrades equipped, especially in the space battles. This lack of a challenge has made many of the fights a bore and something I'm forcing myself to push through. Additionally, there is no requirement to play the levels with the 'intended' characters. Instead you're able to select any character you want even on the first playthrough of the level (making freeplay near pointless and many levels very easy to break/make even easier).I really wanted to like this game, but so far I've been unimpressed. However I do plan to finish it and hopefully will have my mind changed by the end."

That doesn’t normally happen with me, I’m a big fan of having my fill of a game, penning a review, and moving on. But not this time. The Skywalker Saga is a perfect mix of immensely engaging and endlessly sprawling, a game that can ask me to do the same thing at hour 60 that it asks at hour 1 and I agree to it eagerly. It breaks a surprising amount of ground for a Star Wars game, and also remains fun and light-hearted enough that you’ll never really tire of it. And not even the technical issues can mar my enjoyment of this massive adventure.“The Skywalker Saga” refers to the nine mainline Star Wars movies that chronicle the rise, fall, and legacy of Darth Vader. From the lakes of Naboo to the sands of Tatooine, and all the way to the blasted surface of Exegol, you can play through all of the big beats of the Star Wars films. But unlike previous LEGO games, this isn’t so neatly broken up into stages. Each episode has five story missions, but they’re stitched together through open-world exploration across 28 planets seen in the movies, often with scripted events and cutscenes to fill in the gaps between missions. You’ll fly the trench run, battle the Separatist leaders, and take down Starkiller base, but you’ll also defrost Rebels at Echo Base, serve up orders at the diner on Coruscant, and rummage through Maz Kanata’s castle. And if you can believe it, playing through the events of the films is only the start of your journey.As far as a retelling of the Star Wars epic, the LEGO version hits all the right notes. It sometimes picks some unexpected moments to turn into missions, like Yoda’s battle with the droid armies on Kashyyyk or Princess Leia running around on the Tantive IV, but always turns these into fun romps. The open-world segments are also plenty of fun and do a lot to round out the story, taking you through notable events while also leaving you free to roam for cash and collectibles. Missions contain plenty of variety, including space battles, large army clashes, on-rails shooting sequences, and more. Even the normal on-foot adventuring gets mixed up with multiple teams doing things at once and branching paths. Most notably, climactic battles with characters like Darth Vader and Kylo Ren have been given a ton of attention, becoming multi-stage challenges with all sorts of dodging, blocking, and combo mechanics that echo the boss battles of more… severe games.As fun as playing through the movies is, the cutscenes and dialogue are a huge part of what makes this game so fun. LEGO has really made a name for itself with licensed properties by parodying them without losing their core appeal, and that’s more evident than ever here. Cutscenes are always hilariously slapstick, the major characters all have their own running jokes that get used to great effect over the course of nine episodes, and even the most dramatic scenes get broken down into comedic beats. The big climax to Episode I against Darth Maul had me in tears with how funny it was, for example. You’ll see plenty of that cleverness with every mission and dialogue from random NPCs, too, and the fact that LEGO Star Wars never lets that air of wacky hijinks falter goes a long way towards keeping the game fresh.Fresh is what you need this to be, too, because the real meat of the game is collecting things. There is a staggering, unconscionable amount of things to find here, between the 380 characters, 100+ ships, dozens of quests and challenges, and more. New to this LEGO outing is the chance to upgrade the abilities of your characters, who are split across about ten different classes. You need kyber bricks for these upgrades, of which there are over 1100 scattered all over the galaxy. The challenges to obtain them range from looking behind corners to planet-hopping odysseys that end in hidden boss battles. Side quests can also be impressively involved, spanning land and space, and throwing you into all kinds of battles and hunts. You can even capture certain capital ships, which essentially turn into secret stages with their own unique events and mechanics.There’s so much to see and do in The Skywalker Saga, it’s easy to lose sight of what may be this game’s greatest achievement and biggest appeal. This is essentially the first open-world Star Wars game, offering you the chance to freely wander any of the planets and notable locales of the films at your leisure. Sure, you’ve got characters to unlock and collectibles to hunt down all over, but I cannot overstate how magical it is to simply touch down on Coruscant or Kamino or Bespin or Takodana and just be there. The folks who made this game went to incredible lengths to make every location feel like a real place, with beautiful, realistic environments and effects. They meshed this immersion perfectly with their LEGO characters and objects, too, because your bricks and figures look absolutely life-like with plastic seams, reflections, and even sand and dirt caking their surfaces on some worlds.It’s worth noting there are a fair number of technical issues at the moment, ones that may or may not get sorted out via patches. I’ve had to reload the game a few times because of explosions or textures not rendering correctly. One of the instanced space battle areas is aligned around a background model that can make it really hard to see. Most importantly, there can be crashes from time to time, including one consistent one during an Episode III mission that I had to turn my graphics settings all the way down to get around. Surprisingly, that had little impact on how the game looked, so this one seems both extremely well-optimized and also rather unstable. I’ll also add that I haven’t really lost any progress to crashes, because the game is saving constantly, but it’s definitely an annoyance.With that out of the way, I really have nothing but love for this one. If nothing else I’ve said in this review has sold you on The Skywalker Saga, let me say this: I have never really liked the LEGO games, not even the Star Wars ones. I’ve played several in the past, but never stuck with any of them for more than a few hours, owing to hollow, simple gameplay and tedious collecting. In stark contrast to that, I am absolutely obsessed with this one. It’s crowded out all my other games, drawing me back day after day to hunt more kyber bricks and character unlocks. Above all, it’s just fun. It never forgets how light-hearted and charming it is, and everything it offers the player is there to help you enjoy it even more. This is the Star Wars game I’ve been waiting decades for, an open-world romp that does everything it can to make you enjoy your time in a vast galaxy of adventure.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at  or on my !"

It's actually amazing at how it does it - you'd expect that turning the movies into games would mean each game would be 20 hours each, but somehow they packed it all in and still made it fun. I took 22h to complete the core game, doing minimum side quests, and finished all 9 episodes in that time so it's only a bit longer than watching the movies themselves.It's just not quite deep enough for my tastes. The lightweight, whimsical style of LEGO and the fairly simple gameplay and skill tree just didn't do that much for me. It's perfect as a kids game though, and there is a vast amount of content to explore. I reckon I touched 40% of the total game - there are huge amounts of collectables and areas to explore that I just skipped right past.The art, music, sound and production are spectacular though - this game is a finely crafted masterpiece. It's really just the overall feel of it that didn't do it for me.~ DIFFICULTY ~🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it✅ Easy🔲 Normal🔲 Hard🔲 Dark Souls~ GRAPHICS ~🔲 MS Paint🔲 Bad🔲 Meh🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game🔲 Good✅ Beautiful🔲 Masterpiece~ MUSIC ~🔲 Bad🔲 Not special✅ Good🔲 Beautiful~ STORY ~🔲 This game has no story🔲 Like playing Angry Birds for the story✅ It's there for the people who want it🔲 Well written🔲 Epic story🔲 A Tolkienesque masterpiece~ PRICE ~🔲 Free🔲 Underpriced✅ Perfect Price🔲 Could be cheaper🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of money~ REQUIREMENTS ~🔲 You can run it on a microwave✅ Average🔲 High end🔲 Supercomputer~ LENGTH ~🔲 Very Short (0 - 2 hours)🔲 Short (2 - 15 hours)🔲 Average (15-30 hours)✅ Long (30-60 hours)🔲 Extremely long (60-110 hours)🔲 No ending~ FUN ~🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry🔲 Hard to enjoy✅ Repetitive🔲 Actually pretty amusing🔲 The kind of fun you'll remember🔲 Ride of your life~ REPLAYABILITY~🔲 It's a one-time experience✅ Only for achievements🔲 If you wait a few months/years🔲 Definitely🔲 Infinitely replayable~ WORTH BUYING ~🔲 No✅ Wait for sale🔲 Yes"

Absolutely.By portraying all three trilogies,  provides a coherent, entertaining storyline filled with humorous twists and quips that never become boring. Truly. Not only that it feels like a complete, parodying recreation, but it also comes up with its own jabs that even make fun of some of the decisions made in each instalment; thus, even horrendous episodes like  or  are enjoyable. Moreover, it inspires itself by the popular  memes, which is a nice touch as it underlines its dedication to the fandom.Due to that, it caters to the fans rather than to everyone—and that is fine. Could you enjoy it without being familiar with the films? Probably, as the game still has a lot to offer, but many jokes might fly over your head at lightspeed. I am glad that it is like that, though, as it would lose part of its charm otherwise.The way you experience the campaign is a bit different this time; it lets you galavant through the galaxy and visit numerous planets, with an occasional unique mission here and there. Thus, it feels like a thorough, delightful journey rather than a bland list of levels, making the whole adventure more satisfactory.As it is an action-adventure title – from a tighter third-person perspective this time – the usual gameplay loop revolves around exploring, platforming, hoarding all the collectables and, of course, fighting. When you are not directly following the story, you can just venture away and explore the universe on your own. However, do not expect a seamless open world; instead, it consists of a bunch of playable areas in each system. I would say it is better that way because the locations are designed with care to provide just enough content without overwhelming you.Apart from relaxing sightseeing, there are the said collectables to find; picking them up is not pointless, though, as you use them to upgrade your characters’ abilities or unlock additional, hilarious rewards, like a fierce Porg companion or baguettes that replace the lightsabers. To obtain them, you usually have to solve a simple environmental puzzle. Even though that might get a bit repetitive after a while, I did not mind it because I adored discovering new locations and trying out other iconic characters.Speaking of those, you can unlock them, along with starships, by completing side missions. These quests often tend to deliver an even more over-the-top take on . At one point, you might find yourself smuggling trampolines to Mustafar, ending it with a bouncy fight against Bossk, or you could be crushing down a revolt of cloned woolamanaders – who are essentially cute blue apes – on the Kamino facility. This kind of content serves as a sweet, optional stuffing that can spice up your journey.That leads us to the combat, which surprisingly has a lot of depth when compared to an average  game. For sure, it is still pretty effortless, so do not expect any hardships or obstacles in your way. There are, however, several possibilities to use, as apart from mashing one button, you can engage in various combos that make encounters more fun and satisfying to observe. Whether you viciously slice through a bunch of Clones with Maul’s double-bladed lightsaber, blast everyone’s heads off with Boba Fett’s carbine rifle, or slap others as C-3PO, you know it is going to be a joyful time. And if that does not convince you, then undulating around as Mamma the Hutt, licking everyone in the process, should do so!These differences do not only influence the combat but the overall interaction with the world, as well. Where a Jedi will take advantage of their agile movement or the Force, a bounty hunter will rely on a jetpack and grappling hook; due to that, the character classes complement each other. It is a simple yet effective system that pushes you to try out more of the iconic heroes or villains.Unfortunately, the skirmishes in space are disappointing, though serviceable for what they are. While there is a decent variety of starships to choose from, the combat lacks the complexity of the ground one. You only have one attack option, with the possibility of unleashing a homing missile, and that is it. Thus, all of these encounters are bland and uninspiring, becoming boring later on. The exceptions are a few main missions or battles with capital ships, which at least offer unique objectives that balance out the monotonous gameplay.Additionally, the absence of online cooperative play is saddening. Even though you can use , it is not enough, mainly because every progress made counts only for the host while your friends gain nothing. That is weird and discouraging, as you suddenly cannot use the characters and abilities you unlocked but rely purely on your friend’s ones. Also, doing all the collectables twice does not sound that appealing either.Where  beautifully shines is its audiovisual presentation. Simply put, it is top-notch. All the planets with their iconic locations are glamorous to lie your eyes on, and all the ships, even the capital ones or Death Star itself, are made purely of  bricks, which nicely distinguish them from the rest of the environment. Just galavanting through the deserts of Tatooine or the city of Theed, listening to its iconic themes is heartwarming.Another nice touch is the presence of some of the original trilogy’s actors, who reprise their roles, like  as C-3PO or  as Lando. You can also hear a few familiar voices from the animated  show. Naturally, not everyone could be present, but the attempt still shows the dedication put into this project. Moreover, the number of additional monologues and even dialogues between numerous characters is astonishing; even Darth Vader and Kylo Ren have their small talk, and at times, they might even perform an amusing animation when you let them stand in place for a while. The love and care just jump at you at every bricky corner you pass by.That would be perhaps the best summary for .Overall, I adore this title, as it is a special experience that managed to awake an inner child in me, a kid that enjoyed watching the films over and over again. The humorous nature and relaxing gameplay make for an excellent combination. Yes, some aspects could have been a tad bit better; however, that does not take away the dozens of hours of fun I had. Thus, I can wholeheartedly recommend it to any  enthusiast.Now excuse me; I still have a few collectables to find."

The voice acting is just the 1st major change for this game. Along with this the combat has been changed up to feel more hack and slashey with lightsabers, and more third person shooter like with blasters, a major step up from the old games.You can now freely move the camera around and access most of the games features from the select menu without ever having to return back to a central hub area like in the older games. There's side missions you can do to gain more studs and hidden collectibles to find again scattered throught the episodes. You now have the new Kyber bricks collectible which helps you level up your character abilities and powers. This game also contains the largest collection of Star Wars characters and vehicles available to play as spanning all 9 episodes and even The Mandalorian and Solo if you have the DLCs with more characters being added soon. The graphics are also very pretty and look good no matter what graphics settings, and can run well on some older hardware like GTX 10 series GPUs.Some other upsides of the remake are the almost seamless transitions from world to world when going through levels (with some slight technical hiccups here and there, but I'll get to that later). You can enable silly extra options like ""mumble mode"" to make the characters sound the way they did in the original games or alter the gameplay for a good laugh. The Skywalker Saga also pays pretty good respect to the original films, keeping a lot of memorable lines from the movies for important moments of the story, while sometimes sprinkling in the Lego goofiness for laughs. The game is also not difficult to play compared to the original games, which makes it more welcoming to younger audiences and casuals who are Star Wars fans, but aint big on gaming. For me personally, the easier difficulty of the game wasnt to my liking, but with this being a family friendly Star Wars game, I can understand why this was done.Now onto the downsides. While I like the game so far and feel satisfied with it as a Star Wars fan and a gamer, I am disappointed with the way some moments of the story were cut out, probably due to time constraints, or shortened by just having certain characters or locations show up at parts of the story they werent supposed to be in yet (eg. Yoda explaining Kamino being gone from the archives to Obi Wan in the Library and never showing the part with the younglings wisdom and the cool space map in the training room), but again this can be understood in order to cram 9 movie stories into 1 game. Still, the games progression through episodes feels too quick and it doesnt help that intense action filled moments dont happen frequently like in the old games, and leads to moments where you just walk from point A to point B with little to no resistance only to activate the next cutscene.The game also has some bugs and glitches that can lead to soft locks that require a restart. Had my game soft lock on me 3 times when trying to start a mission or go into a cutscene and had to restart. Had a glitch when trying to buy Zam Wesell from the in game shop where my studs would be spent but Zam still showed up as not having been bought. I had another odd glitch where side missions in spaces just wouldnt show up and I was flying in empty space, I could only see the story mission icon and the blue asteroid thing floating by. In the droid factory level for episode 2 the games fps plunges as low as 28 fps at times on areas where theres a lot of machinery and enemies moving on screen. Also one thing that annoys me is that every time I restart or tab out of the game it never saves my resolution settings and always sets me to 1080p 50 fps every time, had to play on fullscreen mode for this game too because trying to use windowed borderless after restarting will just put you in windowed only and cant be fixed unless you switch from fullscreen back to windowed borderless.Personally, I like the game and recommend it to any Star Wars fan for episodes 1-6 remade alone (7-9 will always be a mistakes barfed up by Disney's lousy writers), but I'd wait a while to buy this on sale for $20-30 at the most, the gameplay and pace of the game don't warrant $50, or $60 with the deluxe edition. Unless your a hardcore Star Wars fan like me, wait for a sale."

But when you stack it up against its 15-year-old predecessor, it comes a bit short. Sure, you technically have MORE content. But, personally, I find it hard to consider repeating the same exact puzzles on every planet, the same exact fetch quests with different names, and the same exact on-rails ""levels"" as meaningful content.Let's actually talk about the levels for a bit. When you get to an *actual* level in the game (say, the first mission in The Force Awakens, the Canto Bight prison break in The Last Jedi, or the escape from the Death Star in A New Hope), they're surprisingly open, have relatively clever puzzles, and come across as a pleasantly surprising update to a 15 year old formula. Unfortunately, these moments are far and few between. Most levels are either boss fights that follow the exact same formula of spam attack until the boss runs off, immunity phase, repeat; and on-rails vehicle segments that all function exactly the same, with the only difference being the ship you're piloting. This would be less of an issue if these were, say, 1 per episode like in The Complete Saga. Instead, you have issues like Revenge of the Sith being almost entirely boss fights with only one (Droid Attack on the Wookies) and a half (the first 1/2 of Down for the Count) being *actual* levels. instead of 6 levels per episode, now you only get 5 - and most of them are exactly the same. The other segments of the films that could have been (and in the past, *were*) levels are now relegated to painfully dull, pace-killing walking simulator segments, in which you spend 5 minutes walking to a location/character to listen to some dialogue or watch a cutscene, and then repeat until you get to one of the 5 actual levels.The majority of the work in this game went to the open world, which - while visually impressive - lacks any sort of substance. As mentioned before, all the side quests and puzzles are carbon copies of one another, rendering them repetitive and borderline pointless. Yes, objectively speaking, 700+ puzzles is more than The Complete Saga or The Clone Wars had, but does the total amount matter if only about 100 are unique?A similar issue exists with the characters. Wow, over 1,000 characters with more on the way in the form of DLC! Unfortunately, they almost all function exactly the same - and most don't even have voice acting. This is something I really don't care about (IMO the LEGO games were better when they didn't have voiceovers), but, at the same time, if you're going to have VO, then at least apply it consistently. Even characters who have voice acting will lose it if you elect to use certain skins instead of the default. Again, does having ""more"" matter when it's done in such a half-baked way?Finally, there is no end to the technical issues that mar this game. Six months after release and performance issues still plague certain levels. To TT's credit, they did fix these issues somewhat - ""Better Call Maul"" went from literally unplayable for me to actually running at a consistent framerate after patches - but the performance hits are still apparent in areas such as the Droid Factory. This points to underlying engine and optimization issues, which - unfortunately - are not so fixable. Additionally, bugs crop up left and right: things as simple as audio getting stuck and constantly looping, to things much more gamebreaking as not being able to lift Force objects. There are bugs tied to acquiring collectibles that actively prevent the player from getting 100% completion. One side quest in particular has a bug where you have to specifically quit to the main menu in order to get it to advance. If you go somewhere else in-game or ALT-F4, it simply will not progress. The latter two problems have been known issues since the game's launch; neither have been fixed. With the release of the Galactic Edition (and the questionable DLC practices that came with it), the chances of these issues ever being fixed has decreased from slim to none.So, final verdict: if you love Star Wars, and love LEGO games, and don't mind uninspired, repetitive content or just want a game to keep you or a kid busy for the next several months, then this is by all means a fine game. If you're looking for a worthy update or successor to The Complete Saga or even other, newer LEGO games, this isn't it. Personally, if you have a choice between The Complete Saga and this game, I'd go with the former every single time. That's not nostalgia talking, it's just simply a better, more technically polished game in spite of its age."

Yes. Overall the game is a fantastically fun romp through everyone's favorite fictional space epic about destroying each other over politics with lasers. Tons of stuff to do and see, its a good time. Would I recommend 100%ing it like I just finished doing?NO.The blessing, but also massive problem with 100%ing a game and playing it for so long is you see everything the game has to offer, and I mean EVERYTHING. Sure while I saw every character, every joke, every reference, every unlock, I also saw every glitch, every bug, every cut or rushed corner or idea. Every repetitive nonsense, every boring game moment. I physically recoiled in my chair every time I was forced into 3, brain dead difficulty dogfights every time I just wanted to transport cargo through ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hyperspace. Around the 70% mark the game had already become very painful to digest, but I stuck it out just so my ape brain could see the sticker on my steam profile and the infinite shower of coins you get as a 100% bonus despite the fact that money has no value after you've 100%ed the game. (Also by the way the last challenge that stood in my path to 100% was bugged, and I had to replay the level 13 times before It randomly worked by accident that last time. I will murder Kylo Ren with a snowman.)The story missions are quite abridged, fast forwarded and simplified if you will, which really sucks if you are a person who genuinely cares about the story and wouldn't mind being retold it again in detail. It stings a bit when even the quiet reflective and powerful scenes from the movies are cut short or played completely for laughs. The real meat and potatoes of the game is through exploring all of the different planets, or at least the planets that the poor time crunched devs had time to finish, looking at you Kijimi.  Overall if you pick up and play the game it will be a good time and worth the money, but the second you start to reach deeper you soon realize that the Skywalker Saga puddle is actually quite shallow and rough around the edges. Still the best Lego Game since the Wii era of Lego games though. Over all 7/10, not enough Watto."

PROS:-Amazing and dynamic graphics and cinimatics-Faithful, yet humorous take on the Star Wars film plots, as is par-for-the-course in Lego games-Large open world(s) to explore and find collectables-Lightsaber combat is fun-That Darth Maul fight was absolutely GLORIOUS -A leveling/powering up system that incentivizes finding Kyber bricks-Funny back-and-forth interactions between the characters you choose (one of my favorites: Young Anakin: ""That's a cool suit! Where can I get one?"" Darth Vader: ""Patience, child. Patience"")CONS:- Walking. a LOT of walking.This isn't even a joke, about 60% of episode one consists of traveling between locations where nothing happens (except some dialogue if you're lucky) and you can't fast travel to speed things up. As an added bonus, if there's characters talking, you are slowed to an absolute CRAWL for the duration of the area in order to avoid skipping any dialogue.- The aforementioned saber combat, while fun, is uncommon, at least if you're following the ""story mode"" - Blaster combat, while having a nice, over-the-shoulder playstyle, feels clunky and monotonous. (more of a personal nitpick i guess)- Starfighter combat is janky, slow, and repetitive. I found myself many times asking ""Wait, another wave of enemies?"" as i slowly steered my fighter to shoot the barely-moving fighters. Easily one of the most disappointing parts of the game, especially considering how the fighter combat in the Lego The Force Awakens game worked.- The mind-boggling amount of the EXACT same puzzle with little-to-no variation ( batteries, platforming, more batteries, character panel, and EVEN MORE BATTERIES)- The way you unlock characters outside of the story (glorified fetch-quests of talking to the right people) is very, very annoying and not at all rewarding to pull off when you finally find the right joker to ask about the character you want.Heck, it's hardly worth the hunt because all characters are basically just reskins of the same handful of classes (Jedi, hero, astromech, etc) with no gameplay variance between them.- The sheer quantity of the kyber bricks being kinda just spat all over the world, not in any really clever ways with cool puzzles or sequences like old lego games did, just in a ""oh, didn't think one would be here"" kinda way.The most ""unusual"" puzzle (if you can even call it that) that I remember from my playthrough of Episode 1 consisted of rebuilding pipes to fill tanks with water on Tatooine and, despite being the most ""unique"" puzzle I encountered, was by far and away the most monotonous, boring, and frustratingly slow sequence of events and took a good 10 minutes, not from difficulty (it only gave you the pieces you need at a time, so a bit hard to mess up), but from the sheer length of the ""challenge"". The reward? A single kyber brick. SO fuggin worth my time...- ""Actual"" levels don't really feel unique or special, usually feeling like an extension of the open world area (and not in a good way. It kinda feels like ""Oh wait, that was a level I just did? all i did was WALK do a hero panel and shoot 3 droids""TL:DR-Once my nostalgia-tinted glasses were taken off, I was left with a monotonous, boring, repetitive, aimless, wannabe Lego Star Wars game that, while it it has some good stuff to work with and matches today's standards of graphics, feels incomplete or unfinished gameplay-wise.A real shame. At least we have The Complete Saga still which, I might add, still holds up today, at least in my mind. Go check it out instead of The Skywalker Saga. You won't be sorry."

Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself"

If you are doing the mission for Aqua Marine Squad (mission is on Tatooine/ mission giver is on Hoth) make sure you can finish that mission first before going any further. Otherwise you'll get stuck at the same point I am. 90 hours into a game that I love playing on my Steam Deck and I can't get all the achievements.

With the deluxe version, you get additional DLC character add-ons to use during freeplay. One thing that surprised me the most about this game was how short each level is compared to previous LEGO franchise games where you go through many modes within each level. I finished the entire Phantom Menace in just over an hour, while the time it took me to complete one level in 2016 Force Awakens Game about 45 minutes to an hour. That could be due to the 2016 game being the entire movie plot, but it was very surprising to have only the Gungan Battle Mission last merely 7-10 minutes. It reminds me of the Complete Saga game, if not a bit shorter. I'm so happy that Lego incorporated the Clone Wars voice actors to VA their given characters in the Prequels. It was awesome to notice that. Also, the open world mechanics are amazing and will for sure last you days just to cover one planet at a time. There are so many opportunities to complete civilian missions and collect kyber blocks to upgrade your skills. Using the holoprojector is still new to me, as that is where you will be able to access your freeplay characters and ships, as well as purchase unlockable characters.   One of the griefs that I have about this game lies within the DLC, and that is not having the ability to access the Bad Batch, Mandalorian Season 2, and Rouge One character packs. Part of my reason for buying the deluxe edition was for the immediate access to these amazing characters so it's a bit frustrating to have to wait longer till April 19 and May 4th. The villain duels are flat out amazing to play, I am definitely replaying those missions just for the fun of it If you're a die-hard fan of the Lego Star Wars Franchise I would absolutely recommend this to play."

TT games really took a while to get ground with it. I was in shamble with every delay announcement., but I am glad things eventually worked out amazingly. Not only we get additional content from the Mandalorian seasons and the Bad Batch, the game also runs amazingly well without any major frame rate drops. The visual is by far the best the studio has put out. Though the lightsaber effects are still a bit weird when you turn around a little...No big deal though. Things I wish to have in EA's battlefront 2 like Rogue One characters, the two series related contents I've mentioned above, more skins for iconic characters like Ben Kenobi and Kylo Ren, and BANTHA, are all in this game. What's not to love? Except probably the absence of FOV slider and Online COOP. I hope they will add these two features in the near future, especially the FOV slider. This default view really would mess some people up during extensive play sessions, and I am one of them. You don't have issues with these two things? Then hop your ass in and buy the game! Oh yes, you better buy the DELUXE EDITION. It gives you all the sweet characters from the Solo, Rogue One, the Mandalorian, the Bad Batch and some other stuff! Pretty good deal if you ask me, whether you are a fan of Star Wars/Lego or not. Trust me, this game will make you feel the love and efforts the developers have put in. Now I hope they get some good rest from those crunches."

Proof that when you have merit and care about the product, you can produce quality.Finally! A Star Wars game where developers can take liberties with the lore without offending fans. This game REALLY makes you feel like a Star War. Playing this is a kind of nostalgic bliss. The Lego Star Wars games were my exposure to Star Wars as a kid and were how I first experienced the movies. I still remember being a little kid when the first Lego Star Wars came out. It was the greatest thing ever, I at least put like 500 hours on that game as a kid. When I played it originally I couldn’t read yet so it was very hard for me, but it was always amazing. I  still can’t read, and actually don’t know how I am able to write this but here we are. As a somewhat adult man, I gotta say we’ve come a long way from the days I would grind the Lego Star Wars II Mos Eisley level on my Gameboy… what a feeling. The hours I put into the Complete Saga, along with all the other games is astronomical (no pun intended), yet I feel like a little boy again whenever I pick up and play the Skywalker saga. It’s just phenomenal. It has its issues too, but it’s just amazing overall. It's a solid game and a great rehash of the old game. Looks absolutely stunning! LEGO humor is intact, which is great. Some levels from the old game aren't in this one but it's pretty much an updated Complete Saga with more modes and features and even more characters to play around with. I've had so much fun with it and it's a superb game.It's everything I wanted as a huge fan of the older games, plus a little more. It has so much amazing content that I love and I think it's worth every penny, especially for someone who enjoys completing games.I'm a big Star Wars fan, and this definitely has become one of my favourite Star Wars games. Let alone Lego games. This is pretty much everything I could have asked for from a Lego Star Wars game. I enjoyed every single level and the open world is amazing. I have to reiterate it isn't perfect and I have a few small problems with it but I could see this become one of my favourite games of all time.Whoever is running the Lego company really  knows what they’re doing. The games and movies they make are always so high quality it’s astounding. It’s one of the very few children’s companies that actually seem to care about their product. Well, whatever they’re doing… it’s better than what Disney has been up to that’s for sure.This might just end up being the best Lego game of all time.10/10"

It's 100% clear to me that TT Games has made this with the old games in mind; not as a replacement, but as a successor, a game that kindly respects them rather than ignorantly bypassing them. (It even uses the original minikit collection sound as it's build complete sound! I have too many hours on The Original Trilogy and Complete Saga to ever forget that satisfying bit of audio.)The game has taken to a completely different set of levels. Instead of raiding the Jedi Temple in Episode 3, you'll be fighting Sidious in the senate chamber. Instead of fighting a bounty hunter mid-flight in the first level of Episode 2, you'll be exploring, trying to figure out what that dart thing really is.Frankly, it's a much more immersive way of going about the story. In LGS (The Prequels), you'd finish fighting Grevious then immediately transition to running and fighting clones on Kashyyyk, with little to no story explanation; it was a bit of a mess. Don't get me wrong, the levels were fantastic (and specifically levels 1 and 6 of Episode 3 had some of the best design of many of them.)Even in The Original Trilogy, you'd go from murdering Jabba the Hut to going around in speeders; the games seemed to be picking specific points to hit from the movies rather than retelling them, and that resulted in games that weren't all that immersive; games that really were a bit scrambled.This game is different. While the levels may be short, they're very involved and combat-filled. And, when you finish a level, you don't teleport to the next level automatically, you're still within the relative area of where you finished it; you have to travel to the next level yourself (or stay where you are and get Kyber Bricks, a fantastic part of the game that I can't stop participating in), really showing off the fantastic galaxy TT has made. The more story you complete, the more planets you have (and you can go anywhere anytime!)The game is a bit of a fabricated experience, though; it shows you what to do, and actively directs you towards that goal. You're always able to go your own direction, but you cannot 'untrack' the story mission, it is always tracked. You'll always have a tiny orange exclamation on your screen, nearly 24/7, adding to the odd smattering of UI elements the game's dropped on your screen. Of course, a fabricated experience isn't a bad thing; it's a kid's game, after all, meant for a very wide audience, not just 20-30 year old gamer nerds. The game does let you tune these to an extent (you can disable or enable consequence-free falling, for example, reducing stud loss to 0 when you fall into the void), but not everything can be turned off or skipped. For example, the game will give you a tutorial when it deems you should be shown it, locking your controls and forcing you to do what it's asking. You can't turn them off, either; just do what it's telling you to do. It's a little infuriating, to be honest.That's all nitpicking, though. In it's entirety, this is a massive, beautiful game, with a ton of massive, beautiful environments, and a ton of massive, beautiful levels (that are short in a linear sense, but have so much exploration to them that more than makes up for it!)I highly recommend this game, it IS worth the price. (For reference, I can count the times I've paid $60 for a game in the past 10 years on my left hand.)This was worth the price.I love this thing.THANK YOU TT GAMES YOU ALL ARE FANTASTIC"
119,14,Kitty Nat,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120400500/,31,,1,103.5,Posted: March 16,79,0,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/79b3d78b82986bfb637b3ab811ae197df5dde10e.jpg,"We've been waiting since 2019 for , originally scheduled for spring of 2020, to be released.  The delay was not all due to the pandemic.Was it worth waiting for?Er, mostly. Storyline is the usual solid adaptation, but the collectathon/completionist partcontimues looonnnnggg afteward.The game is organized into the nine movie episodes, plus a Galaxy Exploration for easy access to the hub worlds for Free Play.Since each trilogy has its ardent fans (and detractors), the game makes the opening of the first movie of each (Ep I: The Phantom Menace, Ep IV: A New Hope, and Ep VII: The Force Awakens) available to you from the start, so you can go to your favorite trilogy first or save it for last.The game engine has been rebuilt, but not reinvented.  Most of the gameplay will feel familiar to anyone who has played any other game in the TT Games LEGO franchise.In solo or co-op play, players switch amongst at least two characters, using their various abilities to solve puzzles and advance through the levels.Levels have a variety of segments.  Some are simple exploring.  The light saber duels are represented and involve lots of button mashing, often with breaks to chase the opponent and do more exploring.  There are some spaceship chases, and destroying enemy big ships.New are the combos you can do in battles for extra power or for more money from defeated mooks.  These are not particularly needed, though, and just hitting X a dozen times works, too.With all the shootouts in the franchise, the devs have provided some low cover that both sides can use.  I've never been into shooters, and mostly resorted to the Jedi.  It is slightly annoying to have my character slip into a ""taking cover"" pose when near the barriers that make up the cover.  The barriers are rebuildable, and the pieces become distractions with their ""build me!"" animation.A brand new twist here are the Classes.  Characters in these games have always seemed to fall into various categories or classes, and here they are official.  Classes here are Jedi (Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda), Dark Side (Vader, the Emperor, Maul), Protocol Droids (C-3PO), Astromechs (R2-D2, BB-8), Bounty Hunters (the Fetts, Leia as Boussh), Scavengers (Rey), plus Heroes (Leia, Padme, soldiers for the good guys), and Villains (Empire and First Order officers and stormtroopers).  There's also an Extra category for characters that don't fit easily or can't be used well, such as some tiny droids.  As usual, the devs give you almost every character model they whipped up to use, even if the cutscene or level segment missed the cut.All characters in a class have the same abilities, with no unique additions or combos.  On the one hand, this makes it easy to remember which character can do what.  On the other hand, it also prevents the devs from giving a character a unique ability (Think both hobbitty Baggins with the One Ring.)The distribution of abilities is always a source of annoyance for fans of a property adapted into a LEGO game.  Someone somewhere is always scratching their heads over why a certain character was given (or not given) a particular ability.For example, both Bounty Hunter Fetts have a jetpack, but cannot fly with them, even though both use them as bosses.  The Jedi and Dark Side share an odd one, using their light sabers to climb walls by sticking them in the wall and pulling it up.  And Heroes, Villains, and Astromechs all have their own terminals mainly to open stuff up.On the other hand, one of the best abilities is given to the Protocol Droids.  Hub world NPCs speak several different languages.  Many characters know a few languages, but only the protocol droids, created specifically to help in diplomatic affairs, know ALL of them.The Classes each get their own set of Upgrades, and there are ones for the whole game as well.  This not a min-max system, as you can jump in at almost anywhere and can accomplish most things without getting a single upgrade.  Rather, these are simply things that make the game a bit easier or faster, such as stronger hits, a greater health bar, more shielding for ships, or bypassing the repetitive minigames for Hero/Villain terminals.The sheer size of the game world(s) gives you a daunting task if you are a completionist tackling the collectathon part of the game.Seriously, the galaxy here is HUGE!  Almost a couple dozen planets to visit, some with a couple different areas to go to.  And some of the planetside areas are large in themselves, often beating the expansive Manhattan of the LEGO Marvel games.The main thing to collect are the Kyber Bricks ( of them!), a reference to the kyber crystals that power light sabers and give them their color.  This is the game's version of what are normally Gold Bricks.A chunk of them are awarded simply for completing the levels or accomplishing various things in the levels, such as for completing minikits (micro version of space ships in the game) or each of the three tiers of True Jedi money quotas.  (The partial credit is new and a nice touch; it's very difficult to reach the full amount in Story Mode.)New this game are Challenges.  Get all three for a level and you earn a Kyber Brick.  Some are easy, such as simply rolling to shake a homing missile in the flight levels.Some however, I found very difficult, such as: You have to either luck into completing the Challenges, buy the hint in the in-game menu, or just find the solution in an walkthrough.  The hints can be tricky to figure out.The hub world collectibles include more bricks, character or vehicle access (you still have to pay to fully unlock them), and datacards.There are the standard races, on land and in space.  In space, the races include Scramble Runs, in which you do not have to pass through the gates in a particular order.In space, you can destroy a Kyber Comet for a few bricks, or be offered smuggling runs to another planet.  You can even take over a capital ship (the Dreadnoughts, Star Destroyers) by destroying its defenses and defeating its captain.Hub world collectives include Datacards.  With one of these and enough money, you can unlock the Extras that in past games were earned with specific Red Bricks.  These include the traditional money multipliers and some stuff's just fun and silly, such as the Cantina Song on a loop, or light sabers looking like baguettes.Both non-flight levels and hub worlds have maps.  The hubs even have indicators for various things, including useful NPCs who will tell you about collectibles.  Some just point you to the nearby brick, others send you offworld.  Recruitable characters ask you for a favor before they will let you use them.Many missions will have you hopping from planet to planet.  There are also a couple ""find all of us"" missions, including hunting the mouse droids and finding a wookie tourist on every planet.The game has a shooting (and light saber toss) FPS mode.  As I don't usually play FPS games, it took me a while to figure out the controls.  A tutorial game would have helped.  There are some aim assist toggles, though, and one tap sets the gun to continual fire.  However, there is a shooting gallery (to earn a vehicle) that the aim assist doesn't work/help with.This is when I had my ragequit moment.  I had sunk a bit over 100 hours in the game ALREADY (including 10 or so on one particular level's challenge), well over the time on any other LEGO game, and still had about 30% left.

This is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long while.The game has all 9 episodes, it took around 17-18 hours for me to beat in co-op, just for the base game, it will likely take hours upon hours to 100%. I really enjoyed episodes 1-7, 8-9 were questionable but more on that later. There's also tons of side quests and missions. If you're expecting a remake of the complete saga, you will be very disappointed. This game is very different but in a good way. They tried so many new things and it worked. The game is now semi-open world, it has some rpg elements like quests and upgrades, etc.I beat the main story in co-op, and it was great in co-op, I'm pretty sure it would be enjoyable in singleplayer too. No online multiplayer kinda sucks but Steam remote play is surprisingly stable in this game, especially over ethernet. I played with people from halfway across the globe and 98% of the time it was flawless. As far as performance on the host machine it's not great, I'm running a RTX 3060 & Ryzen 9. The game dipped under 15 frames in some missions.This game has so much polish, for example on Tattooine or Hoth, your player will have sand or snow particles on them. And almost every character has unique dialogue with each other, it results some interesting character reactions with characters from different episodes. It also has the normal Lego slapstick humor we all know and love.Episodes 1-6 are amazing, I enjoyed basically every second of those. I am not a fan of the sequel movies but I actually enjoyed episode 7 too. Episodes 8 was surprisingly mediocre. But episode 9 was straight up bad. On episode 9 I got straight up softlocked once or twice, the level design was confusing, it was pretty boring gameplay, on top of a bad plot. But the other episodes were amazing. I love 1-7.The game is very buggy. It's not uncommon to completely softlock yourself, or have another major bug. It's actually sometimes really annoying and happened to me a handful of times throughout my playthrough. But a good chunk of the game is flawless.Overall hard recommend whether you're a Star Wars fan and/or a Lego fan, adult or kid. It's amazing. I loved almost every minute of it."

I was fortunate to not experience any game breaking bugs unlike other unfortunate users. However despite being able to play-through in the games entirety I have experienced a few bugs which I will list.- major fps drops in the ewok village open world area and in the droid factory level- character switching bugs when doing remote play co-op- random crashes- characters having no faces- mynock mynock puzzle breaking, was able to fix by using boba fett to catch the glitched mynock- unable to complete certain levels and level challenges in free play- the minimap option of rotate with player doesn't work all the time while it is selected for some reasonThis list of bugs whilst not game breaking were certainly a pain to experience. Another unfortunate thing is that from my experience the game was not optimised well for the remote play co-op. My friend and I encountered various issues whilst playing, particularly the character switching issues in free play which would cause the other player to randomly change character when the other player was selecting a character. We also found that the secondary player often had what we coined as ""little brother controls"" in levels due to many of the levels being 1 v 1 boss fight scenarios. This made the experience for the secondary player less enjoyable although I'm not sure what they could have done to help this.But enough of the negatives lets get into the positives, this game is nostalgia central. it reignited my love for Star Wars as well as my love for LEGO. The open world exploration is massive and really well done. There are hundreds of puzzles and little side missions that make up for the fairly small amount of story levels (only 5 per episode). I really enjoyed playing the game and actually followed through with 100%-ing it completely which for me never happens. There are plenty of the classic LEGO game witty jokes and funny cut-scenes which I enjoyed despite being and adult. The gameplay is really good, the fighting mechanics are really nice and I liked the camera angle that the game used. They could have done more with the ship and space gameplay but we have to remember that at the end of the day this is a game designed for children. Overall I'd give the game an 8/10"

All the characters are beautifully animated and blaster fights have been massively improved since The Force Awakens. Unfortunately, thats where the positives end for me.The levels are very short. To some, that sounds like a good thing, but to me, it fails to make an impact on the player. Just when the level starts to get good, it ends.Also, the bugs. I have no idea how a LEGO game, has this many bugs. The mumble mode that so many LEGO veterans like me have been so excited for; it actually breaks some of the in-game sequences. In my experience, I also have quite a few game-breaking bugs that force a game reset, and even a crash to desktop.When I first booted this game up, I was beyond excited. When the bugs get fixed, I will delete this review to give a [Neutral] stance on this game instead.Edit: No Battle Over Coruscant level requires that this game recieves a permanent negative review."

There is usually one 5-10 minute mission per 1h hub area.* Lots of loading time... made worse by the mission  design which loads a new level for 30s of walking.* Many missions are uninspired: You are not doing anything interesting, varied, ...* Some missions were clearly not tested / designed in co-op, with the 2nd player not being able to do anything for some time* Hub areas are littered with collectibles that require little to no thought to collect.... just enduring the tedium. less than 5% of the tasks actually require some though. With more than 1400 things to collect it is all quantity, no quality.* Inconsistent UI/controls, and in general lack of polish and streamliningAltogether it feels like they were just doing the game by-the-numbers, instead of iterating the design, and much to the detriment of fun missions, and puzzles. It's a shame, but it seems the developer do not really know what made some of the older ones fun (Lego Lord of the Rings is still one of my favourite)"

I have been looking forward to this for years, and I am not enjoying what they made for us.The levels are short. The few puzzles there are, are lackluster. Building is rare if present at all. Difficulty is non-existent. Over-the-shoulder gunplay is repetitive since Troopers are just blaster sponges.This is a LEGO game only in style and name. They spent so much time developing open exploration that they didn't give platforming and puzzle design the time and care it deserves.Some more specific issues I've had:-Turning off aim-assist and health regeneration changed nothing in regards to difficulty. The only thing that changed was that it actually made the speeder level on Endor impossible, forcing me to turn aim-assist back on so that the speeder itself locked on as you can't aim.-Enemies and vehicles pose absolutely no threat, not even the AT-AT's. The Battle of Hoth is lazy, hardly feeling like you're actually taking down an AT-AT. Instead you're just flying through hoops in a clockwise fashion, providing no real satisfaction when you succeed.-The platforming doesn't feel good either. When grappling some climbable areas your character doesn't automatically lock onto the ledge. Instead you have to make sure that the game specifically prompts you to ""A to JUMP"" or ""B to GRAPPLE"". Otherwise you *will not* grab it, even if you are clipping through the geometry. And during some sections swinging between poles or vines on Dagobah does not feel natural. It locks you to one position, and the momentum is non-existent. There's a section in the Maul fight where you're supposed to platform across an electricity floor, but literally all you need to do is press A to jump across one at a time. No skill or difficulty at all, just one button.-The lightsaber duels are set up with a tutorial that seems promising, hinting towards more in-depth mechanics, but no. There is no satisfying dodging, or QTE. It's just as shallow as the rest of the combat.I understand this is a LEGO game, made for kids, but even The Complete Saga has an abundance of puzzles and at least some more difficult combat and platforming.And as of writing, there are also so many precious moments to Star Wars that are not shown in the Story missions. There is no infiltration of Theed palace. C-3PO isn't blown up and carried on Chewie's back. Leia doesn't find Wicket, she just appears at the village. You don't even get to blow up the Death Star in Episode 6. It just happens without you."

Especially episodes 1 2 and 6 most of the events happened in cutsceans even blowing up the deathstar is not a level and happens in a quick 10 seconds cutsceane. Developers clearly spent 90% of thier time on how the game looks and 10% (or less) on how the game actually plays. The game boasts a massive 400+ character roster but once you unlock them there is nothing to do with them as levels are so short. Nostalgic player will relive their childhood for a short time before realizing all there is to do is walk around hub worlds and unlock collectables that dont actually serve a purpose in the game. But newer players will find a mostly empty gameplay experience that can be completed in a single afternoon. Was hopeing for a lot more given the 3 year wait time but at the end of the day there just isnt anything here. puzzles are embaressingly easy, so many kyber bricks are just sitting in the open with no puzzle behind them just lying the middle of the street. Space exploration is non existant except as filler from going from one level to the next. On the plus side the game does look amazing and many iconic locations can be explored and that classic lego humor peaks through every once in a while. unfortunatly this game will get pointless after unlocking the 1 millionth kyber brick than can only be used to unlock a pointless upgrade to your hero.  Similar to the early stages of No Mans Sky its a massive ocean but its not deep enough to even drown in. Was mostly dissapointing but had so good laughs along the way. 5 out of 10"

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Unfortunately for me it did not live up to expectations. While visually stunning, it lacked any kind of depth or simple problem solving reminiscent of past titles. There seemed to be a lot of ""go here"" now ""go here"" with little to nothing other than very similar side quest filler. It may just boil down to me being too old or not liking the more open world concept vs the older more linear titles. It gives off a very large as a lake and as deep as a pond vibe. All in all I think it fits the age range it was meant for. Anyone below the age of 10 or anyone with a short attention span should totally pick this up but anyone wanting a newer and prettier Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga should not waste their money."

It was also one of the most heavily anticipated games in the entire TT LEGO series. And why is that? Well, for 2 reasons... 1, the trailer looked amazing. But also because it was one of the titles that spent the most time in development and promised the most new features and changes to the series. If you look back at the long line of games you'd see we got a new LEGO title pretty much annually. In some years we even got as many as 2 or 3 new LEGO titles. Basically Traveller's Tales was pumping these out like clockwork. And then after 2019, after the release of The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame, nothing. We got our first glimpse in 2020, but it would not be for another 2 years until the game finally released. A little over 3 years between games. Yes, the anticipation for this one was as strong as the force. But was it really worth the wait? Skywalker Saga takes the formula of past LEGO games and makes a bold choice to switch things up, which results in a few steps forward, but also a few steps back. Where the game really shines would be in 3 key areas: Action, exploration and unlockables. But where it suffers mostly would be in the overall flow of the main game. The game is comprised of 45 stages spanning all 9 movies with 5 stages per movie. The stages are tied together by segments that will have you go through some of the free roam areas, but in general they are rather short. Most of the playtime will be spent revisiting stages to unlock things you could not access before with new characters in free play mode. It's a bit of a downer when compared to previous LEGO games, and this is primarily due to the fact that levels are not padded with puzzles but rather focus more on action segments with minimal puzzles, which is a 180 turn compared to previous titles. While the game does do a good job capturing many key moments from the movies, there are also a lot of key scenes at the same time that fans will notice are missing, or heavily compressed into short segments in cutscenes. While it's not unusual for LEGO games to rush through story pieces taken from movies, it is still a major bummer since we waited this long. Luckily the game makes up for some of this in other areas. For starers revisiting some stages is a blast. While some are going to be short no matter what, others do feel a tad bigger when revisiting to unlock things. Also the free roaming areas for the most part are massive with tons of side quests and lots of things to unlocks. You'll spend a lot of time hunting down these new things called kyber crystals, which are essentially the replacement for gold bricks. In past lego games gold bricks did not hold much merit. Some games allowed you to accept new quests if you got so many gold bricks, but that was pretty much it. Kyber crystals on the other hand can be used for currency to unlock new abilities or enhance character classes. And there are a ton of these to collect also, with over 1,000 of them scattered across the entire galaxy. Combat is also another major improvement over past LEGO games. In previous titles combat was simple, and pretty much a straight up button masher. That's not to say this one is not also a button masher. It still can be. But there is also a bit of strategy to be found here as you can pull off combos now. Sometimes enemies will even block your attacks if you mash the same button over and over, forcing you to press other attack buttons. It's a small change, but its still a very welcome one that takes away from the tedium of pressing the same attack buttons over and over. Ranged combat has also been overhauled, as you can freely aim in any direction now like a traditional over the shoulder 3rd person shooter. Some enemies will even have reactions depending on which body part you hit. Like shooting at their legs may make them fall over, or shooting the helmets of stormstroopers will actually make them fly off revealing the lego heads underneath for a followup headshot resulting in an instant kill. You can even sneak up on enemies for stealth kills. Hell, there's even a counter button, though I did not see much opportunity to use it as the LEGO characters you play as already seem kind of overpowered as usual not giving you many opportunities to need to use the counters. But when you do get an opportunity the counter will result in a special move reminiscent of some of the flashy spectacular special moves you'd see in some of the past lego games. Some of them very good for crowd control too. Needless to say, the combat changes overall are a very welcome addition to Skywalker Saga.Aerial and space combat is also a welcome change. In past games that featured this you usually had 2 types of aerial and space combat: On rails or tilted top down. Now there are still a few on rails segments here, but they have ditched the tilted top down space combat for full control of your spaceships, meaning you can get into  some full 3D dogfight action for once! And it's a blast when you are in these stages. You'll be weaving in and out tie fighters with your X-Wing, Millennium Falcon or whatever ship you have access to while taking down the enemies or shooting at cannons, satellite dishes or other objects on massive space stations or dreadnoughts or other massive spacecraft. Sadly this type of combat is limited to certain stages, and the space sections you'll find while exploring the galaxy are just that... space. It would have been nice to see more action in the free roaming space sections. Visually Skywalker Saga looks phenomenal. The name of the game is anything but realism, and instead your characters are all comprised the typical LEGO bricks. I mean we are talking a LEGO game. But the mixture of solid animation and little details make it a visual treat. You'll find little visual nods like when you walk around Tatoonie seeing bits of sand getting stuck to your minifigs, or walking through the snowy tunnels of Hoth and seeing your bricks getting snow stuck to them. Cutscenes also have some wonderful animation that look like a proper CG movie. Very spectacular and a great treat to behold. And the overall look of the worlds is also eye candy on the LEGO scale. Like many past LEGO games, it is a mix of bricks and more realistic looking set pieces also. Typically if it is made of bricks it can also be destroyed, so some areas can get completely wrecked leaving bricks scattered. Sadly the chaos does not last as bricks do disappear when destroyed after a short period. But all the same it is very satisfying breaking things down. Mostly the game runs great for me playing at 3440x1440 with an RTX 2080 Super playing on max settings. The overall stability of the game is far from perfect however  as there are still some bugs to be ironed out. I have had the game crash to desktop on me a total of 4 times in the 25+ hours I have played so far. 2 of the crashes while revisiting the General Grievous. There are also 2 areas which also are prone to massive frame drops even on high end machines as multiple people have reported (myself included). Those 2 areas being the Droid Factory Frenzy stage and the Ewok Village. Traveller's Tales is aware of some of these issues so now it is just a matter of how long before they are fixed. But when not encountering the 2 aforementioned sections the game runs extremely well for the most part. Pros:Amazing changes to combatHuge open world hubsTons of collectablesAerial and space combat is extremely funCons: Story skips or rushes through several key segmentsBugs still need to be ironed outOpen world space sections feel underwhelmingOverall, I think Skywalker Saga was indeed worth the wait. It might not be perfect, and some parts do feel rushed, but that aside I have had a blast so far playing the game."

That being said, if you are looking for an experience similar to the original trilogy game than don't buy this. In my opinion they gutted everything that made the original fun and replaced it with a lot of empty open world and near zero combat. Most of the game is spent going from place to place essentially seeing a lego set of the movies. I am incredibly underwhelmed. If I wanted to watch the dialog from the movies, I would just watch the movies. I came to smash things and solve puzzles and 99% of the smashing has been on random lego structures and the puzzles are badly placed and scattered across the open world rather than the actual missions. The only upside is how nice everything looks. Otherwise it totally fails in comparison to the original lego star wars games.Update 1: I played through the first three episodes and the Phantom Menace was by far the most boring. I would argue that the game got progressively more fun, but there were a ton of missed opportunities. The main one being that they make you go check on Anakins mother in ep 2 but don't let you fight the sand people, instead they make you wander around for 15 minutes with no action and then give you a cut scene."

While i would never expect this from a lego game, it is rather tame in regards to combat difficulty, at least from what ive experienced so far. Its unlikely that though the journey your heart will be racing, hands sweaty, mind racing as you try to beat the final boss of an episode, because that isn't TT style of lego games, rather the combat is satisfying and fluid, rewarding you for combos and parries and massive hoards o enemies to mow down and fling pieces everywhere!! Great game overall, definitely the pinnacle of TT games, however if you like intensity in a game, this may not scratch that itch, its relaxing and slower, but really really immersive."

I have 100% in-game plus the extra Steam achievements which are not required to pull the 100% lever on Yavin 4. I don't usually post Steam reviews for the vast majority of the games that I have in my library, but this is an exception. I hope my lack of formatting skills and/or awareness can be overlooked in favour of the review itself.Perhaps it was the hype that got me overexcited to buy and play this, considering my last REAL experience with LEGO Star Wars games was with the Complete Saga, and I believe perhaps this hype affected a lot of us whose last games were the Complete Saga. I hope that my review will stray away from nostalgia and focus on the real problems I have with the game, but first...THE POSITIVES:It would be wrong to say that content is lacking as a whole in this game. All of the character models are incredible, the planets and space battles/levels are beautiful, and a lot of work evidently went into making these characters and worlds come to life. The comedy through the story missions in particular, I felt, was excellent, and many gags landed perfectly, such as DJ's tool to get out of the Canto Bight prison being one of those orange brick separators and his reward from the First Order being a solid gold brick separator. Those moments stuck with me throughout my experience, but unfortunately they were far too short. I believe that is my main issue.THE NEGATIVES:I think you would understand given that I haven't recommended this game that I have far more problems with the game than I have praise. Thankfully I did not experience many bugs throughout my experience so I won't include any lengthy sections on them, but I do feel like a game that has been delayed for as long as it was should have been able to iron out the more ""game breaking"" bugs that certainly do exist.THE STORY of the game is incredibly lacking in comparison to the open world, so much so that I feel like the actual Star Wars story was put on the sideline in favour of the extra content. Extra content is not a bad thing in any capacity, but when it outshines the story then there is a problem. This game is the saga of the Skywalkers, hence the name, yet you will spend most of your time doing anything but furthering that goal. Extra content, challenges, and side missions should surely compliment the base game and not overshadow it. I feel as if the added content was done more out of ""memery"" than story telling. I remember more from having to annoyingly escort Gonk droids around than I remember of the Sequel trilogy levels as a whole.THE LEVELS are incredibly short. I get it: it's a LEGO game. The levels are always short, right? Well, no. With the Complete Saga as an example, the levels were as short as necessary, not as short as possible. I'll paint this picture with reference to the beginning of Episode I. ""Negotiations"" is present in both games. In the Complete Saga, it is an entire level. In keeping with telling a story, everything is present from the movie. The ship the Jedi arrived on is destroyed thus trapping them on the Trade Federation ship, it introduces the player to combat, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan discover the invasion force destined for Naboo, they sneak aboard one of the Droid tanks, and the level is over. In the Skywalker Saga... the level consists of a cut-scene showing the destruction of the ship, one hallway and then you walk out into the hangar and that's it over. It's not even counted as a level in the game, which is something else that annoys me to a great degree. It actually feels like filler - no more than a connection between meeting our characters and landing on Naboo. It's underwhelming to say the least.MORE FILLER THAN CONTENT plagues this game. For certain levels I spent more time travelling to the necessary planet, waiting through loading screens, painfully making my way through walking segments, sitting through a cut-scene, all for a level that may last five minutes. The odd level will take longer, but what purpose does a level like the Naboo monster escape have to the Skywalker saga? Dodge attacks, shoot backwards, mission over. It's frustrating having levels like this but then the actual levels where you would expect content is lacking. Again, Negotiations could have been made a level and the Naboo underwater monster level could have been taken out entirely and nobody would lose any sleep over it. But every trilogy has these missions where when you start the mission you don't actually start the mission, you just start the build-up to the mission. Every time it happened my friends and I would jokingly shout ""GAMEPLAY"" as we walked forward half-listening to exposition that is incredibly rushed.LEVELS THEMSELVES LACK CONTENT outside of walking to the missions. Episode II's Geonosis Arena is probably the worst offender of this. Following the battle with the individual creatures, the arrival of the Jedi to the arena was almost non-existent. The main Jedi appeared, like Mace Windu, Kit Fisto and Ki-Adi-Mundi, but outside of that it was really quiet. And the arena battle amounted to basically nothing. In the Complete Saga, the Arena battle felt alive. It felt as if a battle was taking place around you and you were just trying to survive before the boss battle with Jango Fett. This time, Jango is part of the droid ""attack"", you kill him relatively quickly and that's that over. The Geonosis Arena battle meant an incredible amount for the story of Star Wars, with most of the Jedi being killed since they were unprepared for the combat they were facing and the overwhelming odds against them. In the game it's just an excuse for the Jango Fett boss battle. It's shockingly empty.100% IS A CHORE and incredibly frustrating. Gathering over 1,000 Kyber Bricks scattered across the planets was not fun, and realistically meant nothing because I easily beat the game (meaning the story levels) without upgrading many of my character classes. By the time I finished Episode IX I had hundreds of these things just sitting and waiting to be spent on upgrades that now meant nothing to me. The data cards were an interesting take but pretty much pointless outside of the stud multipliers. Why could they not have been bought with the billions of studs I amassed throughout the game at some kind of inter-planetary shop? I had far more studs than I knew what to do with any hardly anything to spend then on, and 25,000 studs for hints or whatever else means nothing when my pool of money was in the billions. Gathering characters was the least fun I had in this game. Sy Snootles, Mama Hutt, and other INCREDIBLY RANDOM characters are all in the game and have to be unlocked through purchase or missions, but they couldn't include a character customization option? I have no reason to run around as Babu Frik outside of two seconds of it being funny before realizing he's ultimately pointless and only included to add more characters... for some unknown reason.--------I could go on and on about issues plaguing the game, but I think I've at least shown the most egregious offenders in this review. I did not enjoy playing through this game for the most part. It felt incredibly rushed, it favoured side content instead of main story content, missions were far too short and linked with unnecessary long travelling sections, wanting to 100% this game was a slog instead of an enjoyment and so on. It has its moments, but I genuinely don't know if even the casual player would enjoy playing through this game. It lacks originality for a series where LEGO would make it original enough. It's just... bland. Uninspired, boring, frustrating... and bland. For those reasons I just can't recommend this game. I doubt many people will see this review, and I'm just a random guy on Steam so my takes probably hold no merit but hey... I thought it was important to say that no, this game has a lot of glaring problems."

The missions are fun, the jokes are enjoyable even at their worst, and the openworld is nicely made. If you want a fun game for you and your friends (skip the online coop problem) in the star wars universe this is the game for you. However, compering it to old LEGO games (Star Wars III: The Clone Wars, DC Super Villains) that I played this game is not as good at keeping you in after the campain is finished. In DC Super Villains I went for 100% complition due to the fact I wanted to collect all the characters. They all felt different and I considered the missions different and interesting. I did the same in The Clone Wars with the characters but in this game the way they have it set up they all feel the same due to the class sistem. I get that the Jedi and the Sith are preaty similar but Leia and Cody shouldn't be identical in abilities. This simple designe choise has a few effects on replayability and might be the reasson character customisation was dropped. This sort of character class sistem is boring because I have no reason to search for other characters once I get one off each class since I could do everything now, there were no new mechanics, no new interesting combinations, everyone feels the same. If to this you add an open world that barely throws staff at you unless you ask for it and even then it is week, you get a post mission world feels empty. The ships do not change that with few of them feeling different esprcialy when it comes to turn and roll rates (they are the same for all) makeing dog fights not skill based but spam turn better based. With all of that beeing said the game is still peaty good. The ground combat is fun and enjoyable, the missions are fun and if you sow the films you will enjoy them, the bosses are well made and the places look and feel good, its just that they didn't fill this wonderfull game with enough unique things."

Now, before you stop reading, I know this is a LEGO game. I know Lego games aren't supposed to be Elden Ring, however, if  the AI misses 99/100 shots while you're completely standing still, if the key to a door is literally a meter next to you, if the puzzles become so mind-numbing that TT Games gives you the skill to simply skip them, it becomes apparent that you never had proper gameplay, just padding. Kids these days play Fortnite, games that aren't really always easy, but if you even dare to put Mario or Kirby next to LEGO Star Wars the Skywalker Saga then you realize that even kids games have an ounce of a challenge to them. This game makes Mario or Kirby games seem hard.It isn't all bad. The planets to explore are amazingly designed. I had a lot of fun exploring these, getting the collectibles and enjoying the beautiful graphics. I never knew plastic could look so good. The combat is also giving me a strong Devil May Cry vibe, but it's obviously a bit easier. Doing combos in this game feels amazing until you realize that the foes you're put up against aren't even nearly worth the spectacle. They die in a few swings which never makes the combos outstanding, rather short-lived.Now. Let us talk about the bad. Every game deserves some criticism, even a LEGO game.This game has so much content, but most of it isn't quality.When it comes to the episodes, there is a lot of padding. Most of the time you spent 20 minutes going to the missions, and even when you arrive, they aren't really fun. The game acts like you overcome these great challenges, but none of the battles give you more than 5 enemies per spawn to fight. Great wars like the battle of Kashyyyk, the arena fight on Geonosis are completely mindless, and it ruins the atmosphere. These battles feel more like barren wastelands with the occasional droid trying to do some minor havoc by missing 90 shots. I can't even call the puzzles ""puzzles"", since you aren't even doing the one thing you're supposed to do during a puzzle. Thinking. Most of them are just pressing a button at the right moment with a 5-second window, or simply pressing 4 buttons in the correct order. This is yawningly boring and handholding on the next level. Especially level design completely suffers through that. There are never any stakes, no sense of urgency or whatever. I even ran through a level and somehow got the ""True Jedi"" achievement, my guy, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.The bosses too are most of the time recycled. The first boss you meet will be the most fun, because Darth Maul, Count Dooku, General Grievous, Darth Vader or Kylo Ren will have the exact same attack pattern. It is simply copy and pasted.The level selection itself is odd too. Each episode has 5 levels, which completely limits TT. The battle over Coruscant, the fight between Mace Windu and Palpatine are generic cutscenes. That is truly sad. The Complete Saga was better in that.Last, but not least, the cutscenes. The cutscenes are well animated, however the game doesn't do well in telling the story in its own way. It completely misses the impact of many cutscenes, like Anakin's mom dying or Order 66 happening. Luke loses his parents and immediately goes ""I guess I wanna be a Jedi"". They often miss the point, for the Sequels it makes sense, because they don't have a point, but the lack of explaining makes me want to rather watch Star Wars and play a game like LEGO City Undercover rather than playing this game, which has the ""story"" of Star Wars in a LEGO game setting. Humor too often falls flat. The Complete Saga had many jokes, some subtle, like Darth Vader's corpse sliding into Luke's ship. Disappointingly, the humor in this game is so on the nose and so constant, every serious scene you saw in the trailers gets ruined by humor before and after. Not even one cutscene goes without trying to tell a joke, I only laughed at 2. You can't be funny, if you start expecting when the jokes will come and are rapid firing into your funny bone. It doesn't work. 5/10, I had more fun exploring the planets than doing actual story related missions or side quests."

While this game plays a bit different from other Lego games, it is still very much a Lego game. If you’ve played a Lego game before, you know what you’re getting into.The game has all 9 main Star Wars movies recreated out of a combination of Lego bricks and more traditional materials. You can start at the begging of any trilogy and beating one unlocks the next. Each episode takes you to a handful of planets that you can explore to find upgrade bricks as well as watch cutscenes to progress the plot, and 5 levels. The planets are fun to explore and the levels, while fun, usually feel very short. It certainly feels like certain plot points are just brushed over very quickly. If you’ve already seen Star Wars, like I would imagine most people have, this is fine, but if you are new to the franchise, you may end up confused. As with most Lego games, the story has a comedic twist to it, which keeps the story feeling fresh and entertaining.The boss fights are definitely the worst parts. Almost all of them consist of smacking the boss a bunch with your lightsaber. You have so much health that you don’t really need to worry about dodging their attacks, and they have so much health that you end up sitting there clicking of a few minutes.In terms of issues, I would say this game is buggier than most games I play, but not so buggy that I would call it a buggy game. I had a lot of minor things, a few crashes and a few freezes. The game also forces mouse acceleration to be on.Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga was a lot of fun. It reminded me how much I liked the first 6 films, and how bad the newest trilogy was. Even so, the levels were pretty much all fun and even after beating the game, there are a lot of collectables to be found."

I didn’t want to believe that one of my most anticipated games of the year could let me down in such a big way.I started off by playing Episode 1 and for the most part was enjoying myself. The updated combat system felt refreshing, the visuals were stunning not just for a Lego game but in general, and the cut-scenes still had that Lego game charm. After playing around in the open world between each mission, I realised my goal of achieving 100% would be easier by playing through the story missions first, then alternating between open world for collectables, and then replaying story missions in free play mode to collect everything I missed or was inaccessible. I got to the Darth Maul fight and thought it was quite fun. I was still enjoying myself at this point, but some doubt was starting to creep in. Around Episode 3 is when I started really noticing how much the game was using the old walk-and-talk method to convey immersion, where a character provides the illusion of gameplay but is not more than a cutscene with very limited control. Some missions would involve more walking than actually getting to play the level, which is an issue the original Lego Star Wars games didn’t have. For some reason, it seems this game is taking the modern approach of making games more cinematic, which may work in more story-driven games like God of War, but doesn’t really work here. The more the game progressed, the more issues I started to notice. While the combat is fun, it boils down to spamming X on the controller, with the occasional button added in as enemies can now block your attacks. You can pull off some quite spectacular combo moves with a lightsaber akin to Devil May Cry, but unlike that game, this game doesn’t reward you for being stylish, therefore providing little incentive to do more than the basics. Shooting is mindless, monotonous and sometimes broken, such as shots not being registered. Dying provides no inherent risk to the player, so any sense of challenge dissipates. The bosses all boil down to the same combo - damage them until their first health bar goes away, forced quick-time event, repeat until all health bars are depleted. There are over 300 characters in the game, but with only 9 dedicated classes, they feel like 9 characters with different skins and each of them functioning the exact same way. The story doesn’t know if it wants to be serious or funny, which provides a real jarring juxtaposition within story immersion. It really doesn’t feel like a Lego game, as it removes features found in old Lego games like puzzle variety, the ability to build fun objects and being able to create a custom character. It’s a traditional third person action-adventure game with a Lego skin. When I reached Episode 5, I realised I stopped having fun a while ago and was forcing myself to finish the story so I could move on to open world - the part of the game I really wanted to play. Once I finally reach that point, I started to enjoy myself again, but that  was short-lived when I realised that each planet you explore was basically a re-skin of another. Kyber bricks are the main form of collectable in this game, which are like the golden bricks found in other Lego games. Although most of them would only feature around 250-350, Lego Star Wars made the choice to have , more than half coming from the open world and roughly equates to 40-50 hours of game time (by my estimation). Each planet would house Kyber bricks found through basic exploration, races, side missions and more, but the variety caps after one planet. I have completed 67% of the game, acquired about 750 Kyber bricks, explored just over half of the planets and fully completed Episodes 1-3. During Episode 4 in free play mode and having close to 50 hours in the game, I realised I was playing only to reach the 100% goal and I wasn’t enjoying myself.I stopped playing and haven’t returned since. The game does have its positives. Collecting data bricks, (this game’s equivalent to red bricks in the other Lego titles), allows you to unlock some fun extras like big head mode, pew pew mode, all lightsabers turning into baguettes and more. I can’t pretend to act like this didn’t put a smile on my face and honestly, it extended my game time. The planets are perfect recreations of the ones found in the movies. Exploring Naboo, Tatooine and Coruscant was a great experience. I don’t recommend this game, but I can see how others may enjoy it more than I did. If you were thinking of picking it up, I’d honestly recommend playing the old Lego Star Wars games instead (they don’t have the sequel trilogy, but that may be an added bonus to some). It does most things this game set out to achieve, does it much better and will continue to be fondly remembered for years to come, which is more than I can say for Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga."

I fell off the Lego games wagon a long time ago, sometime around Lego Indiana Jones/Lego Batman. I remember playing Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga for hours and hours with my brother during my childhood, so despite the fact that I’m not hugely into Star Wars, seeing the original announcement and occasional news of Skywalker Saga evoked some nostalgic feelings in me. I didn’t think it’d be my game of the year or anything, but a semi-open ~~world~~ galaxy Lego Star Wars is the kind of thing that would have blown my mind as a kid, so I figured it’d be moderately enjoyable and worth checking out. Unfortunately, the Skywalker Saga really let me down. My main complaints boil down to four things: the overall lack of polish, the lackluster method of storytelling, the lack of trust in the player’s intelligence, and the variety of systems that feel simultaneously overcomplicated, pointless, and too simplistic.When I first started playing Skywalker Saga, it appeared to be a pretty polished game, but that illusion quickly faded. Every single time I open the game with borderless window selected, it doesn’t display correctly until I switch to fullscreen and back again. There were also a lot of clunky moments - things like pressing a button prompt to interact with something but somebody/something getting in the way, so you’re locked into a walking animation until that is resolved, which can take quite some time. Worst of all, several times during my playthrough a level became completely glitched (typically during boss fights when the enemy froze while invincible and the scripted part failed to trigger), requiring me to restart from the beginning. Skywalker Saga’s story is fine - it’s Star Wars, enjoy it or don’t, I’m not getting into that. It’s the storytelling that I take issue with here. There are lots of silly moments as you’d expect, and that was enjoyable to see. The problem is that Skywalker Saga levels are so incredibly scripted and constantly take away your control to show you something (often something completely mundane that you could’ve easily figured out yourself if it weren’t shoved in your face). It really sucks all the fun out of it when you keep not being allowed to play and have to sit and wait and watch something happen. This frustration is further compounded in boss fights - most bosses have multiple health meters and they tend to become invincible as each one empties until some scripted thing can happen, which gets old extremely quickly. To make sure I wasn’t blinded by nostalgia about this, I went back and looked at some let’s play footage from TCS to compare with, and they were much more reserved - just placed at the start/end of levels rather than constantly interrupting you throughout. That seems to me like a much better system. I remember going back and replaying levels in TCS with silly characters (such as the custom characters, notably absent here), but I have zero interest in sitting through all that scripted stuff again.Then there’s the apparent lack of trust in the player’s intelligence, which is one of the things that I find incredibly annoying. Like many of its Lego game predecessors, Skywalker Saga frequently throws little puzzles at you that you need to solve throughout your adventures. This includes things like smashing things up to get pieces to build into something else, opening locked doors, or using a droid to do any number of things. Building weird little gizmos (the boxing glove drill was my favourite) to clear obstacles is fine, but the rest of this stuff just feels like useless padding. The droid unlocking minigame boils down to rotating a couple of rings around to align the correct pattern, which sometimes requires literally 2-3 button presses. Unlocking doors requires you to either do this very slow dpad QTE or remember a pattern of 4 dpad presses, depending on the door. These things and the droid QTE are all so incredibly simplistic and slow that it feels like their only point is to pad the game out, which really sucks. And don’t come at me saying “it’s a game for kids!”, because that’s not an excuse. You can put more complicated things than that in a game for kids, it’s been done before, they can handle it. There are a lot of additions to Skywalker Saga that were not present (or present, but less so) in TCS - things like an upgrade system, the explorable semi-open world, the more in-depth combat system with combos, the little weapons caches, mounts, etc. All of these things are really cool ideas that on paper should elevate the experience, but they fail to do so. The upgrade system is convoluted on multiple levels, requiring you to find and spend kyber bricks (only around 270/1000+ of which are in the levels themselves, by the way) to unlock perks. Annoyingly, the skill tree consists of a lot of unrelated perks which are locked behind one another, so it sucks to see later down the line that you can increase your damage by 10% but first you have to upgrade your movement speed, unlock the ability to detect hidden collectibles, and other things like that. I realize that a lot of games do things like this, but typically the skills are at least organized into sections that make sense, so unlocking the best combat skill requires investment into other combat skills, but here it’s just a bunch of unconnected nonsense. On top of that, a lot of the upgrades are really boring/useless - % damage increase to melee, % damage increase to ranged, faster build speed (lol), etc. Surprisingly, I found the semi-open world areas (more like hub areas, really) to be more annoying than anything else. I’m sure if you’re into the game it could be fun to go around doing the little side quests and exploring for secrets, but when you just want to play the story it’s incredibly annoying how many instances of “follow the moving gold objective indicator for a couple of minutes” there are. All that pointless walking around is pure padding and the game would have been better off without it. Another issue is that because the developers want you to be able to get distracted by something along the way, “follow the NPC” missions will stop in their tracks even if you get too far ahead of them. You literally have to follow them the entire way or they’ll just stop moving and progress will halt until you come back.Skywalker Saga’s updated combat system is probably the thing I dislike the most about the game. Sure, you have access to some different combos and it’s fun to aim the guns yourself, but this came along with enemies no longer being one hit kills like in TCS and instead having health bars. I despise the health bars. The game constantly throws mission objectives at you like “defeat the stormtroopers” where you have to whittle down the health bar of a bunch of boring basic enemies that pose zero challenge whatsoever. The combat system in TCS by comparison is incredibly simple, but I think it works a lot better overall - neither of the games are challenging, but at least you weren’t bogged down with so many boring time waster enemy segments. I guess I just feel like if you’re going to expand the combat and make enemies this much more tanky you’d be so much better off going even further with it whereas Skywalker Saga’s combat seems halfhearted and can still easily be mashed through… so what’s the point?At its core, Skywalker Saga feels like a game made by people that had a million different ideas on how to expand on the core gameplay of previous titles - a skill tree, a combat system with combos, semi-open world hub areas to explore, and a million other things, but none of it seems to really come together in the way you want it to. On paper, all this new stuff should’ve been exciting to play around with, but in practice none of it was fleshed out enough to be satisfying, and in many ways the new stuff ends up feeling like a big step back."

I remember Lego Batman 3 where every quest was a meaningless fetch quest where Lego Kevin Smith would ask you to go pick up some dumb collectible.

Some reveiwers are saying the finished the game in 20 hours, but I have been finishing most puzzles on the way, and even in over 24 hours I have really only made it through the first 3 episodes."

I always wanted to fly around in space, explore the different locations and planets, take in the vistas and unlock all the characters. This game is all that, but I’m not the person who wants that anymore. All I can see now is the shallow combat, the frankly bad side quests, and the wonky performance. I didn’t care about that back in the day, but again, I’m not that person anymore. I care now, I care about the experience and the story but I’m also a gameplay-first kind of guy and this game just didn’t deliver outside of the almost great combo system. The complete saga has better level design, it’s not the better game but as an adult, this is so easy to see- this game didn’t focus on level design as much. They wanted the world to feel sort of grounded and realistic but this hindered their puzzles and their levels. But as a kid, The Skywalker Saga would have wowed me to a degree so high I would probably get a heart attack and die right there and then. But now I can’t lie and say I didn’t expect more from a game I’ve wanted to play my whole life.So I guess it's fine."

If you enjoy this game and are reading other reviews, understand that this review is based on my own personal experience with my friend while we played through all 9 stories in Coop.This is a game that I had initially looked forward to back when it was first teased. However, the much needed delays honestly caused me to lose interest in this product, for example I didn't even notice the game had released (even though it was on the top of my Steam wish list) until like 3 days after the fact when I started to see people posting glitches on Twitter.Now, the reason that I do not recommend this game is solely because it is absolutely not worth the full price in the current state it's in. The levels are rather boring and quite spaced out (some of them even drop your frames into the single digits.) If you're interested in this game, make sure that you get it on sale so that you don't feel as duped for how little there is going on in the game.Pros:Some jokes land and are actually goodThere's plenty of references to other medias that have a clever spin on themThe graphics are goodThe clone wars voice actors did a really good jobPlenty of things to collectGun play is fun when it's used which is quite rare""I don't like sand""The Combo system is quite fun, but it's hard to get a high combo since there's not enough enemies to get a higher combo than maybe 30 without abusing a bugCons: Really empty feeling hub worldsVery few enemies to fightVery few instances where you have to buildReally short missionsPlenty of bugs that really shouldn't be in the gamePoor quality of voice acting for some of the Original Trilogy and Sequel TrilogyAnimations on characters either not loading or just looping?Lots of clipping and things being where they shouldn't be (not just clone troopers in the wrong era)No online coopSteam remote play is super unreliable and can drop connections to dirt despite having no real reason to do soEnemies don't have enough health to make Melee combat feel rewardingTutorials that won't stop even after disabling them in the settings like literally 25~30 hours into the game and still getting tutorials on basic features Cover system isn't necessaryCoop boss fights are really boring, for example, one player is Obi Wan and the other is C-3PO sitting there watching the fightClaustrophobic multiplayer split-screen (what happened to the one that the other games used with a thin line that moved dynamically around the screen?)Upgrade system makes you overpowered way too fastDatacards remove the enjoyment of finding the red bricks of prior gamesOverall, my friend and I both gave it a 5/10 and we played through every mission in the game and have an overall completion 61.2% and have no interest of going back to finish it to 100% since so many features of the game are just boring.I understand that this game means a lot to many of you on how the game is a ""upgrade"" to the Complete Saga, but there are so many intentional game design choices I feel are just so poorly made (for example the missions can be completed in speed runner times without even trying that hard.)Like throughout the time playing this game, there were plenty of times where we had joked about the fact that this game was delayed by 2 years, such as when fish on Naboo would swim through the level itself.If you like Star Wars and Lego, you might like this one, but just wait until it goes on sale since again, it's not worth the full price.Like many Lego Star Wars games are collect-a-thons, this one bolsters a high amount of things to collect, but those collectables are used as a way to cover up many of the significant flaws with the base game. Sadly the level of polish on this game could've ultimately used another 4-8 months to resolve.Some exploits to have some fun with:Force characters can bypass basically every puzzle  • Standing on a crate that's meant to be lifted with the force can bypass some puzzles  • Droids are basically the crates and characters all in oneThere are more than a few instances where objects keep dropping money far past the point that they should no longer be doing so  • The barrier on the Hoth mission in Echo base can be shot infinitely and will repeatedly drop blue and gold studsSome characters can stun lock enemies There are many instances where you can shot at an enemy's spawn and rack up insanely high combosLego Star Wars is something that I hold near and dear to myself, and this game just has far too many flaws in it's current state for me to find it enjoyable. If you are still interested in this game, by all means, pick it up, play it and enjoy it as much as you'd like to. Don't let my review here stop you from enjoying the game just because you either disagree with me or have noticed similar flaws, since I am not advocating for you to avoid the game all together, I just do not believe that this game is worth buying when it's not on sale.Did you notice the Eddie Izzard reference to the Death Star Cantina standup routine? (this video here  ) like Darth Vader is literally in the Cantina on the Death Star itself when you go there. It seems that nobody really caught this reference since it's not as child oriented as many other jokes in the game are, and yes, I know about the ""Better call Maul"" joke."

The episodes stories feel a bit short but the cutscenes make up for it. The only reason why I would not recommend this game at least for now is the amount of game breaking bugs I've come across. Mumble mode causes softlocks, there was a point where I couldn't get out of the ship when starting the game back up so I was basically stuck and wasn't allowed to free roam I don't know how I fixed it just did it itself, and things just not triggering so I can't progress and I'm forced to exit the level and re-do it it's just infuriating. There's a ton of more bugs I've encountered and so have other people. I would love to 100% this game but with the bugs I just can't right now I hope they will release a patch soon that fixes all of this and if they do I'll change my review to recommend it but for right now I just can't recommend this game just for the bugs itself."

I got to 100% completion, went through tedious, ofttimes buggy challenges, sat through hours of fast travel and hyperspace warning cut scenes and had no one to alleviate the boredom with. The humour in the movie parodies is great, the missions are neither here nor there, the sheer amount of characters is astounding and the attention to detail in their variations in movement, combat and idle animations is something I haven't seen in a game like this. It's terrific. There is SO MUCH to do, and some people are happy with doing all of that by themselves, or in horrible vertical split screen through shared play or with someone next to them. But I really expected there to be a fully fledged online co-op, like the Complete Saga on the PS3. Surely in 2022 it wasn't too much to ask for? Maybe I'm being naive, but my point is this:1200 kyber bricks, plus minikits, plus ships, plus passwords, plus the hundreds of menial and handholdy side missions and a few buggy challenges, the repetitive capital ship missions, the hold-RT-and-turn-your-brain-off space combat, plus that bloody wondering wookiee... and you're on your own doing all of them.With nearly 100 hours put into the game, I can say if you buy it to speed through the story and not explore the areas for kyber bricks, ships and minikits that you will not be getting your money's worth out of it.However, if you buy it and plan to 100% it, at the end of it it may be that you won't have gotten any satisfaction out of it. And no amount of bad puns, forced pop culture references (see, that's how you pun) and R2 units can change that for me.Therefore, I would not recommend this game at full price. Get it on sale.If there was an in-between, I'd choose that. But my personal experience has been more negative than positive."

It's filled to the brim with content, keeps the charm of the originals while updating features. It's probably the greatest collectathon game of all time with over 1000 kyber bricks 100s of minkits, level challenges, and characters. The levels are fun and mix it up a lot. I mean the amount of ideas they packed into the main story is great. But with that said some things really didn't seem like they were very utilized. Like the class special abilities. Also there is an abundance of quick time events that aren't partially interesting, but it is a kids game. And for a kids game it looks amazing, the graphics are great and the style has grown on me. I would give this game a 9/10 honestly because of all the fun I have had with it. But there is one huge thing  that holds it back. THIS GAME IS BUGGY. There are smaller funny things like Boba's infinite bast to huge game breaking bugs. Here are just a few of the big things that I and others have dealt with.> If you have mumble mode on in Ep 9 the story misson won't let you go on unless you restart game game without mumble mode on.> infinite loading between worlds> Stuck camera > infinite death loop> Random crashes when changing characters> And one of the worst things ever is the character menu, everytime you load in it shows all your characters are new, when you buy a character you have to cycle though before you can select them,  bought characters are shown as not bought and just over all it isn't a nice UI, its just hard to get to who want to select and the sound effects aren't great and it's because of the character menu that we have character dupe glitch.I could go on and on about lag and models not loading in. There is a whole lot wrong with this game, and it's probably has to do the how the game forced to be made at home during the pandemic and was delayed.  But these things can be fixed and changed. I don't thing every little bug will be fixed but in the future I hope this game is a lot more playable. And still with all the bugs I will keep on playing, because this is a fun game. So I would give this game a 7/10"

Combat is a bigger focus in this game with a slightly deeper hack-and-slash system and over-the-shoulder third-person shooter combat. The character system has been overhauled as well, with characters falling into particular classes that can be upgraded at large. And being a comedic Lego adaptation lets the game make the most of the movies' settings and set pieces while smoothing over the prequels' wooden dialogue and blunting the ridiculousness of Palpatine somehow returning. Ultimately, this game is no masterpiece, but neither are the films. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the best direct video game adaptation of the films that you're gonna get and a very fun one on its own merits, and that's all you can really ask for."

Hear me out. When Padme and Anakin met, they were both underage: Anakin at 9 and Padme at 14. Still a questionable relationship, but not illegal or statutory rape. Furthermore, they were separated soon after meeting, as Padme went back to Naboo and Anakin became a padawan under Obi Wan. While it was obvious that Anakin was in love in episode 1, it's not really suggested that Padme was yet having sexual thoughts about Anakin. They did not meet again until episode 2, where they were both above age 18. Only then do we see Padme falling in love with Anakin. So, in conclusion, it's reasonable to assume that they never had sex until episode 2 and Padme is definitively not a pedophile.Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."

That game helped shaped my childhood and my love of Lego games going forward. Lego Star Wars 2 the year after was also a great experience with many improvements over the first. The humour and quirkiness of these games set the bar for gaming that both children and adults could enjoy. The 6 missions per film with between 30 mins to an hour-ish per level gave a good amount of gameplay and despite the levels being ""linear"" there was plenty to build with hidden secrets to find. From illusive Minikits to Dancing Skeletons to Snow Globes on Hoth there was many a fun and unusual quirk in these levels.Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga gets rid of these big levels in favour of smaller set pieces with 5 in each film and honestly... it's a mess. I find myself running between various points in hub worlds (a cool idea in principle) to small missions that feel anti-climatic, unfulfilling, and generally clunky without the fun puzzle solving that the first games had. There are puzzles but they feel hollow, samey, and erratic. By the time a mission starts, it's over and I am aimlessly wandering an open world talking to generic NPC's that I could skin how I wanted and import into any generic game.Co-op is pathetic at best. Player 2 is often on the sidelines in big epic encounters as opposed to the original games where they were an active participant to defeat the boss. I will stop rambling but all I will say is, the devs obviously worked hard on this game and had a love for Lego Star Wars but whilst it is a large game it feels unfocused and more like a spiral galaxy of ideas that sound good but just make the core gameplay feel rushed and unfulfilling. The plot goes by at lightspeed and I feel as if I am not able to take in the story of these amazing films. Honestly, if you love this game then I am happy for you but for me, I recommend the original Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga to fill that nostalgia with a more focused and fun and satisfying experience that honours the narrative of Star Wars more."

Instead, pretty much every single mission is just running from point A to point B with little to no puzzle solving. Any puzzles that are present feel tacked on last minute and are very repetitive not to mention few and far between.It seems TT Games has prioritized a massive open world filled with mind numbing collectibles instead of making the gameplay feel engaging in any way.

The levels were long, the combat was too easy and really the only thing that the original game had going for it was the sheer amount of unlockables.This game fixes almost everything that's been wrong with the lego games, the combat is fun with a new combo system and lightsaber throwing, movement feels good, there's a free third person camera, the graphics are beautiful, and it doesn't ask for hours and hours of your time per session. The way they tell the story in this game is just like the older game, it's quick and only touches on what it really needs to. There are so many collectibles in this game and I've been having a good time going around collecting them all, most require you to switch to a specific character type, or solve cute well designed puzzles :)There are a few criticisms I have concerning the flow of the gameplay loop mainly in the prequel episodes, it feels like episode one and two specifically never leave you alone to explore. It was overwhelming, it asks you to travel to a new area what feels like every five minutes leaving you no room to breathe. While I like the fast progression of story in this game, for some reason it just goes WAY too fast in the prequels.The one other thing that's a little lame is that there are 'puzzles' where you walk up to a device with a specific character and perform a series of actions to open a door or power something. These are never built upon, it's always the same throughout the entire game and they feel arbitrarily placed around the game with no rhyme or reason. But honestly that's where the bad stuff ends.Finally, do not play this game in fullscreen. Play in borderless windowed. This game does not want you to tab out and trying to tab back in after doing so will either result in the game being scaled down to 800x600 and you having to set it back or the game just not focusing again. you have been warned.Overall this game has been a blast so far and i'm excited to keep going. It brings back the same emotions I felt when playing the original as a kid and sometimes i find myself smiling at just how immersed i am in a silly lego game :) There are a few poor trends this game follows but they don't outweigh the pros at all. play this one"

I know most people wish the levels were longer, but for me, it keeps the story moving along at a pace I can enjoy.Everything and everyone is in this game and it is amazing to see the world they built and how graphically amazing it looks for legos walking around.I just wish they had online co-op.

No cool new missions or gameplay only cool cosmetics to try out in the missions you have already played with the normal characters.

If you're getting this game for just an open world star wars game you're in the right place but if you're getting it for a Lego star wars game, don't bother. The good: The open world is amazing being able to travel between different areas on Coruscant or moving to Tattooine is great I love wondering around in this game and finding all the small details in the open world. The stories [at least the stories we got] are funny at the very least they were able to keep the lego game aspect even within the open world. Datacards I love the concept of Datacards and how they are essentially the red bricks now make them feel more star wars like.The Graphics are amazing I love wondering around this game and exploring these locations with such great graphics. The cities look amazing even the movies we dont speak of have good looking areas that fit them they feel alive.The Bad: The story is lack luster half the time when I've been playing this I am playing a mission only for it to be like... Thats all? I'm already done...? Iv spent more time collecting Kyberbricks on the planet than actually doing the actual story of the game. I wish we got more story even 1-2 more missions per movie would of been great but they went with only 5. I would of sacrificed some of the open world for more story honestly. Split screen is terrible, iv tried playing with a friend and if you even remotely try aiming the aim circle is placed right behind your head half the time and its unplayable to even look around properly. Custom Characters removed, Honestly the removal of custom characters is a big thing for me. Its sorta the key factor of a Lego Star wars game and its just removed. Taken out... makes me sad to see this feature leave us. Ray is the first character we hear when we boot up the game... not even a skywalker.. why? They could of done Anakain... or Luke even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ben... but they picked... Rey.... not even a skywalker.Characters are no longer unique, R2D2 can no longer hover. Palpatein cant shoot lighting, Darth Vader can force choke but every other dark side character ALSO has this ability. This game is missing so much in terms of unique characters. Honestly I would of given up a good 100 of these characters in this roster for unique characters and custom characters to come back. The platforming in this game feels clunky and incomplete some of the time just falling off do to my character refusing to do the proper taskThe enemies are way to easy I only died once in a boss fight and that was to maul and my own mistake. Dosn't help if you farm kyberbricks you can get not 1, not 2 but 4 health bars making it almost impossible to die. Ship combat is way to easy I understand this game has kids in mind but honestly really? Conclusion: If you want a free roam star wars game, go for it, but if your buying it for a lego star wars game. Don't bother its not worth it. It dosn't even feel like a Lego game anymore. Unique characters are gone. The levels are short and there are few of them. The collectibles are outside the levels now. Custom characters are gone. Just to many negatives that overwrite the positives. The only thing this game really has going for it is the free roam is great.Edits and Corrections: Something else I will add the combat system upgrades are amazing. Don't get me wrong on that, the issue I have is again characters just feel the same and dont have anything special going for them.Also for the split screen comment about how its ""Not needed"" a big part of any lego game in my opinion is the ability to go and play it with a friend. Just cause you don't play it with a friend dosnt mean others won't try. Split screen in this game just needs to be improved.For those thinking palpatein can shoot lightning he can briefly use it in his combo. There is nothing for long lasting actual lightning like he does in cut scenes. Iv also just played to confirm I see no traces of them actually using their abilities that people say they have so my point still stands. Little traces of it in a combo does not count cause they are still the same as any other character. Their unique abilities are gone and that is what im upset about. Not the fact palpatein has lightning in his combo.Correction:  I was wrong about force choking not being in the game but literally ANY DARK SIDE CHARACTER can use it which still proves my point about no unique characters."

He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.StrategyHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distractedA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower."

The previous LEGO SW games had much more enjoyable levels that supported the narrative pacing more, and had more interesting puzzles than in this new iteration. While this one has many interesting new mechanics, the core game experience is not really for me. The story pacing is much more faster and jumpy than I would like it to be. The game is pretty and has interesting innovations, but I will stick with the old lego sw games."

There is usually one 5-10 minute mission per 1h hub area.* Lots of loading time... made worse by the mission design which loads a new level for 30s of walking.* Many missions are uninspired: You are not doing anything interesting, varied, ...* Some missions were clearly not tested / designed in co-op, with the 2nd player not being able to do anything for some time* Hub areas are littered with collectibles that require little to no thought to collect.... just enduring the tedium. less than 5% of the tasks actually require some though. With more than 1400 things to collect it is all quantity, no quality.* Inconsistent UI/controls, and in general lack of polish and streamliningAltogether it feels like they were just doing the game by-the-numbers, instead of iterating the design, and much to the detriment of fun missions, and puzzles. It's a shame, but it seems the developer do not really know what made some of the older ones fun (Lego Lord of the Rings is still one of my favourite)"

If you want to buy the game for the star wars story, don't bother but if you want to play the game for all of the LEGO collectables then this is more than worth it's price. VVV Pros and Cons VVVPros:- Graphics- Collection of Characters- Space Mechanics- Most Combat (not covering fire)- Has Darth Vader (That's pretty cool)Cons:- Buggy- Designed not around base mechanics, but designed around assuming you have the assists on- Lackluster main missionsI am giving the game but only barely and honestly, out of bias, this thumbs up. In all honesty, the game has been a small mess to say the least. I've read a lot of really positive reviews all saying that the game is great, bugless etc. but this isn't true unfortunately.I'll start with the good things first. The obvious is the vast improvement to graphics and overall quality of the game. I've had great performance running the game on 1080p, max settings for what it's worth and I only have a GTX 960 graphics card, I'm pretty sure integrated graphics could run it if anybody is concerned about that. Anyway moving on, the game has a large collection of characters from each Episode varying multiple classes and this feature is really cool, you can upgrade each one and use each class to complete the few puzzles that exist, I'll get onto puzzles later. There are also various different ships that you can actually fly around space and onto different planets though flying is limited to space. Space battles are another cool thing, while travelling between planets you can get pulled out of hyperspace and be dragged into a space battle between 2 clashing factions. There are small scale ones where you destroy a few fighters and then there are larger ones that include the games capital ships. I love the combat, I'll say that, the new combat is really nice to use especially and mainly as a Lightsaber user. With blasters, it was very hit or miss, sometimes i'd have a blast using the different blaster types and just destroying all of the enemies that had gathered behind a single bit of cover or simply spraying across a crowd, lightsaber/melee combat just hit differently though. The new combo system is small but still cool, you have to start it with a regular attack and from there you can either use the force, go into the air then slam or just continue attacking. Pummelling Darth Vader in the corner with constant step backs, combos and lightsaber throws has to be the most satisfying thing I have ever done in a LEGO game. While the main missions leave a lot to be desired, the open world of the game doesn't, you can explore every planet from the 9 main movies and most of them really in depth too, all containing a large amount of collectables on each planet, I'm currently on Utapau and about half way through completing the planet. Large planets I'd say takes a good few hours to complete while the smaller ones just 1 or 2, but that all depends on how you play. Each planet also has Ships and Characters you can unlock by completing their respective side-mission which you may use rumors to assist you. Rumors are small hints that you can either buy from the menu or find with certain NPCs spread throughout the galaxy.Onto the negatives. The game is just buggy, there have been multiple times where I've had to reset levels because I have been unable to complete the objective which sometimes left a pretty sour taste in my mouth after it happened the 3rd or 4th time. There have also been times where i have flat out just fell through the floor on multiple occasions and I'd be left falling in a loop since the floor is also the last 'safest' place to reset. In some levels where you control a vehicle, mainly speeder and space fighters, I would just be thrown to the left or right for no reason, a complete 90 degree turn which resulted in frustration. Another thing with vehicle control, mainly in space, if the mission requires you to be going straight ahead and pushes you that direction while also giving the player free range, it just doesn't end well. If you turn too much to either the left or the right, the game would take control and instead of turning you back to the objective or simply resetting you, it decides to just turn in every direction it can which often leads to confusion and frustration of losing control of what i want to do. The next thing i want to bring up is the way the game is designed around the assist settings. The game has options to toggle on or off Aim Assist and playing with this off has led to a few rough levels, specifically the speeder chase on Endor. This level without aim assist is out right impossible, your shots would more or less always go into the ground unless your speeders front part got lifted by a bump on the level or something but other than that, there was absolutely no way to control it. The end result was me turning on Aim Assist for the first time and realising how much the game seems to function just a small bit better, with correct hitboxes and hitting targets. Next is level design, I know this is a controversial thing to say because ""It's a kids game"" but that doesn't justify the lack of puzzles and/or challenge to the game. If you look at previous LEGO titles, there have been puzzles galore and personally it was my favourite part of the LEGO games, trying to find out which pieces fit where in a grand scheme of bricks and layouts to unlock a mini-kit or some more studs was just exciting, in this game, that wasn't there. You'd maybe come across a room that requires you to move some large bricks into place so you could access a terminal to unlock a door which would grant you a kyber brick or ship. The next is levels, levels are so short and do not engage well with the player, most of the time you'll watch a cut scene, shoot some guys, finish the level and then another cut scene, they are also incredibly short and have at least one of the get behind cover and shoot mechanic in all of them, which after a couple episodes, starts feeling dull and I began to run right through them. The last thing with levels are bosses. Overall they're alright, they get introduced in a cool fashion but then you get a pretty mediocre fight. The fights go like this, Hit boss, boss runs, you fight troops, you chase after boss and then that loops 2 or 3 times depending on who you're fighting, it got boring pretty quickly. The last thing I want to talk about is the story, obviously it's going to follow the star wars story and that's cool, it's a reason i bought the game. However, I feel like the developers had more of a joke with the game and didn't take many things seriously, every small bit no matter how serious, includes a joke and it won't even be something small, it would just be something that ruined the scene for me.This is my first review so i'm sorry if it's a bit drawn out but i felt passionately about this game and thought id provide a few insights for anybody scrolling through the reviews, this may not be well received but it's just my unfortunate experience while playing the game. Either way I hope it helped.i am still going to be playing this a lot and will 100% it!!"

Now, after all the delays I have to say, its not the game I was hoping to play for the last 3 years. At first I thought I had fun while playing, but it was actually just the built up hype that wouldnt let me accept that this game is 0 fun. You just play through the levels and they all feel and play the exact same, for 45 levels. The Story is boring as f****. There are 4 types of levels: -) run around till you reach your destination and shoot enemies who literally deal 0 damage, even if you stand still-) drive around till you reach your destination and shoot enemies who literally deal 0 damage, even if you stand still. -) try to find a card or a key or another random object, you will need to progress further in the story. Those objects are extremely poorly hidden.-) fight bosses, who feel the same in every single bossfight and also do 0 damage. The prequels are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in level design, 0 puzzles and no difficulty. At least the original trilogy and the sequels don't feel that rushed, but still, TCS levels were 1000x better. The gameplay is actually good, it feels so much better than in the old games and the combos are fun to use. Problem is, you can’t fully use it because of the AI. It is impossible to die in this game, even if you are a child or a person whos bad at videogames in general. It is literally a challenge to die. The graphics and the open world *design* are pretty damn good. Very detailed and nice to explore. But after you‘ve seen every planet and completed the story missions (which takes like 10 hours max if you’re not collecting every single stud.) you have the open world missions left. Those missions are complete trash and not even a little bit fun to play. Over 1000 collectibles and over 300 missions to unlock the option of buying a new character. They all feel and play the same. Its repetitive asf. Its a shame that people defend TSS by saying the level design has simply „evolved“ and they had to break the „old formula“ for something better to come. I mean, they kind of made the game more modern, by applying the boring open world formula most triple A games have these days  I really tried to like the game, but its just bad. Even a remake of TCS would have been so much better. If you like to spend 100 hours in a game doing the same missions over and over again, just to complete it 100%, this is the right game for you."

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

I wanted this game to be a HD remaster, but i was open minded for a new style of game and would have been happy to accept a change on the format.Gameplay: This game has been simplified to the point of being boring. Lego games have never been hard, but theyve always been cute and ingenuative. It was fun to see the different ways they Incorporated a beloved franchise into a lego world, all the refrences, the humor. This game has none of that. The missions are bog standard, 90% of it is just running from place to place sitting through the loading screens. For some reason they designed the mission lay out to play out in the ""open world"" itself, meaning each section of a level is inside a part of an explorable planet, taking you out of the story while you run around looking for the huge glowing ring that lets you play the next section. Audio: Instead of using the original voice lines, they hired voice actors to imitate the original lines, some of which sound like the character but none of them are delivered half as well as they were in the movies. Gone is the charming grunting and gesturing, and theres no nostalgic rush to be had. Its just mediocre voice acting. I assume this was done to be able to easily add in lines that arent said by the original actors, but i didnt hear any of that, and even every side quest being voiced wouldnt make up for how badly done the lines themselves are. I prefer silence to cringe.Story: Its.. just.. why. The story is incredibly condensed, making every scene feels rushed and the dialog feel spliced and jammed together. Fun parts are skipped and replaced by mindless walking. Remember the naboo infiltration mission? No you dont get to play that. Instead, spend 5 minutes walking around the gungan city and sitting there ""escaping"" a monster where all you have to do is press a button when prompted. Remember in attack of the clones when obiwan finds out the location to kamino? Yeah you actually play that in this. Youre dropped into the world and have to run to dexters, once there you have to wait tables till he fixes his robot, only to sit down and have a 20 second conversation, then you have to run all the way to the jedi temple, into the library, then play a minigame to unlock the archive, then run all the way to your ship to fly to kamino, THEN you play an assasins creed follow mission and WALK from the kamino landing pad through boring hallways while listening to the kaminoin drone on about nothing till you get to the room. You spend like 20 minutes to get through what was a single cut scene in the first game. It adds nothing to the game but bloat, none of it is fun, 85% of it is running from location to location. This takes time away from story development and fun gameplay, because the developers spend their time on 20 minutes of nothing instead of adding to the world. Like much of modern cinema, its empty fluff to padd out the gameplay time. This was done in a single cutscene which was more endearing and gave more information than 20 minutes of banging my head into a desk. All of the cartoon humor has been sucked dry, I smiled a total of three times in 2.7 hours. At one point, general grevious dabs. As if he hadnt been made a mockery of enough in the clone wars, they made him do an already extremely dated dance move to further sap him of any and all intimidation he could possibly have. W h yCharacters: The characters are just boring. Its cool to see them in such high quality, but all of them feel the same. They have classes now instead of abilities. We have a new menu to change characters, instead of holding down Y and getting the whole list, you have to go through the menu to find a character menu, to find the class menu to scroll around looking for the character. None of them have noticeably better jumps, the astromechs cant glide, Jet packs are pointless. All of the classes combat comes down to spamming the button to do the exact same moves as everyone else.Co-op: Just painful. There is no dynamic split screen like in basically every other Lego game, it will be vertically split no matter if youre right next to each other or on opposite sides of the map. This leaves you with only half a screen, which makes it hard to enjoy the look of the level or even see what you need to be doing. Every, single level selection requires both players to hold down the select button at the same time, which sometimes just wont work. when youre in a ship youre likely to fly into your target while waiting for the other person to get positioned. Since theres no online play (in a game made in 2022), i have no idea why you need to agree to the level in the game, youre probably not going to be playing with someone you cant get along with.Im summary: I wanted a remaster, but i would have been happy with a good game that was different, i got neither of those. I got a boring, uncreative, uninteresting, clunk fest of a game for twice what the original cost on release. My very first video game that I, myself, owned was a lego game, its how i learned to use a controller, and how i learned my basic video game ""skills"". Ive been a fan ever since, but this will probably be the last lego game that i purchase. There hasnt been a good Lego game since Jurassic park, and this is no different. Rey Palpatine is at the very top of the menu in a game entitled ""the Skywalker saga""0/10"

A normal mission is just:you start in free world ---> run to the mission ---> cutscene ----> solve some puzzle ----> cutscene ---> boss fight ----> cutscene ---> free world ----> repeatnow as i said the cutscenes are well done and look great but theres just to many, and they sometimes do the fighting for you, if i wanted that i'd watch the movies again.If your lucky you get to fight some enemies before or after the boss fight, which is nice because i really like the new fighting system, especally the combo system, that is very well done just like the space battles which seem a bit underwhelming as there isnt much going on (only 10-12 fighter at most and 2-3 capital ships which dont shoot) but the ship controls are very good. Overall though the game also seems to easy, i have been playing this with a friend and its been really easy.So sadly i cant give this a positive review, i have only gotten to episode III after that i just didnt want to play the mission cycle for the 50th time again, maybe it will get better, i certainly hope so and if it does i will change the review but right now i would jsut buy the old lego star wars games as they are by far better.to summ it up:pro- Great Graphics- Great Cutscenes- Great new Control systemcon- Terrible mission design- Kinda boring Hubworlds- Only very short side missions in Freeplay"

TT Games isn't really known for updating their games.Solid and very fun but definitely has some issues that no doubt must be resolved:1. Random performance issues. I noticed this a couple times but from what I played so far, it is especially significant in the Droid Factory level, where my average fps was just above 10. Yeah, 10. In most gameplay I get above 60 and sometimes fps can range up to 140, so the frame dips to 30 in certain moments and as low as 10 in others must be fixed.2. Some levels are quite buggy. Specifically on the Zam Wessell chase, my bolts would sometimes shoot randomly backwards into the air and worse, sometimes actually get stuck on and damage my own speeder.3. The hit-box on some characters don't match the model and blaster hit consistency is low in general. I think the hit-boxes are tiny or something, but the only work around is homing shots. But, you can't configure the homing shot sensitivity or have separate toggles for when you are or are not flying a ship. So you can either choose to never hit anything or to lose the skill ceiling of aiming unless you micromanage the option.4. There are options for most things that need options, but many of these options only have a single adjustable variable, meaning you can't customize options with specific variables in mind. I'm poorly wording this but essentially, you can't set certain setting specific to whether you're flying, aiming, using a mouse vs controller, etc. The options are all locked to either player 1 or player 2 and the player will again just have to micromanage the settings if they want them to be different based on how they're playing or what they're doing.5. there's no option to switch which side of the screen players use in co-op, which can be frustrating, no explanation needed.6. Sometimes the menus are fiddly. Specifically the character selection menu is really annoying and slow to navigate because you can't scroll quickly like in old Lego games and the menu resets every time you open it, meaning you have to spam the scroll button a LOT to test out new characters. You can actually select from your current character but that only works from within their character class. In general, the character selection menu is inefficient and clumsy.7. Camera is sometimes very claustrophobic and, importantly, can sometimes work against you by zooming in randomly and stuff.8. Sometimes your crosshair and the target you're attacking can get muddied behind the mess of effects and HUD. It can make combat and pursuit levels frustrating.There are also a few personal tidbits I want changed:1. Add custom characters. It takes development time, I know, but before this was confirmed to have been removed as a feature before release, I was quite excited to see a new character customizer even more complex and in depth than the ones in the most recent games. And it's just not here.2. There are so many fun mechanics in this game but most of the time they're slow, removed despite appearing in old games, or practically never used. Remember building? Yeah, in the game based off of a construction toy? I think I've used it maybe 3, 4 times in total in finishing two episodes. R2 and 3PO panels use a minigame that it time consuming and boring. The old games made the right call to have them automatic. Frankly, they could be even quicker than in Complete Saga. Short characters' vents are removed entirely. Just a lot of the fun and unique abilities of certain characters feel underutilised in the story missions.3. The fact that 2 of the 3 main combo attack buttons are also used to jumping and using a special ability makes melee combat feel inconsistent and bizarre, because unless you have already initiated it with a standard attack, you'll just jump or use a special ability instead. Or, if you want to jump or use a special ability while in an engaged state, you end up attacking an opponent instead. Awkward and clumsy.It might seem like I'm giving this game a tough run, but because it has years of Lego games to look at as a guideline. Yes, I expect and prefer new and improved content over previous games. But it is sad to see a huge reduction and removal of some fan-favourite features in old games, like character/class-unique abilities that do have their utility but are underutilised in the story, or the cancellation of a character customizer. Sad and I hope the game improves. I'm glad it's really fun and at least the content is complete, but there are definitely issues that plague the game which would be a huge deal in a less casual game."

Not to say that straying away from established formulas is a bad thing, but when you replace it with the ubisoft collectathon model, complete with terribly slow walk-and-talk segments, then you've got an absolute bore of a game on your hands. I had been eagerly awaiting this game as The Complete Saga was fantastic, if a bit basic at times, but it was a good start and we saw that formula improved on in games like Lego Batman 1. In the years since it seems that TT's design model has totally regressed, with walking and talking segments outweighing the classic puzzle styled levels by a wide margin. Levels (from what I played before giving up, that being episodes 1,2, and the first half of 3.) also seem considerably shorter, to the point where I was beating levels before I even realized I was in one. This is an incredibly lazy game, do not waste your time on it if you don't want a completely generic experience indicative of the homogeneous game design models of the past ten years."

350,40,Legionary Leader,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LegionaryLeader/,155,10,0,1.7,"Posted: April 6, 2022",454,0,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/245950a43749893f3a16e7aa717b0f144aa4971a.jpg,"At the time of writing I haven't reviewed much at all, but I thought it to be extremely important to make it clear to anyone looking to buy this game that they should not. So here is your TL:DR:This game is an utter disappointment not only as a video game, but also as a Lego Star Wars game.It has horrible optimization. The multiplayer is Co-Op LAN only (We're in 2022 folks). The level design is abysmal.The game is practically only cutscenes which are very short. There's so much on the HUD and so many menus and options for a game that it's distracting and just too much for what should be a simple Lego game.The entire game is as follows: Walk, kill 3 enemies, next level, super fast cutscene, repeat.In a slightly more detailed version:In an loose fashion, I'll talk about some of my problems with the game that specifically don't have to do with the actual gameplay but more about the devs choices such as much options, game options, bugs, and optimization.Me and my friend were looking forward to this game for years. It was clearly announced far too early, as we both agree it doesn't seem like a completed game. I thought after Cyperpunk happened, devs would be a little more careful.To start with a minor annoyance that I had personally experienced, I just thought I'd add to the list.The game obviously by default was fullscreen. When changing to Windowed Borderless and re-launching the game, it does not put the game over the windows task bar. Alt-Tabbing out and back in doesn't get rid of it, neither does doing Alt+Enter.I had to manually go into the options to re-enable full screen, and then back to windowed borderless.Upon learning that this game does not have online Co-Op in 2022 we shrugged out shoulders and said ""Alright, let's do Remote Play"". A great solution steam has built in, it doesn't always work the best but it does work, thanks Steam.I have 1.7 hours according to steam at the time of writing, approximately 1 hour was spent trying to figure out the Multiplayer and fixing it to work. If you want to play via Remote play with your friend, you have to use 2 controllers. As a keyboard user this was an issue for me, however I dug an old xbox controller out and got it to work just fine. If you only use keyboard, and your friend uses controller, then you're going to have to settle with being player 2 as the game does not recognize any other way of configuring between players. It prioritizes the Controller user as player 1.This issue is just silly, but it gets worse. On a 27"" screen, after succeeding with 2 Controllers to enable Steam Remote Play, my friend joined the game and it activated our vertical split screen in which it was extremely hard to see the entire time. We had to just deal with it as there are zero options to change to horizontal split screen in the options. When compared to the old Lego Star Wars, where the camera would combine upon being close to your other user, this is a major downgrade. Sum up: You're forced to use vertical splitscreen, no there is no other option.Also quite a silly issue. Both I was willing to deal with if the game was a good time, as it wasn't THAT bad.Like I said, we've been anticipating this for years, I wasn't gonna quit because of some some splitscreen getting in the way.Also on my system I currently run a 1080ti for my graphics card. I played through the entirety of Elden Ring with ease and no issue. For a Lego game, the frame drops I had were upsetting to say the least, and I've read that many other people are having trouble with this as well, so be careful if you don't have a $3000 GPU in your PC.This brings me to the actual gameplay. Most importantly!The game is just  fun.The old game was so well thought out, every level felt full, and was drawn out the correct amount of time, maybe even a little long.This game is the complete opposite. We started with Episode 1, so on the trade federation ship. We blew through the halls of the ship with minimal enemies to find ourselves in a cutscene that leads to Naboo below within the first 3 minutes of playing. We got up to and finished the entire Pod Race within the next 15 minutes.The game is nothing more than a million HUD icons in your face telling you where to go or who to talk to, with a million menus for things like planets, upgrades, characters, etc. You walk 10 steps, kill 2-3 small groups of enemies, activate next level, rinse repeat.The fact that a game in today's age can be so poorly designed and uninspired is baffling to me. Nobody wants to pay 50-60 dollars to have a conversation, walk 2 feet, kill 3 enemies, and then start the next level. This $50 price tag ($60 if you want a few extra characters) is an atrocious insult to those who spent their hard earned money on games. Especially in a time where for the exact same price you can get Elden Ring, one of the most well crafted games in a very VERY long time, this game is an insult to the old game and gamers alike.Now I don't wanna go blaming the developers immediately, because we can't know what happened. But I personally suspect Disney personally ordered this game to push their trilogy once more in a new way.If you have played the old Lego Star Wars, please heed my warning and avoid this game.If you have not played a Lego game before and this seems exciting to you regardless of this review, please try it and you should see what I'm talking about.To those of you who enjoy, I'm very happy for you, however I cannot ever under any circumstances recommend a terribly optimized walking simulator that advertises itself as the remade Lego Star Wars in which costs 60 bucks.Thank you for reading, have a good day."

For example every sith and jedi can do the exact same which is using the force by lifting up objects, throwing light sabers, influencing the weak minded. Not even palpatine can throw lightnings nor can snoke or doku. Nr2: Duel of Mustafa. I mean wtf. If you have played the complete saga in coop you actually get to play as obi wan kenobi and anikan and fight against each other. In skywalker saga however you get to play as obi wan and the other coop partner has to play r2d2 or c3po and watch the fight from aboveNr3: Although there are 5 levels per movie they are ridicously short and between those levels you have some half-hearted follow missions where you just follow a character inside the open world and sometimes have to protect them. This mechanic feels like its stretching the total story time."

Why is that?Pros:Graphics: The new engine looks very nice, even a little better than in TFA. I'd love to see more LEGO games in that qualityHumor: Let's be honest, that is the most important part of the LEGO games, and they absolutely nail it. The cutscenes are gold, and there are tons of easter eggs you can spot.Cons:Open World instead of Levels: You're walking longer from one mission to another, than the actual mission has length, sometimes a level (which was ~20min in every other game) is only 4mins long and the only element is to outrun a giant fish.Performance: I've had so many crashes I stopped counting. I remembered LEGO Games as a stable gaming experience, but even that seems to have faded away.Overall Content: Since there are already games for the Prequels, Originals and TFA (and The Clone Wars as well), you could think that the game just needs to rework some levels and fill the rest of the sequels. But instead of building on top of the great existing levels, the devs decided to throw it all away and start from scratch. I can understand why such a decision is made, but I cannot understand how underwhelming the result of that process ist. This feels more like a teaser for a real Skywalker Saga game, which probably doesn't exist.No online Multiplayer: Do I even have to say more to that? It's 2022 folks. (and yes I know such things as parsec exist, but thats no excuse for not including such a feature in the game)So overall:This is an okay game. It's far from bad, but also far from the greatness of previous LEGO games.If this is your first step into exploring LEGO games, go ahead and you will have a great time.If you have played many LEGO games before and loved them, I suggest you skip this failure."

I've been rather disappointed by this game. All the improvements have been wasted. Not to stay there hasn't been some good moments or jokes, but its hard to enjoy the good when faced with the bad.The new combat system is great, but the enemies don't complement it. The bosses don't even work with combos. The dog fighting doesn't control well. Co-op isn't all that great which is a crime for a Lego game. Some races hide the next objective out of view if in split screen, but are in view if playing solo. Some races are impossible co-op. Some stages just have player 1 or 2 doing nothing for awhile while the other has their fun.It feels like the game is rushing you through the story, and stages are so short. Some are done in what feels less than a couple minutes. The forced replay minikits are still rampant as well.I will say the hub maps are fun to explore, maybe even the best part. They are amazing to explore and hunt down the collectibles, but feel barren enemy wise. You may encounter a couple of enemies like droids, but that's rare. NPC's usually run instead of fight so there is no Cantina bar fights. Now I understand that constant enemies would be annoying, but a designated area or two on some hubs would of been nice.The upgrade system is nice and puts the bricks you collect into good use, but some are annoying, some overpowered, some useless. It is good that you can disable them at will. A lot of the extras/cheats/""redbricks"" are mostly annoying, but some are rather fun.I want to love this game. I really do. This game has so much potential, but it feels squandered heavily. I would only recommend this game on sale.Edit: I will review the episodes that we played through.Prequel Trilogy:Episode 1:  The best of the prequel trilogy. had some good jokes and the levels were fun. All except the Gungan vs Droid battle. It was extremely short and not fun.Episode 2: Not as good as 1, but still fun.Episode 3: Sadly disappointing. A lot of the jokes don't land well, but that's a personal taste. The fight against Anakin on Mustafar was not good. Original Trilogy:Episode 4: Starts out great, then drops in quality. The trench run was extremely short with very little dog fighting.Episode 5: Best movie in my opinion, worse movie in this game.  Then the Hoth battle was disappointing. To be honest, it was better in the original game. There was no Dagobah mission, just a hub map. Cloud City felt cut in half.Episode 6: Easily the best in my opinion so far. I thought the jokes here mostly hit and made us laugh. Sadly no level to blow up the Death Star II. Sequel Trilogy:Episode 7: Mixed bag. Some parts are fun, others are not. While the Death Star and Death Star 2 did not have any dog-fighting, and DS1 had a small trench run, Star Killer Base surprisingly had a dog-fighting section and (still kinda small) trench run section. Why not also for the Death Stars? End of the day, its ok.Episode 8: It's ok. Not good, but not bad. It's just kinda there.  The last stage was quick to finish with not much going on. Not much more to say.Episode 9: Its better than the last two I guess. Its still ok. Sad that we don't participate in the fleet battle on Exegol. While there was not a mission to blow up the Death Star 2, there was a mission here that felt like it, which in turn only makes me want a mission to blow up the DS even more.  I feel like all of the Episodes would of been better with one more mission as they all felt more like a summary of the movie rather than the movie itself, even at times missing a key scene.Edit 2 : Now that I and my co-op buddy have finished all Episodes, my feeling on this hasn't changed much. Its still disappointing. I still only would recommend this on a sale maybe 50% off or more. Even if you get it on sale though, its still gonna be disappointing as its missing key moments of the saga that no sale will fix."

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

I'm also a fan of (most of) the Star Wars series, playing past games like LEGO The Force Awakens and the original Star Wars LEGO games, so it seemed right to hop into this one. That being said, something just didn't feel right about it.I started with Episode I and it felt rushed. Key moments of dialogue/story were removed or, honestly what may be worse, changed. I've experienced LEGO games doing this in the past, but it didn't feel as egregious as this one. Rushing along the story and prioritizing the collection of items rather than the enjoyment of the story and world around me didn't sit well. The HUD was entirely too crowded and busy, including the menu screen for upgrades and such. The pacing in LEGO LotR or The Force Awakens felt much better, where collecting was the secondary objective to enjoying the story play out. LEGO Marvel (the first one) and LotR nailed the idea of an open world with things to do while having a cool, silly and engaging story. In the Episode I track, I felt overwhelmed by the amount that I could do in the Hub locations without being able to do much with them (because of Free Play lock, which is normal for these games), while at the same time I was underwhelmed by the Story missions' substance. Trying to fit NINE movies into one game is quite a task, and it may just be too much content crammed into one space. I'd much prefer Quality over Quantity.Bug-wise, the cut-scenes were a bit jumpy and climbing up ladders was a nightmare.As a positive, the game looks gorgeous, from the locations, to the player models having dirt on them. Wonderful work on that front.Overall, I love LEGO, LEGO games, and Star Wars, but this iteration doesn't grab me. It feels off, less engaging and, unfortunately, not very fun."

Now go here! Now come back! Now do that again but this time in a different order!"" For me that wasn't fun at all. I didn't play it but man it looked tedious...especially with all the bugs.This game is basically that but it doesn't have the bugs so it's slightly more bearable. This game is NOT lego star wars. It's a different game with a lego star wars skin slapped on it. The levels themselves are severely lacking, very few mechanics, boss fight mechanics are reused over and over again. And the game makes you go from open to open world to open world in between levels to waste your time so you don't realize just how short the levels are. For example the very first level you're on a space ship and...oh you just hover over the trade ship and press a button...why is this here? Anyways after that you're in the meeting room just like the old lego star wars...oh wait that's a open world/hub world...ok now the level started and you're in jar jar's home...oh wait that's another open world...ok now you have to go to the chief and tal- WAIT WAIT HOLD UP FOLLOW JAR JAR while he moves ever so slowly to the chief THEN YOU CAN TALK TO HIM! Then you have to walk to the ship on the opposite site of the hub world on the lowest level. THEN the first level finally starts...and all you do is press 2 buttons while a giant fish chases you. One to shoot and one to dodge...that's it. literally a 5m level and you had to spend like 20 navigating the stupid ass hub worlds. What the actual ♥♥♥♥? This gameplay persist throughout most of the game...1) Open world is not fun and it's dryOk that's fine because the open world areas are fun right? No...not really. It's basically just an open world with collectibles and NPCs you can SOMETIMES talk to if you have the right characters that can understand the language because that's a mechanic...cool. They do have enemies but once you defeat enemies in the open world zone they NEVER EVER respawn unless you create a new save file. YEAH!! If you want an open world Lego game there's other options that do it better.2) Player 2 experience is awfulAlso do NOT play this with a 2nd player...the fight with Anakin is literally just player 1 most of the time and will occasionally switch to player 2 as R2D2 so they can press a button to activate a panel...THATS IT! Player 2 is highly disregarded a LOT and that kind of thing happens many times.3) Controller support issuesThat's once you're playing the game that is. First this game lies about ""full controller support"" as it doesn't support the PS controller and while it does work it gives the Xbox prompts which is mildly annoying. I had to use a 3rd party software to get it to give me PlayStation prompts. However then the share/select button that closes the holo menu didn't work so I'd have to press circle 3-4 times to close out of it...so I fiddled with the software for like 2+ hours and couldn't figure it out because the button worked outside of the game but in game refused to recognize the button press. Ok...whatever R3 isn't being used...here it is ""open holo menu"" let me just rebind that...surely it will rebind it for closing it too right? right!?4) Horrible button remapping with very little options...you can probably guess...it didn't. Because whoever was in charge of button remapping let me just say...they are either really stupid or they rushed that crap together in a single day. So I couldn't rebind it and also most of the button remapping option just rebind the button for like 10+ different actions instead of just one...like HUH!?! THIS GAME IS 50 BUCKS AND YOU- naaah. I had to deal with so many controller issues on a 50 dollar game that has ""Full controller support"" and once I played the game I literally got through episode I in less than an hour with only 10m being ACTUAL levels and the rest was just going from point A to B in the open world. Which lacked any action or anything interesting.Like I said before this is some other game using the Lego Star Wars brand as a skin. If you want nostalgia sure it works but gameplay wise it's not the same and when you beat an episode rather than feeling satisfied you are left feeling empty like ""That's it?"" and concerned that you'll be done and tired of this game really quick.TLDR: Player 2 experience sucks, game lacks content and is dry, does NOT actually have full controller support. I'd honestly just buy force awakens or complete saga over this game.Now that I've critiqued the game I will say this is by far the BEST looking Lego game to date as they switched to a new engine and the graphics are simply stunning. The art team did an outstanding job I will give them that so honestly that's about the sole thing that carries the open world...while it's boring gameplay wise, it is beautiful to take in."

Completing the game to 100% will take a bit of time, for me it was just under 70 hours, for others it could be 80 or more, but you will definitely get your money's worth.

400,45,Mech Muffin,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099940387/,17,,0,17.0,"Posted: May 6, 2022",453,1,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/b52cfaf7015f9f5fd73e2ef85ff24330b6fbacc5.jpg,"Ok, first off, this game has massively positive reviews.  Classic case of nostalgia blinders.  Let me tell you first why I can talk about this game and second why I think it's subpar for Lego games.First, I've played almost every single Lego game released (even those old ones like Rock Raiders and Lego Racer), so I've been a fan of these games since I was a kid.  I've played all the Lego Star Wars games (except I hardly touched TFA).  Ok, so let's get into why I don't recommend this game.1. Level design: The levels are very, very short.  Like some can be completed in 5 minutes.  They probably average around 10 minutes, the longest maybe at 15.  Don't expect excellent level design like in previous titles.  No puzzles, hardly any areas to explore.  Only collectibles are studs and like 5 parts of a minikit.  This game decided to focus on semi-open world hubs with short missions interspersed.  I'd be fine with that if the open world had anything interesting to offer.  90% of the worlds are focused around collecting kyber bricks, and after a few hours, you realize all the puzzles to get the kyber bricks are recycled every planet.  There are a few side quests that really stand out, but there are few of them.  Overall, level design is very poor, and the short levels just aren't made up for by the bland open worlds.Even more disappointing to me was the removal of several key levels from the previous Complete Saga game.  There is no Battle over Coruscant.  There is no space battle over Endor.  These are skimmed over in quick cutscenes, like 10-20 seconds long.  Very disappointing considering how much potential this game had.2. Character selection: There are a ton of characters in this game, and the Skywalker Saga doesn't ignore some of the more obscure characters, which I appreciate.  Unfortunately, as in most Lego games, about 80% of the characters are identical in how they act and attack, the only difference being their appearance.  There are unique voicelines for key characters which I found very enjoyable, and the company leaned hard into memes, especially prequel memes, which added a lot of enjoyment for me.  Jetpack characters got a hard nerf.  You can only hover low over the ground for about 3 seconds before you run out of fuel.  Very disappointing considering how far you could fly as Jango and Boba in previous titles (I have heard Bo Katan's jetpack is much better, but I haven't tried it myself).  The Jedi characters have several different lightsaber combat animations now which is a positive note.  They all handle pretty differently and are unique and fun.  Blaster characters on the other hand are very bland and boring to play.  The over the shoulder style camera for blaster combat is great for fighting but less so for trying to clear out an area of breakable objects.  The blaster characters in general didn't have enough differences to make them interesting.  3. Fighters and space combat: this was a big step forward for Lego who up till now had kept fighters locked into a flat plane with really weird camera angles.  Now you fly starfighters with 3rd person perspective camera and can fly any direction.  Unfortunately, there's very little to do in space.  There are some encounters, but they become repetitive after a few hours.  But the starfighter levels are amazing, especially the Droid Control Ship over Naboo.  Wish we'd gotten more of these levels instead of having them zipped past in cutscenes.4.  The story: Closely tied to the levels, the story is enjoyable but far too rushed.  Episode I in particular skips over major story points.  It probably took me 30-50 minutes to complete the whole episode.  Each episode only has 5 levels as well...  Again, missed potential.  There's no reason to limit each episode to 5 levels.  I know the devs wanted players to spend more time in the open world, but then again, they should have given us more to do in the open world.  Anyway, the story is fun, has good humor, but is too short.Overall, this game is fun for a few hours but becomes stale soon after.  The graphics are beautiful, but good graphics do not make a good game.  In my opinion, the Lego Star Wars Complete Saga and Lego Clone Wars games are far superior in level design, story, and replayability.   The Skywalker Saga has little to no replayability, and considering the short levels, it's hard to excuse a $60 (more if you get DLC) price tag.  The official MechMuffin rating for the Skywalker Saga: 4/10  Missed potential, and save your money.  Go play Lego Clone Wars."

It’s my first LEGO game, I am so impressed with this franchise, the investment was totally worth the shot. In fact, it’s the first purchase in 2022 I’ve done that I truly felt worth every penny I’ve spent in a game.StoryJust like the movies and how they go, but with some hilarious twists from TT. Seriously, I can’t stop laughing while going through the stories. It’s family friendly, you can safely play it with kids using co-op:)ContentThe game offers rich vast content for you to discover. I divided them into a few small sections below.-Mode-Apart from story mode, the game also gives you the Free mode after completing an episode. It allows you to play any characters you’ve unlocked, run freely to all the locations you’ve been to from stories to collect anything you’ve left out. Hundreds of side missions, challenges, mini games are waiting for you to completed. So you can access these content normally without competing all 9 episodes at any time you wish.-Collectibles-There are thousands of collectibles for you to collect across the mega university of galaxy: characters, ships’ skins, skill points currency...Well, it’s a LEGO version of the classic assassin’s creed, I am not exaggerating, I repeat, literally thousands lol.-Artwork-Everything is transformed to the art models of LEGO toys, while maintaining the high quality of how neat they look, all models are amazingly in detail.-Voice-Everyone including most of the NPC on the maps is beautifully voiced, I am not sure whether all the characters are voiced by the original actors and actresses in the films, however, they don’t  sound much different to me at very least. Personally, great job to all voice actors/actresses!LengthThe game is said to be around 15 hours to go through all the story lines, if you speed run it. In reality, there are so many places to explore, so many fun collectibles to gather, so many side fun missions and challenges to completed, you probably won’t rush the game to end, so the gameplay time extends much much longer than 15 hours, easily over 50 hours I tell you, it’s a mega open-world game, in my opinion, the price it offers is worth the time you are going to sink.Performance&GraphicsGame runs smoothly with my 65 inches ROG-PG65UQ 4K display with 120 FPS at cap. No lag, no FPS drops, no stutter, nothing, apart from some bugs. Graphics look like this:   with max-out settings.And the game terrifically supports HDR, when it’s on, the visuals are even beyond what it looks here, with vibrant and vivid colors. The reason I couldn’t screenshot them is: HDR features lose when taking a screenshot, they just won’t record to the image, so the final outcome significantly loses color details which is nothing it looks like in the game. Couldn’t share them is pity, though there is no doubt how amazing they are while HDR’s on. If you also have a HDR monitor, you will be impressed, it is as good as Lucas’s films which is presenting in front of your eyes.BugThe only drop back is: the game does have variety kinds of bugs. Like cutscenes turn to black screen when sound still going on. The button promote on screen are wrong sometimes when using a controller. Game occasionally freeze when bugged out. It doesn’t remember your visuals settings, for example FPS is set beyond 60. Though nothing game-breaking.Update: the game contains massive amount of bugs, they do not prevent you from completing the whole story, but some game-breaking bugs do successfully stopping me from 100% completion. PURCHASE WITH CAUTION!SumIf you like LEGO’s cute family friendly art style, get the game! If you are a Star Wars fan, and don’t mind it’s a cute version, get the game! If you are not in either of the group, and interested in this game, I highly recommend you trying it out.It’s pity this game no longer being introduced globally. It’s better spending your time playing video games rather than fighting the war, no?"

They've got no where near as much to interact with and they feel repetitive and rushed and even feel like you're speed running them at certain points. They've had so much removed and they've lost their charm and even the cut scenes feel rushed and out of place sometimes. I even went back and played The Complete Saga after playing this game and the first level of Phantom Menace took me maybe 20 minutes to get through on there after doing all the puzzles and collecting studs, whereas that mission on The Skywalker Saga took no more than 5 minutes to complete even after looking around and collecting studs and there weren't even any puzzles on that mission. Somehow the missions feel like a second thought in this game and I think way too much time was put into the bland open world rather than the main missions. - I think one of the worst parts of the game are the open hub areas, there's just too many of them (a new one after most missions and even multiple per planet) and they're all just filled with the same boring and repetitive puzzles, endless collectable kyber bricks and pointless NPC dialogue. It ruins the flow and immersion of the story having to go to them after nearly every level. They're as wide as an ocean but about as deep as a puddle and I hate having to access the main missions through them, it makes them feel tacked on. - The hacking puzzles are so repetitive and terrible, especially the R2D2 ones which are the exact same puzzle every single time.  - Combat is mindless. It obviously wasn't the strongest point in the older games either but it's still extremely simple and the new combat mechanics feel pointless to use when most enemies die in a few hits anyway. With the gun fights, most of the time you'll just stand in the same spot shooting down a hallway over and over again until the enemies are dead. - The UI and menus are a cluttered mess. There's so many things on screen and you don't need 95% of it. Looks so much messier and intrusive compared to the simple and clean original games UI.- The quick time events have literally no impact on game play whether you win or lose or are too fast for them. For example the Darth Vader lightsaber duel on Bespin, even when you win the QTE, Luke loses and when I purposely lost the QTE, Luke still beat Vader? It's the same with the object pulling QTEs, you don't even have to wait for the circles to align to successfully complete it, you can click the corresponding button as soon as it appears for the same affect.- The environments and characters do look great though and the roster of playable characters is impressive. It's still goofy and filled with funny moments too.Nearly everything in this game is a downgrade from the originals though. Obviously some people are gonna love the new format but having played the original games and enjoying them so much more than this new one, it all just feels so disappointing and I don't understand how it's had so many positive reviews."

Pretty short if you are just beating the game. Probably like 15 hours. If you are a completionist well it's gonna take probably around 100 hours. Ton of collectibles and replaying the story missions. Bugs occasionally pop up and had a few crashes mostly during fast travel for me. A solid game but with a lot of bloat. Would recommend if you are a fan of star wars otherwise eh.

The humor and comedy is still there in every cut scene and it's a thrill to finish the game and relive the movies in a fresh way. Next to that the replayability is high, you can come back for the ole trusty True Jedi statuses by collecting enough studs to fill three bars, collecting all the Kyber bricks and of course all the mini kits. Next to the 40 hours that I played already, I still have a long way to go on the achievements (19/45 currently) and getting all the mini-kits, characters and ships!"

A 100 hours for a Lego video game is nice, too bad halfway through it strated feeling like a chore.On paper, the skywalker Saga has everything to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made:So yes, if nothing else, this game has a  of content. Too bad most of it feels like padding.The story itself is super short. There's 5 missions per movie, most of them are around 5 minutes long; if you're not interested in collectables (but why are you even playing a Lego game in that case?) you're only in for 10 hours or so.But then, these collectibles. There's just  too many of them, most of which are  too easy and repetitive. I'd rather collect all Korok seeds in Breath of the Wild again, than try to 100% this game a second time. It's just ""quantity over quality"" taken to a (bad) extreme.While there's a lot of characters, half of them are just useless, either because... they just are (like most of those in the ""Extra"" category, who don't have any weapon or ability), or because others from the same class are just plain better. It feels like the devs just chose some random names from a SW wiki to add them to the game.Space battles are super boring. there's no dogfight or anything interesting going on, most of the time you don't even have to move, just stay in place and turn around to follow the enemy markers, dodge when the game tells you to, repeat for the next battle. Capitzl ships aren't much better, but at least you need to fly around a bit to hit all the targets.I won't talk about difficulty (or lack thereof), but just know there an invincibility option or an auto-dodge in the accessibility menu. Because apparently the game playing itself while you watch is ""accessibility""...Then there's the technical issues (severe FPS drops in some areas, random CTD 3 or 4 times in total) and glitches (some of which haven't been addressed since launch)..."

This is a worse game than the original Star Wars Lego games in every way. While I am not as young as when they came out the game is laughably easy with puzzles that always complete themselves. The only good addition is the combat system which is poorly done. There are not enough enemies to use it on as common ones die too soon to even actually combo against and bosses almost always have immunity to regular attacks unless you are countering a move. There's also a lack of enemies outside of the space battles in the open world to fight, sometimes in a Lego game I just want to switch my brain off and fight people with a lightsaber, I shouldn't have to spend as long finding a spawn point to do so. Platforming has also been removed completely with simple button presses advancing you to the next part of the level. At the end of the day this is an overpriced game that plays off nostalgia and I wish that I hadn't fallen for the trap myself upon release. I wish the game at least had more difficulty to it. I've yet to die once in the game, and while you can argue it's a kids game I feel that when paying full price for such a game in today's industry difficulty options should be present. I think that the very best thing this game could be described as is a let down, and for the worse side I consider it a vast downgrade from games that came out in 2005 with a higher asking price. There is attempt at mimicry of advancement when in reality we receive a pseudo-complex system for combat that boils down to ""don't use the same attack more than 3 times consecutively"", lobotomised platforming and self-playing puzzles."

While the character options are fantastic, and the story is enjoyable, the game's current state falls short of expectations even at its lowered price point of $50. As a three-time buyer of this game on various platforms, I have experienced the best and worst of what it has to offer.On the positive side, the game's character options are impressive, and the story, while not without flaws, remains engaging. However, the game is grindy, which I found tiresome after spending many additional hours pursuing achievements and unlocking all the characters and minikits. The replay value of the story is also limited, with only key missions available to replay, leaving the player feeling unsatisfied with the overall experience.The co-op experience, a hallmark of previous Lego Star Wars games, was frustratingly marred by frequent game-breaking bugs, which caused the game to crash or freeze. While the game is still enjoyable in single-player mode, it lacks the charm that made its predecessors great.Ultimately, I wanted to like this game, but the various issues it presents make it difficult to recommend. However, I believe that there is still potential here, and I hope that the developers take note of the community's feedback and work to improve the game's shortcomings. If you're a fan of grindy games or looking for a mindless single-player experience, this game may still be worth considering, but be aware of its limitations in co-op mode and replay value.TLDR: I wanted so much to like this game, as I've played many Lego games as a kid and am a huge fan of them. If there was a neutral vote, this game would be it. But if I was considering downvoting it, I felt I had to represent that on Steam. There is so much love and potential here, so give it a shot if you want, but please be warned of the games pitfalls."

As someone who grew up playing the Lego games, not just Star Wars ones. Technically speaking, this game is magnificent with the amount of things you can do, as well as the visuals/audio. They are all leaps ahead of their predecessors, especially compared to the original Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga game.Gameplay wise, however, these games take steps backwards. The easiest way I can describe this game is that it is akin to Assassin's Creed games, where you have A LOT of things to do, but nothing of substance. While old Lego games involved a huge number of quests to acquire bricks and whatnot, the activities and challenges you did were a lot more varied and creative. In this game, there isn't a lot of variety. Of the things that are here, the creativity is lacking. It led to me getting bored and I couldn't be bothered to slog through half of the quests on half of the planets because I couldn't stand grinding the same repeated quests any more.The other main irritant is the way that characters are handled. I won't get into the voice lines vs mumbles debate, although I firmly believe the mumbles and old style of talking had a lot more charm to it. Characters, as opposed to having a huge roster of distinct and unique characters, are now broken up into certain classes of character (you have Jedi, Scavenger, Bounty Hunter, etc.). These classes result in characters not feeling unique anymore, since each class MUST have a distinct class ability, they are required to be able to do things that don't make sense for that character. Because characters don't feel as unique, it makes the process of acquiring new ones a lot less satisfying than the past. The way that DLC is being handled is also a headache for me personally. I know that Disney is coming out with more Star Wars products/shows as time goes on, so TT obviously couldn't fit everything into the game without an easy compromise. But the way that character packs are being doled out is seriously irritating. Because they are ONLY characters, they run into the previous issue that I wrote about characters themselves. They boil down to skins of a certain class. Which is sort of acceptable if the pack has characters that all fit into different classes, but is absolutely absurd when packs have nothing but one or two classes in them (such as the trooper pack). It means that packs will have different value associated, and like I said before, they are only skins for classes. They don't include any other content of any kind. No levels, ships, areas, etc. What's worse is that these packs don't get included for those who buy the Deluxe Edition, which, for an extra $10 USD, nets you a couple included character packs.It is disappointing because again, this game should and could be one of the best Lego games of all time. If this game is on sale, then I'd say it might be worth buying. Or if you're unable to play previous Lego games or really just want to play the latest and greatest and don't have an interest in any previous games. But otherwise, I do not recommend buying this game in its current state. I didn't even mention the technical issues that this game runs into, as well as a myriad of UI or quality of life issues that also hinder the user experience."

I’ve completed this game 100% with almost 90 hours into it. The Good: The graphics are immensely beautiful and comparable to the EA Battlefront titles. Cutscenes are sometimes funny and are nostalgic of the old films and from “Lego Star Wars the complete saga”. The Bad: There are a lot of flaws in this game. I recommend watching Doktor Skippers Critique video on the matter. However, to summarize how bad this game is, this is a short list.- Has zero replay ability - The Levels are all “start at point A and go to B” or boss fight- Some episodes have long, uninteresting levels that can put most people to sleep - Boss fights are unchallenging (like press a button and you win unchallenging)- Large cast of characters that are identical to each other (lacking uniqueness with the exemption of their class roles) - a lot of dead space between missions (ex. A lot of walking and doing nothing) - Level collectibles are uncreative and lack flair old lego games had when pursuing mini kits - Level challenges suck (You’ll just look up a video on how to do some of them, as they are either tedious or repetitive). - Over 1000 collectibles in a vast over world… but the majority share the exact same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ objective/instruction or ask the same premise. Seriously… why are there around 45 smuggle missions??- And lastly, a mountain full of bugs, glitches, and crashes.TLDR: Buy the complete saga instead… or Lego Star Wars 3 if it interests you. This game falsely advertises a bigger game. I can only recommend it if you are a diehard star wars fan and want to go insane doing the exact same task to obtain collectibles. Rate it 3/10"

The levels in the game are painfully short, like some can be beaten in under 5 minutes and they aren't very imaginative either. This isn't just compared with other Lego Star Wars games but almost every Lego TT game which always found ways of adding to a scene. There are also only 5 levels per film which wouldn't be bad if they were longer and didn't sometimes consist of a singular area, (yes really). I also went to replay a vehicle mission in free play (a space one), and it would not let me pick a different ship.Also, the story is quick and abrupt and has some weird changes, but I think this was partially Disney's standards and practises not letting some characters be killed and instead comically knocked out while Darth Maul gets hacked to pieces ( I know he lives in the clone wars but that’s not in the game)Then there's also the unnecessary additions of both shooter cover and melee combo trees. Enemies are so weak and easy to kill that it's more efficient to just shoot them. The combo trees feel like nothing more than an arbitrary attempt to make combat more interesting, but the game is so easy it doesn't matter. There's nothing wrong with the game being easy, it is after all, for really young kids but it renders these additions pointless, most children will also be able to figure out cover is useless. The bosses are really boring too, there's rarely if ever any puzzle element and just mash attack while occasionally dodging The open world segments are in fairness really good, one major positive about the skywalker saga is that it has one of the best Star Wars worlds to explore.  Even the sequels' worlds are fleshed out and are given new life.  It makes you want to explore them.  The open worlds consist of puzzles and quests to do and are lot are classic Lego puzzles with the twist that you can solve in a few more ways. Can't be bothered to stack all the boxes slowly? Stack destructible items and use them instead, can't use a scavenger with a glider yet? Fling another character with a force push and switch to them to get the kyber brick.  The quests are very simple, don't expect brilliant quest design there just another means to an end. While the open world segments may be good, don't expect the rewards to be. There are over 1000 kyber bricks in the game. 6 per level and others are rewards. After a while they are useless. Sure, you could upgrade your skills but after a few select ones there is no point, in fact it can be a detriment if you're trying to grind for studs via a combo meter. There is no real point in going for 100% unless you get the 100% reward (it's a pointless stud fountain, don’t bother) or the characters.The characters suck a bit too. There's classes for characters which isn't a bad thing but because of this there isn't much uniqueness to them. They use the same abilities. Even Jedi and Sith are disappointing, the only difference being a unique force grab and whatever upgrade paths they have. Abilities like force lighting are restricted to stupid combo trees, you can't just pull it out which might have actually added some more puzzle variety. I’m not expecting every character to be unique but the game is sorely lacking variety.The game is a chore to play IMO, like all Lego games can get tedious after a long session but every time I came back to play it wasn’t fun.It feels rushed; it was rushed despite delays. TT employees suffered major crunch because of bad and stupid management as feature creep set in. I would honestly love to see the state of this during its intended release. This game could have benefited from being more a sandbox like lego is supposed to be instead of a weird mashup of genres.While Custom characters are not everything, we know it was supposed to be in the game and it could have benefited from a ship builder too. I mean anything new and interesting do with those kyber bricks would have been great."

The original trilogy only came out 30 years ago, so I understand if you missed it.    On November 6, 2007, history was made — or, at least, my childhood was made, as  was released (jeez, fourteen and a half years ago). You’d be hard-pressed to find a child at the time that didn’t at least play a little bit of the game. So when  was announced, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it. And while my wallet whimpered a little at the $50 dollar price tag, I was still excited to give the game a whirl. As such, here’s my honest review.    This review comes from playing through about 50% of the story. The story is, predictably, a comedic retelling of the entire Star Wars main line of movies. It succeeds in its purpose, hitting all the comedic notes in a way that felt less outside my age range (looking at you, ) and more akin to the older style of visual comedy, with some casual one-liners to emphasize the point of it being a joke.     This is the part where I fully admit it. I don’t like the voice lines. All the characters feel like bad impressions of the actual cast. This was mitigated in 2007 by having the characters never voice any lines. That worked, and meant they had to get creative with how they told the big moments. With dialogue, not only are they less creative, it feels like they try to hit every single major quote in the scenes (there is an option to turn off the dialogue in favor of the usual mumbling they do, but the scenes are definitely built for dialogue and the mumbling only serves to take away from the delivery of the lines in favor of clinging stubbornly to nostalgia).     Maybe that’s nitpicking. After all, I am no longer in the target demographic (I’d imagine a 20-year-old isn’t exactly the model target audience for LEGO). However, I’ve mentioned the word “nostalgia” perhaps a little too much now, and that’s for good reason. I mentioned the mumble option earlier, but there are a multitude of quick nostalgia trips the game decides to take, which means they knew that people like me would be getting the game. As such, I reserve the right to criticize the game.    Another criticism I have — the menu is super cluttered. I open the pause menu to see where I have to go, and I have 5 different things screaming at me with yellow dots, signaling me that there’s something new to look at. It’s distracting, I was just trying to see the layout of Tatooine. Also, there’s an upgrade tree. That’s kinda weird. It’s not offensively bad, it’s just… there. And I don’t know how to feel about it.    I, very luckily indeed, haven’t really encountered too many glitches, at least not game-breaking ones. Except one. For whatever reason, if I hit Alt+Tab to say, check an email I got, for whatever reason, the game will completely refuse to open. It’ll bring up a black screen before booting me out again. I tried setting it to borderless windowed mode, but then it leaves the taskbar visible and cuts off the bottom of the screen. I gave up on playing the game once because of this. It happened multiple times, each time after I decided to check something using Alt+Tab.      I realize that the paragraphs above paint a perhaps negative picture of the game. This isn’t entirely my intention. I really like the game, I find that it keeps the charm that makes (almost) all LEGO games great. It’s oozing with enthusiasm to tell you Star Wars’s story the way only it can. And I honestly fully bought into that. At the end of the day, I couldn’t say this is a masterpiece of a game. Nor do I expect it to be a relic of people’s childhoods like was. But it’s a good game, it’s fun to play, and it tells the story in a new and interesting way. And honestly, what more is there to ask from a LEGO game?Was it worth the $50, though? Jury’s still out on that one. Maybe wait for it to go on sale before you buy it."

Keep in mind I have only played through the Original and Prequel Trilogy, as well as a couple side quests and open world exploration. I have not done any Sequel Trilogy content and i'm not sure I will for a while considering I don't really care too much about those films. I'm going to start off with the pros and then later talk about the cons.Pros:Cons:While it does look like the cons outweigh the pros here, I still had a really good time with this game and I'm looking forward to doing more open world elements and finding collectables. Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy was the very first PC game I ever played so playing through a modernised refresh was a fun nostalgia trip."

Story missions are really short, bland, and repetitive. I feel like they missed out on some great potential for some of the missions that involve a huge battlefield. It would have been cool to see missions like in Lego Star Wars 3 where you could run around on the battlefield command troops or use tanks or walkers to destroy enemy structures etc. a lot of side quests are the same and gets boring. Still no custom character building. I'd rather play LSW 3 than this."

Which I am not recieving even though I was promised it. this pack includes my favorite characters... Rex, Ventress, Savage Opress. Clone wars maul. The devs aren't to be trusted dont waste your money on this game the only enjoyable part was the original trilogy and the some of the prequel Missions.

There’s a lot of good nostalgia playing this game.  I remember playing these old lego games on my game cube and loving them.  This version however is a bit of a mixed bag.The good:• I actually liked the “open world” approach to this series as opposed to previous versions very linear style.• Lots of little quests, space battles and neat little puzzles to solve.• Lots of characters and ships to choose from in free play mode.• The story line is humorous (not haha funny, more dad joke funny).The bad:• 6 months later and there are still game breaking bugs.  My current game is stuck at 99.98% complete because one of the side quests is bugged and there is no way to reset it.  When I submitted the error I got a boiler plate response of “maybe we will fix it eventually”.  Pretty unacceptable for there to still be game breaking bugs 6 months after release.• Lots and lots of running around to different planets for quests.  You will spend the majority of your game-play running from one side of a map to another.Conclusion:I can’t recommend it until they fix some of these game breaking bugs.  If you’re a completionist and liked getting “100%” on previous versions, I would be wary about purchasing this version.  If you just want to play it for the corny story, you should be fine."

The game has some bugs (noteably 'The Missing Pieces' and 'The High Ground' softlocks), but it's absolutely incredible despite those. The combat feels fluid, the ship flying feels better than Battlefront (the good one, not the new one), and it really shows that new games can be better than the originals.

This game is just the goat at minute 1 to probably the end because I have barely even gone through the first episode. Compared to the previous entries this game offers so much more, and brings on more than how the complete saga ever brought to the table. To start this off the characters which in my opinion is one of the main things that truly makes a lego game show it’s colors. I just gotta say IT MAKES ME ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NUTT BRUH, like oh my lord bruh the character classes bring upon the most erotic fellow to you than almost lego games, but I don’t wanna say that fully since I haven’t really gone through the game. Then the combat for the game which I can describe of off three words. SMOKING SEXY STYLE. Like man if these motha ♥♥♥♥♥♥ would make a lego DMC game I would believe it because literally any character can just do air combos like it is just nothing bruh. All of the Jedi in this game play like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dante but on crack. However, I don’t know if there really is a Virgil yet but I will recommend on here if there is. Now when it comes to the episodes and cutscenes of the game I still haven’t gone through much, but man that ♥♥♥♥ be funny as hell. Definitely a lot of the dumb silly movie references sprinkled in there like it is god having diarrhea in the air(please don’t think the diarrhea analogy is a negative meant to be a positive). Now for some of the negatives that I have to unfortunately bring upon but are just little beta dumb cry baby cucky ones is that first the puzzles for each world can be a little repetitive. I can’t truly say this for sure, but for the areas I have played so far those puzzles are a little repetitive since it is kinda the same but can be fun depending on what you are doing. That basketball puzzle thing is some but tho like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also, another huge and unfortunate thing that idk if I get it later or not but there is not custom characters. If they are in the game then I will definitely reevaluate regarding that in my part 2 review. Other than that this game is a gift from god himself bruh, playing through it is like having one of his angels giving you brain every minute and second. This game will definitely give you more hair on your nuts than that other game that has to do with some dumb ass ring even though it is just about some yellow tree. That is all I have so far and part 2 will come when this game is hundoed. P.S: Any dumb jokes on here please don’t take serious you nimrods."

The vistas are breath-taking, sweeping, and gorgeous. The revamped combat system adds a level of franticness to fights. By all the parts separately and piecemeal, this should be a thing I really like. The inspirations and level design are clearly drawn from titles like the LEGO Ninjago Movie Video Game, and the more recent superhero games like Marvel 2 and DC Supervillains, especially the notion of hopping through a hub world and telling a story there as much as the story is told through levels.Unfortunately, due to things like ""running faster"" being upgrades, this slows down the pace of the story pretty significantly, with excellent voice acting in the hub worlds during the story missions (perhaps the best in any voice acted lego game, and yes, these are story missions, this is an open-world game now, I'm very frustrated by this but that's personal preference and thus not important to this review) being secondary to my frustration at having to play walking simulator. The vehicles in the hub world, like the Coruscant walker, are not meaningfully quicker than taking 2 levels of sprint, which is a horrible gamer-y thing to say about a LEGO game. There are other systems and mechanics to complain about, like the promising combat revamp (it's now a wasd-mouse title for non-controller players, wow!) and how it tends to make fights feel even less engaging. If you were bored by the superheroes games and how they approached fighting mechanically (visually fantastic and fun, really established character styles), it basically takes the very cool combo system from ninjago, adds the sponginess of the superhero games and adds some shooting to it, all to make a perfect storm of mechanical genius and gameplay mediocrity. I genuinely wish I had nicer things to say, because I've been excited for and evangelizing this game for months. I'll probably 100% it out of spite, and in the hopes that I adjust to all these details that I've been complaining about. If that's the case, and I end up liking this mechanically, I'll flip the thumb to positive then, and consider rewriting this wacky essay."

The Space Battles alone feels like you are back in Battle Front 1 (the newer one).

Like this was the most enjoyable playthrough.But it crashes and soft locks so often. The system requirements to run this is nuts. Elden Ring ran fine for me, but this messed me up.  Talk to an npc too soon, can't move and have to exit. Outrace an NPC, softlock. Move too far to the side in an on rail segment, softlock. There is something wrong with triggering cutscenes, spawning enemies, and starting characters speaking. My character will be locked so frequently."

I dont really know how to explain how i feel about it. There are very few building sections and puzzles are relegated to finding collectibles and not the actual story mode. it was really fun to explore an open world with star wars characters, but the maps and levels felt lacking. i enjoyed what i played but what i played felt like a collectathon with lego characters. swapping characters felt unnessecarliy difficult and tedious at times. overall, the game was fun, just not as a lego game."

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2020 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. We spent 7 hours on the game that night and we had killed the first 3 bosses. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

For example the entire battle of coruscant is skipped from revenge of the sith. If i didnt try to get true jedi or collect all of the minikits i was able to finish the phantom menace in 20 minutes. The comeplete sage was a much better game over all.

Here's why.Controls- It controls pretty good, although bit janky on whenever you swing pole to pole or on the little things (I forgo what they are called)Combat- It feels like babies first DMC, with all of the combos and sh*t like that. I find the combat fun and it does feel a little bit satisfying to pull off the combos.Quest Design- There's all kinds of quests in the game. Escort, Smuggling stuff to other planets, ect, ect. I find it completely garbage, since it repeats over and over again with nothing of value...and some of the sidequests are completely BS (see ""The Final Gonk"").Map/Level Design- The game follows a 5 level format, with 3 level challenges and 5 minikits to collect and some open world's stuff to do. The pacing of the levels are completely weird as they take 5-10 minutes (or longer if you're just messing around and trying to get the minikits), and some of the levels are on rails sections, meaning that there is no point of playing Freeplay. In fact, most of the levels don't really require freeplay to complete it, you can just be a Hero and grind for Villain costumes to put on, and you've already 100% the level. The open world sections are completely there just to pad out the story, so the episodes lasts only an hour and 30 minutes. One final thing, the fights between the Jedis and Siths are completely the same with no different movesets of how the siths fight.Graphics- I really like them! I think the models are completely superb, the environments look completely good too and I really like the details to some of the models. QTE's (Quick Time Events)- The game does have them, and there is literally no consequences for not pressing the button, because sometimes the game automatically does that for you, which I feel is completely lame. Like I get it, the game's for children, but at least have consequences of not pressing the required button. And spoilers btw!That's why the whole fight between Luke and Kylo Ren is really lame, because it's just a QTE mash. It makes sense why, but it just feels lame as hell.Voice Acting- I think it's fine for the most part, but does feel a bit off for the characters. Stability- The game runs fine, and is generally smooth. Unless you're in certain areas, that's when the game starts to dip to either 10 or 20 FPS...also expect random crashes. Oh, before I forget, USE BORDERLESS FOR YOUR GAME AND DONT ALT TAB IN FULLSCREEN Conclusion- That's pretty much it, also I couldn't 100% the game because some a**hole at WB thought it'd be a great idea to delay a patch to add in DLC characters, thank you WB. Love ya, as always LOL as for my rating for the game:5.5/10"

The only reason this game is open world is for the purpose of forcing you to spend time collecting items for the sake of upgrades, so you either spend 3/4 of your playtime ignoring the story and working on collectibles, or you just do the story and finish the game with almost nothing unlocked.

Wait for a discount.This is the type of game that makes me I wish Steam had a in between rating. So um, I will say I recommend it, but not at full price. The problem is that it's downgrade in alot of ways to the complete saga, for instance the hub world NPCs only have like two actions, walk and run away if attacked. At first I was ok with it since they were all defenseless citizens. That was until I realized almost every NPC in the hub areas are like that including Clone Troopers. Yes, the Republic's finest on Coruscant will run away at the first sight of danger. There are few exceptions where I came across some Storm Troopers in Cloud City, but that is rare sight. Not only that, but if you switch to a Dark Side character, the hub NPCs, other than a select few, will not react to you any differently, nor can you use dark side abilities on them. Sadly this game also suffers from game breaking bugs as well, which may have been fixed in patches, but I had problems with indefinite black screens during transitions causing me to restart the game again. Along with performance issues that cause the game to dip to down to 40 fps on a RTX 2060 and Ryzen 7 5800x. The graphics are improved, but not by that much that it should be causing performance in selects areas to go below 60 fps, even lower the settings does very little to help with it.The best change is the player combat and boss battles which I do feel are improved over the complete saga. Having the ability to use combos to earn studs, to aim a blaster and light saber throw, and use the force to manipulable objects in any direction you want is really good.Lastly the custom characters are removed which wouldn't have been a huge deal if the game was well refined, but it's not. The game itself lack so much polish that I really have a hard time forgiving removing such a key feature that was present in all other Lego games go back all the way to Lego Star Wars II while lacking the polish of those game. Keep in mind this isn't even the first open world Lego game, the DC and Marvel Lego games are also open world and have so much more polish and more interesting NPCs in the hub areas, which makes me wonder where all the development went into on this game, I can't imagine the player characters took so much effort to improve that all other aspects of the game suffered."

It took me give or take 2 hours to finish each episode from the saga. Someone might have done it quicker. So after losing the refund time, I thought I might as well carry on.The transitions between the episodes' stories got tiresome, walking from point A to B , click start mission. Which could have been solved using cut-scenes. Now the cut-scenes are badly placed and help remove fun. Could you have a space battle ? Yes we could've , did we get one ? No.  Episode 3 ‘s intro is a good example of this.  Sure you have 9 episodes to do and it would take longer, but it would be nice if missions weren’t watered down with cut-scenes. The good thing was the new mechanics of using a lightsaber differently, the P.O.V of aiming down sight, and characters having some unique skills. Though that isn't enough to make a game good.The games main focus was mostly making an open world filled with 1,166  ‘Kyber bricks’. To go and collect to upgrade your character's skill tree. Rather than the film's episode story.  Which i might end up doing if i'm  bored. If you want a good Lego Star Wars game I'd recommend the complete saga version."

It's a shame there isn't a photo mode, as it would be amazing to take pictures in this game.Unfortunately I found a negative point, at least for me, and for those who are going to use keyboard+mouse it will be a little difficult to get used to the controls. The game has very little options for customizing the hotkeys, there are certain actions I would like to do with other hotkeys, but the game prevents me from using repeated hotkeys of my choice. The game has hotkeys that allow for various actions but I would like to choose what those actions would be instead of being predefined, since a keyboard contains several keys I think it wouldn't be a problem to have more choices and freedom in customizing the hotkeys.The game's sensitivity is also too high, even using the mouse's lowest DPIs, I still don't feel comfortable with the speed of camera movement.This are minimal criticisms that may not affect many people, but if they are improved it would be great."

The new visuals and combat are a breath of fresh air and look and feel great, but the content is so lackluster that the visuals and combat are overshadowed completely. There are only five levels per movie, the longest one being maybe 15 minutes or so. Each level is the same sequence of watch a cutscene, fight some enemies, go here, fight some more, watch end cutscene. There are no fun puzzles like in other Lego games.The open world is where the bulk of the content is, if I can even call it that. Most of the missions require you to talk to a character, go fetch something, and come back. My only positive of the open world is the sheer size of it. Almost every important planet is available to explore.I have had fun playing it, but only in short bursts. It just doesn't have the same magic as any of the older Lego games."

Each character ranges from Jedi, Bounty Hunter, Villain, Sith, Hero, Dark Side, Astromech Droid, Protocol Droid and on top of having these different classes each class has an ability tree that you can level up and grinding towards these Kryber Bricks actually feels rewarding because you'll be needing them.  Some characters have combos that feel a lot like Dmc or Darksiders. There's so many different animations and moves to perform, one of my favorite being the Bounty Hunter that will jump up in the air and spin attack down. Open World: If anyone has ever played SWTOR this game gives off those vibes and it's fantastic to be able to explore the world at your own pace as the game presents it. As soon as I and my friend landed on the first planet we spent maybe the first 20-30 minutes just free roaming and gathering bricks and trying to do all these side quests before heading to the next mission. The galaxy map and the planets feel populated and breathing. There's tons of hidden things to find and backtracking to do at later times. (This which is very familiar to Lego games in general but still a blast to do) Characters: I can't confirm this because truthfully I haven't beaten the game, but from what I've read there are about 380 characters in the game. Now with that being said there are also a huge amount of vehicles to use and collect. (I'm just going to add that I am a veteran to Lego games and a huge fan of them. Just because there are 380+ characters and vehicles does not mean that 380 are going to act differently from one another, be aware that a lot of these characters will just feel reskinned from the last one and there will probably be about 20-30 dynamic characters.)  Alright well, I'm going to critique the game, and I am also going to nit pick here and there what I don't like and I'll be sure to label that.Story: This is Star Wars. There really isn't a ""wrong"" way of doing it but the game feels extremely lackluster and far too fast paced for the amount of delays and time we had to wait. Each chapter has 5 main missions, and each of those missions will last about 4-7 minutes long. I told my friend to finish the first movie and I'd catch up with her, and by tomorrow we could play the 2nd. Well I got on, and within 30 minutes I finished the first movie. There are so many scenes that feel left out, rushed, and simply altered to keep the comedy rolling every 4 seconds. I know Lego's have always had their way of being funny but a lot of this feels forced. For the amount of delays we had to wait it makes me question what was their focus? I'm going to assume the open world because that's massive. My gripe with this is just how much more impact other lego games have had with little to say in terms of dialogue.Voice(Nitpick): I personally don't like the voice acting for a lot of characters and a huge amount of them feel butchered. Playing LegoLOTR that used the movie audio felt bootleg and lazy, but it was a nice form of keeping the cast sounding original and sticking as close to the script as possible. Here a lot of characters have voices completely changed, altered, and a lot of it just doesn't roll with me. This is a new generation and I'm happy people will get to enjoy newer voices but a lot of the emotion was cut and left out from what the movies had already established.Multiplayer. OKAY HOW CAN YOU GUYS NOT ADD THIS? HOW!?!? LEGO WORLDS HAS MULTIPLAYER, YOU GUYS HAVE A LEGO MMO THAT SUPPORTS MULTIPLAYER, HOW DOES THIS GAME NOT HAVE A FUNCTIONING MULTIPLAYER DROP IN DROP OUT FEATURE? IT'S 2022 GET WITH THE PROGRAM! YOU DELAYED THE GAME 3 TIMES AND NO ONE THOUGHT ""hey we should probably add online multiplayer"" Character Creation(Nitpick): It's gone. That's all I have to say, it's gone. :( Can't kill kids(Nitpick): Why come?Minor bugs N glitches: Yea I've run into a few of these, non of them game breaking for me (my friend did have to restart her game twice I think?) But for me I've only had visual effects, some enemies that don't die, and weird clippings into walls. Overall fun game, going to continue to play and enjoy it, that's all I really have to say."

In previous games the game added more content around the movie however in the Skywalker Saga it's the opposite it tries to include a narrative but fails so hard due to levels squeezed to minimum. The older series offered much better way of storytelling - even though the characters never spoke a word the game conveyed storytelling via the body language of the characters which looked also very comical, however now they in addition to body gestures they also speak, which completely changes the atmosphere and now everything seems overly goofy.Levels have very poor content, the first level travels the same path and back, defeating 3-4 group of enemies on the way. Mini games which are just not even fun and serve 0 gameplay purpose other than that they are just there. In previous games they diversified the gameplay after a long tough fight or a platformer puzzles and elements which in the first 4 levels were not only simply not there but were strictly 1 dimensional.And a lot of complicated useless levels, UI elements and gameplay mechanics.The first game ever that I wanted to refund"

If it had any other style, realistic, cartoonish, whatever, it'd still be the same and maybe even better game. I played most of the LEGO games (some as a kid, some for the first time only recently). There are better and worse LEGO games. With each of them you can find something done well and something that could be better.Open World problems:-  Always feels empty. Sure, there are some NPCs and stuff to break, but the NPCs don't really amount to anything and stuff to break is scattered so loosely. Older games (at least most of them) had playable characters walking around the world making it feel more alive. Often fighting their enemies.-  There is no place that would feel like home. Re-playable levels:- Levels which was the main thing of every LEGO game just aren't a thing here. Sure, they are present in the game, but the story/the level is nothing. Tiny area with almost nothing to do. Only few of the levels have something to do in them.-  A lot of key story elements are missing within the game. They don't have any level or they're skipped and never mentioned.Boss battles:-  Not inventive. You have to smash buttons. That's it. Where are the battles when you had to use the stuff around you? Now you have to fight till enemy's healthbar gets down.-  Fixed camera. Fixed camera is great thing as long as it is optional or there is nothing to do or to explore. And even then, a lot of players don't like fixed camera.Health bar:-  Is it easier to know how much HP your enemies have? Yup.  But it's not cool while fighting boss. Where used to be scary amount of hearts now is just ordinary health bar. New ""leveling"" system:-  Interesting concept, terrible execution. Was there a need for it? No.  This system would be great for any other game. If this wasn't LEGO game trying to be typical LEGO game.Target audience:-  Is this game for toddlers? Or for more mature playerbase?  The game seems to not be sure either.  You can expect me to do elaborate stuff (which is fun on its own) or let the game be easy and fun.  You can't expect somebody to play this game with equal seriousness as while playing any other non-LEGO Star Wars game while he's being fed with 1 hundred millions of suggestions and hints as if the person who playes it was infant. Pick one, or let me disable all the hints.Storytelling/Humor/Mumbling:-  The main reason why all the old LEGO games were such a good games and made us laugh was in the was its story was told = without words.  Now it's just bland retelling of story with something that is not funny.-  Who are the jokes for?  Infants? Typical US citizen?  Most jokes aren't funny because they're so bland and obvious. The story is told with voice actor so people responsible for jokes no longer have to come with something creative. Characters:-  There is so many playable character that it's hard to pick which to play. And not because there is so many to chose from, but because the system (UI) sucks. It is cool to have them split into smaller groups, but changing the character is nightmare. Especialy in free play, it's not very good.-  You can play as Yaddle or even rodian dancer. Which is cool, but it's way less cool when you realize how many iconic characters is missing in the game - Seasee Tin, Agen Kolar or Stass Allie.-  Some characters got updated texture in comparison to their irl LEGO figures, while others didn't.

Missions are extremely rushed and can be finished on average in 10mins or less. several major story points are either outright skipped over or given a 20 second cutscene. i was impressed with how space battles and flight now handles, however there is virtually nothing to do in space aside from the few collectables at each planet. cutscenes make up more than half of the of the actual game. That is just an outright terrible decision in my opinion. ethere are zero puzzles, and every collectable can be acquired in the same way on every planet. why. I could barely play through the first six episodes, and that was simply to try and please my inner kid while holding out hope that it would get better as i played. I did not. Graphics do not make a game good, they merely add to the plethora of things needed to create a good game. nothing more needs to be said about that. characters with blaster serve no point aside from using them to get collectables, and they are otherwise unplayable on general occasion because you'll be better of playing with a jedi or other lightsaber wielder, and on that note even they are borderline unplayable because there are hardly in enemies in each mission, i mean like, 10-15, per mission, aside from certain boss battles. oh and about boss battles, they are all the same, i mean full blown copy and paste move sets, and they are not even a threat, because you can sit there and just through your saber at them because 90% of the time they dont know how to block it. Your multiplayer is utter trash and just does not work, I spent an hour with my brother trying to get remote play to work, but we had no luck. Overall I do not recomend getting this game, especially if you want the nostalgia of the older games. At that point, just buy the older games and replay them, because this game brings little to nothing to the table. I'd barely give the game a 3/10."

I played Lego Batman, Lego Lord of the Rings, Lego Indiana Jones, Lego Harry Potter, and Lego Clone Wars. I have not played any of the newer lego games, so I wasn't sure what to expect going into this game.I did not like this game very much. The world is very large and full of things, but none of it actually felt valuable. The missions are very short and void of any of the puzzles or big buildables that made the original games so good. Giant waypoints and arrows ruin the puzzle aspect even more. It feels like the developers focused so hard on the open world that they severely underdeveloped the missions. You can run around and talk to people and get sent on fetch quests, but it all just feels hollow and pointless. All of the characters and locations are really cool and fun to see, but ultimately it feels like most of the magic of the earlier games is gone.Also, there's no online co-op for some reason?

What I love about previous LEGO character is that you can unlock certain that can do an assortment of different things. In this game, you pick a single character from each character class and that's it. You can just use those exact same characters for the rest of the game, and sometimes you're forced to use the character in each mission from story mode during certain scenes, TT! MY BROTHERS IN CHRIST! I WANT TO FIGHT GRIEVOUS WITH A CHARACTER OF MY CHOOSING. THAT'S PART OF THE FUN! Yet you can't. Extremely disappoining.Speaking on the story levels, disgustingly disappointed. I genuinely had more fun in TCS. Where you can use fight the villains without being locked into non-free play characters, and the puzzles are unique, fresh and engaging. Most the puzzles in this game are repetitive, there is nothing unique about most of these levels, you will find yourself re-doing tasks from one mission to the next so much. Why is there so many space battles, for each planet, THERE'S NO POINT IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME! If they're all the same, have it for a few planets, no more no less. These missions aren't even fun.Non-Skippable cut-scenes, even during Free-Play. Never had this issue before, Free Play Missions before even used to just not have them at all, that's preferable and it makes sense. I'm not playing for the story anymore, discard those cut-scenes during free play.What I did like:The open worlds were engaging, large in scope and had unique puzzles and interesting quests, although they could be much and confusing at times.The combat is fun, it's probably an improvement on the mashing button of previous LEGO games, although I can't really say this isn't button mashing. There are some obnoxious parts to the combat, like the fact you can't block the main attacks, (that's the whole point of a block function, right?) Instead having to move out of the way of the attack. To conclude, I want the entire story missions to be revamped in the games to come to include unique puzzles, to be longer than 5 minutes and I'd like to see how characters are used within the games, their abilities, perks and powers to be completely re-done so that each character has a value within themselves, rather than a value as the category they are part of. I'd also like to see a lot more effort put into the story mode, replaying these weren't interesting, I wasn't going back in free play happy to finally be experiencing all the secrets I couldn't find in the story mode, it was a slog. A boring, repetitive, non-skippable cut-scene, unable to use my own characters during fights, slog."

All of the fun elements of the previous games (space combat, Death Star runs, playing scenes from the movies the way you want to, etc) are mostly missing. Large portions of combat are glossed over by cut scenes, which should and could have been lifted straight from the other recent Star Wars games. Wanted to help destroy Death Star II? Nope, can't. Wanted to destroy Starkiller base? Nope. You do at least get to do the trench run from Star Wars, but it's a brief bright spot.The weakest part of the game is Episodes 8 and 9, where not much at all happens. ""Your mission is to run over here."" Then cut scene, then ""Your mission is to run back where you came from!"". Then another cut scene. Would you like to gather clothes for Finn? Ever wanted to go to a casino in a Star Wars game? You're sure going to! Do you want to get inside the weaker plot points of Episodes 8 and 9 in great detail? No? Well, sorry, you will. And they drag on and on.And did you want to play as random background characters from these movies? You can! Remember that person...or alien, or whatever it is, that got trotted out in early footage from one of the films? They're here! And you can play the game as them! Isn't that exciting?! Most of the side characters are ""Hey, it's that guy"" material, padded out as ""achievements"".Challenges in space are sometimes confusing. You want to get that random character that was in the background? You gotta do this race/shooting challenge. The racing challenges in space are confusing, mostly because you have no idea where you need to advance to. It's just a bunch of green boxes in space with no pattern to them, isn't hurrying and getting frustrated by this race fun?Running/sprinting seems weird in this game. Why does it take so long to sprint? You can almost lose some of the running challenges because you can't sprint quicker. High points - - the datacards are a nice new way to get skills. The previous games was all about gold bricks, but now you've got to have the datacards plus studs. Nice new feature. - playing the game as Han Solo in carbonite? Amazing idea. Honestly. - the voice cast. Snagging original actors from the series, and animated series, is one of the greatest achievements of this gameBut, they don't offset how dull the game feels. Combat is slow, lightsaber combat feels like it takes forever, and after playing through the game once, I'm questioning going back in free play. Don't recommend. Better yet, buy the Clone Wars game. Way better than this."

The first ever franchise Lego game to release, way back in the mid-2000's. The first game I ever owned, on the first console I was trusted with alone. While some kids grew up playing Mario or Sonic, I grew up playing Lego Star Wars. First the originals, then the Complete Saga, The Clone Wars, and eventually even The Force Awakens, not to mention a plethora of games from other franchises. Star Wars was one of the subjects closest to my heart, so imagine my excitement when this game was announced.Then imagine my disappointment when it turned out to be a meaningless, hollow, unfulfilling experience.First, the positives:- . The detail that has gone onto making digital plastic bricks and minifigs is astounding, as other reviews will testify.- . For a game series known for its quirky humour, this entry is no different. While a large chunk of the comedy in the writing, animations, idle dialogue and collectables is ripped directly from r/prequelmemes, there are a handful of moments which legitimately made me laugh out loud. Even the prequel memes are entertaining to be fair, but they lose their charm after being played every two minutes for the 75 hours of playtime I have as of writing this review....And that's about it. For the cons, the list is longer:-. On paper having smaller, multi-route levels sounds like a wonderful modernisation of the Lego game franchise which allows creativity and problem solving to a greater extent. In reality, this as turned every level into a hollow, repetitive shell. 'Multiple paths through each area' becomes 'guess the fastest route to disappointment', as you work your way through waves of identical-in-all-but-appearance enemies before waltzing past puzzles even the children this game is made for would find effortless. Collecting minikits and completing challenges feels tedious and frustrating; . - , with no unique design features or mechanics. Lightsaber duels, which have been given a huge makeover from previous Lego entries, play exactly the same regardless of whichever iconic Start Wars villain you're duelling. In addition, combat feels no different or 'special' compared to fighting your bog-standard 'Joe Stormtrooper' from Sand-Covered Level #73. The biggest change between the two encounters is that boss fights have an irritating and inescapable forced camera perspective which makes the already-laborious effort of collectable hunting even more painful.-. Despite the numerous delays to this game's release to allow for bug-fixing, it still freezes, glitches out or crashes at least once per hour-or-so session. Some transitions appear worse for this than others, such as entering the Gungan City from Lake Paonga.-. Repetitive tasks and modern gaming seem to go hand-in-hand, and the prolonged enjoyment of the latter stems directly from the implementation of the former. Sadly, this game once again falls short. Of the 1166 Kyber Brick collectables in this game, 896 of them require performing the same half-dozen tasks at least twice per planet. Gathering them all becomes an exercise in stubbornness soon after taking any time to explore the galaxy. . - . Characters are grouped into one of ten classes, the members of which all behave (you guessed it) identically. There is nothing interesting about any of the playable characters. None have any advantages to any other. For instance, double-bladed, single-, and dual-wielded lightsabers all behave the same way with no changes to attack speed/radius/damage, despite a combat system which would fit this mechanic so well. Blasters behave the same way, regardless of if they're heavy repeaters, twin pistols or snipers. Simply put, there's no detail to any character beyond the aesthetic and when you quickly come to realise this it sucks out what little soul was left of an already-soulless game. The creation of this all-encompassing class system means there is an enormous class of characters called 'extras'. One may assume this class contains characters from niche media, spinoffs or jokes, but one would be wrong. This class - which is by far the largest in the game - holds every unique, niche, or distinct character which couldn't be shoehorned into the narrow confines of another class. This leaves even iconic characters such as Young Anakin Skywalker high-and-dry, in terms of usefulness.- A closely-related but distinct complaint is that any unique-ness which does exist for certain characters is either implemented awkwardly enough to seem like an accident or is entirely useless. For instance, Darth Vader can interact with 'Villain' panels but not 'Villain' crates, while the game doesn't consider any other Sith character to be villains at all. Many Mandalorian characters possess jetpacks, but can only hover for a second - too little time or distance to have ever been useful, when there is a class with a whopping ~10 characters () where 1/3rd of their usefulness is tied to gliding short distances.All in all, as much as I want to love this game, I can't. And Steam knows I've tried! I'm finishing this game, out of spite and solidarity for my younger self, but unlike all the other Lego games, I will then never play it again."

There are very few things I can complain about, and a huge amount of stuff I can only compliment. This review only focuses on the negatives of the game, so please be aware that while these are complaints, I still recommend this game!1. Co-op mode in this game is not optimal. You always have a split screen and can barely see anything because the fov is very zoomed in. So much so that it is hard to ignore and play the game normally.2. The levels themselves are very short. If you are not looking to 100% the levels then you can probably blast through one trilogy (if not even more) in one sitting. If you manage to not get distracted by anything, that is.3. It is oftentimes hard to distinguish between level and open-world. I find myself shooting at stuff first thing when I the story wants me to progress to a new area to collect some studs because the game does not indicate when a new level starts, nor does it have the stud bar or anything on screen until you actually collect your first studs. 4. After a while, collecting kyber crystals and characters becomes very repetitive. Which, given that there are over 1000 kybers and more than 300 characters in this game, was to be expected. But I have not even collected half of all collectibles and I am absolutely dreading 100% this game.However, this game has so much content outside the levels, has beautifully crafted planets to explore, and is so incredibly much fun to play, that I can only recommend this game. There are many games out there that cost more for far less content--and contrary to those games, this one is definitely worth your money."

I 100% the original games and I am more likely to dust off my complete saga for PS3 than play Skywalker Saga again any time soon. This game is not fun. In short, it feels like another product which seeks to exploit the nostalgia associated with a once successful brand. It became too much of a pattern by now, especially with Star Wars franchise. Technologically it's very rough around the edges, runs on a spaghetti code and is visually uncomfortable to the eyes (subjective).  3D models are gorgeous but overall impression is ruined by the overuse of awful graphic effects and art direction badly merging photorealism with LEGO bricks. Camera position and resulting field of vision isn't nice either.  The game is a definition of bloatware. From the beginning there are too many pointless and useless collectibles and nasty UI elements thrown in my face over substantial gameplay. The latter is extremely repetitive and trivial. It just feels worse and far less appealing compared to the originals. Missions are EXTREMELY short with more cut scenes than gameplay. You are expected to fly through them and then waste time on bloatware-style free roam. Being based on what essentially is a toy and being rated E is no excuse for lack of any challenge and difficulty options.  We all know that adults and young adults are the target audience of this game. Shallow variety added to combat is pointless as you can just go through the combat by spamming a single button in whatever manner you like. There is no satisfaction whatsoever. Story is told in an extremely condensed manner and lacks cohesion. In this case devs just used dialogue as an excuse not to show and just tell instead and it had a detrimental effect. Previous games just did it better despite not using a single line of dialogue. Humorous elements are poor and feel forced. Voice acting and actor choices can get very questionable at times.  I Can't recommend it for the price they ask. I'd actually recommend doing something more productive with your time than playing Skywalker Saga. This is a soulless husk made by the next generation of hacks who fundamentally do not understand the franchises they are working with and it became a common problem across all media. Due to refund time window I had limited opportunity to see more but I wouldn't be surprised if there were instances of blatant political virtue signalling of the modern age in a LEGO game; I just get that impression from the state of this product. Just another soulless corporate product for mass consumption before getting excited for the next product. You do you if you like it. I don't. And I love both LEGO and Star Wars but it's just becoming too much. I don't even come with any expectations when it comes to Star Wars stuff any more, hoping to get positively surprised but I am getting disappointed almost every time."

Other examples are the senate which only has the office of the supreme chancellor)- i havent been able to get capital ships to spawn (in free roam to unlock them) which is frustrating- ships are all practically the same (they all have the same max speed)- for some reason they took the thrusters off the astromechs- game is overfilled with npcs (for example at the lars homestead there are roaming idk how many people which makes no sense)- its filled with bad jokes that are often not funny and only a child would laugh at or jokes that only diehard fans that know everything about star wars would understand (i know this is a kids game but im sure that the majority of players is over the age of 14)- objective markers are confusing (points at one thing but youre supposed to do something at a different place)- i was dissapointed that places like varykino were left out of the game- only 5 missions per episode- kylo ren is even worse in this game than in the movies :/- a lot of the missions i was just waiting for it to end because it was just so boring (especially in the sequels)- you cant fly anywhere on coruscant (you need to take a taxi which has like 5 locations to which you can go to)overalli had fun with the game even though it has its flaws, i hope they add some clone wars stuff which everybody has been asking for  (just imagine if they take the stuff out of the comics or books that not everyone has seen on the tv show and has played in the previous clone wars games already).If you want to buy it, i would wait for a sale or get it on a key website for a cheaper price. I got the dlcs but they just give you characters so theyre not rly worth it. Im at 28 hours and i still need to complete the last episode of the sequels, so if you take your time and free roam a lot like i then this game can last you some time.I dont hate the game, Its just pretty dissapointing after getting my hopes up after seeing the trailers and teasers about it"

The ""hub world"" is gone and now you have multiple roaming areas you can travel to as you progress through the story. The new perspective being over the shoulder makes it easier to aim with blaster characters but it can be too zoomed in at times and when riding animals it is too close to the screen. The fighting mechanics have expanded, however, along with the addition of skill trees.If you play on borderless window mode then the next time you boot the game up it will not be cropped right and your taskbar will overlap with the game, so you need to reset the settings. If you play on full screen then alt tabbing back and forth can cause the game to enter weird resolution settings. No true online coop mode is unfortunate, but you can still coop with share-play but the screen real estate gets tight. Visuals are nice, but there are very few settings for adjusting the graphics in game. Music has the usual classics from the franchise and the story is told in a slightly different way with unique jokes and writing. Overall, the massive content available justifies the price."

This game is very feature rich, and the sense of humour is charming and silly as always. The time I've spent with this game so far has been extremely satisfying in terms of the gameplay, the way the episodes play out and the free roam aspect of the game, allowing you to essentially do free play at any point. However it is a much better experience to play through the story and then start unlocking the bonuses, as you'll be more than equipped to max out certain upgrades and continue having a killer time getting all the collectables. It's just overall a very fun, addicting time and I am definitely getting my lego star wars fill with this."

The levels do not have the creative puzzle solving/building that previous lego star wars games had. in the entire episode I built maybe 3 things. Voice acting was decent but were edited together at an unnaturally fast pace. Oh and the best level of the episode was ripped verbatim from the past games (the podrace level).

Buy Easier does not mean better, the gun combat within the Skywalker Saga gets boring after a few encounters and so do the Duels. Is repetitive with no variation. Same with the Puzzles within the game most of the Lego Charm outside of cut sense has gone. For an Example in the Cloud city level where your escaping, has a whopping 2 puzzles within it, with one of them Grappling something and shooting then the next is killing an enemy to drop a key-card. You don't even need to kill one enemy after getting the key-card to complete the level you can run though the entire thing and the last part just wait for Chewie to fix the falcon. And dont even get me started on Character Variation, cus let me tell you there is none.In conclusion I would say is a mind numbing game with the Lego Charm Removed.

While a revision of the series shouldn't copy everything from the original, I feel like the levels don't pay respect to the ones in the older game.If you are someone who just wants a LEGO game experience and loves Star Wars, this game is still a no-brainer!

(i bet the biggest level was about 7-8 mins, they're all short). Well, this is a full remake of the original LEGO game, all missions have been remade, and most of them were cut, some missions like the rescue of amidala, or even other missions are completly gone, replaced by cutscenes and just walking from point a to point b, which is extremely sad, especially for such a star wars fan like me.All is not bad, from the cut missions from the new voice acting (yes, not the original act). The gameplay has completly been changed, now you can do a lot of new stuff that enchances the experience in a whole new diferent way, it feels like a LEGO game inside a action movie and i love that part. That being said you can now:-> throw your lightsaber-> throw objects against enemies-> use special attacks-> dodge attacks-> counter-bulletsAlso there is a new sandbox style of world which feels ok, since most areas have beautiful visuals, but side quests still feel very meh and barely any sense in them. Anyways, you can also fly ships across the galaxy, thing that feels OK, because just OK... Because, well, you can only travel extremely short distances, ship battles are extremely fun though.I bought this game to play with my wife, we had a lot of fun, but sadly, like i previously said, all levels feel short.Also, split camera is worse than ever. Usually, there was just 1 screen when players were close to each other, now, no matter what distance you are from your partner, there is always 2 cameras, which is hard for exploration and in some combat situations, over the shoulder camera tho is fantastic, since you can now shoot rifles like a true shooter.All in all, it is a great star wars game, but compared to some other LEGO games, especially the original one, it feels short, in 2022 i was expecting a longer game with a lot of dedication, and i paid for a game that was cut in a half, feels like they wanted to rush for a faster release. I dont care of cutscenes replacing missions, i want a full game. I still recommend this game, but for an extremely low price. A tenner, nothing more, nothing less.unplayable, enemy is a bullet sponge, flies through buildings, lost half health after 15 minutes.SOLUTION: turning auto aim on, takes exactly the same damage in less than a minute.At some point in this mission there is some sort of optimization bug, i went from 150 fps to a low 15 for about 3 constant minutes without ever going back to normal.May the force be with you! [small edit]: what is impressive about this lego title is that they built every single scene from scratch, wide open detailed areas, and i appreciate that, but all of them are not used as they should as every mission is short and takes very little time to complete. Other thing that i also appreciate is the ship battles, most are epic and take place in wide space places, but falls short as most become repetitive and you're not as free to fly as other star wars games and other lego games. I hate that they turn it into an rpg open world, because most side quests are take this, deliver to this place and thats it, so much missed potential. LEGO star wars complete saga is the best lego game ever and the best lego star wars game still, this one is not a bad game, but not as good, not even close, id rather have a linear star wars game with long missions rather than explore skywalker saga. even though it builds a fantastic star wars universe."

For anyone who knows how the combat is in every other lego game you have usually 4 or so hearts and each kick, punch, bullet and so on takes 1 heart. Here it's very different, having different health bars instead of individual hearts, you can choose to have health regen or having to pick up hearts to get hearts back, there are different classes essentially that has different weapons and abilities, move sets just all of it is just so different and i honestly like it a lot.There are tons of small details that make this game just so much greater than it already is, I can't remember all of the ones i found but again i remember seeing them and thinking it's great of them to add in such small stuff for those who know either if it was Star Wars or Lego related. Like different soldiers have helmets covering them and you can pop them off, if it's a clone they're all the same but if they're stormtroopers for example they look different with many different faces and hair. Of course The Star Wars story is great and cause first of all it is in a lego style it cuts down to more bit sized and also adds lots of comedic stuff into it, I feel as though cutting it down to make a 9 movie story play out. I can understand that it is necessary to leave out some stuff to make it not take too long to get through the story, but also in some places it left out crucial stuff that then made some missions not seem like they had as much impact or meaning. One thing I thought was kind of sad but can understand is that many of the voices I associate with certain characters weren't there, don't get me wrong the voice acting in this game is fantastic. Just wish for such a big game that they would have original voices for some of the characters even tho as the game progressed i didn't mind all that much.I know many might see this game as a kids game but still a lot of refrences and such that are more pointed towards adults, so leaving in some more serious points wouldn't be all that bad when it comes to actually showing the story of Star Wars in this more easy fun style!I really like the way they had you be able to fly to many different planets to both explore and do more missions and such in, there are tons of stuff to do, that can stretch from just fetching items to multiple missions with same quest giver or something that tells a longer tale, that in turn spruces up the world more.Any game no matter how much you tweak and fix it is always gonna have bugs and glitches, I can't say i have encountered many, of course all lego games have a bit of jank to them so that's to be expected. I had one bug where all character models were just gone except hair/head and weapon, of course it was a fun one to begin with seeing main menu with half weapons and such but not really many characters, this was kind of game breaking as i couldn't do certain actions but had to turn off and on it again to fix.Second big issue i had which ALWAYS occured in every gaming session was suddenly the screens would flicker a bit, and i would notice my night light which i like to have on was off, if i was watching stream through discord it would freeze the whole discord and Nvidia overlay just didnt wanna pop up anymore so have to restart pc after playing for that to work and restard discord for that to work properly.I could go on and on about how great it is and the issues it also has, but overall i'd say again this is a great game I love lego games and I love Star Wars so I am biased there, but I really like how open it is and fun side missions and quirks to main story too, but of course sometimes so much can be bad when first starting it can be jarring to see how much there is to do if you are completionist at times like me. Love how everything just fits so good together and i do highly recomend this game to any casual gamers who wants to play a good lego game, thank you for reading and hope this helps in deciding if you want to buy the game if you even read all of it. :)"

I think the best thing about it is that it's an entirely new experience as far as Lego Star Wars is concerned. You could still easily go back and play the Complete Saga, and I think that's great. There's a bigger focus in this game on open world as opposed to the mission based structure of the originals, which is a positive for me, since I enjoy running around and collecting stuff.Honestly my only gripes with the game is that it can be a bit blurry at times. I don't know if it's a depth of field thing (there's no option for it in the settings) or if it's some kind of adaptive resolution scaling to keep a solid 60 (which if it is, it's working since I've had no frame drops at all) though I've heard you can edit some text files to potentially fix this. The menu can also feel a bit clunky a times, but it's probably cause I'm not used to it yet."

My major problems (as a mega lover of all other Lego games, no matter how old I get lmao:1. The UI. Oh boy. It is Ubisoft on steroids. The UI is bad. Really, really bad - insanely intrusive, and takes up a ton of screen space telling you useless information and controls you never need to see after the very first time. The tutorial of this game NEVER ENDS. 2. The bugs. Within my first 15minutes of playing, I got an infinite black screen transitioning from a cutscene. Restart the entire game / mission. Same thing happened a few missions later. That was my point of refund. 3. The fun. I really don't know what it is about it - it just lost that ""thing"". I don't know if it's the UI, or the story/mission structure, or what. I can fire up age-old entries to the series and be instantly blindly entertained. Just not here - it is too.... ""modern"", and this does not fit the essence of what this game was/is. 4. The story structure. I miss the old hub-areas of going into a door and loading a level instance. The missions blending into the Hub world feel awkward, like a chore, and never live up to the separate instanced-levels. Also, the tutorial never ends, so be ready to have your hand held the ENTIRE GAME - even turning hints off.5. The voices.... okay - look, its an awesome idea - but it does not fit in a lego game. Not like this. The animations telling the story was what added to the comedy. Now, you have MASSIVE, non-toggle-able CAPTIONS taking over the entire bottom half of your screen in every cut-scene. Not only this, but they commit two CARDINAL sins in 2022: Black bars, mixed with MASSIVE closed-captions, with an EVEN BIGGER background on the text. It is insanely distracting, and you'll be forcefully reading captions instead of watching the scene 99% of the time - this is how the brain works. If they update to:A.) Disable UI elements - like, literally, ALL UI elements, PERFECT.B.) Disable tutorial elements / help messages / control overlays - PERFECT.C.) Disable Closed Captions - MEGA PERFECT.It's a shame. Cause I'm sure it's a fun game and having a billion things to collect and 20+ planets to explore is literally my thing. But A, B, and C make sure I will never, ever enjoy the actual gameplay - it is too distracting, unimmersive, and guided - basically, it is a nonstop reminder that I am a young adult playing a Lego game - I'm trying to forget this lol"

It can be buggy, though it makes up for it.First off, this game is so close to being a masterpiece. Lego's flavour to the star wars universe has always been amazing, and it is in this. Compared to the older ones it's reinvented the wheel, giving a lot of space to touch on the lore of star wars while keeping it light and wholesome.The change to classes was executed great while at the same time making every individual unique in that class, and as a plus if you switch to a character and there is already a character related in the lore. You get a line of dialogue.The Lego flavour to the story is at it's peak, it's been done very well, while not 100% faithful, it's easy to follow and funny at the same time.The gameplay is what you would expect, but with an added combo mechanic for combat, which really changes up how you play those with lightsabers and a few others. It's unique enough and easy enough that it doesn't feel sluggish or invasive. The puzzles are nice, but while going for completionism you see them reusing a lot of puzzle and the later it goes, the less inventive they get with their names for the puzzles, (I guess the juices run dry when you have to name 1200 puzzles). In the end it is really fun and engaging.Here is where it falls short of being a masterpiece. The bugs. While not noticeable if you just do the main story with a little side stuff, while going for 100% it gets frustrating. There have been times where it softlocks from a brick which requires a game restart or if you're lucky a zone refresh but sometimes it straight up crashes. Minor bugs are there and ai freaking out. While this could be a deal breaker for a lot, the rest of the game is magnificent and is worth your time."

The levels for the prequels are short, misused and have rushed cutscenes. Additionally, the developers decided to miss crucial moments in some of the films, such as the Battle of Geonosis in Episode II (every moment builds up to that battle), which I think is due to the developers not wanting to depict war and death in a LEGO game. I found that decision to be particularly disappointing because I adore the Clone War era (pivotal moment that started it was left out), and the front cover literally depicts the Battle of Geonosis.As for the combat, it feels very satisfying, whether you are using a lightsaber or blaster. The only problem is that it is heavily underused, since levels primarily require you to do repetitive side quests and hilariously easy puzzles. These problems were absent in the Complete Saga, which also had more complicated puzzles that I was able to do as a child.Overall, this game is really not for the prequel fans, as the levels are poorly designed and focus on the worst moments of the films. Hopefully, the upcoming news for this game will be TT addressing this issue, where they add more levels for the specified era."

There's no online multiplayer like the complete saga, and freeplay boss fights don't even work, like you HAVE to play as a certain character even though it states ""FREE PLAY"".

Not only that there's no real difficulty if you play co-op, you can just spam certain bosses and they go down wayyy faster than in just singleplayer. It's still a good game on its own, but it doesn't feel like it was made with co-op in mind at ALL (mind you lego games are primarily based on cooperative play, or have been for quite some time.)so i've changed my rating:single-player: 9/10co-op: 6-7/10"

Humour is forced into every cutscene which for me is not something i want. All the bossfights are very similar to eachother except the episode IX Palpatine in which you have to just smash buttons.

Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things. If that’s the case, then all Jedi should probably cancel their preorders for LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, since this dazzling new entry in Traveller’s Tales’ longrunning LEGO game series has brought both adventure and excitement by the plastic bucketload. With stunning set pieces cribbed from all nine mainline Star Wars films and a surprisingly vast number of iconic planet hubs to freely explore in between, The Skywalker Saga is a brick-breaking blockbuster executed with a goofy charm that had me feeling as happy as a droid in a hot oil bath.In a dramatic departure from the zoomed out camera perspective of previous LEGO titles, The Skywalker Saga features a tighter, over-the-shoulder third-person view typical of the likes of GTA or Uncharted, and it brings along with it far greater control over your attacks. Lightsabers can be boomeranged and crates can be Force-pushed with satisfying precision, and a simple combo system allows you to launch enemies into the air for a juggling volley of saber swings with ease. Fighting as a Jedi or Sith might not have the depth of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but it’s nonetheless fast, fluid, and it feels fantastic.If you’re controlling a character equipped with a blaster, you now have the option of taking cover behind walls and other objects to pick your foes off from afar, and can switch between cover positions with the tap of the button. (A similar cover-based mechanic was featured in 2016's LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but only in specific sections of a level). I love the neat touch atop this system that you’re able to quickly rebuild destroyed cover (as can enemies), but outside of a couple of specific boss fights I hardly ever felt the need to actually shelter behind anything. In The Skywalker Saga, the combination of a constantly recharging health bar and the authentic inaccuracy of each Stormtrooper’s shots meant there was rarely any risk in taking a run and gun approach. I certainly still enjoyed the gunplay in The Skywalker Saga, but more for its flashy spectacle than its shallow attempts at strategy.Not only does the new close-up perspective make you feel more engrossed in the action, it also leads to a greater appreciation of how realistically rendered each individual LEGO brick is. With the paint on minifigs chipping away convincingly after extended use as though they’re a much-loved toy. Absolutely every LEGO creation looks so uncannily true to life, that when you blast an immaculately assembled 1000-piece Tie Fighter out of the sky, you can almost hear the cries of anguish from the parents who spent their whole Sunday afternoon helping their kid build it.The mission variety was very engaging too. The 45 main story levels constantly switch things up so that the action never grows stale. The Skywalker Saga is capable of delivering mindless carnage on a massive scale, like when The Battle of Naboo briefly blossoms into a thrilling game of tower defense, and you gleefully lob balls of energy from Gungan catapults to decimate hordes of Trade Federation droids and assault tanks. Yet it can also be more focused and cerebral, such as when Rey enters the mirror cave on Temple Island, and you carefully puppeteer her reflections in order to reach exit portal switches.Of course, and The Skywalker Saga does indeed feature levels designed around high-speed podracing, X-Wing trench runs and all the major lightsaber duels you’d expect. But even at its most familiar moments, the campaign is still a blast to play because it feels so smooth and is such an eye-popping sight to behold. The only occasional catch is that its strict adherence to a cinematic style of presentation can come across as a bit too rigid at times. In one of the boss fights against Kylo Ren, for instance, I’d whittled his health bar down to zero, yet the fight arbitrarily continued for another minute, all so I could button-mash my way through the remaining quicktime events.Each story mission is connected by surprisingly sizable hub areas situated on some 20-odd different planets, from the sandswept streets of Mos Eisley on Tatooine to the polished surfaces of Coruscant's Financial District, and everywhere in between. These open areas are absolutely rife with hidden Kyber bricks to collect by solving various environmental puzzles, and while you do see some repeated challenges across the galaxy there are plenty of other fun little surprises to stumble upon along the way. I particularly enjoyed the Lemmings-inspired challenge on Kamino that tasked me with adjusting a series of platforms to prevent a hapless clone from shuffling to his doom, or arranging a choir of Wookiees on Kashyyyk to angrily yawn a rendition of John Williams’ signature score.And if you get tired of exploring and action-platforming your way across the wealth of planets, you can always just pick your favorite starship and jet up into orbit for some impromptu dogfighting. There really is a staggering amount to do in The Skywalker Saga.TL;DR: 7/10"

I bought this game expecting it to be like it's predecessor. I was wrong.Walking in an empty sandbox listening to dialogue from the lego characters is so lame, gone are the times of actually feeling like you are in each episode of Star Wars. I feel no dialogue in the original lego game did the game very well, as you didn't need someone talking to understand what is going on. Don't get me started on the most recent Disney Star Wars lego segment in this game, just playing through it feels worse than torture. I feel that segment in this game is by far the worst one, as it just tries so hard to make you enjoy the characters to make up for how much of a mess the films were. I want to puke when I see Rey standing at the title screen each and every time, acting like as if she is the reason Star Wars was good; which is not true by a landslide. I love the prologue and the original Star Wars episodes, not the new ones. Idk how Disney just expects you to get attached to some random characters they poorly slapped into the series. I mean the lore for Disney's Star Wars is an absolute joke, it's literally just a repeat of the original trilogy with even worse characters. Overall, the game is mediocre and boring. Don't play the Disney Star Wars trilogy part of the game unless you want to be tortured, just play the first 2 trilogies if for some reason you REALLY want this mediocre game, and I recommend you get it on a steal of a deal of a price when it's on sale. Who wants to pay the full price for a mediocre experience?! If you haven't played the original for some reason though, skip this game, it's not worth your time. Go play the original Lego Starwars, it's really good."

Very fun, and let's the imagination run wild. My only complaint: no in-game character creator. LEGO games should all have this, it should be always be included.

The amount of puzzles, collectibles, side missions, and challenges is astounding. Sure, many of these are just filler—repetitive, menial tasks—but a surprising number is delightful and satisfying. And even the menial tasks can be enjoyed for the journey itself. It's nice to just spend time in this wacky, beautiful game world. I only really started to get tired of it when I approached 80 hours of game time.It's indeed remarkably beautiful. You would think there's not much potential in brightly colored LEGO blocks, but here they are placed in realistic terrains, and even the blocks make use of superb lighting and material effects. You really need to experience this game in HDR if you can, as the implementation is often breathtaking.It's not all gravy, though. The UI is very cumbersome. The controls and camera usually work well, but they can become frustrating in puzzles that require precision 3D platforming and/or speed. Load screens between planets are long, which is very annoying when working through the many multi-planetary side missions. It's also just ...  easy. If you understand how the in-game ""money"" system works, you can early on become rich enough that you don't have to think about it anymore. And combat is so trivial that it's likely you will never die. Indeed, weapon upgrades are unnecessary for survival, they'll just make encounters end sooner. Finally, the mission tracker turns most missions into brainless follow-the-blue-light experiences. That said, I did enjoy the many puzzles, which require some logical thinking and observation skills. I really wish the game focused more on puzzles than combat.But what I  wish for is a challenging, serious Star Wars open-world RPG with the scope and beauty of this game. Still, this game scratches some of that itch as it's loyal, in its own way, to the Star Wars universe and its tone. And it's also loyal to LEGO. It's very funny, very lighthearted, and very easy. If you come into it with the right attitude it can be a good time for many hours."

Is fantastic.

While the missions that correspond to the episodes are quite short and incredibly easy, there's a HUGE amount of content in the open-world planets. So if you're cool with exploring and messing around a ton over following an actual story line, this game is for you. But even still it's just amazing."

Add the ability to have more than two characters in your party. It is frustrating to switch characters using the D-pad all the time. Plus you cannot make a Clone or Gonk Army! 2.

This is a vastly different game that plays like a mix between other modern LEGO titles but with Mario Odyssey/Scribblenauts-style open world missions. If you bring an open mind, this game can definitely hit that childlike joy. I will add that this game is incredibly easy, but you can be extra and combo enemies or use creative means to kill them such as throwing objects and mind controlling. The game is also mostly stable and finished on release, which in today's industry is refreshing. I look forward to finishing my 100% saves on both Complete Saga and Skywalker Saga.To me, deluxe is worth it. I also used a third-party to buy my key, so the price was comparable to the standard edition here.Here are my 2 complaints/suggestions: 1. There are no custom characters like in complete saga, and I really hope they add them. I unironically think this is the best game to explore the SW galaxy, and it would be even better if you could play as your avatar. I also think that LEGO of all franchises not providing custom characters is a tad ironic.2. When your sprint is upgraded, you move really fast. I love that. What I don't love as much is that if you jump while sprinting, you lose all momentum. I'm a person who spams jump while I'm walking around and I would like to just yeet myself, but alas I cannot."

Although this game is missing a few characters that I hope they add in upcoming DLC, the roster is very good and characters even have their own classes now. As for custom characters not being a feature in this installment is very disappointing but there is plenty of content to make up for it. I love the new combat system it's absolutely amazing combined with the new over the shoulder camera angle. Don't get me started on the open galaxy concept. There is such a wide spread of ship it's so hard to pick one. AND THE FACT YOU CAN OWN A CAPITAL SHIP! Incredible. I only wish that there were some light side capital ships. Maybe a Venator-class Star Destroyer from the clone wars, or a rebel EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate would be nice. Overall great game. Simply a classic."

Although I dont want to get into many spoilers, I will give an example since most people that buy this game have already seen the movies: In the fight against Darth Maul, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon take down Maul together and then Qui-Gon dies comedically to a cut in half Maul. But in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, it stays true to the story and Obi-Wan has to finish off Maul himself with that final jump move out of the pit and then rushes to Qui-Gons last words. I know it is very nit-picky of me to make a complaint out of something like that, but I just felt like it was worth pointing out. Nevertheless, the game is phenomenal and I highly recommend it to those who have kids/friends/family to play it with, those who want some childhood nostalgia, or just any Star Wars fan since this is going down as one of the best."

I'm now at 99.5% and I have to find the wandering Wookiee 13 more times. The problem is that I have already visited the remaining positions that the mission shows me and talked to the Wookiee. But that apparently didn't count. If I now return to these positions, I can no longer find a Wookiee, because I have already found him and talked to him. So I can't complete the game and get stuck at 99.5%.Very, very sad that such a game breaking bug occurs in a 60 Euro title."

This is not a remaster, it is a whole new remake. Having multiple returning Clone Wars voice actors (Tom Kane, Matt Lanter, Dee Bradley Baker, James Arnold Taylor) really helps the voice acting along. The traditional pseudoslapstick of TT games is back in a less overstated way, and there are lots of little easter eggs all over to satisfy even the most eagle-eyed fan."

Makes me think of my childhood playing The Complete Saga and I am not let down by this sat all. If relaxing LEGO games and/or Star Wars are your thing you have to play this game. Can`t wait for future DLC packs to see what we get, the attention to detail is amazing. The character interactions are so perfect when idle. Completely love what they have done with the large flagships (you`ll find out when you play) adds such a new fun layer to the game that we haven`t seen before.The fact we actually have decent sized areas of 33 different planets to free roam and break and loot is awesome, so much more to do than ever before.Just wish I could get the republic gunship, But maybe a future dlc.Absolutely 10/10 to the people at TT games they have outdone them selves with this one.(Will be updating if I find more to say)"

I was very hyped about it- as I grew up with the LEGO Star Wars game, and had a great time exploring the star wars universe.At the time of my review, I just completed episode IV. And to summarize:The story gets squashed and cuts at a random paze. And they try to throw in some comedy elements. But I think the attempt at trying to tell the shove the major plot points and twists into 3 voicelines just ♥♥♥♥♥ up the pace of the game.Game mechanics:As a game developer myself, it's also sad to see some overall bad game mechanics. - UI text boxes flickers on the screen, and text can flash on screen before it should. - The camera is way too far panned in when riding animals, which makes it very awkward to move around- In general, the controls just doesn't feel good to use. Maybe I'm just sensitive to doing shooting with a controller, but it was not a smooth experience. I tried doing shooting with a keyboard, and that worked better than on the controller. But I didn't enjoy the other controls on the keyboard. In the end I just preferred doing melee attacks with a controller. And it sucks that you have to change your playstyle because the controls are bad.The whole game seems almost overengineered in a way. But also underdeveloped at the same time? It's a weird combo.I have to say I went into this experience with some hope of having a nostalgic experience. And I am. But mostly just getting the urge to playing the original LEGO Star Wars game.That said, I will continue playing the game some more. Just to satisfy my inner child. As I did pay a bunch for it. But I will continue to cringe at the screen and not the smoothest game experience. I also did have a great hope to play this LEGO game with friends, but I don't have the heart to share this experience with someone.It's a 6/10 for me."

At this point in time it's left a far better impression than most other Star Wars games despite its friendly appearance. I'm also pretty sure that the devs also visited r/prequelmemes a few times with the interactions many characters have while idle and swapping.It's no secret the Travellers Tales studio and its Devs went through hell while making this game, and to all those working at TT still and those who left, if this is your legacy let it be known as your greatest treasure. There is more love and commitment in this Star Wars game than any other. Anyone who plays and explores this game will come across this love, this understanding, these devs are also fans of the same franchise, not EA bots chugging out a game to sell a P2W experience for money and short term gain. I wish all those in TT both current and past a great future, you blew my mind with the Original Trilogy game, showed your love with The Lord Of The Rings, your passion with Indiana Jones, and mastered your very own identity with this game, Thank you for all the joy you have brought to me ever since I was a kidFrom the bottom of my heart, I wish you all the best"

There is a lot to collect, things to discover, which makes it more interesting and gives you a sense of accomplishment, especially when you figure out the puzzles. I love the fact that the game made fun of that purple haired admiral from the movie, and there are a few other points where the game pokes fun at the lack of originality of episodes 7-9.
