Up till the 2K launcher was in place the game was stable and I never had any issue with mods. Now the game consistently CTD and when it does load, will not load a saved game. 2K ask that players uninstall the game, clean all the related files from their pc and reinstall. Thanks. Proof that you don't care and the uninstall exe isn't optimised to clean the registry and hd properly. All so 2K can data mine you. This is just unacceptable and anti-consumer.

They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. As such, I can NOT recommend this game. To verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. Then I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).Then, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. This is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. Steam should be reigning in this behavior as well."

Some observations about this game as it stands alone, now that the adjustment period from Civ V is out of the way: - AI's military tactics are still extremely weak. It does not assemble its units for advantage, attack when it has the advantage, or defend its cities effectively. You'd think a fundamental goal for any game like this would be to have fronts naturally develop, as in a real-life war. Nope. Scattered, random skirmishes that the AI always loses. You can run the map with 1-2 infantry or cavalry units, plus 1 artillery. - Diplomacy mechanics bring nothing to the game. If you so much as defend yourself or retaliate against an aggressor, as one does in war, you're branded a warmonger. Were the Allies warmongers in WWII for conquering Germany? Leaders relentlessly spam you with their disapproval, consuming ridiculous numbers of UI-animation seconds before you can esc/cancel with each one. Despite claims that leaders approve of certain things, it seems to be an either/or, all-or-nothing, hair-trigger mechanism. A leader will love you one turn and denounce you the next, because they expected you to have one more military unit that turn or something. There is no nuance, spectrum, or ""scoring"" to this system, as far as I can tell, contrary to the claim that there are several levels between ""friendly"" and ""denounced."" It's a waste of effort to try to get along with everyone while trying to win a science or cultural victory. Just let them inevitably declare war and fight them off. - Firaxis has figured out how to make leader interactions annoy you further and waste even more of your time. Clearly, you want to be spammed with an inconsequential 30-second message for ""good job"" ""or ""I hate you"" several times each turn - often interrupting your next click - and wait an additional several seconds for it to respond to multiple Esc presses. - The AI engine is SLOW. I've played on an i7-5930k and an i7-6850k, and on both, it takes up to a minute to process AI turns in late game. I think most hours spent playing this game are for the ""please wait"" stage. Why Firaxis cannot take advantage of parallel processing, or cache possible scenarios in advance while you're taking your turn, I do not know. There should at least be an option (or default) where other player moves have faster animations so that you can see what's happening without losing time, without making all the animations bizarrely short like in quick combat. - The lack of automated builders brings more tedium to the game than it does craftsmanship. In late game, I really no longer care about the details of each city; there are no real mistakes to be made, and I do not want to micromanage every single tile of every single city on a standard to huge map. Keeping the charge mechanic on builders, but adding an option to automate (or making it a technology, like a ""self-reliance"" civic) would probably still encourage early game caretaking, while removing late game tedium. - The game in general just feels slow and tedious. This is in no small part due to terrain penalties and weak road bonuses for unit movement. (And the fact you essentially can't deliberately construct roads; military engineer roads are too expensive.) Even in the middle ages, no, it didn't take 20 years for a unit to cross a civilization. It takes a lot of the oomph and fun out of army mobilization when it's far more practical to move single powerful units against the weak AI than to assemble melee and archer units into a tactically appropriate formation. There's simply no reason to bother with a combined arms / blitzkrieg approach in this game. - I like the districts mechanic in principle, but it's not flexible enough. Districts should be removable at a cost, or at the VERY least, there should be more information displayed in early game about the future optimal options for each tile. It's really not fun to try to wing it and guess where it will be best to place an industrial, commercial, or theater district in the future, before you can select those districts to see the adjacency bonuses. (Or for placing future wonders, each of which have strict, arbitrary requirements.) At the very least, there should be some sort of filter (a lens?) to display all adjacency bonuses on a tile. - Tile info popovers are slow and unreliable. Just show the dang info when I mouse over. I'm not afraid. At least make it so that mousing over a resource icon by accident doesn't prevent tile info from displaying until I leave the tile and reenter. - Personally, I think the air unit mechanics in this game feel awkward and unnatural. Why not just emulate real life instead? Carriers in real life can project power farther and to more places at once than allowed by the 2 short-range aircraft, as can air bases. Jet fighters intercept attacks, like in Civ V. They don't sit there and take it. No cruise missiles or ballistic conventional weapons in this game? They do exist in real life... Also, by the time you can build aerodromes and project significant air power, you could far more easily have created 3 times as many land units of greater power. The air game seems to be rather pointless, and is placed too late in the game in terms of military advancement. Air units are too weak for the time they take to acquire. Minor note: you'd also think cheap surveillance or attack drones would be making an appearance by now. - Nuclear weapons are thankfully a little more realistic in this game, since they really ruin whatever land you'd like to conquer, but at the same time, you've got to ask, of what use are they in the game? The AI never has a powerful enough conventional army where you'd need nukes to defend yourself. Since you can conquer all other civs with 3 army units, it's foolish to nuke them first and ruin your takings. Best guess, if you're trying to win a science or cultural victory, you'd like to ruin everyone else's day? If you're in the mood to go for one of those victories, initiating nuclear war doesn't really fit the bill. - In my experience, all games devolve into domination matches. As soon as someone attacks you (inevitable), you will have an army and be branded a warmonger for defending yourself. So you might as well remove the nuisance of neighboring civs who like to attack you. Nature then takes its course. Maybe this is a bit realistic, but it doesn't exactly meet the 4x, varied experience Firaxis is trying to accomplish. - City state and liberation mechanics are flawed. There is no real way to defend an allied city state, or even just to play peacekeeper. You're not notified that they are attacked, and you are not given any casus belli for declaring war. War of liberation (after the fact) also doesn't seem to become available when it should. If you do liberate a city, all your units are immediately expelled from that territory, bizarrely and unnaturally disrupting your advance in a way that just wouldn't happen in real life. Takes the fun out of liberating that neighboring continent that had been conquered by a single civ; liberating France as in WWII is literally impossible. - So tired of hearing ""best not to aid that city state"" from other leaders. What are you talking about? I didn't aid any city state. Which one??? - The tech/civic boost mechanic is neat, but it makes games far too uneven. Either I hit all the boosts by the luck of the map and launch a moon landing or accidentally win a culture victory in 1700, or I'm tied up in a war for 500 years (in which I can't go on the offensive to end it or else become a warmonger), miss a lot of the boosts, and discover petroleum in 1960.I fired up this game this morning on a sick day to pass the time, and found that it's more fun to write this review than to sit through any more hours with the game. That should tell you something."

He let me keep the game.  After a week, I settled down to a few hours per day, back when my disabilities made employment harder to find.  That game, and Civ 2, 3, and 4, helped keep me going.With Civ 5, another friend talked me out of the kiddie pool of lower difficulty settings, and I discovered how much fun each of the 40-some sides could be.  The same friend gifted me Civ 6, for last Christmas, and I liked it so much, I gifted the $80 every-DLC-as-it-comes-out edition to another friend.  I put about 15,000 hours into Civ 5, and have already put over 4,000 hours into Civ 6.  My first impression was as bewildered as had been my first encounter with Civ 5.  Gorgeous as Civ 6 is, my main thought was channeling UPS: ""What can brown do for you?""  But eventually I figured out how to assign envoys.  Now I can even interpret the graphics for developed hexes in others' empires' sepia tones.Occasionally, the map gets stuck scrolling, and I have to save, exit, and restart the game.  But I go weeks without that happening.  I haven't run into any other annoying factors.So far, I've played Pericles' culture-focused Greece, Russia for a religion win, China for wonder-spamming and science,  Tomyris' unstoppable Scythians, and my favorite so far, the peaceful Canadians.  Each one has been full of unique fun.  I hope you enjoy this game.  There are lots of good video play-throughs on YouTube and Twitch, of course.  Watch before you buy, and you'll know what to expect.  I think most people will find at least a few sides that they enjoy completely."

War for being too strong and too week (at the same time). War for not trading. War for simply existing in a manner that doesn't quite suit somebody else. What seems to be an attempt to inject some personality to diplomacy with ""agendas"", results in predictable games where everyone hates you, or everyone loves you (until they don't). There's never a middle ground.On agendas, certain civs simply don't play themselves as they should. Hey Brazil, I see you've denounced literally everyone on Earth for making more great people than you. Would you like to change that? Maybe build a campus or theater square? No? Just gonna build another encampment? Thought so. Nice to meet you China. No I didn't realize you were the preemminent builder of wonders in the world. Do you know why? It's because you never built one China, that's why. Ah, Cleopatra, I see you're now chronically indecisive, as you simultaneously hate and love large militaries, and simply can't make your mind up. These agendas will override everything else you do with/to another civ. If you are friends with America and watch helpless as the Aztecs burn and pillage their way across the continent, you might be inclined to pitch in on good ol' America's behalf. But more fool you, because you see, America hates people who declare war on his neighbours, even if those neighbours are currently enslaving his own people and turning his cities to ash. A man's got to have a code after all. Now you're a warmonger. Why? Good question, but it's ok, Alexander the Great still loves you.The next part of my rant jamboree is the design of the game, such as unit scaling and modelling and such. Before the game was launched there were many people who expressed concern over a ""mobile game"" aesthetic, justly concerned that 2K might be trying to grant their next installment with some more mass appeal at the expense of anyone being able to take this seriously. Thankfully, the gameplay hasn't been dumbed down, so much as screwed up (see agendas). I am not terrified of this army of strangely proportioned stretch armstrong figures marching towards me, because I'm too distracted by the trader, whose cart is 2 or 3 times taller than my palace. In Civ 5, when the Mongol horde was at my borders, it stretched on and on like, well, a horde. Now it appears to be maybe 20 horses all together, each being roughly the size of an entire building, and altogether looking rather silly. If course there's another reason not to be intimidated by the Mongol horde, or anyone else's horde for that matter. The entire combined forces of all other AI civs could be beaten back with a damp rag and a can do attitude.The AI in Civ 6 cannot war, which is particularly damning in a game that always ends in a war. Alexander the Great of Macedon may command the most fearsome force known to man, but rest assured, it'll be soundly defeated by simply doing the following; ranged units + garrion promotion, place in city centres and encampments. Or just wait them out, when you think the enemy has gained the advantage they'll just sit there and contemplate life, or throw themselves away on fortified units with ranged support. It's worth pointing out that at launch the AI did not even know how to use boats or planes, so I wouldn't hold your breath or anyone elses for any of this to change any time soon.I will now try to think of some nice things to say about Civ 6. You can use mods in multiplayer games fairly easily. See that overpowered civ from your favorite TV show that was obviously made by a fan with no thought to game balance? Yup, you can bring that into a game with your friends and make them regret basking in your presence. The most fun I've managed to have in this game has been with friends, where the only real competition in science, culture, faith and of course, war, are the other human players. The AI might aswell be so many other city states. Oh and the music. While I miss wartime music (listening to the cheerful Kongo theme while nuclear hellfire engulfs the planet is a bit jarring) the whole idea of music evolving with eras is just fantastic. Entering the industrial era to ""Scotland the Brave"" blaring in your ears while you agressively bagpipe the inferior nations of the world into submission is satisfying, to say the least. But then you realize that you're building the same cities all over the map, and that the last game you tried to get into was the same as this one, and that enemy you've been contending with isn't really contending so much as falling behind because he decided to give up on winning. And then everyone denounces you for being close to winning yourself. And then I get tired of this and try and get Civ 5 to work again with a bagillion mods.(oh yeah and districts aren't that special, I always end up building the same 2 or 3 different cities with no variation)(I'll stop typing now I am very tired)EDIT:I have so many hours played in this game because of friends who used to enjoy playing it. As they lost interest, I lost interest. There were other mods I used that also made it fun, which are no longer usable since the summer patch (I think, it might have been the spring one I can't remember). I cannot reccomend this game because it does not stand up on it's own as a civ game should. Time and time again the modding community has found and fixed bugs that should have been dealt with before release. Maybe the next big dlc will make Civ6 a game worthy of the franchise, I don't know. Until such a time I do not think anyone should buy this game. That is my opinion and I am entitled to it no matter how many hours I have played, or whether or not I ""got my money's worth"".(While I understand where some people are coming from with the ""you played a bunch but didn't like it so why did you play it"" mentality, I would not take any review seriously with few hours played, regardless of wether they reccomended it or not. If my friends came with the game in a sort of package deal, then sure I'd reccomend it, but I got them elsewhere)GS EDIT:Another DLC, and with it some more game mechanics for the AI to struggle with. There's really not much more to it than that. Obvious one is climate change and disasters, of which there is very little change and it's not very disastrous. Just keep a builder or two on stand by if you're in a disaster prone area and you'll be fine. Of the couple times I've had the patience to see a game to completion, not once did the sea level rise, which leads me to believe that you have to really go out of your way to screw up the planet. The main incentive for burning fossil fuels seems to be powering tier 3 buildings in certain districts. Not only is this not necessary, as these buildings still provide their standard yield, but you can just hold out for cleaner energy sources a couple more techs down the line.The other ""new"" mechanic is the world congress (for some reason starting in the year 500 AD), which at the very least is a more nostalgic kind of stupid. Fans of Civ 5 can look back on fond memories of the great nations of the world banding together against the true enemy of civilization, truffles. Voting yourself is pointless (unless you're playing Sweden), because the AI will mass vote to ban random things regardless of whether it hurts them or not."

Let's go with the basic simple review, is this better than Civ 5?- Eh, it's more flexible i guess. In Civ 5, i either kill everyone and conquer every cities on the planet or just turtle up myself with any number the tradition policies told me too. Districts system is good that you could give your cities their actual characteristic, probably the best part of Civ 6. Eureka systems are good but sometimes lead to repeatitive early game interactions like ""Try to kill barbarian with this Slinger"" or ""Make 2 Galleys"", some of them also depend on map RNG.2.)Is the game well-balanced?- Lol, nope. Some Civs are very strong since the Ancient Era while some are like playing without any bonuses until Renaissance. Babarian can be annoying most of the time, sometime they went full Genghis Khan and dunk 5 Horsemen into your face on very early game (I think Babarian condition that ""If they are any Horse resource nearby, they will make even more Horsemen"" are work even with horses in your cities). City-States do something weird as well, some will never make more than 5 units, some will make 10+ units and make traffic on the continent worse than morning rush hours, so ally with some City-state don't improve your army while some could eradicate some armies for you. City start could be very bad or extremely good, coastal start like Spain or England could be pretty bad.-Edit: Somehow 2K went buffing and nerfing some Civs, Norway, England and Spainish got buffs and Kongo got a nerf.(DLC Civs are still OP, no worry). Barbarians're still annoying, I don't think they touched this part anyway. 3.)Is patching, bug fix or A.I improvement come fast?-Edit: 2K seem to give out the seasonal patch and update(?), some of it actually make the game better while some of them are pretty bad(like making Alliance with A.I. in latest patches which is pretty annoying)4.)2K sell so many DLCs, should I support them?- No idea, Just be yourself. The prices are a little higher than a TCG pack in my country, so i'm not that mad about it. 5.)Should I purchase it now?-If  it's on sale and you will play it right now, yes. If you want to play it later, No, wait for better patch or expansion.TL;DL: It's good game design and improvement over Civ5, but still need more patches and balancing. The decision is up to you, but for me it worth it, maybe.Edit: Ok after realize so many people actually read my gibberish review so I guess I will update the update, patching, and some other parts."

No...I have been playing Civ since the original back in the 90s, and over the years its changed dramatically. Yet even inspite loving this game there are a few things i find really disapointing. But first the stuff I love.........1: Two Tech TreesYea you read that correct, instead of having the old standard tech tree there is a second one that covers your civic abilities. These in hand effect how you govern or opens up more to how you can govern better to your preferred style. For instance one of my favourite abilities from Civ4 'Serfdom' has reappeared and the way this ability works is pretty great.2: Still Fight Barbariansin previous games when you reach a certain age or a unit reaches a certain experience I have found that those units no longer gain experience when fighting barbarians, thats now changed. you can still level a unit but unfortunatly its at a very slower rate than if your up against a civilization target. Yet still its good that when you come up against mauraders trying to pillage your sea tiles that you can be rewarded.3: DistrictsAt first I wasn't sure if I liked the idea of districts or not but I think the more I play the more I like. The idea behind districts is that your cities are not just on one tile but can spread out over several tiles. This in my opinion can be a blessing or a curse. It can be a blessing if you find the right spot to build a city and there are plenty of boosters for your districts like Mountains or rainforests for science districts. The curse comes more with the lack of space issue. Especially if you land in a location and raise a city only because you find valuable resources, but the city could fail to see its potential due to a lack of district space. The game forces you to make more wiser decisions.Those are the main likes, here are my main dislikes.....1: All roads lead to Rome?Err no they don't, the way you build roads has been redeveloped for some bizare reason and they no longer have the abilities of earlier Civ games. First of all your builders no longer create roads, only traders and a new engineer unit can build roads. If you task a trader to trade with another one of your cities it creates a road on its path. If you use an engineer, the unit only lasts for 2 active turns and then disappears, they seem to be a waste of time imo............ Roads no longer give you any advantage anymore, they don't provide added tile wealth like in previous games, and they don't really offer any movement advance for units, e.g. 3 tiles instead of one, in fact I have seen units avoid roads for some reason.2: Oh and the same for buildersThats right, with no modifications your builders only have three active turns, meaning that you can only get them to develop three tiles. So for example in previous games if you wanted to say redevelop a pasture hill with rainforest to build a mine, it might take e,g, 10 turns to do everything from cut down the rainforest and then build the mine, now it take 2 of your 3 goes, one to cut down the trees one to build mine. The only saving grace is that every action is instant, cutting trees take one turn, building a mine is one turn etc etc. I am not entirely sure why the devs have done this, and especially why they have changed the way roads are built and work. my only conclusion is to reduce map congestion, but that should be left to the player to decide.  I used to love having a transport ship filled with builders who follow and invasion in case I have used nukes or if I need to redevelop the infastructure. Can't really do that now.3: Boot polish can make it shineWell I think in this case there is a distint lack of polish and especially when the game costs £50 - £70 depending on what version you get before any discount is alarming. There are a lot of bugs in this game and things missing that I would expect from previous games from the get go.  One bug is when a Civ tries to contact you but then does nothing, the animation is still playing for the civ leader but no pop ups, Why does this happen? Well I have worked out that parts of the game work to quickly, and when the game is catching up the game crashes. This is not a PC speed issue as it would happen all the time otherwise. Another bug which I have experienced and it seems reading the reviews for the game so have others, other leaders are easy to piss off. For instance if you build a wonder or choose a different form of government, other world leaders seem to go into a nerd rage.Also why do the devs still insist on not having transport ships and forcing one unit per tile, its so redundant and slow, also where are my paratroopers? I love paras as they offer a great dynamic to combat.4: A lack of consequenceOne of the things I loved about Civ4 (imo my favourite version I think) was that every important game changing task you did had concequences. For example, you got caught spying big time, it had consequences, you have developed Nukes, it had concequences. Now nothing does. I had caught a civ trying to steal cash and sabotage districts, and in spite the fact they apologised, they did it again several turn later. I declared war which seemed the only way to stop them, but I turned out to be the bad guy for doing this and ruined the end game because everyone hated me and called me a warmounger. Put this down to a bug or intentional, either way it ruined my game.5: Out pricing the futureYep as it seems with all games these days the polish comes in the form of overpriced DLCs. At £25 I think I will wait for the sales before I purchase ""Rise and Fall"". It seems that I actually hate this game considering that I put more negatives but I don't, I struggle to hate any Civ game even when newer versions remove the stuff I really loved. I just think that when you make a conscious decision to buy the game you do it knowing the negative points. There is still enough love in this game to make it enjoyable but thats where you as the player come into it."

A lot of people prefer Civ 5, but while that was also an amazing game, I prefer to play 6. It doesn't let you cheat the movement system as much, and it keeps things more interesting throughout the game than Civ 5 did. The AIs are more aggressive, which makes them more interesting to play against. Probably the only pitfall to Civ 6 is the Rise and Fall expansion.

However, upon playing this game, I have noticed that no matter how many times I play Civ 6, I cannot get into it. It's like something was missing in which the previous Civ games had that this one does not. Then it hit me; this game was missing the UNCERTIANABILITY FACTOR.Now when I say the uncertainability factor, I mean the tiny gray area that makes the game truly unqiue. Where you have just enough room for error that the game could be good or bad for you, where you could do something that you could not in other games, and where you were not entirly sure how the game could truly play out. In other words, the mystery factor of the Civilization games that kept you guessing: ""What happens next?""Now here are a few examples from CIVs 3, 4, & 5 that will help paint a clear picture of what I am talking about: In Civ 3, I rememmber where you could attempt to sail across the ocean tiles before researching the appropiate tech. In most cases the ships would sink (unless you had the lighthouse wonder), but in those very few instances you could cross those ocean tiles and get away with it (which gave me a sense of happiness each time it happened). This was not the only instance in where there was some kind of flexibity allowing you to get away with acts that could help you or hurt you, as there were also volcanos. It was very hard to know if you built a city next to one or not, resulting in a destroyed city (with its surrounding areas) anytime through out that particular game; it could also happen multiple times in the same area in the same game too. As I stated before, there was a potential of flexibility that could either make or break your game by taking chances.In Civ 4, there was the randomized event sequence in which gave the player(s) good bonuses or bad ones. It was very randomized & had a large pool of events making it hard to repeat the same ones over and over again (not to mention that anyone of the events could happen at anytime of the game, begining or end). This meant that every game you played was different resulting in playing the best or worst game you ever played. It is worth noting too that your opponents (players or AI) could receive these events at different times as well. For example, your iron resources could be granted additonal production or subtracted depending on the event. Then there is my favorite, hordes of barbarians could suddenly show up next to one of your (or your opponent's) cities and start rampaging. Regardless of what or when these events happened , this brought about a sense of curiousity of ""what happens next.""Finally in Civ 5, each resource had a varied amount of resources, resulting in a finite or limited number of strategic units using those same resources. For example, you could find three resources of iron; one having 3 iron, one having 2 iron, and the last one having only 1 iron which resulted in having a potentional of 6 units using iron (unless you went on to find more iron). This made the game very competitive for other players (and AI) to grab these resources as soon as possible. Not to mention too that you could never know how many of those resouces were near you or not. It could be the difference between one civ dominating the classical & medevial age due to having asburd amounts of iron and then crumble in the mordern age due to having very few oil resources. In other words, that the game can change from good to bad, or vis versa, depending on circumstances in the game.Now I am not saying that these examples, that I have listed, need to be added into the game; but I do beleive that the intent of each one of them represents needs to be addressed. The point is that Civ 6 does not have that uncertainability factor that makes the game a truly unqiue & mystifing expereince as did the last few Civ games had. It has no flexibility, no sense of curiousity of what happens next, and no true game changing sequiences (although the R & F expansion was a good start) that would ultimately define the rest of the game. I want to love this game soooo much....but I can't, not until this missing element is adressed and implemented. I am hopeful that the creators will read this, if it gets enough likes, and understand why Civ 6 is missing a key element that nearly all CIV games have had up until now and take action to solve this. Thank you all for reading this."

But releasing a game as a ""Platinum Edition"" which cost like 60 bucks, only to then release a ""New Frontier Pass"" DLC for 40 bucks more is a particularly scummy practice.We gamers need to band together and only buy it on heavy discount to send them a message. Please don't buy this stuff at full price and signal that this behaviour is acceptable.Because otherwise what does ""Platinum"" mean? And where do we go after this? ""Triple-quadruple platinum with unobtainium gemstones""?  Label is misleading, and they deserve to be punished for that.Edit: punctuation.-----Edit II [22 I 2021]: Wow, this blew up. Thanks for all the points, guys. I thought to address some of the comments. Some valid, some not so much. Here is the thing, there are people who buy the game at- or near- release, and they have to pay a high financial price for it. Time goes by, game gets cheaper. This is, I daresay, a reflection of economics. It's kind of like going to the cinema when a film first premieres (expensive), and then watching it on Netflix decades later (-almost- free). It seems justifiable for DLC to remain expensive for first-movers. Theoretically there is a first-mover advantage, if nothing more than the fact that multiplayer servers remain more populated. But yes, beyond a certain amount of time (and here I cannot actually say for sure how long), the DLC prices should be moderated.Secondly, the fact that I paid a bit less for Platinum than someone did is not really relevant to the point. It is kind of like saying, ""hey, OP got poked in one eye, she should be happy she didn't get poked in both eyes."" I submit, humbly, that we should be going after the rogue eye-poker, instead of the eye-pokee.Thirdly, someone was saying that marketing is prone to exaggeration. This person, I suggest, is not legally educated. There is a difference between ""mere puff"" and ""misrepresentation."" For about 25 years between 1990 and 2015, ""Gold"", ""Platinum"" and ""Game of the Year"" Editions have been known to denote a rather specific arrangement of games, usually to the effect of the inclusion of the base game, together with all the expansions.Words have meaning. To quote a mediocre film of a good book: ""Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth."" If words do not have meaning, then one day you will find yourself served sh*t on a shingle, have that called ""breakfast"", and you will be happy to eat it even if you aren't.Something  wrong here. Fortunately, the market is democratic, and we are the constituents, and we have the power to change things.I only respectfully ask that we do.-----Edit 3: 21 Nov 2022With the launch of the Leadership pass, I can say that it is a good step towards remedying the previous review qua DLC.  However, the botched communication, the bugs, and the terrible roll out does not sufficiently change the protest review."

The crucial problem of this game is that the vast majority of decisions made by the player ultimately don't matter, and the decisions that do matter will have the same right answer time and time again. In a nutshell, Civ 6 is shallow and repetitive. It doesn't work.War is always the right answer. The fastest way to a cultural victory is to steal the hard work of a cultural player. The fastest way to science victory is to take over other Civs for their science output. War is also the best way to spread your religion. So by pursuing the domination victory, you inevitably end up doing what is optimal for all other victory types as well. Hence, war is always the right answer and the game is broken. Diplomacy is broken. It's broken to the point of comedy. For example, Frederick gets mad if you get friendly or become Suzerain of city states. Now heres the question: Is it ever within the players advantage to choose to not become friendly with city states so as to avoid angering Frederick? No, of course not. So what ends up happening is that Frederick will hate you every single game. And what's comical is that every character's agenda is similarly broken and ends up having the same effect as Fredericks. It's inevitable that every AI character will hate you just for playing the game properly. Not to mention that war is always the right answer and war mongering penalty is steep, so it's best to just ignore diplomacy entirely- it's so irrelevant that it's not worth the brain space of thinking about it.The characters are severely unbalanced. Scythia and Sumeria are unstoppable. Germany is also well above the rest of the cast because of its high production output. It's like they never play tested the game. The special abilities of most of the cast don't matter because they are designed for a Civ game when Civ 6 is a game of war. The Eureka boosts add to the games repetitiveness. The effect they have is that you end up doing the same actions in the same order over and over again. This reduces the extent to which decisions are made in response to what is going on in the environment. The effect is disastrous in what is already a repetitive game.The user interface is awful. The game interrupts itself constantly with the same annoying cut scenes. Skipping through them is too slow and they get old fast. Again, it's clear that this game wasn't adequately play tested.This game is also glitchy. It's gotten better since release, but it's still far from a polished product.If another player wins the game, it skips immediately to the ""defeat"" cutscene. It jumps to this cutscene so fast that you don't know who won or by what victory type. This can happen seemingly out of nowhere if the AI gets a non-domination victory (usually a religious victory, I have never seen an AI get anything but a religious victory. It is by far the easiest victory type for the AI against the player- just to mention another thing that is broken). It's extremely frustrating to put many hours into a game only to have it end abruptly. In order to figure out how you lost, you have to select the ""just one more turn"" option and then do detective work. It's just awful. There's no way this game was play tested.Ultimately, Civ 6 is game that comes off as lazy and rushed. I gave it many chances and tried my best to appreciate it, but the flaws are too severe. I typically find myself getting bored by turn 20. The repetitiveness is maddening."

But AI and diplomacy is broken.I like the city districts and the strategic possibilities it entails.  But it feels like they spent all their time on that mechanic.Imagine being invited by a nation to help them fight a war, and then get denounced by the SAME country as a warmonger for your troubles.  Imagine getting suprised attacked by a nation, defending yourself and taking one of that nation's cities in retaliation and being denounced as a warmonger by that nation and everyone else.  Imagine liberating a nation long-dead for millennia, no acknowledgment of thanks, and then being denounced by the same liberated nation as a warmonger.  Welcome to Civ VI, where you are hated no matter what you do.  And no matter what victory condition you start with, you always end up wanting to nuke the &*$@#^& out of the nations around you.  For the first time in all the Civ games I've played I wished there was an option to execute opposing leaders, that's how annoyed I got.  Ah to see the eternally annoying Phillip II lose his head, now THAT would be fun...Wait there's more!  Imagine being asked for a gift of resources, plus gold, plus gold per turn.  You think to yourself, ""I feel generous today"" and offer at least the resources and the one-time gold, but not the gold per turn.  Well, these entitled pricks will tell you, ""Not good enough!  We want a gift from you the way WE say it.""  It's unreal.  So back to nuking them.  Honestly I cannot understand the thinking that went into the diplomacy, it's the worst I've ever seen.  It doesn't just feel unfinished, it's plain bad.  As usual your opponents get to say snarky comments and threaten and bully you and you get no options to respond.  This has been an issue for me in previous games too, but it's even more exquistely painful in Civ VI.  And the AI does ridiculous things like FLOOD your country with their missionaries and apostles, blocking your path and there's no option to even say, ""Hey, can you relax with the religion thing?""  I had to declare war multiple times just so I could move around my own empire.  And of course, the flood of hate and denouncing hits you from all sides.  I played king level and at the end of the game city states still had warriors and even some nations.  This game needed way more playtesting.  I hope like other Civ games it improves with patches, but I'm not pre-ordering a Civ game ever again."

I've grown up playing the series since Civ II, when I was only eight years old. This series has shaped what I know and  expect out of any strategy game, and will forever serve as a litmus test to other strategy series. I can play any number of games and genres, but I always go back to Civilization when I grow bored of the others. Keeping this in mind, Civ 6 has been a huge disappointment to me and fails to compare to its predecessors in any way. Many new features are welcome improvements (though admitedly adapted from other comparable series): the introduction of districts, policies, and changes to various science, espionage, religious, and military aspects. I even warmed up to the art style very quickly in my first playthrough. They carried over enough of the previous games to make it easy for me to pick up and start playing right away. Unfortunately, they left behind the soul of the previous entries. Civ, for me, has always been a single-player game first, making interaction with the AI one of the most important features in the game. I like how they made the AI react differently to my playstyle. I like that I can have reasons (casus belli) to declare war, drastically reducing warmonger penalties to the AI. Unfortunately, all of this means nothing since the AI is deperately broken. They will declare wars against you and other civs for absolutley no reason, and then beg you for peace, giving you all of their resource. City states will either be technologically inept in the later game, or wildly advanced beyond any civ close to them. Harder difficulties don't make the AI play any better - they just get more settlers and builders to start. It took them six months just to patch the AI to make it playable, but it still needs improvement.To make matters worse, Firaxis is taking the Paradox route by nickel and diming fans just to get the ""bonus"" content of new civilizations, which are honestly desperately needed for the enjoyment of replayablility. As of this review, they are charging a minimum of $5  new civilization. I felt that Civ 4 and 5's expansions were perfect - these expansions brought multiple new civs, leaders, and game changing content, all for the better. Yes, they were more expensive, but they brought so much that they were  worth it. Until sweeping changes come from expansions or patches, I do not recommend purchasing the game at full price in its current state."

The intro is great. Although it is no Baba Yetu, the video combined with the awesome score had me in chills. The last game's intro was really good as well but this one was just spectacular and a great way to introduce players to what will be an extravagant game. +Main menu. Very good looking and very intuitive. It is much more simple this time around, with few sub-menus that you have to nagivate just to start or continue a game. The options panel has many, many settings. There is also a ""New to Civ VI"" advisor option for returning players. There is now a benchmark to test your system.+Civics and research.I thought, coming into this, that I would not like a second tree, but it in fact helps to expand the gameplay especially with the addition of governments and policies. Research now adds more to your game, not just a building and a unit here and there. The game feels like it is tailoring itself for you quicker than it would in Civ V.+Governments, policies and casus belli.One thing I thought that I was certain to hate was the removal of social policies and the addition of governments and policies, especially with the card system. However, it has turned out to be very useful especially when you need a specific resource like gold or faith, or if there are many barbarians surrounding you. You can unlock more governments and policies in the civics and research trees. Casus belli, which is a justification for war, is a great addition to this game. There are many different casus belli in the game. Declaring a liberation war can be used if someone has captured one of your or one of your allies' cities. The warmonger penalty for this is nothing, but only for the recapture of that city. There is a holy war, which is war on a civilization whose religion has been spread to one or more of your cities. All warmonger penalties for this are halved. There is also a  reconquest war, protectorate war and a few more.+Districts. I also thought that I would dislike districts and having to manage each one and finding space to build each one, pre-planning cities etc. But it had turned out to be a service and a great addition to the game. There are many more district types than I had initially realised. This all sums up to a very unique game.+Huge maps. Compared to the pre-installed maps in Civ V, these maps are huge and a treat to explore! I recommend setting the amount of civilizations in your game to upwards of 8. It had taken me over 150 turns to find another civ in a game of 8 civs on Continents. I was really starting to question whether there were any other civs or not.+Great people and promotions. Great people are truly great. Each unique great person has a unique ability, except for the great prophet. This mixes the gameplay up a bit and adds variation.Promotions now have their own tree. They also heal the unit, not to full health though which is still a very nice feature. +Trading, envoys, and builders. Trading takes on a new format which I feel is much more customisable. Traders add roads as they travel and have new bonuses.Envoys are better ways to handle gifts from city states. You do not have to be an ally (or suzerain) with a city state to receive its bonus, just send an envoy. Builders now have charges like Great Prophets, Missionaries and Inquisitors did in Civ V. This might seem like a bad thing, but they get the job done on the turn that you order them to do it.+Game length. In Civilization VI, the developers have stated that they have tried to lower the game length to just get through everything faster. This is definitely a positive thing. Before this game was released, I started a Standard Speed game from Ancient era in Civilization V. After playing for around 10 hours, I was in the industrial era. After around 10 hours on Standard from the Ancient era in Civilization VI, I have almost completed the Research and Civics trees.This helps to filter out all of the repetitiveness and the waiting around and it does a good job at that.+Graphics. The graphics, which can be considered cartoony, I don't mind. The graphics in Civilization V were definitely more realistic than they are in Civilization VI. This doesn't particularly bother me, I don't mind how the graphics look. If anything, the graphics look quite nice. If it bothers you, then consider everything else in the game before you decide to not buy it.+-AI. The AI in the game is okay. The only reason that the AI isn't a negative for me is because I like that they have agendas and the gossip features and how they react to some things that you do. After watching the AI match and reading peoples' complaints, it looks like the AI has multiple issues, like the placement of districts and expanding their civilization. The AI would also declare war and then make a peace treaty soon after. There were pillaged tiles and sitting units for most of the game. These things don't particularly bother me. I can still play a game fine with these issues but it looks like it really riles people up.+-Few glitches at launch. From launch, the game has very few glitches. However, here are some which I have enoucntered. Mousing over the messages which appear on the right of the screen as they did in the previous game does not always reveal what the message is. You need to fiddle with your mouse a bit for it to finally show. Also, meeting a new city-state has three separate messages and it would be nice if they were incorporated into one to unclutter the screen. The game does have a system of making multiple messages into one. It should do this for these city state messages.-Amenities, housing and others. Although it can be fun to micromanage these small additions, it feels more like Cities: Skylines than Civilization in this respect. Being able to queue productions was a neat part of Civ V, but it has been removed from Civ VI."

The game introduced a newish idea, that each civilization, in addition to victory goals, would be driven by their own personal reasons. For example, the vikings like anyone with a strong navy, egypt anyone with a strong army, brazil hates anyone who gets lots of great people, and china hates anyone who builds a lot of wonders. This had potential to make games more complex, as it would allow you to form alliances that catered to your goal, and the goals of the AI.In practice, the system is horribly done. Let's go through a few turns of meeting the Vikings:Turn 1: Oh hi! We found the vikingsTurn 2: Oh they won't accept our gifts? That's weirdTurn 4: Vikings: ""Your navy is s***, we denounce you!""Turn 7: Vikings: ""Your navy is still s***, we declare war""You then spend about 20 turns at war, taking some citiesTurn 28: All other AI ""Warmonger. Warmonger. We declare war""How does that make any sense? Gorgo, one of the leaders of Sparta, will actually attack you for being weak, because they hate the weak. And the warmonger system makes 0 sense, as well. If someone declares war on you, and you take one of their cities in return, you are a warmonger. Did they capture some of your cities in a previous war, and you took them back? Warmonger. Another AI asked you to go to war with them to take out a second AI? Well now they both think you are a warmonger. It is absurd."

Civ 6 is a fantastic 4x game that in my opinion is an improvement on civ 5. However, there is one caveat. The two main DLCs are essential for the game to be great (not the frontier pass). I highly suggest you wait for a sale to pick up the game with the DLCs for the best experience. If you are on a budget and can't get the DLC, just buy civ v with the DLC (pretty cheap, since game is old) as that is a better experience than base civ 6. But with the DLC, the mechanics and turn to turn decisions are a huge improvement, even rising above civ v + DLC. If you are a civ v veteran, give this game a try with an open mind, its going be different, but once you learn the mechanics you will fall in love with the game. A lot of civ v players hate districts at first, but once you understand them and learn how to play with them, you will find that you will probably actually prefer the district system. Districts add depth and interesting decisions when deciding on district type and placement.Civ 6 + DLC: 9/10Base Civ 6: 6/10"

At least not yet.What did I like: - refreshed government types (early goverment types unlock very few benefits, later ones more and more) - think ""they replaced Policies with it""), - interesting City District mechanics (still didn't fully wrap my head around it, but I only played 20h or so), making Cities physically large, occupying 10+ hexes), - trade routes now establish roads automatically (oh, and wokers now ""expire"" after few uses so you only use them to build farms/mines/etc but not roads), - Corps/Fleet idea (you can join 2-3 units of same type to create a stronger version with bigger punch; useful if you're hopelessly outgunned by tech-superior opponent, your swordsmen against his riflemen).What I didn't like: - cartoonish graphics (I realize developers want to introduce 12yo's to this game, but they clearly forgot about veteran gamers), especially irritating on diplomacy screens, I don't think I will ever get used to it, - seems it's made for tablets, not PCs (aforementioned graphics, everything is click-click-click - not much of keyboard control), - reports are clunky compared to Civ5 (try to list all your military units, to see if they need upgrading etc, I dare you; try to easily see which of your cities has most production/science/...), - diplomacy is a joke; while I like Cassus Belli (a ""reason"" to start a war to minimize your warmongering score) it's only the player needs it, AI will be constantly starting wars with you, even if moment ago they were showing smily face (icon representing your standing with them), and then when you pummel them to dust (hey, they started!) all other AIs will start hating you for warmongering, - oh, and they will be denouncing you every 5 turns or so, and that's the video sequence you have to wait through (and THEN click ""OK, done""), making turns longer and longer (the ""denounce"" is used by players to start wars; it's not really used by AI for nothing else) - not to mention that scary Gilgamesh looks like a Asterix-or-Obelix cartoon. He was my friend for ages, and then he hated me, and then my ""free weekend"" expired to I couldn't put him to his Disney-like grave.What is interesting but needs improving: - the Eureka system. Great idea (""if you use archers all the time for war, it should be much easier for you to develop crossbows""), but flawed execution. Some Eurekas are triggered by luck (""find a natural wonder to speed up research on X""), some by something-way-too-easy (""build a Niter mine to speed up research on Rifling, 3 or 4 eras (!) ahead of you""), and some are just insane (""build 3 units of this brand new thing to speed up following research"", where research takes 30 turns, and building that brand new unit takes 25 turns), - new World Wonders; some are overpowered (Big Ben!), some are useless (""Chicken"" Itza it's now just that, it just improves jungle tiles in this single city alone and takes 80+ turns to build, WTF?).I know DLCs change the game. I will still wait and read reviews once every while to see if anything changed. But for now... Verdict: do not buy (yet?), stick to Civ5."

So its doing something right at least. However even with all its greatness I have to not recommend it at this time. Civ 6 has a few issues that are infuriating to the point I did not want to play the game anymore even when I felt the ""One more turn"" urge to keep playing.First the changes that made me love Civ 6;-Art style: I actually like the style, especially the map fog which I assume everyone likes.-Barbarians: Holy jebus they can actually be a challange to deal with. Even late game when you least expect it.-Districts/Wonder Placement: Actually make city placement and specialization more thought provoking and fun.-Tech/Culture Eureka/Inspiration: Another good feature that can effect your gameplay style of a game.-Great Persons: if you want em you gotta go after them vigorously. And they range from ""Oh neat"" to ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THATS AWESOME""-Various other things but here comes the long rant...Now the things that made me wonder what I was doing with my life playing Civ 6 (Mostly AI related);-UI/Infromation: So much detailed information is just GONE from Civ 5. You gotta memorize your luxurious resource trade deals because the game will not tell you how many you had in total or who you traded it to/from. You have no clue how well religion is spreading. You cannot look at Units special abilities. Combat Numbers do not accurately indicate the amount of damage your unit will deal. You have no way to look at deal historys with other civs. the ""Gossips"" tell you everything you don't need to know, from england building a granary to your civ trading with another civ the turn you setup a trade deal.-AI Agendas/Diplomacy: First off, the Agenda system is not a bad ""Idea"" its just the AI does not execute it correctly in relation to diplomacy and AI Insanity. Bottom line, if you are doing well, they will hate you, leading to all the AI denouncing eachother as well. If you manage to find ONE AI that tolerates you enough to become an Ally, they will do everything in their power to not be your friend/ally behind the scenes. Like declaring war on you for no reason.-Ai Combat Tactics/Peace terms: Speaking of declaring war, the AI are so bad at tactical combat that the Barbarians can wipe them out given the minor opportunity. They tend to fall behind in higher Tech Units because they don't upgrade their units usually. Also I think they were either programed to be complete panzies or their military command give out their orders in different languages to each unit. Because 90% of the time they will not attack anything in melee unless they can one shot it. If their HP drops to 60% that unit will run away. This leads them to just shuffle outside completly outmatched cities with a single archer able to fend off 10-15 units by himself without them even attacking the city. then the AI goes pants on head retarded and decides all hope is lost and will give you EVERYTHING they own for peace.-AI General AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ insanity: The AI in Civ 6 are more akin to an Alien then a human player because they act insanely random. I would say they act like Civ 5 Ghandi but at least he was predictable with his madness. ""We have been best friends for thousands of years sharing trade and tech-DECLARES WAR ON YOU"" ""Wanna do a joint war against this Warmongering prick burning down my cities? YOU ARE A WARMONGERER!"" They are such massive hypocrites like the Joint War example. EVERYTHING they ask you to stop doing, They are currently doing to you but x10, Units near borders in particular even if its a single unit 2 tiles away in your own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ territory while they have a massive army IN your borders.-War, War Never Changes, (Except it does for the worse): War in Civ 6 is now a huge pain in the ass because unless you declare war on people within 20 turns of the game, WARMONGERING. even the casus belli's do nothing to change this (Except Liberation wars which never happen because nobody likes you), the ""Severity"" of Warmongering penalties translate to ""How long they will hate my guts"" not ""How much they will hate my guts"" so no matter how justified your war is, everyone will denounce you for declaring war on anyone, even the people who joined the war with you. Because you are a heartless bastard marching your forces to go punch that genocidal civililization in the face, who kick puppies for fun. Next on the agenda of war is ""War Weariness"" this as a good mechanic that falls off the mark due to its execution. Because yes it makes it so you cannot just be at war forever and kill everyone. But it screws over the AI while it forces the player in the late game to keep wars in short increments or have all your cities get pissy. This screws over the defender/AI because War Weariness skyrockets in cities being fought around. probably why the AI caves and throws everything they have at you, I've sieged a city and within 2-3 turns barbarians spawned around it and it turned into a 3-way fight.-Last but not least, PACING: The games pace is so wrong, without rushing science you will have nukes by the Napoleonic Era. Epic game speed is the old standard speed. You will never stay long enough in one era to enjoy it. Finally once you hit the Atomic Era the game speed kicks into high gear rushing the game into a suddon stop. You will get the coolest tech and units 5 turns before you achieve a Science victory, possible to not even get them with a Culture victory.I've stopped playing my current game because of these problems which I desperately hope get patched or something as there is a game in here that I love. but I can't play it without feeling like I'm a cat chasing blind deaf and stupid mice to a finish line on the counter. sure there are many ways to get onto the counter and the mice ""could"" reach it. but one jumped off the counter, another pissed in my cat-bowl, the final one thought we were buddies then had a brain aneurysm and tried to bite me but had no teeth and just gnawed on me And before you say ""Raise the Difficulty."" thats just tying rope to the mice to pull them towards the goal faster. They are still Blind Deaf and Dumb."

Easy to learn and very begginer friendly, especially those new to 4X and turn based strategy games2. It looks for very good and the artwork (except for some leaders) is wonderful. Seriously, compared to any other 4X game Civ 6 is just stunning. 3. Its just a very fun gameCons:1. The AI is just absolutely horrible. Just completely sucks. At lower difficulty levels it's very stupid, and at the higher difficulty levels, its still just as stupid and makes the same mistakes. It just gets so much more starting resources to try to make it challenging, but any experienced player will tell you, that instead of being challenging and rewarding, it makes it, boring, tedious, grindy and repetitive.2. Some UI features that should have been standard (like having a Production Queue) aren't [art of the base game and need a UI mod to significantly improve the game.3. Because the Civ series has always had a strong emphasis on the single player part of the game, the different civs are NOT balanced for multiplayer, which really ruins the multiplpayer experience.Overall, I would give Civ 6 a 6.5 out of 10 and with a UI mod installed it's a 7.5 out of 10. I would reccomend it to players that are new to the 4X and turn based strategy game genres and fans of previous Civ games will enjoy it. If you are an experienced 4X or strategy gamer and looking for a challenge, you probably will not enjoy Civ 6 and I would not reccomend this for you (Seriously the Ai is garbage).I hope this review was helpful. Thanks for reading."

Districts do nothing for me. They're goofy and make your cities not feel like cities. Trade routes are clunky and a constant annoyance, especially once you get to the Renaissance era and beyond. The AI has annoying tendencies such as sudden deluges of denouncements / wars that come out of nowhere, presumably related to the difficulty setting. Nevermind that a far off nation has never encountered one of your units or you one of their's (except for that first explorer), and nevermind that they don't have the ability to travel across the planet to even engage you, seems like there's just some counter that says you should be at war with 4/10 nations bc of your difficulty setting. And then 30 turns later you make peace after no shots fired, they pay you and are happy with you again. You blow through eras without being able to build any units from that era bc it took too long to build things from previous eras before you advanced to the next (regardless of whether you're going for a scientific victory or not). Sean Bean is great, though.Edit: All right, I'll be retracting alot of what I said above. I still think districts are goofy, but tolerable. They revised whatever default behavior existed for trade route duration so even in the late game you're not just constantly reenabling trade routes (of course, it'd be a better UX if they just auto-reenabled but hey, still better). The AI is improved, the pacing is improved... I can actually realistically build at least one copy of everything in an era, regardless. And Sean Bean is still great.Also, I'm gonna disagree with everyone and their mother and say I like Rise & Fall and I also like Gathering Storm. I like the power + resource dynamics. I like the era stuff. Much richer experience overall."

I'd say that as of now, if anyone is thinking of buying the game, just get Civ V for a fraction of the price and wait for some actually interesting DLC to be released for Civ VI, or maybe a really big sale. Full price is a joke right now...I played 380 hours of Civ V, and I loved it. I pre-ordered Civ VI as soon as it was announced. Whoops.While a couple (and no more than just a couple) of features were exciting and fun (such as the city districts), the majority of the game felt so, so similar to Civ V. My impressions were that it was essentially a nice mod for Civ V. No where near worth $60. I'm hoping some DLC will invigorate the game and change it up, but 8 months later and they've only released $25 of civilization/scenario packs. Which is also insulting, as these civilizations add nothing new to the game.On top of only feeling like a modded Civ V, they didn't fix any of the major issues of Civ V - mainly, the crappy AI. If anything, they've made it worse by adding more reasons for the AI to randomly hate you. I've found that once a rival civilization hates you (which can start very early and for very little reason), it's just going to be all-out war for the rest of the game, with a few turns of peace scattered throughout. There's no respite. Not that you necessarily need it, as the AI is also stupid and incapable of conducting a proper war or assault. And then you get warmonger penalties, and so everyone else hates you as well. It takes the whole element of diplomacy out of the game.   There are just so many cons to Civ VI, and only a couple of pros. The changes from Civ V are mostly aesthetic, which should never cost $60. I'm really hoping there'll be some REAL DLC coming soon to breathe some life back into the game. I'll never pre-order a Firaxis game again."

I have waited till I got a good view on some of the things that can be adressed and improved upon.I will try to use screenshots if I am able but since I am writing this review when I came back from work, please excuse any typo's and other faults you come across.I loved civ 5 and was looking forward to this game a lot. Let me state that this is BY FAR the best  release of a civilization itteration. many of you will remember CIV:BE, a game that I personally liked in all honesty.There are quite a few things different from civ 5, they recommend that you use the tutorial if you are new to the game. ALthough it helps a little it doesn't explain how different mechanics work in the game.They stated that they have put  a lot of work into the civilopedia. Personally I don't think that it is very helpfull, it gives base information about certain aspects of the game. I recommend reading the darn manual :D It is a good read and a lot more helpfull than a civilopedia thingy.As in all civ games you start with a settler and a warrior, the settler is used to found (start up) cities, now however there is one hell of a big thing to reconsider and that is the availabillity of fresh water.You can use map overlays to let you show where the best spot is to found cities, the main rule, the more green, the better. Also different from past games, in order to have a harbor you do not need a coastal city, you can use a district to place one. More of that later.The research is split into 2 groups, one for your basic research (as you are used to in civ 5) and one civics tree. Although I like the concept it is way to easy to advance in both trees. When you play the game you get them EUREKA moments. It is when you, for example, found a city near the water, that you get a boost (50 percent) of a particular science. This is just to powerfull and the sole reason I researched both trees before (LONG BEFORE) I won the game. This needs to be adressed but for new players this will be helpfull because it makes the game easier.The AI in this game is better then CIV BE but thats not hard to accomplish, it simply isnt on par at the moment with what you would have expected after the heralds of wow moments of the online reviewers. AN example, I am in the atomic erra, one of the AI forces (let's say spain) declared war on me, rightfully so because I like to fight, a lot but my friends know that. SO he attacks me, with spearmen, crosbows and pikemen. SO no biggie, I have tanks and bombs, planes and helicopters. They lost, the game is so badly optimized for the AI that I was able to declare war on every singly faction and still won. The AI does  upgrade the units they have, that's a shame.Here is another important change from civ 5, the community seems devided, I myself, am still not sure what I think of it.In Civ 5 you had happiness, or you didnt had any because you took to many wars, here you have amenities. They take some time to get used to, in short you manage city per city and not glabally. In every city you have amenities, they can come from luxaries (spice and diamonds and things like that) or constructions and wonders, you must be made aware that the more cities you have, the harder it is to get the cities in a happy state.The resources (as I have come to understand it, I may be wrong) is that of every resource you get 4 quantities and no more, so the 5th city will need a different resource to make them happy. It is hard to explain but once you play the game it becomes clearish.Now, what I do for dominination victory (you need all capitals for the win) is to raze cities that are NOT important to me, you will NEED to do this when you capture the city because you cant raze a city 5 turns later, thats a huge difference and I like to compare this to civ 4. You can not raze cities that have been capitals.They kinda work the same as in civ 5 but not completely, if you choose a work for them to do (mining, farming etc) they do it INSTANTLY. They can do it (for most civilizations) 3 times at the start of t he game, this can be improved with research later on, I think a max is 5 charges?Once the chargers are used up, the unit dissapears, everytime you use a charge one man will be shown less than a fully charged unit 3 -->2 ---->1 and then nadaThey have added a lot of new units and still I think they could have done more. With research you can now link up to 3 units of the same type in armies (land units) or armada's (sea units)They show this with stars in the shield of the unit. I wish they would have used a different method, one artilliry is one unit and if you link a second artilliry, in my opinion, it should have been visualized as 2 artilleries and then one more for 3 units. Now you get the same representation, one unit but if it is an army, yay, you get 3 stars in its shield. But for the UPT haters this is a nice middleway. I hope modders will add my idea into the game later on.I am tired and will need to end this, to sum some things up that are very unclear to new players:Walls can be build once you have made the proper research, when you have completed the research you can build ancient walls, with these walls your cities can bombard enemies in your land. Without these you are a sitting duck and you will loose cities faster then you can say omg.Now there is a bug I have found, once you have researched a certain civic, walls become obsolete, it doesn't tell you this. You can see this by going into the city build menu and try to build upgrades for your walls (ancient ---> Medieval--->renaissance) They will be greyed out. This happens after researching this civic belowMany ask where the button is to see what and where your units are, they placed it in a rather weird place.At the lower right (after you have clicked a random unit of you on the map, click on the name (for example warrior), a list of your units will pop up.For the moment you can NOT rename cities, this is a weird design on their part, I hope it gets included later on.Renaming units is possible when they have reached level 2, when you click on a unit that has earned a promotion (level 2) you will see a feather, click on that and you will be able to rename your unit and get an achievement in the same process for that :DSo bare this in mind. I will add things later but this massive wall of text is getting out of hand, if you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask me."

The fact that wonders now take up a tile slot adds to this, and the result is that turtling isn't as effective a strategy anymore and one city can't house literally 90% of the world's wonders. District management means planning is paramount.This game launched with few leaders, some of whom were near reskins of existing ones. Firaxis has decided that it's okay to ship the same civ with a different leader, which only changes  of the unique characteristics of a civ, and call that differentiation. The game is also unbalanced. If you don't have DLC, you will always square off against either Sumeria or Scythia in the late-game, because they are extremely powerful civs. If you  have DLC, you will face whatever civ is a DLC civ.Each game feels hardly different than any other because the civ variety is so low. Each game feels like you're fighting the same seven enemies with the same two always coming out on top.Civ VI employs a predatory system of DLC release. DLC civs are objectively more powerful than base-civs, making Civ VI essentially pay-to-win. A  will cost you $5 since it comes bundled with a bunch of useless crap like scenario packs that you'll never play. FURTHERMORE, and this deserves its own paragraph:----------You'll notice that my profile has ~99 hours of gameplay in Civ VI. At least 5 of that is just bug fixing. Here is a list of bugs I have had that is in no way complete, but what I can remember off my head:* Crashing from launch screen* Build/Culture/Bottom-Right button not working at all* Units not moving to the space I click on* Almost every single patch to this game will require you to not only disable, but UNINSTALL FROM THE FILE FOLDER every single piece of Workshop DLC content you have ever downloaded, and chances are you still won't be able to use DLC content even with a reinstallation.* Unit icons not displayingAnd lastly, the single most ugly thing about this entire game, worse even than the frequent crashes, predatory DLC policy, and inability to use Workshop content:Every single time you complete a production, you need to do another. It's incredibly micro-intensive. ""But wait!"" I hear you say, ""I can just get a UI mod from the Workshop to fix that!"" To which I say, no, you can't. Civ VI won't run Workshop content without breaking instantly.Go buy Civ V.Edit: To those that are saying Endless Legend started the district system, they didn't-- at least not as it's used here. Endless Legend's districts allow the city to utilize all benefits of extra tiles or adjacencies. There is nothing preventing you from building any building you want in any city in EL. Civ's district system is innovative because it prohibits building certain buildings without the prerequisite district."

Civ 6 does some things better than Civ 5, like for example the district system, the finished wonder animations, culture, great people, espionage and trade routes. Some things that I liked in Civ 5 are worse in civ 6, like statistics, map, A.I, resources and religion.One thing that might be insignificant to you is the map showing owned water tiles as if they were land tiles. To me that is just a fun killer since I love looking at the map to see the empire I have created. In this system it just looks like a blob instead of an empire.The A.I in Civilization 6 is pure garbage. In one game I played I had declared war ONCE in the entire game. One time in 354 turns (1932 A.D) and every single A.I denounced me for being a warmonger when I did it on like turn 100, and renewed their warmonger denouncements continualy through the rest of the game, despite me not starting a single war since then. I think this is why the A.I for some reason counts wars declared against you as you being a warmonger, which is just beyond stupid.- The A.I is also incapable of fighting human players. All I did to win every single war was to just sit there and do nothing until the A.I gave up. They send like one or two units into my land and that's it. I play on immortal difficulty.- The A.I mocked me by saying my economy was weak and that I would go bankrupt soon...I had the strongest economy in the game.- Diplomacy...I might be overly harsh on this game, but that is only because I have like 2.000 hours on Civ 5, and I'm making a lot of comparisons between Civ 6 and Civ 5. It seems like they're doing the same ""mistake"" they did with Civ 5, where the game was fixed through multiple expensive DLC's.At Civilization 6's current state, I will say you're better off just buying Civilization 5 if you don't have that.This is a subjective review, so treat it as such."

Not until the issues with the AI mechanics have been truly addressed.Civilization is one of my absolute favorite game brands so I was naturally really excited about the Civilization VI and also preordered the game. The reason for my late review is that my laptop unfortunately broke fairly soon after the release and I was without a PC until only very recently. After around a hundred hours I've now reached the conclusion that this game has a few core issues in how the AI acts that make it extremely frustrating and hard for even the most open-minded player to fully enjoy the game. I've tried my very best to overcome the downsides for the sake of the many upsides and enjoy the game. However in the end I just can't overcome the main downside of the game. The graphical design is fantastic and the game packs with many welcomed ideas or enhancements like the districts and new wonder placement, day-night cycle, new city state mechanics and the beautiful drawn map.A major thing the Civilization V was lacking was a proper diplomacy and that's what Firaxis wanted to upgrade in the 6th installment of the series. The ending result was the idea being great but the implementation not that much. In this review I will focus on those few major points that keep me from recommending this game despite how much I love it otherwise.The AI constantly denounces you for unrealistic reasons. A few of them being: ""your military is too weak"", ""you have so much that I do not"" (having one other luxury resource that the AI doesn't), ""you have accuired more great people than I have"", ""you have a different coverment policy than I have"" or ""you haven't spread your religion to my city yet"". It's absolutely frustrating when you try your best to be friendly with the AI but the relationship either starts right off negative or ends up going there very swiftly. In short the AI most of the time thinks and acts like a very close-minded pessimist.The other negative aspect of the game goes hand-in-hand with the issue I mentioned above. All the AI Civilizations are more or less warmongers that seek any possibility to declare war on you. My ""best"" experience was when in a very early game (below turn 50) I met an AI and they immediately declared war on me. This was followed by every other AI in the game (3) declaring war on me one by one during the next couple of turns. Half of these AI's I had not even met yet. What makes the situation more absurd is that every time when you counter the attack of an AI who has declared war on you, the other AI's denounce YOU as a warmonger. ""The world shall know truth about you"". How does that make sense?The recent Australia update supposedly came with minor adjustments and tuning for the AI as well but I honestly can't see much of an improvement. The core issues are still there. Instead of pushing out new DLC for the game I'd hope that Firaxis would patch the base game so it wouldn't feel so unfinished. It is no coincidence that this game has gotten really mixed reviews so far and as a new buyer I would hold my purchase for now. I will gladly change my rating later on when the issues with the AI mechanics have been addressed properly. I love Civilization and it greatly saddens me to give this game a negative review even if it wasn't my final opinion."

The new multi-hex city development is fantastic, a vast improvement on the old ‘single hex’ city. You now have to plan, and think ahead as to how you will develop your city. The way builders now work, while feeling odd at first, now makes sense. Again, a huge improvement.But, and I am afraid it is a big but. Diplomacy. Not only is it childish on occasions, as to why a CIV declares war on you, it blatantly lies to you. Then you get the ‘Diplomacy Spam’. Politely refuse to allow a CIV into your capitol, and they will come back almost every three or four turns and keep asking you. Not annoying and doesn’t break immersion? Try creating a custom single player game with the max allowed A.I. CIVs. It’s verging on unplayable. The full screen displomacy uses, adds to this frustration.Then we have that old chestnut Religion. It’s just not worth the effort to create one. Your cities will get swamped relentlessly, as A.I. CIVs constantly swamp your land in order to convert your cities.CIV VI has the potential to be the greatest CIV game ever. But right now, it’s a long way off and a missed opportunity.As I have to either recommend it or not, I cannot in all honesty fully recommend it. In reality, its somewhere in between the two.EDITOne thing I forgot to mention. The initial civ starting positions. It’s ludicrous. You can have a huge size map but the civs will all be right close in to you. Huge swathes of land will be completely empty. There is no space.Edit 2Religion has indeed improved. That has to be said."

They almost scared me off of this one and I'm glad that they didn't. This is a really good Civ game. Sure, it's not exactly the same as Civ 4 or Civ 5, both very good games in their own right, but it's a lot of fun.I really appreciate all of the unique ways in which the individual Civs stand out from one another. City states are also actually fun to interact with now, as they don't lose influence over time, and each one has a unique bonus that it provides, be it a unique tile improvement or resource boost or what have you.The diplomatic screen is a little easier to navigate, allowing you to jump between other Civs without leaving that interface, which saves a lot of time.The split research and cultural techs make for a fun dichotomy and all of the smaller actions that you can take to speed up research (or gain favor with city states) help to freshen up the gameplay without being overbearing, like the quest system from Beyond Earth.I like that they got creative with support units, such as healers that can help your units recover faster, or balloons that increase the range of your siege units.The districts take a little getting used to, but they aren't as restrictive as I had thought that they would be. You just have to put down a series of similar buildings on one particular tile on the map, which adds a bit of extra strategy to maximize bonuses. There's nothing keeping you from putting down many types of districts for the same city.It's fun and it's got a creative design that keeps the gameplay fresh. Definitely recommended."

The new research system with inspirations granted from doing various tasks is a fantastic idea that should have been in the game a long time ago. The neutral cities giving quests that allow you to curry favour with them, and the resulting benefits, also makes that portion of the game much more worthwhile. Workers having limited charges makes them much more sensible, and with some mods, making them automated helps greatly in the late game.So why the negative review?Three (four?) words.The. AI. SUCKS.You don't notice this early on, because you're too busy being amazed by all of the things they do right. But eventually, once the glamour wears off, it smacks you in the face. You realise that the AI literally can't do anything right. First it's the small things - like, when you're attacking a city, if the city has a unit fortified in it, it won't attack your attackers unless it has other units in the nearby attacking range. Even if the unit is ranged, it will just sit inside and wait, until another one shows up, before attacking.Eventually, though, you start noticing that the AI doesn't actually even play the game. It just sits there and waits for you to react. It never attacks you, unless you're grossly under-defended. And when it attacks, it's painfully easy to wipe the attackers out.Where it really kicks you in the nuts, though, is when you start playing on Emperor difficulty or greater. Read some of the guides online, and you'll realise that the harder difficulties don't actually make the AI better - it just lets the AI cheat. And the way to beat the AI on these harder difficulties, is to basically abuse mechanics as much as possible.Hopefully they eventually fix the AI, because the game really is great. And if you're playing for multiplayer (which I'm not), it quite possibly could already be great. But for now, I have to give this a negative review."

If you want a review of vanilla Civ 6...well its fairly good, but if you are not gonna buy the complete version of Civ 6 you may as well get the complete versions of Civ 4 or Civ 5. They are both better and cheaper than vanilla Civ 6.TL;DR - It can't quite beat Civ 5 in my eyes, which I still consider the peak of the series. A massive roster of civs/leaders/city states, a second tech tree for culture, and fleshed out diplomacy get it close to beating Civ 5, but the janky AI and the loss of most of the grandiose atmosphere that I come to expect from the genre keep it from surpassing it. The huge amount of choices and variety still make it a great game that I highly recommend, as long as you get the complete package.Pros:+  pool of civs to choose from (46 leaders and almost as many civs!). There is more unique stuff for each civ, with a special perk coming from both the civ AND the leader in additional to two (sometimes more) unique ""things"" (units, improvements, buildings, etc). Makes for a ton of stuff to see and use.+ Diplomacy has gotten some really good improvements and refinements. Lots of casus bellis (reasons for war) give you many ways to wage war and take cities without the world treating you like the damn Devil himself for the rest of the game. Several different alliance types that allow you to choose the kind of buffs you want. Personality traits for civs that reveal over the course of the game, some of them randomized, so you are not (usually) universally loved or hated. The world congress is pretty interesting and makes the Diplomatic Victory fairly different from other types.+ Government system. Like with the amount of civs and leaders, the sheer number of options here adds to the variety that is probably Civ 6's greatest strength. A card system with different categories that allows a lot of fine tuning and frequent switching of buffs to whatever your current short term and long term goals are.+ Great people have been turned into unique versions where no two Great Engineers/Scientists/etc are the same. This might be my favorite change from V to VI. It makes for more interesting buffs, especially when you are obtaining many of the same type of great people. Some even give you things separate from the their type (a great general giving you a relic for faith and tourism, a great scientist giving you faith buffs)+ City states are also now completely unique. There are still general types like scientific and religious, but now each and every one has a different suzerain bonus. Buffs from anything to various trade route bonuses to unique military units to adding the ability for your religious units to earn you science.Cons:- Tone. Quotes from techs and wonders have always enhanced Civ and really gave some ambience to wherever you were at in history. It really pains me to say that many of Civ 6's quotes are vapid and moronic and are so detrimental to the grand scale and subject matter of the game that it borders on irreverent. Monty Python quotes and references to having no wifi on mountains do not prop up my feelings of building a grandiose nation in an awe inspiring world. The writing for the leaders is mostly safe from this, but there are a couple lines that make you roll your eyes. Shoutout to the Proverbium mod for muting the narrator and replacing the worst offenders for bad quotes.- AI. This is not the Civ entry that breaks the series' reputation for janky, sometimes braindead AI. I play Civ almost exclusively single player, so its not enough to ruin the game for me by any stretch, but I am disappointed whenever I see the AI throw troops against a wall doing almost zero damage or sticking with an old government when they have newer, objectively more powerful options. Higher difficulties have no effect on this, instead it just gives buffs to your enemies with things like +1 combat strength.- World Map. I adore playing on a real life globe map but in 6, it is locked to a standard size map, which is way too small and I just do not understand the decision to make it that way.- Loss of vertical empires. In Civ 5, having a small amount or large amount of cities were both viable options. This is absolutely not the case in Civ 6. More cities, as long as you don't expand at a reckless speed, is objectively what you want. The so called ""one city challenge"" in 5 wasn't so much of a challenge as in a different way to play. Fun and viable. Trying that in Civ 6 will absolutely cripple you and is pretty much impossible in everything excluding some extremely specific circumstances.Minor stuff:- The leaders have a good amount of animation, but I am just not a big fan of the art style they chose for them. Some of the leaders look wonky, and they all just...stand there with a static image behind them. In Civ 5 you had queens standing near railings of palaces, warlords with the backdrop of a burning city, kings sitting upon their thrones. The animations and different stances bases on your relationship in Civ 6 cannot compete with that. I was also disappointed to see some reused animations for newer leaders.- Music. I guess its a mixed bag. In particular some of the newer Civs brought some good music, but as a whole its rather average (with some poor songs) and can get grating with the frequency of replayed tracks.+/- Religion/religious victory. Alright I guess it isn't ""minor"" but I have a mixed opinion on it. More victory types are always good, and religious combat makes for a less passive victory type, but it can be very easy to obtain and can happen in a flash.+ You can place pins on the map for things like ""settle here"" or reminders like ""declare war on turn 108"". There is also a search bar to look for and highlight things like particular resources. They are wonderful quality of life additions that you will quickly learn to rely on.+/-/? Multiplayer. I have played very little, but I can assure you it works fairly well (I remember the dark days where Civ 5 MP was straight up unplayable...) The limitation of playing the two largest map types hurts though. Also there is a battle royale mode. I haven't tried it, but it did just get updated, so I guess it wasn't the flash-in-the-pan mode it sounded like to me."

Though I'd say Civ 4 and 5 are probably a ton of fun as well.For ""veterans"", this is a . Not because of AI/Diplomacy, which have been rightly criticized; rather because of stupid mechanics. One word: tedious.- city building and planning (districts <3)- the added culture tree- government cards could be refined but the idea isn't too bad- builders charges- AI- diplomacy and agendas (omg wtf it's awful)- religion (100% not worth the investment)- stupid mechanics: where is the fun? (for me at least)My analysis is this: the game has very tedious-to-optimize mechanics alongside a general lack of challenge. This awesome ""combo"" makes you feel like you're  without the sense of  that comes from overcoming difficult odds.Two examples below:Upon realizing specific actions (eg. building three archers), you get a massive reduction in a specific tech cost (50% or 40% of the tech). This is available for every science and culture tech in the game.The way the feature was introduced by Firaxis, it seemed that it would allow for civs to go faster upon certain tech routes (for example, sea-related techs for the Vikings) thus making every game different depending on what happens in your game, where you start, who you encounter... I would call it an ""organic evolution"" of your civ depending on the context you're in. Sounds good! Sounds like a ton of replayability!Now let's look at this from the ""optimizer"" perspective, that is, players who cannot play a game without trying to exploit every mechanic in the best way possible (that would be me). Of  we are going to try to get every eureka and inspiration: it's A 50% REDUCTION IN TECH COST, FOR DUCK'S SAKE!! EVEN THE BEST BUILDINGS DON'T DOUBLE SCIENCE YIELDS. But getting these eurekas/inspirations is tedious (each one has a very specific trigger). So you go along the tech tree, researching 50% of every tech BUT NO MORE because you don't wait to forfeit your 50% reduction. You just switch techs everytime you reach 50%.This is not fun. This is the opposite of fun. I'm certain this is not the way Firaxis intended this mechanic to be used in.There are hidden formulas within the game (WHY hide this information from me?). As an example, : if you got 50 tech, the district cost will be much higher than when you had researched 13 techs. In and of itself, it doesn't sound too good already, does it?BUT THERE'S A TWIST: if you place your district on the map (by launching production), it locks the cost! So, the Optimizer will place every district as early as possible, then immediately switch production to more sensible things (like military units), just in order to avoid the cost increasing with tech. STUPID STUPID STUPID mechanic.It also makes founding new cities completely not worth it past a certain amount of turn (because local production will never be able to afford building the increased-cost districts).I know it's easy to talk trash on a game that I've spent 80 hours on and end up not recommending. So, here are my two cents on how to make the game better.1) get rid of the eurekas and inspirations OR make the requirements harder to attain so that you aren't tempted to go after all the bonus2) improve military AI so as to make the AI an actual danger3) improve diplomacy so that the AI understands it is playing a game that they want to WIN. With this mindset, allying the player can be very beneficial if it helps overcoming a stronger opponent or eating part of their empire.Currently, every civ will hate your gut for conquering that tiny Roman 2-pop city after Trajan declared war ON YOU. From that moment on, don't ever hope to ally anyone, because you're a badass WARMONGER in the eyes of the whole world. Let that sink in for a minute.4) get rid of the ""agendas"", open or hidden. It's stupid. The AI shouldn't hate you or love you depending on set-in-stone conditions related to (a)historical facts, rather they should assess the situation they are in and how allying or warring you makes them come closer to their own victory5) rebalance the whole game: religion, tourism can safely be ignored 100% of the time. Military, maybe science are the only viable options. Civs are also wildly unbalanced.6) Religious combat isn't right. Missionaries have always been tedious to manage. Why make it a unit? Rather, let us manage religion through a dedicated screen, that would allow us to specify what city we want to target. No more going around the map, that's tedious.7) Have a sensible formula for district cost8) Don't hide formulas from the playerThank you for your time.Your hateful comments will be disbanded. I don't care about your ""freedom of speech"", I do care about my feelings.Fair criticism is always welcome, I love being proven wrong (I absolutely mean it, no sarcasm)."

In short, Firaxis believes it can milk its consumers for all they're worth, charging players repeatedly *after* the initial purchase for each civilization and a couple maps. Whoever made this decision clearly doesn't understand its fanbase; we are not Call of Duty players who will put up with this type of abuse for years on end without speaking up. There is something terribly wrong with the concept of creating a game, gutting half its content, and ransoming it back to the fanbase. Fix this or risk losing future financial support."

Sometimes the reworking benefits the game. Sometimes it doesn't.Civilization VI is not the best Civilization game of the whole series, in my opinion.But is it a *bad* game, worthy of all these negative reviews? Certainly not.Like every other Civilization game, it's a well produced, well executed 4X game by a studio that very much knows what they're doing with this genre. There are some improvements over previous Civilization games. There are some changes in how particular systems or game mechanics work.In some - but not many - regards, it feels like the game has regressed a little bit. The AI is poor, let's face it. The DLC model is bullshít - having to pay for individual civs is just rude.Is this the greatest 4X game ever? No. Is this the best Civ game? Probably not. Is it as good as Civ V? I'd say no personally, but at least it's different, unlike Civilization: Beyond Earth, which was just a reskinned Civ V.But **is it a bad game?** No. It isn't. You really can ignore many of these entitled reviews hating on this game just because they made changes that they don't like. It's a decent, polished 4X game that isn't perfect, but for anyone who enjoys games like this there are plenty of hours of gameplay to be had.If you own Civ V and loved it, but you're now bored of it, Civ VI is definitely worth a go. If you haven't played Civ V but want to try a Civilization game, go play that instead."

If you're new to the series, definitely play those instead, or if not, go for Endless Legend, why not. All three are better experiences than Civ VI. The Civilization series should be well-known to all gamers, but not everyone has actually played the games. The groundlayer of the turn-based 4X-genre, Civilization takes a player, and his empire, from the Stone Age to the Information Age, with the player making decisions on where to focus in terms of scientific research, military development, cultural progress, expansion, and many other factors. Every game is different, not just in terms of player-determined settings, but also in terms of map layout, rival civs, etcetera. Civ VI improves one thing greatly compared to its predecessors, and that is city development. The Districs system really forces you to think, and to specialize. Gone are the days of a single city building every improvement and Wonder. It's just not possible anymore, and that's a good thing. With the districts-system, Science and Production are no longer the be-all, end-all of games which need to be focused on primarily.Barbarians are no longer the pointless annoyances they were in the previous games. They're much deadlier now, and every civ needs to stay on its toes. This definitely gives the barbarians-element some much needed relevance.A few other nice improvements made it to Civ VI, including military/noncombatant escort formations (finally!), expendable builders (which deals with unit clutter), mix-and-match cultural policies, and Eureka!-boosts for techs and civics, earned by fulfilling all kinds of mini-tasks. Now, if they'd just stuck to that, Civ VI would have been a straight-up improvement over VI, but sadly, there's a lot to discuss when I point out... With all the desire for innovation and change, Civ VI trips over itself in quite a few departments, in same cases making the game frustrating and irritating to play.The diplomacy system is, for want of a better word, a complete disgrace. Rival Civs will all, without exception, viciously loathe each other, including you, denouncing each other and you as often as they can, even when you've done them absolutely no wrong. One Civ had several diplomacy bonuses from good relations, but still declared me filth because we had a different system of government. Meanwhile, the A.I. leaders will not stop spamming you with pointless messages every turn, and because they, for some reason, need to slowly fade out twice, it's an infuriating habit which costs you a lot of time and has no benefit at all.You might as well never bother with trade deals either. The AI will never, ever agree to a trade deal, nor suggest one, which doesn't favour them at least 3:1, even if they are pathetically weak. Their deals are nothing short of extortionate, and all they do is waste your time with more pointless interruptions, because you'd never, ever accept any of their deals anyway. As for espionage, well, expect all the A.I. opponents to focus only on you, sabotaging your Industrial Zones relentlessly, causing you to gnash your teeth as you waste yet more turns rebuilding things.What few friends you have will, guaranteed, suddenly declare war on you for no reason at all, even though they're much weaker than you are and have nothing to gain from the conflict. And then, within ten turns, they'll come begging on their knees for peace. Refuse, and the entire world will hate you even more for being a warmonger. That's right, you will be a warmongering menace to the world even if you never once declare war. Having war declared on you and defending yourself is apparently an atrocity. This kind of system makes a player wonder if this game was even playtested at all.In fact, it's not just diplomacy, really. The A.I. in general is often downright moronic.The choice of art style, as well as the writing, are questionable to say the least. While it's true that Civ V was high on realism, and therefore seriousness, Civ VI has taken to the other extreme. The art style is jarringly cartoony, with leaders looking like caricatures and the map nauseatingly green and yellow, the UI is ugly with oversaturated colours, and the educational quotes that came with tech discoveries have been replaced with cringey pseudo-witty pop culture soundbites from comedians and other assorted funny-people. Not even Sean Bean's excellent narration can save the writing from being eye-rollingly lame. All things combined, Civ VI has the look of one of those crappy mobile games.Lastly, the Civilipedia isn't much help. The game neglects to explain a lot of things and looking them up in the Civilipedia doesn't help one bit. You're supposed to smell that you can only build a single Archaelogist per city that has an archaeology museum, for instance. Often, building options will be grayed out without any explanation as to why. And don't get me started on National Parks. Ugh.And of course, once more, many civilizations and mechanics are not present, or in a bare-bones way, which means Firaxis has once more held back things which were present in the previous game, only to release them in expensive DLC packs. It's a nasty habit, and every game developer should ask itself some serious questions when it resorts to deliberately holding back game content to be able to release it as DLC later. Civ VI has some good ideas, but its positive elements don't come close to making it as good as Civ IV or Civ V. It's certainly not a bad game, but as an entry in the Civilization series, it falls far short of the standards the franchise holds itself to. Seriously, get the previous Civs instead, or if you've played those, give Endless Legend a go."

You can really see the potential in this game, but there's still just so many little things missing or buggy that drive you nuts.And as always, the AI is dumb as rocks.  They keep making the combat engine more and more complicated without adapting the AI to handle it at all.  As a result, you can win wars with maybe 4-5 units.  The AI is just not good enough to handle the system.  All the depth of the combat mechanics just aren't satisfying because of this.  It's like beating a dog in Chess.  Your great strategy and tactics are simply wasted on an opponent that has no idea what it's doing.And a full year after release, there are still missing hotkeys for actions you will do *EVERY TURN*.  The art is gorgeous.  The soundtrack is amazing.  The district system and the armies/fleets system show so much promise.  But the game's just not deep enough, and the AI so poor that it's simply not enjoyable after one or two playthroughs.  I cranked the difficulty up to diety on my 2nd playthrough, and still got bored and quit 200 turns in because of how far ahead of the AI I was.  I played on Emperor in civ5, and I think Monarch in civ4.  It's not like I've magically gotten better at the game.  The AI is just *that* bad.  It is utterly incapable of threatening you militarily, and does not know how to pursue win conditions at all.Again, there's a TON of potential.  Really disappointing game as it stands though.  Maybe with a couple of expansions it'll reach its full potential, but until then I cannot recommend this game.UPDATE:  As of June 2020 and playing the game with the expansions, my review remains mostly unchanged.  I've gotten a solid 100 hours in the game now so take that for what it's worth, but my main problem continues to be the AI.  The expansions have added some super cool systems and again the game continues to have a ton of depth to it... but the AI simply cannot play the game.  They still place their cities seemingly at random, put districts in random places, shuffle their units mindlessly, and make no effort at all to prevent you from winning the game. I recently completed a game on Immortal and two of the AIs were not eliminated, but effectively removed from the game by barbarians.  When I finally scouted their lands, everything in sight was pillaged and they had not a single unit to speak of.  So many good ideas in this game but ultimately you are still playing Chess against a bunch of dogs.  None of the depth of the game truly feels rewarding when the AI continues to throw warriors and arches at you 150 turns into the game."

I've had very few technical issues (game hanging upon exit being the only one) and I can understand why those are generally hard to track down, but UI elements getting stuck, being declared war on by a civ you have not yet met or by your own civ, both Greek civs being able to have the same leader in the same game, diplomacy faux pas penalties despite no transgressions, war weariness not decreasing, painfully obvious production -> gold exploits? These are things that should not make it into the final game, or in worst case be fixed with a release day patch.Significantly worse though is the atrocious AI. I was playing as China, had built a desert hills city where I builder rushed Petra, two turns after it's completed Scythia turns up with an army of horsemen, the city has no fortifications and not a single unit within five-six turns of brisk march. Welp, that city's clearly done for... except the horsemen proceed to parade up and down the flood plains, both city-side and not, rather than bang their heads against my non-existant walls and taking that (better than Civ V pre-nerf power level) sweet sweet wonder. I find an archer somewhere that starts taking pot shots at the horsies, a few turns later I can buy ancient walls and a crossbowman joins the archer and fifteen turns later the riverbank is red with horse- and manblood. Not a single horseman ever attacked the city. I meet Russia, they're so impressed by my culture and science and everything else (they were at least an age, propably two behind me) they want to be bestest friends forever and five turns later they hate me and declare war. Then nothing. More nothing. Twenty turns later a spearman appears. Then two more. Then Tsar Peter offers me the entire russian state earnings and his own personal allowance to please stop the bloodshed. Had he used that money in some other fashion, such as actually funding an army to attack me with the game could have been somewhat challenging.And that's a huge problem, the AI is so bad it makes the game far too easy, and when I as a player make mistakes I'm not punished for them - I'm actually rewarded no matter if I play well or poorly.The barbarian AI is largely far better, which is hilarious in it's own way. Start a large or huge pangea map, plod around for 20-30 turns and you'll typically see several of the other civs succumb to barbarian invasion. Maybe the barbarian AI developers should have a chat with their civ AI colleagues, because the former beats the latter hands down every time.Lastly there's a glaring lack of what I'll categorize as ""interface features"". There's no Civ V-esque option to see terrain tiles clearly separated, because honestly woods and rain forest blend together real well under the fog of war in explored territory, separate desert from plains same story. Hills can be deciphered using the strategic view but otherwise can be tricky to spot. The civilopedia is half-baked at best, not explaining alot of game features and details. Unit stats are scarce, there's melee strength, ranged/bombard, movement, and then there's ""excellent against mounted units"" without any actual numbers, unless you train the unit and there's a mounted unit you can feign an attack on to get the tooltip stats (which are excellent). Why can't I be allowed to see those stats before training the unit? There's no ""restart game"" feature like was added in Civ V after player requests. When starting a new game, the game always uses the same settings (small continents) instead of the settings you last set.Want to use your city attack against that invading knight when you have three other units stationed in the city? How about just clicking on the city with units stationed? Better work on your scroll wheel micro, because you need to zoom in/out a bit to simply be able to click the city instead of something else. Want to see religious follower stats without clicking on a religious unit? Sorry, can't do without clicking on each city.The game is extremely well polished in the art/music deparment, one might not enjoy the style or agree with some of the choices but that's an esthetic choice, not a flaw of the game. The intro movie is absolutely awesome and these set the bar for a great gaming experience. As long as the experience I get is a mediocre one and the AI keep tripping on it's own shoelaces I cannot recommend others paying money for Civ VI. I have no doubt the game will see a string of patches in the near future, but the game needs an AI overhaul to stand the test of time."

Really, this game isn't worth your time... Get Civ V instead - it's a far superior game...My key issues are as follows:1) The AI repeatedly declares war, sends nothing to attack you, then begs for peace some turns later prostrating themselves before you with offerings of gold and luxuries.2) When at war with the AI, they never attack. I remember playing Civ IV, and seeing armies building up on my border before the AI declares war. No behaviour of that sort is to be seen here.3) The AI is schizophrenic and utterly moronic. They will condemn you for warmongering, while frequently attempting to encourage you to join in their wars. Involving yourself in even a single war during an otherwise peaceful playthrough can lead to unanimous loathing from the AI, with constant denouncements being shouted at you.4) The AI never uses aircraft...5) The AI settles cities in any location they can, and leaves them completely undefended. The AI does not choose efficient locations for city building, and thus irritates that player into having to declare war in order to raze the cities and more efficiently use the land.6) The victory screen statistics are total garbage. There is no map replay.7) The UI feels a bit awkward, with various essential tools seemingly overlooked. There is, for example, no list of all units. If you want to find your builders, you must do this manually by scrolling over your empire. A further oversight is the lack of a global politics overview. If you want to know who is at war with whom, you must ""speak"" to each leader in turn, and look at their current relationships.Complaints aside, however, I have to say that this game is looks stunning - it is rich in detail and vivid in colour, and the wonder animations are an absolute delight. The sound design is fantastic, and music is memorable and quite beautiful. The new district system is absolute genius - making the process of building and laying out a city a substantially more interesting and nuanced process compared to Civ V. It's a terrible shame that the AI is just such garbage - it ruins the game. I used to play ""comp stomps"" with my friends on a fairly regular basis, but doing so in Civ VI would be a waste of time.Edit:Some people have suggested that I play the game on harder difficulties, but my understanding is that higher difficulty levels simply add a multiplier to the AI's output (e.g. they get a 2x production multiplier so that they can always outproduce you), and does not affect their behaviour. Since my biggest problem with the game is its broken AI, playing on harder difficulties simply gives them an advantage, but does not make them ""smarter"".Additionally, I think it's valid to compare the game to Civ V. I played Civ V from its initial 'vanilla' release, and (I realise that I'm referencing personal memories from ~6 years ago) do not recall being as disappointed with the AI after making the jump from the mature game of Civ IV to the then new game of Civ V. Therefore, I stand by my statement that Civ V is a better game. It is not more content that I desire, but a challenging, intelligent AI.Edit 2:While I was not impressed with the game at launch, it has improved considerably!"

Here is a run through on some similarities and differences:- City Building: Probably the biggest difference is the way a city and civilization expands, in Civ V you could simply build whatever structure your city needed granting the appropriate yield to science, happiness, gold, production etc.. In Civ VI you are, in a way, limited on what you can build in any one city. Virtually all boosts to research, culture, happiness, production are found through building ""districts"". Districts are only made available at certain population targets throughout your cities maturation, in addition these districts must be built on an appropriate tile therefor if you don't have the required space to build you are unfortunately unable to. Multiple new factors also effect your city such as housing and amenity's, without them your city doesn't function at an optimal level and each can be increase based on different base city center structures and district structures. - Research and Technology Tree: This process is virtually the same which is refreshing, nothing new to learn.- AI Interaction: This is mostly the same, however they've replaced the embassy with trade delegations as ""foot in the door"" technique with other civilizations. This may also just be my experience but it does also seem that AI leaders sour towards you rather quickly compared to Civ V.- Cultural Policies: This is disappointing. They've completely removed the Cultural Policies tree from the game and replaced it with a system in which you choose individual card boosts from specific categories (Military, Economic, Diplomatic and Wildcard). Now this system can be equally as formidable but it definitely isn't the same, as your civilization grows and you learn new forms of government additional slots will open based on the path you choose. For example the Monarchy government gives you 2 military card slots, 1 economic card slot, 1 diplomatic card slot and 2 wildcard slots. - Religion: Again, this is pretty much unchanged similarly to the research and tech tree. Nice not having to learn a ton of new features.- City States: This is an entirely new system that plays off of the type of government you have in place. Each government type grants envoy points and as you get into higher tiers the more that are granted. City states are mostly used as boosts to your own civilization, as you send envoy's to each you will be given a certain status with each city state as your status increases so does the benefit (boost to production, religion, culture, etc..). To reach the maximum influence level with a city state it generally takes 6 envoys at which point you are declared the suzerain of that city state, however if another civilization has 6 or more envoys there you will have to continue to send envoys until you have more within the city state to achieve the title of suzerain. One additional benefit in becoming the suzerain of a city state is the ability to levy their army for a listed figure (usually 400-500 gold), can help if you're in a pinch.- World Congress: Sadly, this no longer exists. They attempted to bring it back in their recent DLC's but it truly is a sad attempt at what was in my opinion a truly great feature. Gone are the worlds fairs as we once knew, nuclear proliferation, embargos, etc.. This also plays into the difference in City States as you no longer ally them to gain standing at the world congress. These are some of the main similarities and differences I've discerned in my time playing both versions of this wonderful game. I would say if you enjoy Civ V then Civ VI is definitely worth your time, the game runs much smoother and appears much cleaner then the previous version. This however I would recommend you catch on sale as it, in my opinion, is not worthy of the full price cost."

However, there are some serious problems regarding the AI - namely the fact that they are either petty, incredibly spontaneous, or both. The unique modifiers for each civ leader disregard capability, so the Dutch with insult and berate you for not being able to trade with them when they're on the other side of the world. They will also declare wars against you without any sort of warning, despite the display showing that they are friendly towards you. Lying civ displays was a thing back in V as well, but here it feels arbitrary and a constant frustration when your neighbors (and everyone else) suddenly declares two, four, or even six separate wars against you without any sort of real discourse. The only time a civ will demand something from you is when they are displeased with you, but know they can't win a war. The whole system makes their ""poker faces"" seem more like a game of Guess Who when the other player keeps changing their character.Map generation is oversimplified compared to Civ V, which allowed for a variety of different map types. In VI, however, you have less than ten different map types not counting the fairly minor variable modifiers. With how the Eureka and Inspiration systems work, you could easily find yourself trying to play a military civ without have any iron or horses spawning near you, resulting in a far slower tech development than those lucky enough to do so. This also happens with two of the earlier technologies, which require you to find a second continent and find a natural wonder respectively - both of which you could be easily screwed out of by no fault of your own. This leads to maps boiling down to one of a small variety. Good starts, bad starts, and unwinnable starts. Yes, those can happen - if you end up next to a horribly aggressive enemy or get cornered by barbarians, you can basically kiss your starting point goodbye, because the AI will quickly leapfrog ahead of you. On that note, Barbarians are horribly annoying in the early game, but are basically required for the Eurekas for most starting military techs. If a barbarian scout locates your city and gets back to a nearby encampment - and with a movement range of 3, that's more likely than not - you're going to find a raiding army of three units heading towards where you settled. Note that this likely happens right out of the gate, resulting in you having to put all of your development building military units so you can actually build and expand without your units being killed or abducted. The worst part, however, are barbarians that encamp near horses. Those barbarians spawn Horsemen and Horse Archers, a barbarian specific unit that is both far more mobile than their grounded counterpart but also much stronger. And you don't get the Eureka for the technology to make spearmen until you kill three barbarians total. This is even worse in slower games, because barbarians spawn much faster than you can make military units to fight them off due to the barbarian spawning not scaling to the slower game speed.Religion, which was only added later in the life cycle of Civ V, is in the base game, but it is extraordinarily tedious and frustrating. The AI will pursue religion with a crazy furvor, using every single faith point it has in the most efficient way it knows how, making competing against them to get a Religious Victory a trial of tedium. In fact, the easiest way to win a Religious victory is to actually go for a military victory. Cities burned or captured and Inquisitioned are much easier to deal with than trying to work the arcane Religious Combat system or throwing Missionaries and Apostles at any city who doesn't follow you over and over. It wasn't even until Rise & Fall was added did they allow your military units to stop religious units, who would before then just walk right through your lines and provide scouting and intelligence.Honestly, it's not a bad game. But it is disappointing, poorly balanced, and if you want to just play a fun round you may end up hitting that Restart button more than a few times. Hold off on it for a sale, at the very least."

Cities settled after the first two eras are prohibitively expensive in the name of boosting ""tall"" play, but the game still heavily favors infinite city spam ALA never stop expanding.  The focus is on hardcore chopping of bonus resources/forests to brute force these 100+ turn districts on new cities. And if the city doesn't have forests/stone to harvest... just hope your trade routes complete soon so you can barrage the settlement with caravans to boost production. So it's entirely possible to ignore the arbitrary balance aspect here and just brute force past it. Combined with the Eureka system and very powerful key techs to research, every game really does feel homogenized as you really don't vary your playstyle much between civs. You beeline the same specific techs to unlock a huge power boost while keeping district scaling low with few variations due to unique units and buildings. This means building the same units and doing the same actions to trigger the same eurekas every game... and spam, spam, spam the settlers and chop, chop, chop the woods. So for the most part, it's ""X victory beeline order, Y victory beeline order, z victory beeline order..."" with tweaks to take account for UU/UB. And again, the same actions and build orders to trigger the same eurekas are near universal across these. Edit 2: The DLC civs are almost all OP. Especially in the Frontier Pass, but the trend started earlier.  All semblance of balance is thrown out as the newer civs almost always tend to be obscenely OP.  Like the Babylonians? They get 100% tech completely from a Eureka.  You were already making a priority of these, and it just makes tech progress stupidly fast... especially since you can largely ignore your science yields and rely on brute force Eurekas... especially if you get a science alliance and really leverage spies. They can steal Eurekas... that give you 100% tech progress as Babylon... you straight up steal tech. Babylon can ignore science yields and still be 100 turns ahead of everyone else in research. Simply put, I cannot recommend the game right now.  It's getting patches every season, but the game is in need of some serious and fundamental polishing that firaxis typically only adds in ""major"" expansions.  Its no where near as bad as Civ V was at launch, but some things are pretty unbalanced still.  (I won't touch on the terrible diplomacy as its been beaten to death, ressurected, then beaten right back down into red paste)My main gripes revolve around research, production, and districts.  For one thing, research happens far too quickly.  This is especially bad since the game is so stingy on giving you means to increase your production.  By the time you reserach, build, and field a unit its practically obsolete.   So how do you solve the production hassle? By building a production district! Yet districts get more and more prohibitively expensive as the game progresses.  It doesn't take long at all for them to start rivavling... and then surpassing... wonders.  Yet these are things we are supposed to be building 2-5 per city! There are 12 districts you can build, so you are supposed to choose wisely and specialize your districts.  This one is near the mountains and will make a great research district! Or perhaps your people will find inspiration within the sacred peaks as you build a temple nearby? Well... the answer is actually neither.The crux of hte issue is that these districts increase in cost for every technology you research.  So if you jump straight into the early research district? You are just shooting yourself in the foot.  Research is already too quick and districts already too expensive to build without making things worse by trying to get an early science lead.  So instead of giving us very cheap costs to build a city's first district and making each successive district more and more prohibitively expensive (you know, to meet their actual design goal of specialized cities), you get punished for researching.  That mid game city you founded to secure a source of oil? Good luck doing anything with it when it takes 100 turns to build a single district! The workaround is actually trade routes.  You get an extra one for every harbor or commerce district you build.  Set up all your trade routes as INTERNAL and you gain a substantial production boost.  This is the second reason why the concept is broken.  Instead of specializing cities and being choosey about your districts, everyone just builds a commercial/harbor district first to get that trade route.  So they can get some desperately needed production to build anything at all in any of their cities.  So instead of specializing your cities, you are just building the same district over and over and over and over again.  Every game its the same.  Whatever victory condition you are actually going for will just have to be the second or third district built.  Science is too fast, which skyrockets district costs.  Districts that are needed to build virtually anything worthwhile in the game.Thus, my hope is that they will give a much needed reblance to these systems in a future major expansion.  Then the game will get an ultimate edition that packages all the cash-grab DLC together, with the needed expansion(s), for a reasonable price.  If you really need a Civ fix until them, just replay V. Try some of the mods!"

I love the way cities are organised ingame (especially when compared to the spray paint city tool of Civ 5). Roads actually connect in meaningful ways rather than cutting through everything and creating unwanted super roundabouts. There's a day/night cycle and cities light up when it gets dark. Flocks of birds travel the map and there are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chickens wandering around the granaries. With all the details, the world feels much more alive in comparison to the one within Civ 5 and sometimes I just sit there looking at the screen because of it.- The animations are superb and smooth!- The district system is a welcome addition in my opinion and it adds a lot of depth to the game.- City-states are easy to manage and aren't a complete chore like the ones in Civ 5.- The Barbarians can ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annihilate you if you're not careful. They're more of a threat than an annoyance which is actually fun.- The new policy and government system is good fun!- Being able to organise troops into corps and armies is a very nice addition and helps to simplify combat gameplay.- There are some aspects of the AI that have improved from the previous game, but... Cons- Boy can the AI make some stupid decisions. Sometimes spontaneous war can be enjoyable, but when the civ declaring the war has absolutely nothing to gain from it and won't even bother to show up, it's just annoying.- The Agenda System. Great idea, but I feel some of the agendas are stupid and sometimes the penalties are way too high. For example, Ceopatra hates civs that don't have a large army, so if you're not focusing on troop production early on, she'll probably denounce you and declare war on you and every other civilization that doesn't meet her stupid standards. She basically spawns into the game hating a buttload of other civs. The penalties are way to high, and because a lot of the agendas clash in some way, everybody starts hating eachother except Ghandi.- Casus Belli. Another awesome idea, but it didn't really make it easier to declare war without gaining warmonger penalties. For example, in one game Ghandi was converting all of my ♥♥♥♥ to his religion so I decided to declare a holy war on his ass. This Casus Belli gave me a medium warmonger penalty which I thought would be easy to manage, but as soon as I declared the holy war everybody hated me and denounced me and I lost 14 points to each relationship. So for me, the warmongering penalties are way too high and need to be adjusted.- Theological combat. Again, another cool idea but there isn't enough depth to it. Since there are only 3 religious units, there's not a lot of strategy involved, especially if you're up against Ghandi's theocracy and his religion focused entirely on theological combat. When he came in with that wave of apostles (knowing that the warmonger penalty for holy war was too high), all I could do was wait until he converted everything and remove all the heresy after. Maybe if there were more units and terrain modifiers this could be fun, but for me it just wasted screen space.- It's insanely easy to win a cultural victory. The first time a played I won a cultural victory but I wasn't even aiming for it. I feel like this has something to do with the crazy culture boost from launching a rocket and the fact that you need to focus on culture for a bit in order to get the really juicy policies. It gets the point where in order to get a scientific victory you need to actively neglect your culture and tourism output. This definitely needs a bit of tweaking.What else can I say? This game was fun to play the first couple of times, but with these issues present I don't really feel like playing it more. I want to have alliances clashing over scarce resources and not everybody hating each other because they want more wonders or because they won't bother to settle on my continent. In my opinion there are a lot of small issues that have a big impact on the game, and I can't really recommend it until they are fixed."

I've decided to leave a ""not recommended"" review on the basis of the following issues which have, for the life of the game, prohibited my complete enjoyment of it. First some good things. I think the art style is fine, though many prefer Civ V’s art style. I do wish hills were a little easier to see. I think the district system has largely been well made. It encourages forward thinking and creative placements of cities where you get good early tiles to work while preserving good spots for various districts later. Some people will not prefer it, preferring instead to focus on improving tiles. I think the spy system is well integrated with districts, giving you a lot of flexibility for disrupting enemy plans. The City-states are fun and diverse. The wonders (both natural and built) are all fairly powerful and neat to build and see in your empire. I think the movement changes from Civ V to VI are fine. You explore the map more slowly, but it makes more intuitive sense from a realism standpoint and feels less game-y. Combat (outside of the horrible AI) is more interesting than Civ V. The movement changes and introduction of corps and armies adds some much-needed pacing to combat, especially early on. In Civ V, combat was all very zerg-heavy (declare war, blast them away before they can react). Going ""wide"" is more viable than in Civ V but going ""tall"" can be tricky (new Civs are better at this, I haven't had as much experience with them yet.)I think they have reached, after many years, a decent balance with war-weariness and diplomacy (though the AI never seem as hostile towards each other as they are to you for some grievances). Early in the game’s life-cycle, AI were duplicitous traitors with whom you could not form lasting relationships—no longer the case. The Bad:1) The games systems are much more integrated with each other than previous Civ titles, which makes planning out a strategy more cohesive but eliminates the modularity of the game. Because the systems are all so integrated with one another, if you modify the kind of game you want to play for some variety you are left with some broken artifacts like tech and civics boosts which are now impossible. For instance, barbarians in this game are much more of a nuisance than in the previous title, Civ V, which is not inherently bad given that they were basically meaningless in most of that game’s life, but if you want to turn off Barbarians it messes up other systems in the game, particularly the tech and civics boosts which require feats like “kill 3 barbarians” or “clear a barbarian camp.” On top of this, without barbs you are nearly guaranteed an early dark age. In fact, its better to leave Barbs on for another reason, namely that at higher difficulty the AI deals with them more poorly than you do so it can help you out, even though they are annoying. So you’re left with this annoying system, which is integrated pretty strongly into other systems early. Barbs are one example, but the whole game has integration like this, making customization and even modding more onerous. In previous titles, you could make interesting custom games but in this game as you turn on and off settings other systems break easily. To compensate, they have added new modes like crazy meteor storms and frequent weather disruptions and stuff to instigate chaos (and they’re planning to add a mode which shuffles the tech and civics trees). I don’t really like these, because I’m often trying to create a specific sort of game for my mood, not just generate wild experiences. I don't think Civ is a series which lends itself to these kind of ""crazy"" modes, since much of the game is in the planning (not reacting) to events. Let me be clear, reaction based strategy gameplay does work (darkest dungeon is one of my absolute favorite games), but not as much here.2) the AI issue raises my next point. AI in this series has been getting progressively worse since Civ iv, and this game takes the cake. For 3 expansions players have cried for improved AI but the AI is just as dumb as ever. Rather than fix the AI, each successive Civ game has just frontloaded the difficulty, by which I mean that the difficulty in the game emerges from giving the AI enormous starting advantages which, once overcome, are never really are a threat to you again. The effect of this is a very unbalanced play experience where early game wars are extremely difficult but late game wars are easy. This problem persists in all of my games, regardless of the victory condition I aim for. I never feel like the AI has done something crafty or attacked a vulnerability in my strategy for a cheeky win. They either overwhelm you with numbers or crumble. They are abysmal at combat, they do not play or act like humans, and negotiating with them is a chore. Once again, it is not possible to tell them to not forward settle you. The AI will place bad cities (for them) in the middle of your territory, providing more annoyance for no reason. You can tell them to stop sending religious units, but they will ignore you. 3) That brings me to my last concern, religion. The Religion system in this game is not fun. It is very tedious in single player and relatively pointless in multiplayer. In single player, I usually turn religious victories off because fighting the AI’s waves of religious units bogs the game down incredibly. They absolutely spam the hell out of religious units, which does not do the turn timer any favors as later turns get longer and longer, requiring more processing power while the AI shuffle their huge fleets of religious units. Like with regular combat, they fight religious wars not with tactics but with sheer overwhelming numbers which is a pain to deal with. It’s difficult to start a religion in higher difficulties, because the AI get such an enormous early advantage and the total number of religions allowed in a game is limited. Religious units can be killed by regular war units (after declaring war), meaning that in multiplayer a religious victory is nearly impossible and religion is pursued simply for the inherent buffs it gives in your own territory which are hardly worth it since most of them are buffs to the spreading of your religion in the first place. Thankfully, you can just turn off religion victory and ignore it; but that doesn't solve the AI spending huge amounts of time and resources (both in-game and computationally) shuffling around dozens of religious units each. I think it is indicative that the developers know the system is weak given its relative lack of integration compared to other systems.On top of this, the expansions as I have bought them are almost always a good deal only once they go on sale. The raw content of the expansion (which often just amounts to fixes of previously bad design decisions) is not worth $40. They feel more like DLC than fully fleshed out expansions. If money is tight, which it has been these last years of my life, this game's cost has been a bit prohibitive. I think the team at Firaxis is pretty good at listening to fan feedback, but they seem to be limited in their capacity to fix some issues which I'm sure they are aware of (AI), probably due to budgetary restrictions and so on.I just want to end by saying I know that my issues with the game are mostly subjective, and I have had fun with the game despite these issues. However, enough of the game systems are outright annoying that the game feels really frustrating and sloggish to play, and because they're integrated so heavily, hard to deal with or even mod out. Civ V has a robust mod archive and even years later provides as much as this game for less money-- so I would encourage people to consider which one they want to pick up."

It remedied many of its shortcomings, except the art-style. For my part, I still prefer the nearly perfect straightforwardness of Civ V. Civ VI is at the same time more complex and more strenuous. I see the quirky appeal of this newest iteration but for me personally, the less of Civ V is ultimately more enjoyment.I just cannot give a thumbs up to a sequel that is not a definite improvement. [old review]I have no doubt that this game will improve once all the expansions and patches are out. Do not buy it as of yet. AI is not good at all and Firaxis needs to get this message.Stick to your CIV V for a year or two and then buy Civ VI on a discount."

Also, the warmongering penalties for taking cities still apply irrespective of the war initiator.  The ""freeze when exiting to desktop"" bug is unfixed. **Original 11/03/16 Review** (Rating: 4/10)I love history, and I love computer games.  Thus, every release of a Civilization game leads me down a path of addiction and lost sleep.This pattern has held true to a certain extent for Civilization 6, but I have to give the newest Civ game some tough love and admit that it is not yet up to par.Let me start out this review by saying I have enjoyed a significant amount of my playtime so far with Civilization 6.  I will start with the positives:1.  I like the new districts feature, where you must pick a tile for a campus, market, temple, etc., before you build it.  This prevents you from having one or two ""supercities"" containing all of your wonders and other important buildings, which never quite felt realistic to me in previous Civ games.2.   Some will disagree, but I think the way workers/builders are incorporated in Civ 6 is an improvement.  Workers cannot build an infinite number of improvements, as they could in previous Civ games.  Now, by default, they can build 3 improvements - but, the improvements are completed instantly.  I will accept the trade-off of having to build/buy new workers when I don't have to wait 5 turns for them to complete their work.3.  On a related note, in past Civ games (except for Civilization Revolution), you would have to micromanage your workers in order to build roads between your cities (or cities to other nations).  In Civ 6, when you build a Trader unit and initiate a trade route, roads are built automatically.  I absolutely LOVE this.4.   I like the new ""Eureka"" moments that speed up your research when you complete a specific task in the game - these consistent shots of dopamine are quite addictive and encourage you to mix-up your playstyle.5.   Diplomacy is a mess (more on this later in the review), but I do appreciate how the interface now gives you a scale of how much a leader likes/dislikes you and the reasons for their attitude towards you.6.  The espionage component of the game is greatly enhanced over Civ 5.  Now, when you send spies to a given city, you are offered various missions (steal a technology advance, steal gold, sabotage production, etc.).Now, the negatives:1.  **BUGS**  Some of the bugs/glitches I have encountered have been fairly minor - for example, I had the game crash when I was choosing a diplomatic card/option after researching a specific civic policy (closing out of the pop-up menus and then proceeding was the workaround).  Some bugs are just plain weird - I was playing as Teddy Roosevelt (America), met Germany, Germany later declared a joint war on me along with ... Teddy Roosevelt?  No, it was actually Arabia (who I had not yet met in the game).  One bug, however, is quite aggravating - when I try to exit to the desktop, the game will just sit there.  The computer itself is not frozen - I can Ctrl-Alt-Del and sign out of Windows 10 - but it is an irritating inconvenience.  Oddly enough, this particular bug did not present itself during my first week of play; it first started happening several days ago when I would play for long periods of time (2+ hours), and now it happens virtually every time I exit (regardless of how long I played).2.  **User Interface **  The actual layout of the interface is not terrible, but there are many items of information that are completely missing (or I simply have not found them yet).  In Civ 5, you could click the Diplomacy window and be able to instantly see what luxury resources other Civs had to offer, what resources City States had, what trade agreements were currently active, and what wars were currently taking place.  ALL of that is gone!  So, if I need to trade for some luxuries, I have to click each leader portrait, open the trade screen, and see if they have a surplus luxury they might want to trade.  Click-click-click-click-click-click.  Do you want to see if a nation is at war with one of your prized City States?  Too bad.  Want to know when your trade agreement with England will be expiring - or,  if you even have a trade agreement with England at all - tough luck.  I can't even see what resources I have from trading.  If I forget I traded for diamonds 10 turns ago, I might very well trade for it again.3.  **Diplomacy is a mess**  There's no sugarcoating it.  I like the ability to send a delegation/embassy, which will provide you with information about the other nation (sometimes too much information - thanks, but I don't really need to know about each trivial thing a nation does, like building a Settler).  Nations have specific agendas - which is neat, except that the agendas almost always conflict with how you have to play the game.  For example, one leader does not like nations that interact with City States.  If I wanted to cooperate with him, I would have to completely ignore one facet of the game itself. Nations will denounce you all the time.  And when they denounce you once, they generally keep doing it indefinitely.To reduce warmongering penalties, you are now given justifications for going to war (casus belli), which is really cool except that sometimes they don't trigger.  I once caught an enemy spy, which should have opened a casus belli against that nation, but it didn't.Finally, one of the many things I loved about Civ 5 was when a leader would propose a joint war to you, you could reply in effect ""Sounds good, but can you give me 10 turns to get ready?""  This option is gone in Civ 6, which is very disappointing.  Look, I generally don't have an army that is mobilized and ready to go to war on a moment's notice, okay?Want to pledge protection to your favorite City States (as you could in Civ 5)?  Can't do it.4. **Amenities** I might be in the minority on this, but I actually liked the overall Happiness meter in Civ 5.  It was a straightforward indicator of the happiness/unhappiness level of my nation, and I always enjoyed going into a Golden Age after an extended period of happiness.  Now, happiness is determined on a city-by-city basis and is remedied by ""amenities"", which is okay I guess, except that how amenities are calculated is unclear at best.  The quickest way to get amenities is by luxury resources, but trading for them is a mess due to the diplomacy interface (see above).     5.**AI (lack thereof)**It has been well documented by other reviewers that the AI of other nations in the game is suspect - whether it is waging war, engaging in diplomacy, building cities, etc.  I thought the AI in Civ 5 : Brave New World wasn't bad at all - by the modern era, I had developed friendships with other nations that shared my ideology, and nations of opposing ideologies had formed alliances amongst themselves.  Couldn't Firaxis have built on this, instead of going back to Square One? 6.  **No Diplomatic Victory Condition and No World Congress / United Nations** Civ 4 and Civ 5 had Diplomatic Victory Conditions out of the box, and dealing with nations at the World Congress and proposing various resolutions was great fun in Civ 5 : Brave New World.  Oh well - I guess certain things had to be saved for the expansions, right?So, at this point, Civ 6 is really a mixed bag.  Hopefully patches will clean up the bugs and UI issues, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done in many areas - specifically the AI needs a major upgrade.  I hope we don't have to wait for an expansion to get logical, competent play from the CPU.If you're looking for a complete and polished Civ experience, I would recommend sticking with Civ 5 and the Brave New World expansion for now."

The Modes have certainly made the game worth playing again and with the Barbarians and Heros Packs I'm very much happy with the overall experience. I've always wanted to play with no city states and be able to recruit city states next to my opponents. Barbarians gives a nice needed touch to an otherwise already worn experience.  my opinion bloody brilliant. And the Secret Societies makes things more interesting for each play through. I'm still rather disappointed with the roll out format of DLC content that really ought to have been there from the start. I can only advise purchasing this game at this stage in the game as a whole, with no DLC content packs included. Its just not worth your time and energy if it isn't complete. This gets back to my earlier review found bellow. The game feels incomplete without some of these new features and at its core experience is an unoriginal prepackaged money grab. With all DLC and packs included in one single price (maybe 20 Bucks at this point) I'd advice purchasing it). Note. This is an add on. The full review is further down. It is currently May 9th, and Civ VI is on sale for 74 percent off Gold edition. One problem. GATHERING STORM IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE #*$&^#$&*^ PACKAGE. Unbelievable......Its time. I purchased this game when it first came out when I was still high on the awesome experience I'd had from Civ V in its polished glory. I felt an extreme low when I'd finished the game and realized that many features I was expecting to be present in Civ VI were not present, either in the rush to get the product out or in the desire for monetizing the game for as long as possible. I purchased expansion for rise and fall, and was excited for new features, but they did satisfy my interests in what I knew was the full potential for a Civ VI experience. And then Gathering storm came out....and I did not purchase it. Not because I didn't want to, I really want to because I believe with Gathering storm the game has reached its full potential and the many bugs and other things that you'd expect to be gone from a finished product would be gone. If not gone then soon to be fixed or improved as is evidence of many patches and updates. To the many developers of this game, this is a beautiful game, and you can pat yourselves on the back for good work done. But I'm no longer interested in spending money on unfinished products, or waiting for said products to be on sale. I recently wrote a review on Outward, a game made by ten people. Basic, primitive, easily laughable in comparison to some of the most graphically enhanced games out there. But the game was built, and finished, and sold for 2/3 the price of a triple A game (without all of the additional content). It was refreshing, and while I understood it to be a fleeting experience with sometimes frustrating mechanics, I still enjoyed it more in the small time I've had it than the Beyond Earth and Civ VI experiences. Why? Because I do not feel roped along by a hock line and sink marketing approach. I am tired of being let down by something that was never intended to be the finished product. Understand, this is not the same sort of micro-transaction scheme you see from Anthem or Battlefront, but selling powerful Civs on the side without including them in a package deal for one of the DLC's and slowly rolling out DLC content (good content I might add) is something I can't support anymore. I'll wait till your Gathering storm is on sale one more time, but after this any game you make I'm waiting till you're finished with it to purchase."

Takes a little bit of getting used to if coming from Civ V, and too expensive; when it comes to the EULA bs, I quote someone who was very insightful:""To everyone jumping on the EULA band wagon, I just want to provide some facts that you can check out for yourself. If you're still mad after that, totally fine, but just hear me out.The section that people keep quoting is NOT from Civ 6's EULA. It is from take 2's privacy policy (the parent company for 2k) which can be found here:  This means a few things.This is also not ""new"" at all. The last change made to the take 2 privacy policy was in May 8, 2018 (at the time of writing this review). I have literally no idea where people are getting the notion that this was changed in accordance with Gathering Storm, but these policies have been applying to you that entire time.This policy applies to every single take 2 game. That means it applies to any Rockstar game (so time to hang up your cowboy hats and rocket cars), any 2k game (say goodbye to Rapture, Thin Men, and any incarnation of Nuclear Gandhi), and the brand new title by obsidian: Outer Worlds. Every single one of these games is affected by that privacy policy, not just Civ 6. The ""most helpful review"" states that he has played his last game of civ 6... well then I guess he's played his last game of all of these as well.It's not just written for games. This policy also applies to their storefront (the reason that they need to collect payment information) as well as any forums or sweepstakes (the reason they might need your address, if they need to ship you something).Take 2's privacy policy is not radical at all. If you look at Ubisoft (  ) or even steam (  ) there is a lot of incredibly similar language. If you don't want to read it all just control F some keywords. If these privacy statements frighten you, go and look up the producers of your favorite games, because there is a very good chance that they have a similar privacy policy.The section that the ""Most Helpful Review"" quotes is taken horribly out of context. He takes it from the ""What Personal and Other Information Does the Company Collect"" section. At first glance that sounds like exactly the right context, until you look closer. He starts his quote right after this: ""The types of information collected in connection with the activities listed above will vary depending on the activity"" What activities you might ask? ANYTHING. Literally any interaction you might have with the company is listed above, from requesting tech support, to purchasing a product in the store, to subscribing to a newsletter. The people review bombing this game are trying to make it seem like this policy turns the game into some sort of spyware, sniffing out your personal details. In fact, the most helpful review PURPOSEFULLY misleads you to garner more fear. He specifically states the game is collecting your address (it is included in his quote that is taken out of context). However, this is directly contradicted by the ""What Gameplay Information Does the Company Collect?"" Section, where they state very plainly that they do not collect your name or address during gameplay.Look, I'm not saying that you aren't allowed to be mad or suspicious, but please, do research and think critically before your are led into being mad for the wrong reasons."""

I really, really do. Because for the first 25-30 hours it was a refreshing change from Civ 5 in a lot of ways. Yes, it has its bugs and flaws (Diplomacy in particular), but I figured that Firaxis would be quick to patch out some of these nagging little issues, as well as swiftly release the integrated modding tools (as they had talked plenty about) and that winning combination would help solve these issues and allow modders to add further depth and quality to what I considered a decent basic framework. Certainly, at least, the game actually runs stable and could be played on release, which is more than anyone could say for Civ 5 even today.So why am I giving this a thumbs down?Well, for starters, the diplomacy flaws I mentioned. If you've played Civ 5 you'll remember that once an AI denounced you, that was pretty much it for the rest of the game. You were going to eternally be re-denounced every time the modifier expired. As well, a denunciation from one AI often meant a dogpile of further denunciations from several other leaders in a laughable gongshow of virtual feces slinging that wouldn't end until those AIs were eliminated (Which usually resulted in further denunciation, et cetera)...Well, Firaxis, in their attempts to ""fix"" this somehow actually managed to make it even worse. It seems that in Civ 6, just being a player in the game will get you denounced by AIs. In my first game, I was actually denounced by 3 different leaders in less than 100 turns, and all I did was focus on development inside my own borders. This continued to snowball the entire game until I had every leader, -including my allies-, denouncing and subsequently declaring war on me every few turns without discernible cause. Usually these wars would end in their surrendering and paying me. At one point I was earning 75 GPT in surrender deals across the board Banks HATED me. Learn how I was making 180 GPT with this one simple trick!.Diplomacy rating: Wat/10But Tyler, what about the district system? Surely that's a great addition!Well, I'm glad you asked, poopypants. I like the idea. It's a good idea. It was one of my favorite parts of Endless Legend. And it would be a favorite part here too, if Firaxis didn't manage to make it so My-Steam-Username. For starters, cities generally look like one coherent, sprawling entity. Not so with Civ 6! Apparently Firaxis' definition of a city is ""Looks like a bunch of tile improvements loosely clustered together"". Now, I'm not asking for Cities Skylines when I play Civ 6, but having the ground texture around districts change to something akin to Civ 4's city ground textures, and/or having more of the small buildings fill in the gaps between districts, or just making the districts take up the -whole- tile instead of only occupying about 2/3 of it would all look better than what we got, visually. But visuals aren't all that matters, so here's the real issue with districts:The garbage UI makes it almost impossible to plan them thanks to almost zero information, and it isn't until the late game that you can actually see *all* the effects the location will have on a district. Indeed, I actually had to resort to Reddit to figure out efficient district placement, because Civ 6 itself does such a crap job at providing any useful information. But the real kicker is that I found by late game district planning hardly even mattered. I would build my cities to crank out as much production and gold as they could while completely ignoring the other currencies, and I would somehow still be coming out in first place in 4/5 victory conditions I checked during setup.""Okay so the city building changes are total duds, at least the combat is good right? I mean, Corps and Armies and stuff - pretty cool right?""Oh you naive little bumnugget. I was like you once. Then I tested these systems out. Turns out they fulfill the same role as combat strength promotions in previous Civ games, except now you have to destroy a perfectly good unit (or 2) to use it. I honestly don't know what the hell the point of this was. When they talked about Corps and Armies, they made it sound like you could combine an infantry unit with artillery and AA (for example) and have a unit that, while weaker than those 3 individually, could fulfill the roles of each unit within one tile.What we got however, was again, strength promotions that require you to kill up to 2 units to promote the intended unit.I believe this short clip sums up my feelings on this accurately: ""At least Firaxis introduced culturally diverse units like they talked about in Q&As and dev videos!""♥♥♥♥♥ you. Digganobz.In other words, no. They gave us the same unit models with different skin tones/paint jobs. So everyone still uses Sherman tanks, it's just that some civs get GREY Sherman tanks, while some get TAN. Or GREEEEEN. OooOOOOOooOOhMuch wow. Such diversity. Very multiculturalism. And your cities? Step backwards. They're diverse up until the industrial age and then they all look identical. I mean, even Civ 5 had at least distinct cities based on ethnicity.""Alright, Captain Crabbypanties, why don't you just get mods for these things then and fix them?""Shut your sausage hole, that's 'MR. Captain Crabbypanties' to you. Also, Firaxis has added Workshop Support after -half a year- of the game being out. Hey, they still failed class, but at least they got at least one point toward their grade. Of course, we're gonig to have to take it away thanks to their DLC policy being straight out of the SEGA bible, but you know. Thought that counts.""Did Firaxis get -anything- right, according to you then!?""Sure, it's just that for everything they got right, they seemed to get 2 things wrong the more I played. The art direction is so-so. I'm *okay* with it, but I'm still not a fan really. If I wanted to play something that looks like Clash of Clans, I'd play Clash of Clans like a filthy casual. It's not unpleasant, it's just... Not what I think of visually when someone says ""Civilization"".They were right about this being the most fleshed-out base game in the series. They've managed to include spying and religion as base game features, which is cool. Leaves more room open for totally new features to the series in further expansions/DLC. However, religion suffers from the same dumb AI as Civ 5 when it comes to picking bonuses and any time you lose a founding to an AI, you can consider it an opportunity completely wasted for the rest of the game. And I really only found spying useful from the perspective of preventing enemy spies from annoyingly destroying my districts. Maybe these systems will get more refining and weight down the line but right now they don't feel particularly influential towards the outcome of a game, at least in singleplayer.Like I said, the bad rating is a huge shame, since Civ 6 has a lot of really great ideas that just haven't been that well executed. I get that it's a first try for a lot of this stuff and new systems take some tweaking and patching to get just right, but until that happens I really can't say that Civ 6 has much going for it right now to make it worth paying $80 CADWould give a 50/50 review if possible."

I watched some of the pre-release gameplay on the interwebs, so I was prepared for the most obvious changes.  I really, really, ~really~ wanted to love this game.And there are parts that I do love.  The new way that cities are managed, where each tile can contain a valuable resource or an even more valuable district, is sublime.  Having to pick and choose which cities will focus on what vs. the old method of just building everything everywhere is far more realistic and challenging.  The new trade system, which not only increases your gold income but can also provide boosts in science, culture, and production while simultaneously (and freely) building a road network is a huge improvement over past iterations.  ""Researching"" cultural advancements as well as technological breakthroughs provides a whole new level of development.  Earning and deploying envoys to gradually boost your influence (and rewards) from city states is a fresh new take on that mechanic.  Frequently earning boosts to your technological or cultural advancement simply by doing normal activities which you'd have done anyway is great.  The amount of thought going into this game, and the obvious efforts to deploy a truly ~new~ Civilization rather than a re-skin of past versions is quite welcome.But for every one of the ""goods"", there is a bad.  With so many potential paths toward development and city-building, the game itself can be overwhelming at times.  The new, hyper-aggressive barbarians can require far too much effort to contain during the crucial early game.  Diplomacy with the AI is just as baffling as ever, if not more so--you'll frequently get cryptic messages from AI leaders which hint to something you're doing well (or not) without explaining what it is, you'll still have AI empires pledging eternal friendship and adoration in one turn and then declaring war on you the next, you'll frequently be offered one-sided trades which hurt your diplomacy rating if refused, and once the AIs have declared war on you (and fought just as ineffectually as ever), you'll be offered a king's ransom to return to peace.  The map itself can be difficult to decipher, as some resources look very similar and rain forest tiles have the tendency to obscure goody huts or barbarian camps located within them.  Ship-building and intercontinental exploration seems to come a little too soon on the timeline, leading to even more inane (and unskippable) diplomacy screens.  Once religions come into play, the missionary spam is unbelievable (and largely unstoppable).  The ""sleep"" and ""skip turn"" buttons are easily confused with builders and settlers, making for the possibility of forgetting a unit for centuries.  Garrisoned units and city walls do not automatically activate when a hostile unit is within range, but units set to ""fortify until healed"" DO re-activate every time they are attacked.  All of this leads to a great deal of unnecessary button-mashing, map scrolling, and waiting for the dang AI to shut up so you can just get on with the next turn.It's that last bit which is perhaps most disappointing in this game--I no longer feel that ""one more turn"" urge which I have in every previous edition of the franchise.  I've started numerous games, using different leaders and map settings (and the lack of map options is another downgrade), but I've yet to actually ~finish~ a single game.  Each attempt starts the same: found my capital, expand, bump into AI civs, attempt to build up good relations with them, and then end up fighting wars which they cannot possibly win but insist on starting.  Meanwhile I'm trying to remember which city just finished which district, deciding whether to produce even more districts, or building within them, or wonders, or military units, or builders & settlers to further expand, or traders for money, or spies for diplomacy, or architects for ruins (but do I have enough buildings to put them in?)...it really is a case of too many options spoiling the whole thing.  Oh, and when you tack on keeping track of which cities need more housing or amenities or food to expand...it becomes more of a chore than a form of entertainment.Long-time Civ fans will have already bought this game, so there's no point in making a recommendation to them.  Those new to the franchise have probably been actively avoiding it up until now, so there's no point there either.  But, on the off chance that you're someone familiar with Civilization who has not yet purchased this version...wait.  With some patches and refinements this may well become a very good game, but in its current form it might be worth the money, but it isn't worth the time required to play it."

Then DLCs started coming out for $10-$30 a piece, so I need to pay more than $60 to get the full experience. If you, the reader, buy a bundle on sale for less than $60, you are in a better spot.

I am prompted to write this based on how disappointed I am in this game.  I have owned every single version of Civilization since Civ 1, including Alpha Centauri, and this is the first version I would not recommend.Here are my opinions of the “Good”, the “Marginally Bad”, and the “Really Bad”.GOOD:Temporary Builders:  I did not like this at first, but have come around to appreciating the design choice to have builders expire after 3 uses.  It keeps the unit clutter down, and forces the player to make productions choices all throughout the game.Military Unit Scaling:  This seems improved.  There are no longer such big jumps in unit power that used to occur at particular times in the tech tree.  Unit’s gradually improve as you tech-up in a more sensible way.Barbarians:  The game designers clearly put a lot of work into this, and it shows.  Barbarians are challenging and fun.  It adds a real threat to the early-game.City State and Envoys:  I like the envoy mechanism of influencing city-states.  It seems more realistic and natural than the Civ-5 system.Civ Selection:  I do like the new civ and leader selections.MARGINALLY BAD (or Needs Improvement):Districts:  I like the design concept of districts… the need to plan ahead for city development.  It’s a nice design feature, but I feel that there could be some improvement in how it’s implemented.  First, there needs to be more non-district building options.  Historically, cities do specialize, but not to the extent pushed in this game.  There needs to be more basic city improvements that are not tied to districts.  Also, some districts are poorly thought out… the Entertainment Complex comes to mind.  Every city needs amenities to be healthy, so forcing the player to use up a district for these improvements runs counter to the city-specializing concept.Roads:  If Builders expire after 3 uses, then there are problems with using them to build roads… you would have to make tons of them to get anywhere.  However, auto constructing roads along trade routes is not a sensible fix to that problem.  Instead, they should have added a road-builder unit that also expires… after maybe 6 uses or so.  As it stands, you end up choosing trade-routes in the early game more for building roads where you need them, rather than for the trade you receive.  This is counter to the idea of trade-routes.  Apparently, the designers didn’t understand how advanced players use roads as both a military tool and exploration tool.  And historically, roads were built for these reasons just as much as for trade.Graphical Design:  I don’t hate the cartoony graphics, but I don’t really like them either.  Also, although it does make for a clearly defined map, the additional graphical touches tend to clutter up the map more than in previous games.  Also, for some resources, it’s not as easy to see at a glance the difference between improved and not improved as it used to be in Civ-5.  I much prefer the Civ-5 graphical aesthetic.Culture:  I see what they were attempting with the separate culture tree… they clearly desired to allow more customization of your Civ.  In practice though, culture doesn’t really end up feeling like culture anymore, and just feels like an alternate tech-tree (and that’s exactly what it is).  This approach is more flexible, but something has been lost in the translation.  Also, I do like the ability to adjust your cultural benefits on the fly, but it seems too easy and fast.  There should be more consequence to doing so than just gold-cost.   I miss the days when changing government type was a big-deal, and required careful planning.REALLY BAD:Diplomacy:  This is so bad it gets it’s own subsections…     Denouncing:  OMG this is bad.  The AI civs will start denouncing you early and often for trivial things, and they never stop.  I have been denounced for having a different government than an AI civ, for building more wonders than them (is that bad?), for keeping a city that I conquered about 1000 years in the past, etc.  I am forced to wonder if the designers have actually played this game at all.  It’s ridiculous.     Trade deals:  The AI civs will propose the most insane trade deals.  They always expect you to lose out on every trade deal at a rate of about 2 to 1… they expect you to trade 2 resources for their 1.  They never offer better deals, no matter what your relationship.  It makes the trade-deal feature a complete waste of time.  I hit the escape key the second it pops up without even looking at it anymore.     Comments:  The AI civs will continually interrupt the game to make senseless comments on everything you do.  You get spammed with the diplomacy window almost every turn… and not for anything you have to make a decision about… just random comments.  Again, I have to wonder if the designers ever actually played this game.AI (or lack of AI):  This is the big one… this is so incredibly bad.  I have played well into the Atomic age on King level.  All the AI civs were still running around with primitive units while I was driving along their shores with Battleships and building planes.  And, I wasn’t even really trying to tech up fast… I was more into exploring the game’s features.  This never happened in Civ-5 at the higher levels.  Also, unlike previous Civ games, the AI doesn’t know how to build a Civilization.  Again, in the Atomic age, there were still many primitive Wonders that were unbuilt and available… like the Colossus and Coliseum… that’s ridiculous.  They should just rename it from “Artificial Intelligence” to “Artificial Idiot”.Warmongering Penalty:  I had hoped this would get fixed from Civ-5.  If someone declares war on you, and you kick their butts and take their cities, you are not a war monger… you’re just effective.  However, this game will punish you for that.  What are we supposed to do, allow other civs to declare war, and then once they start losing let them off the hook just to have them do it again 10 years later?  The game should keep track of who started hostilities, and adjust accordingly.SUMMARY:Although there have been some improvements in the basic game design from Civ-5 to Civ-6, there are enough misses to make this game a “Do Not Recommend”.   The AI is so bad that it makes the game completely unenjoyable.  And the Diplomacy is so annoying that even if you like beating up on the “Artificial Idiot”, you will be irritated to the point of just shutting it down.  The big design changes… Districts and Culture and interesting but can use some more tweaking… especially Culture.Maybe after an expansion or two that fixes things, this game might be worth it, but as it stands, it’s not.  Currently (and yes even at its’ launch) Civ-5 is a much better game."

I have been playing Civ since an 11 year old me picked up Civ III complete and lost almost all of his free time to it. But this must be said. In its current state, unless you are a die-hard Civ fan, I would wait for a sale, or stick to a modded Civ V complete.Good:-Districts: At least from an imersion standpoint, the mechanic makes the map feel a little more alive, as everything isn't crammed into a single tile, it helps paint a picture of large urban centers with smaller towns scattered around the map. Also, since districts gain bonuses from each other, natural wonders, improvements, and terrain features, it can be a lot of fun to plot out your cities to ensure maximum effeciency. Tall play is encouraged with districts as well. Factories, for example can boost the production for all cities within a certain radius, not just the city they are attached to. Overall, districts are a fun addition to the game.-Art: This is subjective. Some hate it, some love it, and I am in the latter category. I like how the fog of war looks like an old map, it's a nice upgrade from the old clouds of yesteryear. I don't mind the leader animations, and I think some are quite nice/adorable (Victoria's denouncement animation, it is adorable, watch it).-Barbarians: Actually a threat rather than a nuisance. Though perhaps they are too good for the civ AI to handle. See the bad section.-Music: Really good. Especially that intro/menu theme. Don't know if it will win a Grammy like Baba Yetu did, but it is still really beautiful song.Bad:-The AI... My gods, the AI. Do not expect to have any meaningful relationships other than war at this point in the game. I have had several games where I encounter a civ, only for them to break the game's own diplomatic rules and declare wars on me for no conceivable reason. It wasn't even surprise wars, it was full blown formal wars, and we had just met a turn ago! Good luck to you if the AI will even prosecute said war. Sometimes they don't produce a single unit, other times they flood your lands with units, but stand before your foritifed cities in wonder as you plink away at them. Sometimes the AI gets wiped by barbarians! This mess will hopefully be improved with patches, but this was not a good foot to set off on.-Warmongering and Causus Belli: An awesome idea, courtesy of our friends over at Paradox. If you have a good reason to declare war (religious reasons, liberation, ally needs help) state that reason when you declare war, and warmonger penalties are reduced! Right? Wrong! Even if you have every reason to declare war (reclaim your original capitol), and you are in the right, expect to have the entire world turn their backs on you, or declare war on you in turn. While I haven’t encountered it yet, I am willing to bet that even if you enter a joint war with your ally, they will denounce you as a warmonger, even though they dragged you into the war.-Diplomacy: Let's ignore the infinite warmongering AI for now. While the agenda system works in theory, there are several things that you need to do to win that WILL cause the AI to throw a hissy fit. Settle on a different continent than Victoria? Angry England. Have one less unit than Cleopatra? Pissed off Egypt. Declare war on someone sharing Theodore's continent? American denouncement. Sumeria harassing city-states and you want in on the fun? Gilgamesh obviously thinks that YOU are the true warmonger. The fact that each leader also has a hidden agenda that you can't see without a rather large investment is a monkey wrench in the works that the diplomacy system can ill afford. You might just be better off having the foreign policy of the DPRK (North Korea) in this game; fortify your borders and lash out at anyone that gets close (along with routing all the food aid to your dear leader). -Happiness: Happiness has gone from an empire-wide resource to a local one, now called amenities. You need a certain number per pop to keep the city happy. This all but requires you to settle near luxuries to keep your cities content. Settle away from them, and the city will be rabid within a few turns. The empire wide system worked. This system, not so much.-UI: The UI royally screws over several mechanics in this game. The poor religious UI is far more confusing than Civ V's pressure system ever was, mis-clicking and mis-selecting cities/units/production tabs will occur frequently. Also, you will experience your civ declaring war on itself at some point, or a civ you haven’t met yet declaring war on you.-Religion: Speaking of that elephant in the room, the theological combat between religious units was a neat idea, but a poorly executed mechanic. There are three religious units, and only two of those can fight. And if the religious victory is on, or Gandhi is in play, expect to get swamped by religious units that the Ai will spawn (sometimes by cheating, I swear) that you can't stop without declaring war on the civ that sent them, or lose your tailored religion to the AI's cult of madness. Turn the victory condition off and hope a mod comes out soon that will disable religion all together or reform it.Ugly:-Districts: They can't be moved once you chose the initial construction site. So if you mis-click (and you will) hope you have an autosave or quick save to go to, otherwise your carefully laid plans will go flying out the window, plunge a few hundred stories, and splatter on the pavement below.-Wonders: This is more of a gripe about how they are placed. While having wonders placed like districts helps to avoid the wonder spam of the older games, it does lead to several problems in my view. Perhaps this only applies to me, a guy who likes his immersion, but why is the Great Library, the structure that holds all of our culture's combined writings, sitting out in the middle of nowhere next to some crazy, mad-max-ian college town, rather than in the heart of our capitol, a city as old as time itself?-Mods: As of now, there is no easy way to apply them without text and file editing, and frankly, not all of us can do that. Hopefully workshop or some other mod system gets implemented soon. Civ V lived (and still lives) on its mods. Heck, mods keep even Beyond Earth somewhat alive. Without them this game is as good as dead. (Disclaimer: I will remove this section once mods are addressed)-Windows Defender: Yeah, it doesn't like this game. Make sure you fix that before attempting to play this on a windows 10 system. There are a few guides on how to do that in the steam forums.Overall, I just can’t recommend this game in its current state. Perhaps you will enjoy it more than I, and if you do, then more power to you. I’m going to wait for a few patches before I try this game again. Hopefully it will be better then, and I can change the rating on this review to a more positive one. Otherwise, its back to my heavily modded CIv V game with me."

It's almost 2020 at the time of this update. Firaxis has released an updated world builder that seems to function fine. Could they streamline the process of making and then using your own custom maps? They could. They should. But the company that owns Civ 6 did the thing I was complaining about in the crude, cuttingly sarcastic dialectic below. A developer listened, which is nice. They made the game a little better for me, so I bought some DLCs from them. Seems to have worked out fine. I recommend Civ 6.---Customers: ""Firaxis, please release your dev tools so we can mod your excellent game.""Firaxis: ""But if we do that you might not buy our DLC.""Customers: ""We're might buy some DLC if you don't squash our enthusiasm for your product by chopping it up and releasing it piecemeal. Just give us the mod tools and we'll compare your DLC with ours and let the players decide.""Firaxis: ""No no no, that won't do at all. Just be patient while we milk our title for all it's worth. Buy our half-assed DLC while we withold the modding tools.""Customers: ""C'mon Firaxis, we had a good thing going! Wait, here's an idea: why don't you monetize your modding tools? They're basically the same tools you used to make the game in the first place, so it's not like it would cost you much to spiff up the UI. You could sell us a $2 Map Editor or a $1 in-game tuner.""Firaxis: ""Turns out we already planned on monetizing our mod kit. It'll be released after the other DLC's had a chance to sell. We're thinking $20 for the whole dev pack. Problem?""Customers: ""No problem, I'll just wait until Civ 7 launches, then buy something else. Hope that's cool."""

Fast forward 26 years and now I am playing Civ VI on my MSI GS63. It is so similar, yet so different from Civ I, I have really enjoyed the ride. But is it perfect? Surely not!! I have some mixed feelings about Civ VI. The AI bothers me like most people here, especially with its weird ""warmongering"" penalties and stupid war mechanics. The AI in this series has always struggled to get it right, and Civ VI is one of the worse in the series. But, who has not struggled? It is such a complex game with so many layers, even we struggle! I still have not got used to the idea of city states, I think the game gives up valuable land to these many cities. There is a balance problem with the victory types, some are harder than others. I usually find myself having a science victory, I think that should be the default for many people.  And the religion system is complete bullocks, with spamming, religious units blocking tiles and stupid religious wars. I wish I could just cut it out of the game! I am surprised with the number of bugs and glitches I see in an otherwise such polished game and how they still have not addressed those (I am talking about base game, I do not have the rise and fall expansion pack)The big difference vs old Civ games is the cancellation of stacking. And boy, it makes such a difference! So, for me Civ V might be the pinnacle of the series. But, Civ V was also too bland when it first came out and it took 2 expansions to get it right. I sincerely hope same will happen with Civ VI. If you have Civ V with the expansions, I would not recommend to buy Civ VI at full price. Still, it is a YES for me when you catch it discounted. But, I would recommend to wait for the next expansion, since they will discount Rise and Fall heavily after the 2nd expansion launch!edit: after the recent starter update which is a bad excuse for ads, directx 12 version have weirdly begun to fail starting the game! And I hear this is causing problems with mods especially in Civ V! Very bad decision Firaxis and 2K, fix this!!! edit 2: the Gold version is more expensive than the sum of the packages it includes. In Turkey, the seperate packages add upto 146TL and the Gold version is 152TL!!! Fix it Steam and Firaxis!!!"

It allows much more diversity when planning how to plan your cities.~New Policy system is quite unique and fresh. That being said I would love to see the indrodution of having to choose negative policies. (your Government can be all positive ya know)~less reliance on building wonders (Civ 5 you pretty much win the game if you could build the wonders before your opponents)~City states have been greatly updated since civ 5 (all kinds of unique and cool bonuses)~improved multiplayer. (Way better then Civ 5)~Great people now have new system which is really cool Cons~~ AI is terrible. Prob the worst AI I have ever seen. Not only are the AI absolutely terrible at combat but they often impossible to please. ie. most every game i have played result in every nation being Angry at me even when i have never declared war.      +note on AI in all the games i played it was clear that some of the AI Leaders have clear Advantages over the other AI leaders. For example Germany was almost Always at the top, and Egypt at the bottom of the score board.      + note AI has been receving updates and may improve in the future.~ Religion Has not changed at all since Civ 5 . (the Ai also spams missionaries and apostles and blankets your map with them, this can be really irritating)~ Personally I did not like the art direction, after Civ 5 i was hoping that the developers would pursue a more realistic aproach to the the next game. The leaders look extreamly goofy in my opinion.~ No Dlipomatic victory yet ( There is now a Religion victory)~ Diplomacy with AI is Pretty Bad~ Alliances with AI are pointless ( if you get attacked you ally will never come to help you)I could go on but, these are the main points I feel should be brought up. I want to say i was really torn on to give a positive or a negative review. there are lots of things that i liked but there are also things that i wish that could be undone. If you are a Civ fan I can't really say if you will like it or not, it has it's weaknesses and strengths. I would say if its on sale buy it but, at its current price its not worth it. Hopefully the DLC will spice things up in the future.~Locomotohobo"

So why would Firaxis make the game feel longer and more drawn out?There are other things I didn't like either that need to be addressed. I wanted to like the district system, I really, really did. But it seems Firaxis are keen on not improving the few things I could want for the district system and doubling down on all the drawbacks. I mentioned earlier they nerfed unique districts. Unique districts are districts that can only be built by one civilization. On release these districts did not count towards the population cap, so you weren't actively penalized for using the unique districts for each civilization. I have a feeling the only reason they changed this was in a roundabout way to nerf German's overpowered Hansa district (which was overpowered in part because of German's passive not because it was a unique district, but that didn't help). However, it had the opposite effect. It made the Hansa the only actually viable unique district (except for maybe Korea's replacement for the campus district in Rise and Fall). Meaning if you want to build the Acropolis district for Greece you are being actively penalized by the game. They also did not change the formula for how district costs are calculated. Rather than decreasing the cost over time, Firaxis made the cost increase over time in an obtuse way. The obtuse way they did this was making it so that the cost was increased depending on how many districts you had with regards to how many the rest of the world had. That's right you are penalized for getting ahead of the rest of the world by making new cities an extreme pain to get up and running thus necessitating diverting trade routes to them. While I think this was done to curb building as many cities as possible, all this does is make it a pain to build new cities, not that the Statue of Liberty wonder in Rise and Fall would have you believe that is the case. Seriously why would you make a wonder spawn settlers in the industrial era? That is one of the most underwhelming effects of a wonder I have ever seen.Exploration is also a pita. Firaxis claims that the maps are bigger and I believe them. Not because they're as big as they say they are (I'd estimate they're only about 10-15% bigger if that), but rather because they slowed down movement in the game. Figuring that Civ 5 moved too quickly they made it so rough terrain (woods, hills, marshes and the like) requires units to have the number of moves it would rob from them. So in order to move into rough terrain, you need to have either all your movement points, more than 3 movement points, or a road. Speaking of roads, those are nerfed. Roads don't really do anything aside from removing rough terrain punishments until the industrial era. Starting in the industrial era you'll get a slight movement reduction in that each hex of road will cost .75 movement points rather than the full 1 movement. and then in the modern era, it will be a full .5 movement points instead of .75. For some reason, Firaxis thinks this is a good idea. It is not. Roads should never be this slow. I get it if this was Railroads from Civ 3 being nerfed to be reasonable as opposed to taking a full stack of units from 30 squares away to be right at the front with full movement available in the same turn. But roads were never that overpowered. Oh, and I would like my workers back instead of the builder system. Sacrificing units to instantly make improvements instead of gradually seeing your undeveloped land come to life is not fun.Also, civilization 6 has the most boring civilization I have ever played in the franchise, Norway. I won't bother you too much with the details but Norway, in essence, feels like they made a decent civilization for Civ 5, realized they were making it for the wrong game and then tweaked a few things so that it made sense to put it in 6. Nevermind that the civilization in motion feels as useless as a wet noodle and has no way to capitalize on its early game advantages. Several other civilizations feel like this too especially after the trading route nerf where Firaxis decided to fix the bloated trade routes not with any logical UI fix, but by nerfing the maximum amount of trade routes in a game (without a specific city-state) from 2 per city to 1 per city. The way they did this was rather than harbors and commercial districts granting 1 trade route each, you only gain one trade route per commerce hub or harbor per city. And considering how the game conditions you to use as much land as possible due to the district system investing in harbors is not really something you're not going to end up doing until much later in the game. Which in addition to harming naval civilizations like Norway also took England a traditionally strong civilization in the past, from being an alright civilization to being mostly useless due to this change to trade routes and their earlier nerf to unique districts, since their unique district is a harbor. I would honestly be surprised if they bothered to playtest the updates before letting them go live. This game is not fun in its current state. And personally from the 6 or 7 entries in the series I've played after all the ""balance patches"" this, in my opinion, is the worst civilization game I've had the displeasure of playing. From the looks of reviews on Rise and Fall, it doesn't look like that was the silver bullet. This and Beyond Earth are probably going to be the last Firaxis products I support for a while. Honestly skip this game and pick up the third, fourth, or fifth entries in the series and their expansions instead. They're more compelling even if 5 has some of the wonkiest achievements ever conceived."

The menu theme may not be Baba Yetu, but it's pretty damn close. Seems I will now have two games where everytime I start them, I have to hang out in the main menu for a few minutes: Civ IV and Civ VI+ Runs flawlessly. Literally haven't encountered any technical issues so far. Loading and such seems smoother than Civ V.+ More Micro-managing (probably a minus for some people)+ How disctrics and builders work are a nice addition. Even if they don't actually change much from how workers functioned in previous installments, it makes the game fresh.+ I like how policies work+/- I'm not a fan of the ""cartoon"" look of the units. However cities, buildings and the fog of war are spectacular+/- Features. I'm liking ALL the new features that they've added. The ones they've changed, I like too. However, the ones that are missing, I'm missing. Overall this might be a plus though, might move it later- Some bugs, nothing game breaking so far though- Diplomacy seems... sketchy. As in, needs fixing much like Civ V did with expansions (iirc). I like how the different Civs seem to have more personality thoughUpdate: Diplomacy seems to have the same problem that it had at the start of Civ V (vanilla), it feels random. Don't know if I've just been unlucky and triggered several opposing Civ hidden agendas or if this is indeed the case.UPDATE: After som experimenting, seems like the AI likes to declare war against you if they think they can beat you. So if your army is small - war. Of course, to some extent this has ALWAYS happened in Civ, but it happens constantly in this game if you play a certain ""style"". I guess that makes for more ""realistic"" AI, as that is how multiplayer matches often play out. But for people like me, who always prefered playing for culture victories, this is a big minus. Not enough for me to give the game a ""not recommended"", but enough for me to say ""untill they fix this, I'd recommend Civ V + DLCs more"". And I'd like to add that trying to spice up the diplomacy formula is a good idea, but it needs tweaking.I'm really liking it so far. It is in not perfect, but it freshens up the Civ formula with some of the new additions and I really like how they didn't take the easy and safe way out with the changes.I remember reading how some things would be ""simplified"" and ""streamlined"", which usually translates to ""we made stuff easier for casuals who can't bother with complex games"". But of all the things I've encountered so far that they've streamlined or simplified, it's all been legit. Nothing that takes away complexity, only things that make for a smoother experience.The issues that I've found so far in the game (Diplomacy and bugs) are hopefully things they'll fix with patches and expansions, just like they did with Civ V. Seems like Civ VI has a bright future ahead of it.Will update review accordingly"

Since then, the game has become a piece of crap. I should qualify this statement: the game, itself, is excellent. What has changed is the constant crashes and freezes that begin to occur for me at around the 350 to 400 turn mark. This has been a problem for many other users according to the forums and Firaxis appears to be doing nothing to address the problem except updating the launcher. The crashes - which tended to occur every ten turns or thirty minutes until I shut down the auto-save and extended the game-time to around forty turns - have pretty much ruined the game experience, especially since it takes sooooo bloody long to re-launch the game and then load the saved game. Instead of a relaxing Sunday morning playing my favourite game like it used to be, it has now become an exercise in frustration management. I realize that Firaxis has no interest in dealing with the crash issues since they have already gotten their money out of me, so all I can do is discourage others from going down the same rabbit hole that I find myself in until they fix the problem.

I like how the world looks and feels.Cons:Unfortunately since day one this game has been simply terrible. Most of the games I've played follow the same pattern: I establish a few cities, thinking it may be time to get my trade network up and running and start spreading my religion. No, a t least a couple of other countries declare war on me. They do not bother to show up for quite a number of turns and when they finally do I can usually take them all out with a couple of ranged and one close combat units.The AI is extremely unreasonable when it comes to trade, there is absolutely no point trading, much much easier to just take the resources you want.Wars are generally a slow and painful process. What you need to win almost any war are: 2 - 3 close combat units, 4 - 5 ranges units including two siege units and possibly a general. AI puts up little no resistance. The painful bit is trying to move this collection of units. How on Earth can a unit of archers or warriors occupy the same space as an entire city?! Ever since Civ 5 this has been bugging me. That's not all. Further down the tech tree you start combining units into armies... okay, but why could I not combine them right away? and why can I not combine units of different types? Would make sense, no?Moving on. Diplomacy is a joke. One turn AI is your best friend, the next turn it's declaring war on you because your fleet is not strong enough. The fact that you don't even have access to the sea and have a land army that can crush them in a few turns does not seem to impress them. Then there are frequent splash screens with AI leaders delivering ""important"" messaged. My favourite is when Gorgo has been popping up for 10 turns in a row asking ""Where's the honour?"".It is painfully slow, especially at the later stages. I've stopped playing on huge maps because after gunpowder I found it can easily take 5 minutes for one turn to complete. My rig ain't the fasters thing around but it's a reasonably modern machine that's capable of running GTA 5 on good graphics settings.\Religion... this is a pain in this game. From my experience, even if you manage to establish your religion first you will be invaded by a horde of missionaries many turns later. But then again you can ask the AI to stop converting your cities and it works. For about 1 - 5 turns. So you are left with no other option but to go to war to stop those pests from converting your cities. Usually you want to completely destroy the country to never have their missionaries again. Well, okay, that may be fitting for middle ages. But what of the modern age? Why can I not adopt a policy that would allow me to have multiple religions coexist in my country?Air units are a joke. Firstly you need an airfield that occupies the same space as any given world wonder, mountain, lake, district or anything else. It holds a very limited number of air units and is practically useless. At least in all of my games I've either had to conquer everything well before airplanes could be useful, or did not actually even need to use them.This game manages to reduce governing an empire to the most simple and primitive of functions. There is absolutely nothing challenging in it. Riots, shadow politics, plots, social reforms, government crisis, miner strikes, crime and syndicates, nationalism... those are just some of the things that will never be in the game.I realise some of these thing might have been partially fixed, and there have been some improvements, but the majority of these problems are still there. Instead of fixing this game devs just keep adding new civs for unreasonable prices. The last straw for me was Germany saying that nuclear weapons are the future well before any civ even discovered iron..."

It also seems to have a problem upgrading troops meaning it often just has a mass of slingers and warriers while you roll through it with a few tanks and artillery in the late game.While the systems all feel improved the AI doesn't seem capable of using them which makes much of it pretty pointless.

The base Civ 6 game might not be as polished as Civ 5 + DLCs, but Civ 6 with its own DLCs will definitely be. Some negatives about Civ 6 compared to Civ 5 (will add more when I get the chance):A lot of customization options are currently missing when setting up your game, such as:-the lack of maps to select from (only 5 + shuffle, compared to Civ 5's dozens). -ability to add/remove City-States from the game. -the map/artstyle will take some time to get used to, especially the fog of war. Overall, recommending in hope that Civ 6 DLCs are as awesome as Civ 5 DLCs!"

Civ VI vanilla is much more fleshed out than Civ V vanilla and Gods and Kings ever were. Here's my review:Pros- More fleshed out than Civ V vanilla was at launch- Workers actually have to be produced on a regular basis, no longer are there 5000 year old workers roaming the planet- The road building system is fun and is more historically accurate than having state workers build roads (except Rome)- Gaining influence over city-states is no longer a matter of being wealthy, its a serious challenge compared to Civ V- Districts and wonders being present on the map make territory and strategic planning of city development vital to success- The eureka/inspiration system is fun and makes research more interactive- Introduction of the civic tree makes culture just as vital as science, making player strategy more well rounded than it was in Civ V with social policies- The religious victory is a new option for peaceful victory and allows you to finally fight off the religious units of other civs w/o declaring war, which was a pain in the butt in Civ VCons- Not enough wonders from non-European countries especially from Asia and Africa.- Art style isn't for everyone- Diplomacy game is lacking because there is no world congress- Combat AI is still poor, and can easily be defeated, even with inferior numbers- Qin Shi Huang's character model is seriously weird- Agenda system attempts to rationalize AI aggression, but feels like more of an afterthought as the AI is aggressive regardless- Diplomacy AI is still bad, AI refuses to make peace unless you hand over all of your cities, even when they are down to a 3 population tundra city themselves.- Religious warfare is never-ending and the AI is obsessed with spreading its religion so it never relents on sending wave upon wave of religious units to you. The introduction of a non-interference treaty for religions, or something along the lines of that, would go a long way to preventing endless religious warfareOverall:Despite its many, many flaws, Civ VI is still a lot of fun to play, and builds upon the foundations that were laid by Civ V. City development and war mechanics bring the landscape to life and force the player to build and fight more strategically. Civ VI is definitely worth the money, and while it certainly has its issues, it is a worthy successor to the Civilization series."

If you're still mad after that, totally fine, but just hear me out.The section that people keep quoting is NOT from Civ 6's EULA. It is from take 2's privacy policy (the parent company for 2k) which can be found here:  This means a few things.This is also not ""new"" at all. The last change made to the take 2 privacy policy was in May 8, 2018 (at the time of writing this review). I have literally no idea where people are getting the notion that this was changed in accordance with Gathering Storm, but these policies have been applying to you that entire time.This policy applies to every single take 2 game. That means it applies to any Rockstar game (so time to hang up your cowboy hats and rocket cars), any 2k game (say goodbye to Rapture, Thin Men, and any incarnation of Nuclear Gandhi), and the brand new title by obsidian: Outer Worlds. Every single one of these games is affected by that privacy policy, not just Civ 6. The ""most helpful review"" states that he has played his last game of civ 6... well then I guess he's played his last game of all of these as well.It's not just written for games. This policy also applies to their storefront (the reason that they need to collect payment information) as well as any forums or sweepstakes (the reason they might need your address, if they need to ship you something).Take 2's privacy policy is not radical at all. If you look at Ubisoft (  ) or even steam (  ) there is a lot of incredibly similar language. If you don't want to read it all just control F some keywords. If these privacy statements frighten you, go and look up the producers of your favorite games, because there is a very good chance that they have a similar privacy policy.The section that the ""Most Helpful Review"" quotes is taken horribly out of context. He takes it from the ""What Personal and Other Information Does the Company Collect"" section. At first glance that sounds like exactly the right context, until you look closer. He starts his quote right after this: ""The types of information collected in connection with the activities listed above will vary depending on the activity"" What activities you might ask? ANYTHING. Literally any interaction you might have with the company is listed above, from requesting tech support, to purchasing a product in the store, to subscribing to a newsletter. The people review bombing this game are trying to make it seem like this policy turns the game into some sort of spyware, sniffing out your personal details. In fact, the most helpful review PURPOSEFULLY misleads you to garner more fear. He specifically states the game is collecting your address (it is included in his quote that is taken out of context). However, this is directly contradicted by the ""What Gameplay Information Does the Company Collect?"" Section, where they state very plainly that they do not collect your name or address during gameplay.Look, I'm not saying that you aren't allowed to be mad or suspicious, but please, do research and think critically before your are led into being mad for the wrong reasons.EDIT: Also, one of the top reviews mentions a web process running in the background which I can find absolutely NO evidence of. Again, fact check these people. It's a little strange that the top three reviews spreading this misinformation all have their comments turned off...2nd EDIT: Firstly, thank you to everyone who voted me helpful, I love that this post is getting more comments and discussion.Many people in the comments seem to think I am defending take 2's policy. I can completely understand how that might come off, but that is not my intention. My entire point in making this post was to highlight the fact that this is not specifically a civ 6 problem, but rather an industry problem. That is why I said at the beginning and end that it is totally reasonable to be mad, but to make sure that you understand the full scope of the situation. I LOVE the debate in my comments, because it means that people are thinking critically about the problem rather than taking any of the reviews at face value.Also, many are calling my separation of EULA and privacy policy misleading, since the former has to be adherent to the later. Again, the reason I am hitting this point so hard is because I am trying to hit home the fact that this is not a civ 6 issue, it is an issue that encompasses the entire company.I personally feel that the top negative reviews mislead in that they insinuate that if you avoid civ 6, you avoid the problem, which simply isn't true.I also want to address the fact that my review is positive. I like civ 6 and will continue to play it, that is the entire reason that it is positive, because I like the game. I personally do not agree with the sentiment that a negative review of a game that a company makes is an appropriate way to speak your mind about the company, but honestly if I were in a more personal debate I can see my mind being changed. That being said, the current negative reviews do not paint an accurate picture of the situation and there is no place to correct them since their comments are turned off. This post is meant to be a public discussion of the issue so that we can all share our opinions, rather than just have one person shouting without anyone being able to respond."

And that's so disappointing after the incredible Civilization 5.Graphically:Cartoonish, like a mobile game.  Maybe you like it, but for me (and many others) it looks childish and annoying.  It makes getting deeply invested in the game difficult, because you're no longer looking at realistically depicted cities, roads, and empires, you're looking at candy crush ripoff crap. There are mods to fix this if you'd like, but I'm not reviewing mods here am I?Gameplay:AI is similar to Civilization 5, pretty bad.  Play at higher difficulties for a challenge.  Gameplay is also a lot more unbalanced than in Civ 5 due to the increase in units.  Some units are simply ""better"" for no apparent reason.  Excellent example, horsemen.  Horsemen require horses.  Pikemen, traditionally an anti-cavalry unit in the medieval age, do not.  Medieval era anti-cavalry gets utterly obliterated by ancient-level cavalry, simply because that cavalry requires  a strategic resource.  It feels unbalanced, and helps break immersion.  However, I adore the new strategic resource system (save for unbalanced units every so often).  Owning critical resources now feels like I'm gaining constant benefits as a result.  I can build as many nukes as my uranium production allows over time, allowing me to build a stockpile, unlike in Civ 5 where I might be limited to one or two at a time. Also, engineers allow you to build roads, silos, forts, etc.  It sounds small, but it really feels like you're building your empire when you construct a cross-continental roadway. I hate the district system.  I like it in theory, expanding your city and specializing as you go, hate it in practice.  It feels like I'm playing Settlers of Catan in the worst sense.  It requires extensive micromanaging, and requires prior understanding to how the bonuses of each district work.  If you don't understand those bonuses coming in, you are absolutely screwed as a new player as it will affect what wonders you can build, how many hammers you're getting, whether or not you'll even be able to found a religion, and what government policies are available. Additionally, it feels limiting on what each city can do.  I shouldn't have to decide between a port and a fort, when I have the resources and production and time to build both.  Additionally, it reduces each city to the sum of its districts, nothing more.  I don't have a city on the coastline that acts as a trading hub, this city I build is now just a harbor, commercial district, and faith district.  It feels too needlessly ""gamey"", and only hurts the gameplay even more.And speaking of ""gamey"" the way governments are handled is atrocious.  Each government had its own ""card slots"" of various flavor. As you develop your culture, you unlock various cards representing components of your government, like slavery or mandatory conscription.  Based on the slots your government provides, you slot in these cards and get bonus or drawbacks as intended.  Basically, it reduces the difference between fascism and communism to a change of 3 different card slots and a handful of special cards.  In Civ 5, a fascistic nation would experience major changes to diplomatic relations, and had an opportunity to develop its government or focus on its culture.  Now, the difference is minor at best, and rarely impacts gameplay.  I barely know my own government once I hand in my cards, let alone the governments of my allies, and that's an issue.  It's gamey, childish, and really takes away from the experience.Mods:Extensive, maybe not as extensive as Civ 5, but very extensive.  If you have a fantasy universe (GoT, Warcraft, LoTR, etc.) there's a map for it, and probably some factions too.  Best part of this game tbh.DLC:Rise and Fall is interesting, but also annoying.  It forces you to prioritize certain decisions in order to push for a golden age, rather than naturally rewarding how you're playing the game.  Did you build a faith district and are now the world leader in faith production? Nope no points.  Developing science at an astronomical pace?  Enjoy 1 bonus point when you research beyond the current era.  Oh but you found a random tribe that gave you 40 gold? Enjoy your massive boost to your era score! It's overall not bad, but could've been so much more.Rising Tide is okay.  It's an interesting late game concept, but the environmental crises throughout the game just aren't that much of a factor.  Also, it doesn't change the fact that by late game, you empire is an unstoppable juggernaut that you simply micromanage until you can either conquer everyone (with guns or religion) or win a science/culture victory.  It's just fine, not really exceptional like BNW in Civ 5.The DLC ultimately improves the game, it certainly adds ""more"" to do and is interesting.  Without the DLC the game can be really boring at times.  But the DLC certainly isn't great, and only adds more average content to an already middling game.Overall, Civ 6 is just okay.  That's it.  Not great, not awful, just average.  Multiple DLC's are now out, and that fundamental issue still hasn't changed.  It's tough to get immersed, many gameplay changes are more ""gamey"" than fun, graphically it looks like a mobile game, and the AI/balance issues always present in Civ games are still here. The fundamental Civ experience remains great, and shines through the muck at times in this game, and because of that, this game is just average.5/10, play Civ 5 with DLC for a better Civilization experience (it'll be cheaper too). Stick around and watch for new DLC's, maybe they can really improve the score.EDIT:So some have said that Civ VI is great, and that I just don't ""get it"" yet.  Here's a simple fact. Civ V has an extremely similar player count compared to Civ VI. Sometimes Civ V has more players than Civ VI, depending on the day. Civ V was released more than half a decade ago, Civ VI came out 2 years ago.Civ VI is not in a good place yet, maybe it will be one day, but not today."

With the new launcher they have included ads (which from appearances are obtained from a server, more on this later) for the next game in the series, Civilisation 6. There are multiple issues which stem from this change, starting with the subjective change of including ads to a 10 year old game which is unlikely to receive any beneficial updates in the future, as well as damaging compatibility with certain mods. The objective Issues are: - That (as of the time of this review) the launcher is still watermarked as a beta.- The quality of the game's graphics have been reduced.- Users have reported that the launcher either launches the game using the wrong version of DirectX- Users have reported that with the new update they - Users have reported that either the launcher itself is  or (more likely imo) any data the launcher may be receiving from a server (e.g: images and hyperlinks for ads) can and has been compromised, thus While the subjective changes are up to the user to judge, I'll make my opinion clear - performing updates that compromise the core functions of the game, as well as compromising my security and privacy  2K are doubly damned for making these changes to an 8 year old game with the only intent being to include ads for a game This review will not be changed (even if the update is reverted) purely on principle as this update was not necessary, ethically sound or a good investment of money and manpower."

If you are thinking about buying this game, wait until steam sale of a special discount, because I think only then is it really worth it.Long: When I started playing Civ6 I came directly from the predecessor Civ5 (which i was a huge fan of) and was kind of disappointed. The comic-like look did not really feel like the Civ I was used to, and although the gameplay and the other civilizations were very nice to try out, the UI was extremely complicated and all the stuff with districts, adjacency bonusses, etc was very hard to get used to and it felt very weird at first. However, as I started playing the game more and more (and bought the DLCs) I found love to the depth and optimization possible in this new Civ. I love planning out cities, strategizing and having a challenge, which is exactly was Civ6 challenges you to do. But having to spend such a ****ton of money on a game is very hard to justify, even for a Civ-Fan like me. If I was to buy this game today, I would definitely advise you to wait for the best deal possible (e.g. during steam sale) to buy it with all DLCs, because only then becomes it really better than Civ5."

Skipped 3,4, played some 5, and have played a lot of 6. I like them all for different reasons. I'll lead with what I like about Civ6 (and ultimately why I recommend it), and then close with what I consider wrong with Civ6 at the time of this writing. - The name of the game is city and district planning, as cities now consume far more than a single map tile. LONG overdue.- Very aesthetically pleasing. It's worth playing with music on until you've heard it all.- Apart from the spatial restructuring of cities, it's Civilization. If you liked any of the games, you'll probably enjoy this one at least sometimes.- The pre-made scenarios are fun, and are an excellent idea if you don't want to commit to a 12h marathon.- Natural disasters (DLC) add some interesting randomization, though this also lends to a complaint below.- All leaders seem to suffer the same from natural disasters, which fails to reflect, for example, nomadic tribes being more resilient to dust storms. - They still have the Giant Death Robots, which means that every long domination game on a large map leads to the same place for every leader: nukes and vacuum cleaners. An option to disable GDR and nukes should be part of the canon code when customizing a game, and it's not.- Map generation takes an exceptionally long time, and I have a modern rig with a true beefcake processor.- ""Please Wait"" locks on your turn and enemy turns mean auto-saving is mandatory. - The Civilopedia seems to be the most neglected aspect of Civ6. Several necessary game mechanics are explained inaccurately, if at all. Also, the text input for it could use a complete makeover.- The ""Legendary Start"" feature of custom games, present in prior games as well, is ... not all that legendary, as it doesn't seem to take leader differences into account at all.- At least one of the custom map types will not start a game with Kupe, since he starts in the water. Some basic error-checking overlooked in several aspects of the game. I think Civ 5 remains the better of the (5,6) in terms of polish and smooth function, but 6 is an excellent and developmentally challenging step forward. I'm confident the game will continue to improve, and I've certainly enjoyed the majority of my time in it to date."

However, there are still a few minor annoyances that I would love to see solved:1. AI build their cities too close together, almost always the minimum 3 tiles separation.2. On harder difficuly, AI always conquer several city states very early. City states should be able to defend themselves better against this tactic.3. AI often offer very poor trades, I rarely am able to make worthwhile trades with them. It is especially annoying when all AI in the game come to you offering the same bad offer for the same relic or great work that you own.4. Stepping up to Emperor level means the AI start with an extra settler - such a powerful bonus to have, I would prefer if the actual intelligence could be improved rather than by just giving them a better start like that.5. Changing government policies - it would be nice to see the actual effect of changing policies as you switch them. It is very hard to calculate what is better sometimes, for example +100% campus adjacency bonus or extra science from building in campuses?? I can only pick one and I dont know which actually gives more science?"

Well, let me start by saying, this game is worse than crack. If you're a drug user, stick with whatever you're on, and don't even get near this game. This game is a lot worse seriously. I am married, and I think my wife is sleeping with someone else (I don't care really)  I have played 46 hours in 3 to 4 days and thanks to this game, I have opened myself to other strategy games. Thanks to this game I ended up buying Sid Meier's civilization V complete edition (yeah I know, I should've started with that one before playing Vl oh well) I  also bought Total War Rome ll Spartan Edition, Crusader kings 3, Heart of Iron lV, Europea Universalis lV, and today I decided to buy Stellaris. Goes to show how amazing this game is. Thanks to this game, I ended up buying 6 games. Thanks to this game, I ended up opening myself to another genre of gaming. A genre I barely play. Yes, I own every Age of Empires game, but those games don't come close to this one. I am fairly new to this genre, and quite honestly, I am enjoying every second of it. This game has so much replayability its crazy. You can literally plant yourself anywhere and start building yourself up. You don't have to invade or be in a war to win. You can be the most liked ""country"" and the most calm, and still beat the most fearfully country. Goes to show, violence is not always the answer. I love the details this game provides. Every little thing you build has so much detail and it looks so beautiful. The game is very rewarding with every turn you take. So much to explore and so much you can expand. This game is as beautiful as playing chess. As beautiful and as awesome this game is, more than likely a lot of people find it boring, but don't let looks blind you. I remember this game always showing up on YouTube videos and here on Steam, and I always said, ""oh wow a game about a map? Pff that looks fun"" I was so blind. I decided to buy it and now I can't stop playing it, and worse yet, I ended up buying 6 GAMES thanks to this one! Oh and I forgot to mention, I also bought a few DLC's for this game. In other words, not only did this game has sucked me in, it has also sucked my wallet. I need help. If you're married please don't buy this game, unless you want your wife to be sneaking out of the house while you play this game. Once again, please, someone help me. I've lost money and now my wife. 6 games!!!! I have an idea, let me play a few more turns of Sid Meier's civilization Vl"

This one is so far the worst: it is impossible to have any single civilization to ally with you if you defend yourself against a random attack, or befriend you if you decide to cede all your privilieges to any rondom former firnedly civ. To put it blank: diplomacy is totally broken!Districts: I learnt to love the idea, even if you take out space to build farms, I see potential on the districts: but some of those are so underpowered that they are a waste of time! (pe the Industrial distirct gives so little production that is actually damaging to your economy)Bad pacing! I hated from earlier Civ games that ancient eras where usueless, so fast they went.... At least in pre-civ V games you'll scratch a couple of turns where one of the most amazing military units in the world became useful during ancient times: the phalanx and the legion: Civ VI manages to make those just ""meh"" and if you select ""marathon"" pacing you'll make the military exactly the same,, but you'll be discovering flight while building a district takes up to 150~ turns... Making Civ V look like an amazing game!The graphics.... I won't fall for the ""I don't like the cartoonish"" thing. I don't, but I consider the developers wouldn't be able to produce in just an acceptable amount of time some realistic 3D graphics... But then I have other questions: Wouldn't it be better to produce some high quality 2D like on Sim city4 or Simon 2 and make it accesible to slow end computers and faster in all computers? What is the point on 3D if you can't rotate anyway and it works like and old fashioned isometric engine? Well, at least the animations are quite cool....Not balanced at all:  In previous games it was difficult to win unless you centered your civ to a certain task: war or science: here you have to center it around culture so any random civ won't beat you by culture even if you have all the economic and military cards on the game, or viceversa...No palace upgrades and city views! After such a downgrade in game mechanics comparing to Civ V, I was expecting some good easy gratification respect Civ IV and V! no luck :(The district mechanics is good, and I think it can really improve the game, but as it is it stands in: Buggy, faulty and meh, plus no palace and city view.... I'll stick to Civ I-III and sometimes go to V, but to enjoy VI you'll need mods... if you want to buy it I'll recommend to check the mods regularly and decide if it is worth. as a standlone product it is a big step backwards!"

So, lets start -  Barbarians need better options, currently its off or 'rampage mode' since they all have a high spawn rate,  they need a more options.   Next up is the slow paced gameplay, standard modes pacing is very odd, at times it feels like a Marathon game then quickly speeds up then slows down..the pacing feels all over the place, and because of that - the A.I which tends to follow the date is terms of advancement can suffer too, a classic example of this would be;Player increases research and lets say enters industrial period, the date per turn will usually increase/decrease depending on the date, lets say its 1500AD, the DpT will increase for a while until its more in-line with the era, for some reason that seems to give the A.I huge buffs and they'll rapidly increase in research and power sometimes,  heck - I've seen them jump from renaissance period to modern period extremely fast defying all logic,  but since I've seen England get Ironclads as early as the 1200AD...honestly it doesn't surprise me since the pacing is definitely way off the mark.A.I is stupid, obvious and stupidly good,   the latter is the problem because it will attack with better strategies than the previous games, however the major problems is that alot of the times its rather obvious what its trying to do - such as Sumeria spawning 20 war wagons and then slowly moving them to your civilization to launch a surprise attack...well *I'm* surprised the A.I did that - wow!   Another problem is the fact the AI hates human players, to a point there isn't any reason to be nice to them, they'll break every single promise you make with them, they'll attack you relentlessly and the diplomacy is plain weird to a point it just feels broken, don't get me started on how broken the warmonger system is - essentially by late game the world threatre is pretty much everyone hates everyone and denouncing is just rife, and each turn you'll have to face an onslaught of taunts or complaints or more denouncement screens. Another major problem is the fact that the game feels so slow paced compared to previous games, districts take way to long to build, especially late in game where its not uncommon for it to take 30+ turns for one district, because of the pacing issues, making spawling and large civilizations is nearly impossible to do now.    I could go on and on here about all the issues, from nitpicking about special ability balance such as Electronics Factory, or how the game suffers from strange bugs that cause input lag, especially late game so I'll just close with this statement again;Other bugs and glitches include units simply being unable to attack for whatever reason, I've personally had this several times.   And the fact that the AI does unfortunately cheat, I've seen an enemy civilization that started within 10 squares go from a level 1 city to a level 13 city a mere 36 turns into the game, and then proceed to crank out an insane amount of units or a civilization pumping out a constant stream of Apostle spam.  The A.I abuses the Fog of War constantly thoughout the game unfortunately, almost a through-back to the days of Civilization 2 where it would spawn units next to your cities...its not that bad,  but almost. For all the people giving the game a bad review based on graphics, please stop doing that because it distracts from the real issues that this game has,  and those issues will never be addressed unless we start talking about the real problems, such as the games flaws and terrible A.I.    I think, to be really honest - even with the new expansion thats coming,  I doubt this game can be saved unless this expansion totally redo's many of the core elements of the game such as diplomacy which currently, simply doesn't work and a better AI fixes need to be done instead of giving unreasonable buffs and bonuses,  not to mention the AI abusing the fog of war."

The mechanics are superb, a great improvement over 5. City planning is a fun new aspect, and the inspirations make for a new and dynamic game every time you play as you take advantage of the situation you're given the best you can. Waging war is rewarded as well, unlike in its predecessor when having more cities crippled your infrastructure through unhappiness. And let's not forget an excellent presentation, including wonderful music, heartfelt narration, and utterly charming graphics and character design.Several problems are worth bringing up, however.The AI is terrible. Diplomacy is scarcely worth attempting, as the designers tried to balance the game by making computer players hate anyone that is doing well, and stamping tremendous relationship penalties for each city you take, even when at war with a third party and even when you are not the aggressor. On top of that, CPU players don't understand combat at all, to a downright embarrassing degree. It's unclear how the designers could have screwed that part up so bad, as the combat isn't all that complicated. There are also several interface issues, from unexplained mechanics like ranged unit obstructions, to combat predictions randomly displaying combat values in the tens of thousands. The Civilopedia is miserably incomplete and not always helpful, prompting excursions to the unofficial internet wiki to answer questions.Then we have the more egregious issues.Those who purchased the deluxe edition got ripped, plain and simple. On one hand, it's the own fault of consumers who threw their money at something without any concrete promise of what they were getting back, but on the other hand it took a very long time to get but a few extra leaders and Civs.We've been promised cross-platform compatibility between Windows and Mac since launch. They still have no definite date set for this.Patches have been slow to come and haven't fixed the major issues. Aspyr has, by all appearances, been very forthcoming about what they are hoping to achieve, but results have been consistently disappointing.Ultimately, this is a very, very good game, but it's anything but ""solid"". For multiplayer, it's the best Civ game out there, and overall it's one of the best 4x games out there. But I still think you should wait for a good sale."

The game built around a longterm plan and executing it, successfully netting you the game if it's built well enough. Civ VI mirrors this. You plan districts around your cities, you time technologic/civic boosts, the movement rules are constrained so that you have to have a defence or offence together at that exact moment, you plan on grabbing wonders and taking great people, and on and on. This isn't necessarily bad game design but it relies on polish and the fact that your opponent is relatively competent. Civ games are notorious about a lack of polish on release and the AI is the AI.Typically what happens is patches upon patches until the game becomes 'workable' or even 'fun'. VI hasn't had anything close to that. Some dominant strategies have been nerfed but that's about it. It just seems so apathetic. I'll highlight the UI for a moment. Easy fix but nothing has actually happened to improve it. But I digress.I'll start with positives - what did VI do well?How do I summarise VI? It's a game with the dreaded death knell words of 'potential' and 'has promise' along with 'good ideas, bad execution'. I can't really say I regret playing the game since I've had fun with it and the money that went to purchasing this game was given to me. I just don't see myself playing much more of the game. It's nothing I will return to like Civ IV or a Paradox game, but it has entertained me. If not everything has to be a deep and significant experience, then VI fits the niche of a fun fling for a few hours. I can't recommend it if you aren't into the whole European board game style theme or if you're looking for a long lasting strategy game. If you're into that style of game, buy on sale and skip the DLC unless you really want to play as Superstralia.[EDIT - Coast has been buffed and I've removed it accordingly from my review. It's definitely not godawful anymore.]"

However, after coming back to the game after many months, I gave it another shot and found that it really clicked with me. So much so, that I will say, all the non-war components are excellent.The problem is, war. The AI is just too terrible. Earlier Civ games I can forgive for such terrible AI, but I would think the developers could do better by now.For example, if the AI would just do the most basic action of garrisoning a ranged unit inside the city, it make conquering the city much more difficult. Instead the AI will leave a melee unit inside the city, or no unit at all, thus making the conquest far too easy.Because war is so easy, it therefore makes for the most effective strategy. When an AI is making progress on another victory objective, such as religion, culture, science, etc., then simply build a small force and take their capital. Boom, that AI is no longer competitive and you have just acquired their extremely valuable capital with little effort.I am not going to write a ""Not Recommend"" review after 100+ hours. Obviously it was worth the sale price for me. However, unless the next Civ game has significantly different reviews regarding the AI, I will likely pass on purchasing it. The poor AI has been a problem for the last few games and it should be fixed. At least a few basic strategies could be implemented, such as the AI keeping a ranged unit within the city to defend."

I can be a harsh critic.  I've sunk hundreds (or thousands) of hours into every version of the game.  Civ6 is a fantastic game. It takes all the beauty and interesting mechanics of Civ5 and adds actual strategic decision.  The districts add huge variability and make every game feel very different.  No more mid/late game slog to just build everything.  You cannot build everything, and you really need to think about urban planning.  I love the tech and policy boots; they really help drive gameplay and narrative based on the map and/or your current situation. The R&F expansion keeps you from sitting back and just coasting to victory.I know a lot of people love Civ5 and bash Civ6 endlessly.  Aside from mods, I really do not get it.  Civ5 had no strategic element; it was all ""+1 this"", ""+2 that"".  There were no policies that you could change, no governments, nothing.  Just accumulating ""+1s"" and moving your troops around the map.  For me, that barely qualifies as a game.  Civ6 is a true strategic game with governments and policies.  It's complex but avoids too much micromanaging.As for the AI, that's always the weak point in modern 4x games.  Civ5 and Endless Legend (which I also love) are no better, and often worse.  I don't know if the AI has been improved with R&F but I'm in the middle of a war with Nubia at the moment and the AI is...not stupid.  The peace & war logic employed by the AI has been solid and the tactical troop movements have been good.  Far better than the ""dazed and confused"" troop movements of Civ5. I still wish there was a slider to allow the AI more CPU time for deeper analysis.The game and expansions are pricey, to be sure, but its a great game and worth it when you figure the countless hours you'll be up.  (What? It's 2am already?)  If not, wait for it to go on sale.  But don't listen to all the trolls.  This is fantastic game."

My apologies. TL;DR - After Beyond Earth which I just could not bring myself to play I am hooked to Civ 6. It is a great new game. Civilization 6 is great new entry to the series. I played it straight for 3 hours. Would have played more but reasons. You can go ahead and buy the game. It is nothing like Beyond Earth. It is not a reskin. Everything feels different and plays different. The game is very good looking and runs great. The tutorial could have been better and settings menu more fleshed out. Music is great. The cartoonish graphics compliment the game.So I come here to give my two cents after playing for nearly 3 hours and roughly 200 turns.Graphics: I will start with this because ever since Civ 6 was announced many have been bashing it because it looks cartoony. Trust me, the change in graphics style was a great decision. Had Civ 6 had a simillar type of graphics to Civ 5 everything would look cluttered and not so pretty. After building some districts and settling about 3 cities, the area really looks fleshed out and very good. The units are great to look at. Though I would have liked more animation for units. Like units bleeding and all instead of just their numbers reducing.Gameplay: When I started the game it felt the same as Civ 5 at first but after 20 or turns the changes began to pop up. Everything that Civ 5 had have been improved upon. The freedom has been reduced and there are a lot of constraints now. For example - The builder can only make 3 things after that it vanishes. The builder cannot make improvements. Cities cannot attack unless you have walls, Then to build certain improvements or districts you need to have a certain amount of population. Happiness has been removed and I think this is great. In Civ 5, I was always worried about happiness and always did stuff to keep my hapiness steady. City stated give you quests to complete. No need of building roads now. The tutorial though leaves something to be desired. Even when I selected ""New to Civilization"" mode, the guide did not tell me there are two trees now - Tech and Civic. Though everything can been found in the in game encyclopedia. Alliances can be made with other leaders. I still haven't grasped everything but this is just the gist of things. There are tons more that I have noticed and I am sure there tons which will only show up as I advance more. Settings: The settings are a bit confusing. Most options only have a low or high option. No medium option. But there a lot of settings that can played with. In short the graphics setting menu is not organized at all. Civ 5 menu was better.Music: Music is simply too good this time around. The 25th anniversary OST has all the tracks from Civ 6. Contains some 76 tracks.Optimization: The game runs great. Tons of settings to play around with. So I am sure everybody can find a combination where they can play. Though I would have liked the option to have medium preset too. Hope a patch fixes this. I am sure the performance can be increased more. The game ready drivers are yet to come out and its only the first day."

The series has gone through a fantastic evolution, becoming graphically more vibrant, more challenging and more interesting. Then why am I disappointed in the newest installment?few reasons:1. In this newest version the amount of micromanagement to grow your city has increased. A lot. 2. The maps are much smaller. Consuequences:a) you will much earlier be hampered in your expansion plans because of city states or other civsb) your cities will much quicker be squeezed close together, thus hampering really big cities.c) you will engage in warfare much earlier in the game and either have long running wars or constantly be told civ ABC denounces you.3. No automated workers. Under the new concepts this may make sense. But it doesn't really make sense to improve a tile, only to find out that was the only valid tile for that world wonder you want to build.All in all yes, get it on a discount. I hope further civ developments will return to the roots of what Sid Meyer imagined back in the last century."

Easily a 9/10, there is a lot more strategic depth and player options than there were in vanilla Civ 5.Is Civ 6 perfect? No, there are definitely a few tweaks needed, especially to the AI which does some silly things and gets annoying bonuses (King+ difficulty) which I am really not a fan of. There are few strange UI design choices (overall pretty good though, mostly clear and consice). And diplomacy victory which is something I quite enjoyed has been removed. :/ Saying that, for every small problem I have there are 3 or 4 great changes (great people system, government types and policies, tweaks to combat and movement, housing and amenities in individual cities .etc.etc.). I LOVE the changes to districts and wonders, it makes terrain and planning extremely important. There's a lot of changes which can't be summed up in this small review however.Unlike CIv 5 and Civ 4 I dont think 2 major expansions are needed before a buy, this is already a great game worth your money and after after some patching and tweaks to the AI and UI (and hopefully an awesome expansion to add diplomactic victory back!) this will easily be the best Civ to date."

Civilization has a good balance between a pure competitive strategy game and a city-builder and can be enjoyed both in single- and multiplayer. Both modes have issues though. The AI is terrible and gains artificial bonuses on higher difficulties. The multiplayer could be good, but relies on peer-to-peer connections and is plagued with desyncs and issues. Forget playing with random people on the internet through the game, you need external communities, like CPL, for that. There are mods that heavily improve the multiplayer experience, like ""Multiplayer Helper"", ""Better Balanced Starts"" and ""Better Balanced Game"".

Some victory conditions are very boring and each of them force you too much into a single playstyle for my taste. The balancing of the game is all over the place (which is fine for singleplayer, but not multiplayer). Despite all of that I can't stop playing and still learn new things and get better. Addicting."

I have really tried to like this game, trying many different kind of game rules and strategies. Now that civ 6 got two expansions I feel it's fair to give my judgement about the game. It is very likely that civ 6 is now in its final form.There are two really great features that are  huge improvements over other civilization games: unique great people abilities and districts. Now great people gives you an opportunity to pick only the ones that fits to your game strategy and skip the ones that are not needed. Each of them now has their complete unique abilities. Districts finally makes your cities to expand outside the city center. Number of districts per city are limited so in end game you no longer see ""super-mega cities"" like in previous civilizations that had every single building.Unfortunately those two steps forward don't save the game because there are way too many steps back. The game has many new features that sure makes the game more complex like the governors, loyalty, grievances or tile appeal but really they really don't add any deep or make the game more fun to play. You are constantly swapping governors from town to town in order to get some use out of them. Loyalty makes warfare total pain in the game as conquered cities often rebel before you have any change to do anything to make it more loyal. Civilizations are way less unique than they were in civilization V. Now almost every civilization is just +X% or +X to something and one unique building & unit. Warfare in general is way less engaging and fun than in previous civ games. Mainly because game mechanics are too complex for the AI, it just sends few units here and there and seems to have no strategy at all. In every game you see great generals and admirals wondering around the map alone doing nothing. The general pace of wars is even more slower than in civ 5, because of loyalty system and slower health regeneration rates.Civilizations IV and V still offers far better game mechanics and they have also aged well. I recommend buying IV or V if you want to jump into the Civilization series."

It is, from a graphical point of view, amazing.However, the game becomes dull and boring really quickly. The first 100 turns in any campaign are really fun and exciting. However, once you start getting deeper in, building any sort of momentum with the game is really challenging because... every other turn you have to make ""small (micro)"" decisions that actually don't change that much, and take quite a bit of mental energy to sort through to find what you want/need.  Plus, in the context of Civ, it might be better to say that these are ""super micro"" decisions. Micro for districts. Micro for world council. Micro for policies and policy cards. In theory, it sounds and seems great. The first couple of matches you play, you deal with it. Micro-ing away as best as you can. And micro-ing to that level does sometimes give a pretty satisfying feeling, like itching a really itchy spot. But then you're on you're 10th match, and you kinda start realizing that policy cards pop up way too much, don't actually change all that much, and interrupt the flow of the match.Just want to battle it out with Ghandi? Aw shucks, but I gotta slot in those policy cards every two turns. Hmm better spend 15 mins planning my districts out to get max bonuses, even if in the end, they don't matter that much. Okay, now I can dook it out with ya Mr. Ghandi. I guess that's the problem. Micro-ing in the early game should be insanely powerful and useful, and would make early game a lot more diverse, but instead you just use the same policies because other policies don't match up. I don't see how anyone doesn't start off with the +5dmg vs barbarians and +1 faith and gold for the palace every match right off the bat, the other cards are just... sort of useless?And then by the mid game... you've got a lot more on the go. And micro-ing just becomes an annoying pain in the ass, and makes it hard to enjoy the game. No, I don't want a pop-up screen every 5 turns. And then late game.... eugh. Policy cards, world emergencies, climate emergencies, requests for aid, regular world council, planning districts, recovering artifacts, needing to manage builders because they disappear after 3 uses... see where this is going?To me, Civ 5 is much better, gameplay and fun wise. Even though the graphics are horribly out-dated, it is just much more satisfying to play. Civ 6 introduces a ton of new mechanics. Some are good, some are not as good. Try it out for yourself. You might enjoy the micro aspects a lot more than I do.But nobody is going to convince me that this game is better than Civ 5.

I've been a writer, a coder, a tester but above all else a gamer. My favorite type of game is strategy and i've spent many thousands of hours playing every sid meier game that has ever came out. From pirates, railroads, sim city and every civ. I got a copy of this game for free, which was neat because I was about to order it but I have been on a mailing list since like 92 and I guess it was my turn. First time heh.What I liked:Game felt very familiar right away. I didn't struggle to understand anything that was going on. The districts are explained very well and actually make sense. I never did like being able to cram every single wonder into one city in previous civs, i mean it made for a great city but really, where were you putting all those things? Depending on which civ you choose you can have anywhere from 5 to 6 districts per city from a selection of arts, entertainment, industry, science, faith etc etc. Each of those districts can house many different types of buildings specific to your civ and what direction you are trying to go in with that city. Also Wonders are linked to districts and by land formations you can't just build them anywhere so city placement, tile purchase and city layout are very strategic.Diplomacy. I read alot of negative comments about this. How the AI is insane and makes no sense. In fact i'd say 75% of the negative reviews are about this. However, I can say that 100% of the people complaining about the diplomacy simply don't understand it. Civ VI diplomacy is insanely complex and deep, every leader has his/her own personality matrix plus 2 agendas, one public and one hidden. The public agenda is always the same, lets call it the civ agenda. The hidden agenda is more like the leaders personal goal, looking out for him/herself not so much their nations interest. You have to get close to a nation through gifts, trading, etc to be granted 'secret' access to their policy to see their hidden agenda. If anything you do goes counter to any of their agenda's they become erratic and paranoid. Think south korea and north korea, they co-exist but barely. Or china and taiwan. Civs take their sovereignty super serious in this one, even the HINT that you are making an aggressive move makes them paranoid, build a settler, fine, move that settler one hex towards empty land near them, they freak. Remember, they are hipocrits too. Oh and gifts are your friend, give them small amounts of gold every so often.Units and Combat.The combat in this version is about the same as in the last, you do have some support units and there is a whole faith based combat system but honestly most of the refinement can be had here, its not great but its not bad.Fit and PolishI do wish they had gone a different direction than the cartoony graphics, of course one of the first mods i used was the westeros reshade filter which helped a ton, another issue is when playing a 12 AI map turns take forever to resolve, sometimes 2 minutes which is crazy. But overall its a solid base game and I think it will only get better as they patch and refine.*edit* I wanted to edit this to add a couple things. First off I have had alot of people saying this game was buggy. I have a decent PC: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 14393) (14393.rs1_release_inmarket.161014-1755)  Language: English (Regional Setting: English)  BIOS: BIOS Date: 10/20/10 09:47:36 Ver: 08.00.10  Processor: AMD FX(tm)-8120 Eight-Core Processor            (8 CPUs), ~3.1GHz  Memory: 16384MB RAM  Available OS Memory: 16330MB RAM  Page File: 6269MB used, 12724MB available  DirectX Version: DirectX 12  Card name: AMD Radeon R9 200 Series  Manufacturer: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Sure the game needs refinement, sure it has some bugs, but to label it as a glitchy, bug laden pile of garbage as so many have is outright false. I suspect they are using mods, perhaps incorrectly, or edited files themselves, maybe their systems need more memory. I know alot of people try to game on laptops now. That is simply something that won't fly in this game, not unless you sprung for a 1600++ gaming laptop with 12+ gb of ram and a dedicated GPU.Just saying...*edit #2*Wanted to edit my review to add my current favorite mods I am using that makes the game well, perfect imo.

The expansion and development of that game in comparison to this one is a complete joke. If you were to pay the same ammount of money there are FAR LESS features in Civilization 6 as compared to 5. I paid for the digital delux edition expecting the same product I recieved with Civilization 5 which (when paired with the DLC) was a masterpiece in my humble opinion. This is not the case with Civilization 6. There are amazing features in this game, like city development, the districts system, expanded cultures, and a seemingly more expanisve end-game. I am also not opposed to the art style, and felt it did not detract from the game in any meaningful way.However in stark contrast, the AI is absolutely apalling, the diplomacy/warmongering is game breaking, many Civs with military focus are insanely powerful when compared to Civs with religion focus, the lack of world congress, and not to mention that the game is EASY. Here is a guide on how to win at nearly any difficulty:  1) ♥♥♥♥ culture, religion, and diplomacy, and throw that ♥♥♥♥ right out the window 2) Have AI declare war on you/declare war on them 3) Have your military chill in your cities with plenty of ranged units 4) Slaughter the AI's army as it throws itself mindlessly against your walls 5) Counter-attack the now militarily inconsiquential AI with a mix of mele at the front backed up by a ♥♥♥♥ load of ranged units 6) ProfitWhat the ♥♥♥♥ is happening Firaxis?? Civilization 5 was AMAZING and it showed in your reviews of the game. Then Beyond Earth? Which many people choose to forget as a blemish worth overlooking in the series because it was reasonable to ""try new things"". And now Civilization 6?? Some of the things you did with this game were amazing, and many people love it. But, it's painfully obvious you spent far too much effort on developing very specific aspects of the game while completely neglecting CORE elements of what made running a civilization in previous games fun. It pains me to see all of these new and wonderful ideas sit idle, and grow stagnent while you release DLC that pales in comparison to your previos efforts instead of balancing that with further refining.In summary I am NOT a satisfied customer, I am so dissappointed by the product I have recieved thusfar, and will most certainly NOT be pre-ordering any Civilization game ever again (let alone this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have been served as digital ""delux""). This makes me so sad Firaxis. I have LOVED your series since first purchasing Civilization 3, and have since pre-ordered every one of your games plus any available DLC/digital delux content in the Civilization series. I will no longer be doing this.Thank you so much for the good times I had, and I am perfectly willing to change my opinion, and this review of the game if it develops into something I am satisfied with.

It has some cool features too, but many, many problems.First, the good, since this list will be shorter.1. The district and wonder mechanics are the shining beacon of this game. And, sadly, the only beacon of this game. While it's odd at times and can be confusing for people new to 6, properly utilizing districts can have amazing returns. Especially if you use mods that make the gameplay actually remotely viable (omnibus, loaded districts, quo's, etc). Wonders taking up a tile can hurt, but it also provides massive benefits... assuming, of course, you're using mods (wondrous wonders, quo's, etc). natural wonders also make a comeback, and often provide amazing bonuses themselves (dead sea making your scouts immortal against the barbarian horde lol, the new mountain allowing units to ignore hills... until they get promoted for some reason?), though many are usually decent at best, and some are downright weak. Districts also helps combat the ""build a city every 4 tiles in a grid"" that you see in all of the earlier civs. Due to taking up tiles on their own, cities need more tiles to be able to remain self-sufficient. Getting ""good"" cities (where each of your districts have several yield points) means spreading your districts out (unless you're japan). Cities take more space than they did in earlier games, and compacting your cities now means you're worse off than in the earlier civ games, when you could build markets and libraries without issue in your 7-hex/9 square city. Really, the introduction of districts has done a lot for the game, and is the single best feature of the game, even with the new expansion.2. Speaking of the expansion, thank god they didn't pull another ""we're removing a base feature from older games and making you pay a bunch to have it back again"". Golden ages were re-introduced, but they behave completely different from the same of older games. There's loyalty, which is the peaceful city grabbing, but it doesn't count as re-adding base features for a different reason, and I'll leave that for later. The ages mechanic is actually interesting, the dedications are very powerful (if you can get a golden age), and strategic dark ages can result in steamrolling the enemy, -especially- if you can get a golden age afterwards. That said, if you're playing on slower games (like marathon), it ranges from very difficult to nigh-impossible to not get a golden age, much less get a dark age (a problem made worse with 8 ages of pace later in the game, but they're working on that, and that doesn't effect the middle of the game)... unless you're an AI, of course. So another hopeful mechanic.And that's it for the positives. Now for the negatives.1. The AI. First off I want to mention what difficulty does in civ games (and most games, really). A higher difficulty means the AI gets benefits, and you get disadvantages. It does not have any effect on their ability to actually play, meaning they will behave the same way in easy as in deity. Just that if you play in deity you'll never get any wonders because of said AI benefits. As such, the AI in this game is BAD. A common issue deals with AI simply not expanding, even if they have -plenty- of room or -plenty- of resources to go for. They just don't. Sometimes you'll be in the atomic age and finally go to explore that continent you ignored, find another civ, and they're 3 ages behind you with ONLY A SINGLE CITY. I've had games were 3+ civs did this. Hell, I've had games where I had more cities than everyone else in a 10-player game combined without engaging in any war. The AI has plenty of other problems, as well, sometimes leading to exploits that for a unit to walk back and forth forever without actually attacking you because of how the AI works (though I believe they -might- have fixed this with the expansion - they've had a year and a half to do it, after all). The mod that would fix the AI can't actually do much because of the lack of tools given to modders.2. Speaking of ""year and a half"" and mods, the devs have been completely and utterly irresponsive to practically everything that actually matters. There was no teams when this game came out. ""oh but there's teams now"" some might say, but that doesn't fix the problem. Teams weren't introduced until the Australian Summer update. Neither was any real mod support. Both of these were supposed to be in the game at launch, but weren't, and instead delayed to a ""day 0 patch"", which inevitably turned into a ""month 5"" patch. By then, hype had died down, and anyone who could have been interested in the game lost interest. It went from a game a heard about daily to a game I only remember because I look through my steam list for something to play between burning myself out on other games. I honestly have no clue where the slew of news regarding this game gets its ""it's amazingly popular"" considering the reviews for this game and its DLC are either MIXED or MOSTLY NEGATIVE. But back to the responsiveness, or lack thereof, the team made absolutely no remark to the public over a fix for teams or modding for months, and at one point removed the only evidence they were actually planning on adding it from the code (removed the existing teams code as well as the ""day 0 patch"" comment), which only further served to anger the playerbase that had been waiting for a few months to play the game they pre-ordered (there are a large number of players who -only- play teams). it wasn't until even later that they actually made an official statement remarking that they knew about teams and were planning on fixing it, which seemed more like a remark to the ""they won't speak"" comments than an actual promise to release. Then the Australian Summer patch came and fixed everything, right? Wrong. More bugs were introduced into the game, including a frustrating bug that makes playing the game -extremely- uncomfortable, that's -still in the game a year later with no comment- that's caused by something seemingly -completely disconnected-. If one of your units discovers the edge of the map, it causes the game to stop playing sounds for... some reason? at first it's just one or two actions of a couple units or buttons stop making sounds, or longer periods between music changing, but eventually all sounds other than ambient wind completely disappear, including button clicks, cutscene sounds, all music, and, the most annoying part, barbarian spawns, resulting in the player needing to reload the save in order to fix it... for a couple of turns before it breaks again. this doesn't get fixed until you research satelites or use the debug command ""Reveal All"". For people who play on marathon speed and circumnavigate the world in 150-200 turns, this means spending the next 3-400 turns without sound, or reloading the game. Of course this isn't the only game-ruining bug - the game is chock full of them. A year and 3 civ packs later and R&F comes out... and completely borks mods. Somehow they managed to mess it up so badly that DLC now load after the mods that reference or otherwise rely on, causing a return to the title screen. The only fix for this is to -overwrite core game files-. Overwriting core files is always treated as a last-ditch effort by modders in every game, but in civ 6 it seems practically necessary to get stuff to work properly, with this being the latest affront to modders. So far they haven't commented on this at all. Oh, but I sure am glad they're putting all their effort in making their new hidden agendas less ""sexist""! /sarcI don't have enough characters to finish this review, so I'll continue it in the comments."

I can tell you this- if you like your gaming companies to be competent people who don't try to sell you a million DLCs when basic functions in the game are still broken a year later then Firaxis are not your guys. If Firaxis is wondering why CIV VI is selling so poorly, maybe they should look to themselves and realize people really hate it when you sell a broken game.Edit: came back 2.5 years later to review againIn any case I cam back, bought the new DLC on a steep sale and frankly it still sucks. Not crashing this time but since CIV IV there's been a really really stupid trend towards trying to discourage the player from expanding. The AI I'm pretty sure is cheating and is able to somehow produce more settlers than me while simultaneously growing their cities faster which doesn't really make sense, but more importantly is the absolutely idiotic settlement system. So a rival is like 5 tiles from a strategic resource I wanted, so now I can't settle there? And the dumb tiling system means I can't buy tiles from another city until I reach it? The system seems designed to curb your expansion while discouraging violently beating up the AI to make it stop forward settling your space. It's not really a fun exploration game when the AI continues to forward settle in every.single.civgame and this kind of thing has been going on since CIV 3. I hate the AI so much and I still don't recommend this game unless it's on sale (and I only bought the new DLC on sale because I got a fat tax refund and trumpbux so whatever).And the stupid continental system still isn't fun, every single continent is basically connected to each other. In CIV 3 you could get these cool maps where you'd be isolated on a small island in the sea and have to rush Pharos Lighthouse to get the early sea exploration to find out if you were just a Borneo with other islands nearby or if you were a New Zealand distant from pretty much everything else. All of the maps in CIV VI are frustratingly similar even when I randomize all the settings.Early 2022, 4 years later. Came back again. Still randomly crashes."

It's definitely got some fun to it and has some very neat systems in place. Districts and adjacency bonuses, while not perfect, add a layer of strategy and planning that I appreciate. Wonders being moved to tiles instead of cities deters wonder whoring and adds potential for greater effects. Civs feel a bit more fleshed out and varied -- DLC civs in particular, mind you -- in terms of both abilities and playstyles. The science/civic tree split both makes sense and, alongside governments and policy cards, feels better than social policies did in Civ V. Religion, Espionage, and City States have much more depth and impact than they had in Civ V. Mods are easier to impliment and switch out and don't disable achievements. And I do have to commend Firaxis for recognizing complaints and giving Digital Deluxe folks 3 more civs than initially promised.But the AI is ditzy and unforgiving. Agendas kill diplomacy completely and lead to rapid denouncements. The soundtrack is inferior to Civ V and very repetitive. The tech tree is paltry and poorly connected (researching flight before I can even build castles? Swordsmen progressing to musketmen progressing to modern infantry?). The late game is astoundingly boring. Movement of units is slow and stiff. Barbarians come in nigh-insurmountable droves. Sean Bean's readings are boring and the quotes he reads are lame. Hotfixes have to wait for slow, periodic patches, leaving glaring bugs in the game for longer than they should be. Not to mention the blatant cashgrabbing with how DLC is handled (The full game is $80, let's be real). It's genuinely repulsive to see Civ stoop to this level. tl;dr it's almost there, and is fun in some aspects, but ultimately falls flat and has some glaring issues that keep it from being truly enjoyable."

There are two main reasons for that: The AI and the DLC policy. The AI is not very good (although it wasn't that great in Civ 5 either), they often make subpar choices and they aren't very good at war at all, which means you can usually beat them even while being outnumbered 1 to 5 easily as long as you're not playing on the highest two difficulties. The DLC policy is also not great, when Firaxis releases a new Civ game it's always barebones and lacking in content and mechanics, and then they shower you with expensive DLC to make the experience feel complete. Now this is awful at the beginning, when the game gets originally released, but as the title approaches the moment when all of its DLC are released, they offer decent discounts. You can now for example get the gold edition which includes everything minus the last expansion for just 32€, and then you can get Gathering Storm for around 30€ to 40€.All in all, Civ 6 is just like Civ 5 in a generalistic way, but there's new and different mechanics that make the experience quite different too. If you liked Civ 5, I'd highly recommend getting this one, but only when it's discounted."

It is a game that has so much potential, so many excellent ideas to expand on arguably the greatest turn-based strategy game of modern times in Civilisation V: Brave New World, but falls short in a few key areasGraphically the game is stunning. The aesthetic issues some people seemed to dislike moving from V to VI are moved past easily once you see the fluid unit, leader and wonder animations. The day night cycle looks good, albeit a little unnecessary and annoying at times, and everything is clear on the strategic and world maps. The music is also excellent, each Civ having their own theme that develops as the game goes on, America's theme being notably one of the best pieces I've heard in a video game for a long time. Rise and Fall simply added to these with more leaders and more units, all of which look and sound top notchGameplay wise there are a lot of positive improvements. Districts make city planning a lot more strategic and long term than in V, where you could broadly keep your city up to date by chopping and changing tile improvements as you went. The change to workers that means they now have limited uses fulfills a similar purpose. Wonders similarly use up space on the map, though their value is disputable in far too many cases. Policy cards make changes to the fundamental bonuses your Civ is receiving feel a lot more involved and a lot more intricate than just the government or policy tree changes of previous games. Combat is essentially unchanged from V, if you're going for a domination victory the only major change is the addition of the Encampment district which is vital to any warmonger. Loyalty means that expansion is tempered by a need to either snowball completely or heavily garrison your gains however, which is a good addition.But all those good improvements come with downsides. The early game is even more heavily weighted in importance than in V. Unlucky starts can cripple you in comparison to your opponents, wonders can sometimes skew things so far as to remove major challenges to expansion and teching entirely (The Colosseum adds both Loyalty and Culture to cities in range, making it an absolute monster), and religion, despite having a victory condition now, is less powerful than in V by virtue of its bonuses being a lot less passive and a lot more focussed on that victory. Spies are either useless or broken depending on circumstances (siphoning funds is meh but completely stopping a Space Race part or outright stealing works of art is insane) and often arbitrarily extend games. The AI has no real idea, seemingly, as to how to use most of these elements which further reinforces the players ability to abuse such mechanics. It says a lot that the developers made massive improvements to the AI's ability to use naval combat a year after release because it was, frankly, so easy to win with fleets before that patch and still isn't that hard to just steamroll them now.All that being said, it has the same ""one more turn"" addictive quality that it predecessor had, compounded by the city planning elements that make you want to go back and try again with a new setup and synergies. I adore playing Greece and trying to find ways to beat the AI's to wonders around my Parthenons to create powerful districts that dominate culturally and have done since release. Balance is actually very good, though there are definitely currently Civ's that are extremely powerful (Korea, Greece, Russia, Germany - essentially any with a specialised district of their own) and tech is still easily the most reliable route to victory because by its nature it provides two routes to easy victory (Space and Domination).In multiplayer I've had issues with desyncing since release but it's never been fatal, unlike in Beyond Earth and V where games would just collapse after some desyncs. Sometimes that's unavoidable, so the relatively stability of the game on release and since is good.Overall, Civ VI is not an improvement on V, but neither is it a huge step backwards. It won't feel enough like a new experience if you're still enjoying V and sometimes my nostalgia for BNW kicks in hard. But I don't think I could go back to it. Civ VI changes how you view the Civilisation environment, and that alone means it's gets my recommendation as something to try if it ever goes on sale."

Unfortunately, I couldn't quite even get to the 100 hour mark with this game in the 6+ years I've owned it and found myself going back to Civ 5 even to this day.The game improves a lot in the features from Civ 5, allowing more ways run your civilization with the unit improvements such as allowing attachment of civilian unites to military ones to protect them as well as allowing districts so that a city that was started surrounded by land could still access the ocean if it was at least a few tiles away.  But even with all of these improvements, I couldn't get over a lot of the aesthetic choices they went with this game.  The cartoony and exaggerated expressions from the Civ leaders and units didn't really click with me and kind of made the experience feel more cheap as compared to the more realistic and compelling aesthetic that Civ 5 had.  I also did not like the change of workers expiring after improving a certain amount of tiles whereas 5 kept your workers to continually improve.The agenda system also does dampen the experience a little for me as well as I often found leaders despising me just because I wouldn't fit what they prefer, such as lacking in culture.  I'm sure others would find this setting interesting as it adds another dynamic in relations, but I found it very annoying as it didn't make a lot of sense to ruin relations just because my empire wasn't progressing in a way that the AI thought suitable.It may be a fit unfair with how much I do compare this game to Civ 5, but it is hard not to given this was the next step taken in the series.  Given how I hold Civ 5 in such high regard and how much of a let down this game was in comparison, I honestly cannot recommend it to others.  If you did not like Civ 5, this game might be a good change of pace to get into.  But if you are similar to me and love Civ 5, I would recommend awaiting to see if Civ 7 will be the next step that takes the series to a higher level, as Civ 6 failed to do so in my opinion."

That is bad for a Civ game.  It simply seems to have little in the way of new discoveries and the system of districts has the nasty side effect that you more often busy yourself with the internal affairs of your empire instead of exploring the world - which gets tedious and uninspiring after you've done it for a few games. Game mechanics like diplomacy, religion and spying feel chorelike. With the lack of map generation options, the crazy AI, the lacklustre rewards for expansion and exploration, the reduced need to find specific strategic resources, it all ends up being pretty samey. I can't put my finger on it but it also feels like the different civs are less unique now.You'd think that focusing on internal affairs would be fun, especially for someone like me who really loves playing the turtle, but you will rarely find a game where an AI will not force you to war, either by settling ridiculously close to you or suicide attacking you. Want to focus a match on culture and science? Forget it, war it is. Want to be a reclusive island civ that colonizes the new world? Forget it, an AI will always spawn at a set distance from you. Want to be a glorious diplomat? Nope, the AI will hate you relentlessly. There also doesn't seem to be much of a way to get ahead without fighting - which gets boring if you've already played countless wars in Civ5.I understand that they've tried to streamline the gameplay a bit, by reducing the different types of units you get through the ages, balancing starting map points more etc. but there's not escaping that this also makes every game more repetative. I prefer my Civ matches to be more assymetrical as it keeps the matches interesting and really increases the replay value. The lack of global happiness (Which was a stupid system in itself) and the addition of the generic entertainment complex now makes luxury resources seem to have much less of an impact on the gameplay - and the spawn rate of resources is less chaotic, which makes for finding especially interesting spots on the map for settling (and fighting over) incredibly rare.There are many good sides to the game as well - but you can find those in the positive reviews. My hopes are that they'll turn this game around with a few wonderful expansions and patches. Until then, look for a sale to pick this one up. There still potential to turns this into a great game and I'll change my review if they do so."

Compared to that, Civ 6 is a huge step forward.Original review: While the new graphics style might need getting used to by some, there's really not much to complain about. The interface is sleek and polished and the new fog of war (as well as the strategic view) are gorgeous. Same goes for the amazin theme by Christopher Tin. Civilization 6 takes a fresh turn on well-tried mechanics and is changing those that didn't quite work out, as well as introducing a lot of new ones – and they all seem to fit perfectly. The base game includes nearly everything that was in the Civ 5 DLCs. Not everything, but there has to be something left for modding and DLC, right? Let's end with this: If you ever liked a 4X game in general or a Civ game in particular, you can grab this one without hesitation.

A player figured out a simple edit to a config file that seems to fix a lot of the crashing issues. So far I've even managed to finish a single players game with only 3 crashes (turn 30ish, 120ish, and finally at 300), frankly 3 ain't bad, and I'm about 150 deep in a multiplayer game that has only crashed once (at about turn 50).You'll have to look on the steam forums because I'm not going to add that all in here, but its pretty easy to change. tl;dr: If you are willing to put up with a glitchy game that requires its players to suss out its issues then go ahead and buy this.

All in all the strategic oversight was lacking because the map was filled with too much clutter.  With the latest dlc the game has improved significantly. The weather and natural disasters are well done.  The one thing that bothers me still is the amount of cities that the AI churns out.  It becomes more of a race for settler building than anything else sometimes. Plus I find the AI really aggressive to the point where I lose my fun playing. So I still am undecided as to wheither I like the game. Sometimes I am enjoying it immensely but often only to be frustrated again by aforementioned problems. (still the fog of war bothers me in my oversight in the way that it is displayed) So I wish I could  change the way the fog of war looks.  It is a mighty game still but I can't help but feel it could have been so much better still.

Messy and definately a step backwards from last version. - AI. top complaint from what I can see. Convinced myself it couldn`t be that bad and that every civ game suffers the same issues. But it was. It really was. The AI clearly cheats and spews out units and wonders at start. Their attempts at international relations are extremely erratic and devoid of any reason or loyality. War will come randomly and without warning. Managed to hold my own and pursued scorched earth policy in return. And after a bit the other civs just stopped. Sued for peace and stagnated doing very little. Whilst the civs too far to fight me directly denounced me for rubbish reasons and spammed religious units which arrived at my capital in droves.- Graphics fine. But making sense of the map with the resources and districts is confusing and messy. Speaking of which....- Districts. A good idea I suppose but doesn`t implement well in my opinion. Maybe if tiles where smaller and more frequent. I see potential for making speciality cities but instead I end up with sprawling messes. - Interface is horrible. So counter intuitive. I miss the city screens. Civ games are about making decisions based on information and the way this game displays that information really is a massive step back. Can`t even click on tile for info before making move. I accidentally moved units a number of times with no cancel option. - Builders last 3 turns? Bit of a rubbish change if you ask me. Especially when it takes so long to make them.- No apparent option to balance spending and taxation. Surely I should be allowed to choose which to prioritise- Religion. Just annoying. AI spams stupid units which pour over my territory with no option to block them or warn AI. All I can do is spawn my own to attack each one. Slowly and repeatedly. Very tedious. - Governors. Welcome I guess. But a missed opportunity. Very rigid in what each one does. Would be good to shape your own in your chosen direction. Maybe add ministers. - Corp and armies option very welcome addition. Wars would be so much better if they made tiles smaller thus avoiding 2 tile pile ups. Would offer alot more strategy. Also would be great if you had separate military and civil budgets and could build from both side by side. Anyway, could probably add to this list of gripes quite a bit but short version is a thumbs down from me. Will probably struggle on for a bit whilst constantly thinking ""why did the do that when they could have done this"". Shame."

I was frustrated by Civ Beyond Earth, from technical bugs to issues with progression, maybe because it was foreign to me I just couldn't get into it in the way I expected.  I still had some of that anxiety going into Civ 6, maybe it wouldn't be the game I wanted it to be, that it would be a step backwards from Civ V which is one of my favorite games of all time.  I think Civ 6 has the bones to be the best Civ yet, every aspect has some new level of depth or thought put into it, from great people having unique bonuses, to limiting the typical wonder spamming cities by requiring tile placement of wonders, to city state bonuses being more unique and having that race for Suzerain.  I love when you find a great spot for a district with huge adjacency bonuses, setting up a great holy site or harbor really feels better than just adding a building to a production queue.That said, there is still a lot of frustration for me as a classic Civ gamer, barbarian encampments that spawn high damage horsemen or ranged ships within the first 20 turns, movement penalties being changed from Civ V, some unit autocycling problems, and even AI bugs like not upgrading or spamming too much of one type of unit.  I think most of those faults are overlooked by the core of the game being much deeper.   Along this line, the first fall patch to Civ 6 addressed many issues, and has me excited for future updates to improve quality of life for the game.Also, as a new father, Civ 6 is one of the few games I can play while holding my baby.  I often play with the steam controller so that I can set up all the mouse actions to be controlled by one hand while I cradle the baby in my other arm.If I had to recommend one Civ game to a newcomer, I’d say you can’t beat Civ 5 with all the DLC, it has everything I love about civ and isn’t working through any bugs or UI issues, but if you have played Civ before, Civ 6 is a great addition to the series and I can’t wait to see what more they bring to the table.*** It has been 4 years since this review and I'd say that I love this game more now than I did when I wrote it.  The expansion passes have made the game more rich and deep, I can't even imagine playing without governors and climate change anymore.  My biggest gripe is still load times."

Now I'm judging the base game but this is in summary how I feel.They took out the best part of civ 5, and replaced it with nothing. The best part being city states. Which is a weird argument. What made civ 5 good? The early game is peoples first instinct perhaps, maybe the one more turn, but I'd argue that civ 5 recognized a core flaw in 4x gaming, pacing. Most 4x games start out interesting, establish borders, and just sorta kill each other from there. There's usualy a twist in there somewhere but for civ 5 that twist played off of globalization.In civ 5 you started off very focused on expansion and exploration. Only really concerned with the immediate area around you. Then it became your empire and your neighbors. Once you got money, and maybe needed some more resources, the local city states, perhaps a few wars. Then Rennisance happens, and you can make the world congress and find more trading partners. So you start exploring, and all of a sudden everyone is voting on bills. City states become more important, and you're competing for them mostly non violently. By the end of the game, every city state is a strategic location, and you no longer are just concerned with your immediate neighbors, but also in other forign empires now that you have the reach to go out and meet them.In civ 6, they removed the congress, made city states all about giving you internal buffs, and also made it so you no longer had a reason to explore the world in the proccess. Civ 6 is like a bad good board game. It's all about looking at what you're doing and only worrying about what others do if it affects your internal planning. It's all about maximizing districts, not going ""Oh, we should probably ally Ragusa because it has Uranium... And that other global rival can't have that."" Or ""I need to make sure I can't get embargoed!"" It's now, ""If I put this district here... I will get one more production for it""As result, you never really care what's going on in the world, or who you're trading with. And it causes the whole game to kinda melt together. If you honestly asked me what's the difference between the early game, and the late game, I would hesitantly say nuclear bombs, and maybe airplanes. The truth is, civ 5 made you feel like history was changing as you played it, changing hte gameplay and how you interacted with the world. Civ 6 feels like a game of dominion, where I optimize my econemy and hope nobody interupts me. It doesn't feel like a journey through history, I can hardly feel a difference between mid and late game. And I think that's a big shame.Edit On The Topic of DLC: A lot of reviews claim DLC fix this game by adding more features. But no DLC addresses pacing, my main gripe with Civ VI. Steam reviewers point to Gathering Storm and say ""This adds back world congress, interaction, weather and new mechanics!"" but I've watched dozens of multiplayer playthroughs from the yogscast civilization series with Gathering Storm, and they use these mechanics to give more to do, not change the pacing. Diplo favor and a world congress may be back, and it may be based off of city state allies & emergencies, but city states only passively increase your diplo point gain, and you can only passively (Again!) affect your ability to ally with more city states via culture production, & new forms of government, all of which you solve internally. The new emergencies do give diplo points, but you solve the ones that aren't about religion and war (Two mechanics that were already in the game and were your only means of interacting beyond your boarders) is by building projects internaly in cities and getting points towards an imaginary timer that gives a heap of diplo points when the timer runs out. End result is you're just staring at your own cities all day still, and the way you play never changes.  You just have more to do.Civ V's pacing with all DLC's is just better than Civ VI's pacing. And why would you want a strategy game that is paced worst, but shares over half of it's mechanics with it's last incarnation?"
294,30,wcis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wcisu/,87,5,1,401.1,"Posted: March 17, 2018",665,8,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/cc65b2e51c12c364fdb62d61b2232e804b4c789a.jpg,"I am going to start with very unpopular, but true statement: . It's engaging, beautifully designed and finally has some complex mechanics, which are truly shining in mid and late game. . And I’m pretty sure there is more to come.This will be a quite long and detailed review. Still, I won't point everything, but only the most important things about this game.First of all, we are talking about Sid Meier's Civilization and let's make it clear: AI was never the strongest point of those games. Yes, in this one it had some serious problems at the release, but right now it's fine. Just fine. For example, playing on “King” difficulty, which is my favorite, is quite satisfying. AI is not declaring stupid wars and if so, it is not sending units to death. It's also properly upgrading older units. If not prepared, we can actually lose some cities. Why “King” difficulty? This is a 4X strategy game and on higher difficulties AI is simply cheating. It's not fun for me. If you are complaining about AI in Civilization VI, then let me remind you, that in “glorious” IV different civilizations were losing to barbarians in turn 2. How stupid was that? And Civilization V? It had many flaws as well. Not mentioning the fact, that the “vanilla” version was very… empty. I wasn't very happy after seeing early gameplays. I didn't like this soft and anime style of the game, but I have appreciated it with time. Whole map, units, districts, cities, and finally wonders, are all very detailed and they do look great. What's more, we can turn on day and night cycle and it's actually really cool to see your empire during night. Optimization is also great, at least for me. There is no ""end game lag"" here.Whole map has also been changed a bit with Rise and Fall DLC. For example, if we are in the dark age, everything is a little bit darker and in comparison, during golden or heroic ages, everything is full of joy and light. It's a little thing, but as we all know, being accurate about those little things is also the difference between being good or great in what you do. Civilization VI in terms of audio-visual performance has plenty of those “things”. Sometimes you just sit, watch and listen (at this point I highly recommend you to search for Zulus Atomic Theme, you will thank me later).Leaders. They are fine and personally, they were never important for me. While looking at whole Civilization series, we see nations, not leaders. And yes, there are plenty of women as leaders in Civilization VI, but remember one thing: historically, they were great. Complaining about “excessive feminism” won't change anything and is simply stupid, but on the other side we are living in XXI century and people are complaining about everything now. Returning to the game itself, there are many civilizations to choose from and what's the most important, you can feel that they are unique in terms of actual gameplay.Going through all the eras feels smooth. Like in previous Civilization games the music is also changing and we can feel that everything is more modern as the time pass. Of course it's not perfect at the moment. Mostly because there are certain techs that can be rushed or strongly focused at, so for example we can get late Renaissance units, while all our opponents are still stick with Middle Ages knights or even worse. To be honest, it was always a problem and it's really hard to find a perfect solution here. In the end the game is quite fair and sometimes we can be surprised that our enemies have such strong units or technology already. You need to make a use of your starting position, all resources, terrain and special abilities of your civilization. All those things make every experience unique and we can all agree that it's the best thing in Civilization games. Scenarios. If you like them, you will be disappointed, because you can get most of them only by buying small DLC packs. They are quite original, just like in Civilization V, but there are not too many of them and you can finish most of them in around an hour. This aspect is the one, that in my opinion should receive a lot of attentions from devs right now. I love playing historically accurate scenarios, but well… I'm still waiting for them here. Of course there is Steam Workshop integration so you can download a lot of cool stuff, scenarios and new civilizations, but as we all know, it's not the same. Obviously I am not going to list everything here. Yet, there are some things that in comparison to other Civilization entries changed for good and there are also many new things, mostly introduced in Rise and Fall DLC, which are really nice. First of all, tech and civics trees are both designed in pretty different way, making you actually think about them during the game. What's more, you can boost most of them and you need to know how to do this, since they all have special triggers. Secondly, governments are back. Through the game you are unlocking plenty of policy cards, but you can use only some of them. Thanks to those, you can finally customize many things about your policy. While building your city, you also need to remember that wonders and districts are being built on hex tiles, not within the city itself. This is important, because while you colonize you can't look only after the resources, but you need to think about districts and potential places on which you can build important wonders. A pleasant strategic element. I have seen that people are complaining about districts, but in my opinion they are really interesting. Thanks to them game itself has more depth and some districts, like military one, can be crucial in defending our empire, so you always need to think twice before choosing where to build them. Same with wonders. In Civilization VI you can't have all of them, like you could in previous one. You need to choose carefully which wonder will suit you best in your current playthrough. Most interesting changes came with Rise and Fall DLC. Firstly, loyalty system which is nice for players who like to play passively. If your citizens are happy, you can apply pressure on nearby cities and actually annex them into your empire. You also need to think where to start your new cities, because otherwise it's easy to lose them during dark age in our empire. What's more? We have great ages, mentioned above, and governors. While playing the game we earn special points by doing some things, like discovering wonders, conquering barbarians, hiring great people etc. If we reach certain amount of them, our civilization will be in a golden age, which gives us some perks. If we won't do anything about this, we can end up in dark age, which may be actually quite dangerous for us. Governors are special persons placed in the cities. Their specialization bonuses are quite strong and setting them in the right city can be crucial for the game. On the other side you need to look which governors are used by your opponents. All those new things are very interesting and thanks to them mid and late game are both more interesting than they used to be.If you are looking for the grand strategy, Civilization VI is not for you. . Grab it and enjoy your free time while playing. There is nothing better than a round of Civilization on free Sunday or after hard day at work. Personally, I have already played this game for more than 220 hours and I’m sure there are many more to come."

So, this is my first attempt at a review, and I'll open by flat out saying to NOT buy this game. Buy Civ 5, it will give you more fun for less frustration. I say this not only because of certain mechanics, but because of the inevitable paywall that you hit in Civ 6.  Civ 6 is a game that has locked most of its content behind dlc, going so far to even lock things such as map layouts, and somehow has *less* base content than Civ 5 does. That alone should steer you away from a this title, since the animation are and graphics are about the only thing Civ 6 has going for it. Long story short, the price to get this game to a playable state is *ludicrous.*On to the AI. It's bad. Civ 5's AI was literally better in most aspects. The AI is not playing against itself, *ever.* It is only playing against you, no matter the teams. The barbarians are merely the auxiliary forces to supplement them, being ignored for a hundred turns and marching to your lands from three or four countries away just to fight you. The City States will sit on tribal villages with a warrior for fifteen turns to prevent you from getting it. It is *insane* how bad the AI design for this game is. No matter your actions on the world stage, or even if you have a declared friendship with *everyone,* they WILL vote to ♥♥♥♥ you over 90% of the time, en mass. The AI for this game is just *awful* in every way possible, IMO.Then there's the matter of some of the... Features, or lack there of in this game. Ho boy. There are NO console commands what so ever. You can't make ANY in game changes to your match. While this might make sense in the multiplayer arena, it doesn't in the single player aspect. This is *extremely* frustrating, especially if you're just trying to try something out, or do something specific. Alt+F4 is disabled in this game, and if it freezes while on fullscreen, you will have *no* way to turn it off unless you dual monitors. Hard reset, because they *want* you to push the quit button. Just so you can have a loss on your tally card that means nothing. Want to undo an action or a misclick? You have to load a save, and listen to the monologue that you CANNOT turn off while the game reloads the entire match, instead of just hitting undo. It feels like the devs on this game went really far out of their way at every turn to *force* you to play the game *exactly* how they want you to, and it is a major turnoff for me, in the very least.Overall, all I can really say is, do NOT buy this game. If you're set on getting a Civ game, get 5, NOT 6."

Every single Civ game since Civ II, has been able to provide me with that ""Just one more turn..."" feeling at launch despite any shortcomings or bugs that needed to be ironed out with patches or expansions. I'll even include Beyond Earth in that statement. Sure it had it's flaws, but it had me coming back for more turns (just not as many as IV or V did).I'm sad to say, Civ VI does not provide me with that same feeling at launch. There are numerous issues that I have with the game. Some of these issues I recognize as being based on my personal tastes rather than any fault on the developers part, but the majority of the major issues I have seem to be common complaints I've seen here and elsewhere, and sadly ignored or swept aside by professional reviewers. -The UI is woefully inefficient compared to the UI's in IV and V. While I appreciate the drive to try something new (and I admit, I fell very hard for V's UI and design, I love art deco designs), the UI feels less like a fully fleshed out idea, and more like something that is still in the beta stage, being tweaked and primed before launch. -Tooltips really need a lot of work.-The map and fog of war design can be a bit of an eyesore and confusing to boot. While I'm fine with the ""map"" design for undiscovered territory, the fog of war either needs a color change or complete revamp as it can be confusing and a bit of an eye sore in determining what features and resources lay within the fog of war, as well as where the fog of war ends and where the undiscovered portion of the map begins.-The diplomacy options, while improved (huge fan of the casus belli feature), still need some tweaking. AI players can ask you to remove your troops from their border, but you're unable to make the same request. Why? -Speaking of AI, it still needs a lot of work. Here's a good example, an AI player will ask you to enter a joint war with them. You agree. The very next turn, the very same AI player will denounce you as a warmonger. Uhhhhh, what?-You are given no clear indication how diplomatic bonuses and penalties work, beyond a vague ""War monger +15"", etc. tooltip. -When AI leaders denounce you, their animation screen loads, you see their denunciation, then another screen loads where (until you meet a particular research requirement) your only option is to say goodbye. I know some people hated the way Civ V's diplomacy worked, but I miss it quite a bit compared to this convoluted yet barebones method of telling me that Cleopatra doesn't think I have a very large army every few turns. Honestly, this whole issue could be solved by not forcing me to watch an animation prior to making a choice every time another civ wants to denounce me or make me an offer. -The great people and policy cards feel really sparse. While I think the new system shows promise, it's really aggravating to see the list of cards popup and feel like art assets for each great person or policy wasn't included or ready for launch.-While I think the new mechanics like city districts and the new policy mechanics sounded cool pre-launch, I find myself often confused as to how exactly they and their bonuses work due to the lack of aforementioned tooltips. I get that as I play more, my understanding of them will grow, but it's really frustrating to have to figure it out this way whereas previous Firaxis titles were much much better at communicating how core game mechanics worked. I'm hoping that I can eventually change this review to a recommend in the coming months, but for right now, I realize that while I'm in the minority, I cannot heartedly recommend this game until it gets some serious TLC from Firaxis. There's a great base here for what I think can be a truly fantastic addition to the Civ series, it just needs a lot of work to get there. I hope Firaxis can eventually fix these issues and make this the game I know they're capable of making. Buy at your own risk, for now."

I just can't recomend this game in its current state.  The only improvements the developers really made from the last game (Civ V) are the districts and how wonders work/are placed, whereas every other annoying thing was left unchanged.  The diplomacy between other civs is awful (take my deal or I hate you, have the same government or I hate you, taking back a city of yours that a Civ conqured = MAJOR warmongering penalty, etc etc), barbarians still leave other civs alone to focus manily on human players, the computer Civs will still beat you to building a wonder even if you're down to one turn 30% of the time, the computer Civs will still bypass great available land to plunk a city down right next to you in a so-so spot, the game still auto-bounces you back and forth across the map when you have a large army, the culture/tourism vicotry condition is overly complicated with no real explanation on how it works found in the game, the way builders are implimented and the fact that you can't build your own roads (it's done automaticly through merchent trade routes) unitl you get pretty far down the tech tree is a horrendous mechanic, the technology tree is much shorter (even on king+ difficulties I can get a science victory by the early 1900s), the way trade routes work now makes money completely irrelevant (by 1/3 through any playthrough on any difficulty I'm making so much money I never need to worry about it), half of the Civs have RNG style perks (i.e. Bonus for jungle tiles, bonus for costal, bonus for pastures, etc.) and if you don't start by your Civs inparticular bonus you're screwed, most of the Civs bonuses are basically useless and don't help you reach one of the victory conditions, the Civs art style makes the game look like it was designed for 10 year-olds, and I'm sure a couple more things I can't think of atm.All in all, DO NOT buy this game at full price.  In fact, I wouldn't buy this for more than 75% off.  If you've read this and you're still interested I would wait until the two or three expansions (that you know are coming) and the dozen or so dlc packs are released and buy them all together in a large package for a sizable discount.*edited for spelling*"

The result is they get a massive kick-start to growth which you inevitably catch up on mid-late game because the AI doesnt plan its city tiles layout efficiently, have any strategy in war (except 1 by 1 throw units at you rather than en mass)I never felt actually challenged by it because even when they were ahead, the worst they could do is pillage improvements (which take excessively long to repair) and not a chance of taking one of my cities.  Once you take the lead..... you are free and clear and they will never catch up. All wonders are yours after this point and its just a case of playing it out to the easy win."

I found out that despite my low hopes Civ VI is actually... not completely horrible? In fact, it's almost... okay? Don't get me wrong, I can definitely understand the mixed reaction and the game has more than its share of flaws, but it IS possible to get some enjoyment out of it.FIrst, let's start with the things Civ VI did well:-Religion finally has a point now! With the sorely needed Religious Victory (which really should have been in Civ V from the beginning) you actually have a real motive for focusing on Faith other than bonuses that don't mean that much after a while. Now when other apostles swipe one of my converted cities from under my nose I feel challenged rather than simply annoyed. -The new policy system is great! Not only is there an equivalent of a tech tree, but the way you are so often given the chance to switch policies allows you more freedom to decide your course as your plans evolve.-The fact that certain actions give you ""exp"" towards relevant technologies and policies is honestly really satisfying, and again helps you shape the kind of gamestyle you want.-I found the battles to be a little bit more fun in this, especially the way generals are used. Now instead of manually moving them step by agonising step you can shackle them to another unit AND improve their moving range. Plus Encampements make for nice extra defensive forts, and the new upgrade system feels more useful than before.But before this review gets too positive, let's go through the bad stuff:-Even if you haven't played this yet you might have heard of the notorious Districts system, where instead of building things willy-nilly whenever you want, you have to first build specialised centres on city tiles that work as hubs for each group (Science, Culture etc). And even then you're discouraged from being greedy and building all the districts in one city, since the more disctricts you have the more population you need for the next one, and the bigger your city is the more turns you have to wait for that to increase, to the point where it's just not worth it.On the one hand, this encourages you to make distinct cities that aren't carbon copies of each other, and to decide early on where you want to focus on and sticking to that plan. On the other hand this makes it very frustrating and difficult to change course when reacting to unexpected developments or when you simply change your mind. Having a Grand Plan is nice and all, but not when it comes at the expense of improvising on the fly in my opinion. And honestly I think this brute focus on one or two specialisations leads to less interesting strategies, where you're just spamming the same few things over and over again. Plus it weirdly contradicts the previous mechanics I mentioned that allow you to change your strategy as you go.-I know at this point saying ""the AI is bad"" is beating a dead horse but, yeah, it's pretty bad. To be fair they did try to add some complexity to it, with a friendliness meter that shows specifically the actions that add and subtract from the score, and I liked the way your delegates would feed you information on what everyone else was up to. But now, leaders don't just randomy denounce you for having a small military/puny empire (hi there, Wu Zetian) but also for... having a different government than them. And it's not just your neighbour declaring war because you're getting too close to their borders, but also that random person on a different continent that apparently hates you because your low productivity just makes them so mad, damnit!This whole thing feels like you're sitting in one corner minding your own business, and everyone else is continually butting in to say how every single decision you've ever made offends them to their very core and that clearly the only sensible course of action is a senseless war that wastes everyones time. At one point in one of my games I was at war with three different leaders who were all so far away I didn't see a single military unit from them! And even after making peace our relationship was so low I couldn't even send an embassy or trade for open borders, and all that through no fault of my own! So even after the mid-point of the game where they can't declare war because of the warmonger penalty, their earlier bonkers attitude still affects the play.Finally I'm going to mention some changes that while not objectively bad, I personally found annoying or pointless:-Workers disappear after 3 uses. I understand this is to discourage you from making too many tile improvements since you need to keep them free for the districts, but it's still a weird gameplay decision that feels like a waste of turns. Sometimes I had to interrupt my production just to make workers to repair one tile that was pillaged, or to go to a single luxury source that recently ended up in my city limits. Why couldn't they instead just limit the number of worker units you can have to one or two, so you can have them available at all times and just use them sparingly when the need arose?-As a collorary to the simplified workers, you can't build roads anymore. Trader units automatically making roads is admittedly very useful when connecting foreign and far away cities, but it's super annoying when it comes to connecting my own damn cities. I shouldn't have to waste multipe trader units to make the cities in my empire combine their resources! Plus sometimes roads were meant to help military units move faster and you don't even have the freedom to do that where you want anymore. -I found the UI to be pretty bad, especially the city management one. In Civ V you could easily understand what you needed to know in a few glances, but this game just tosses a bunch of hard to read columns at you and calls it a day. It's both unintuitive and harder to process.-Speaking of the presentation, I think the new visuals are a misstep. I actually do like the cartoony style and the game does look pretty and colourful, but the problem is, it's TOO colourful. Being bombarded by bright colours and icons everywhere got really tiring after a while, and this is a game you're supposed to invest in multiple hours at a time.-Okay this is going to be the pettiest complaint ever so don't take it too seriously, but the new narrator is lame as hell! Who thought this boring sounding voice was a good idea? The guy in Civ V was so amazing, he had such a gravitas that it just pulled your attention no matter what he was saying, and the way he introduced leaders was incredibly epic! I remember I would always let him finish his lines even though I'd heard them a million times before cause they were just that fun to hear. With Civ VI guy I interrupt him before I even finish reading the line, that's how much he annoyed me.Well, for a review with a thumbs up this turned out pretty negative. So why am I recommending this game? Basically because it still gives you the overall experience of a civ game, and civ games always manage to be fun and addictive no matter the incarnation. And if you're a newcomer to the series, this is as good a starting point as any.It's just that if you already have Civ V or the previous games, you don't really NEED to play this. For all its ambitions, Civ VI hasn't improved on the formula in any concrete way, and in some ways it has even regressed. Combine this with the high asking price, and people's disillusionment makes perfect sense. So in the end I'd say this game is worth experiencing, but only on sale. And while you wait, playing Civ V will keep you perfectly entertained."

IT MAY NO LONGER BE AS ACCURATE AS IT FIRST WAS. TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.Short: At this time, I'd only recommend buying Civ VI if you intend to play primarily with others. The biggest problems revolve around the AI, and multiplayer gameplay is MUCH better than singleplayer. Even then, though, I'd suggest you put some thought into it.If you intend to play primarily singleplayer, just stick to Civ V. It's fun, and suffers none of the issues that Civ VI has to deal with.Long:I'm honestly shocked that I'm writing this.I loved Civ V. I have ~163 hours logged on it. But this...I expected better.Graphics:The graphics are probably the area where Civ VI actually does well. It's clear that a lot of effort was put into making a game that looked very pretty (because it IS very pretty).If only they put as much effort into making the gameplay as high-quality.Soundtrack:I've seen some articles raving about Civ VI's soundtrack. There is NOTHING special about it. It's barely present, and not memorable at all. (The title screen music is the exception to this. THAT is amazing.)As for sound effects, they're nothing special, but they're of acceptable quality.Gameplay:Good:+It has the same deep, complex, addicting strategy gameplay that the Civ franchise is known for.+The new District system adds more planning to city building, and encourages you to build more cities so you can access a wider variety of resources. Planning = Strategery = Better.+The Happiness system from Civ V has been replaced by Amenities. The way it's set up removes almost all of the penalties for building a ton of cities. This means that ""building wide"" is now a MUCH more viable strategy than it was in Civ V.+Citystates are now MUCH fancier. Becoming their best friend now grants you a VERY special bonus unique to that specific citystate (as long as you stay their best friend, at least)+Religion plays a much bigger role. It's not DLC anymore, and they've added a victory method relating to it. Nice to see it getting some much-needed attention.+Culture has gotten an overhaul, it's now needed to unlock government policies (as well as some buildings). The tiny upgrade trees from Civ V have been replaced by a giant research tree comparable to the science one.+Some changes to how unit maintainence and economics work means that maintaining a larger standing army is now feasable without late-game special abilities.Bad:-THE AI, AKA THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. Oh my goodness, where to begin?I expect some occasional stupidity or unreasonableness from AI in any game. Civ gets more leeway in this regard due to the fact that it's SO. FREAKING. COMPLICATED! (in a good way. I like complex.)However, instead of the mostly-semi-reasonable AI one would expect, we get AI civs with LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE expectations that, if you don't meet, they just go out and declare war on you. Non-stop. No diplomacy of any sort is possible (because they're so unreasonable) and it's HIGHLY doubtful it would help anyways. It's unreasonable, it's not fair (as while the AI civs pretty much always end up hating each other, they barely ever declare war on each other), and most importantly, IT'S NOT FUN. For someone like me who prefers to go for victories besides domination, this is pretty much game-ruining.In addition to this, they also seem to have the ability to create LIMITLESS military and religious units with little to no cost or negative side-effects. Again, unreasonable, unfair, and unfun.The AI is the BIGGEST ISSUE Civ VI has. I am not the only one to hold this opinion, either. If it wasn't an issue, this would be a MUCH more positive review.-Housing. It's an arbitrary limit on how many people you can have, and it exists for LITERALLY. NO. REASON. (realism? who needs that? I want fun gameplay, not realism.) By limiting population, the game forces you to ""build wide"", as it's COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to ""build tall"" (comparable to how in Civ V, the happiness system made ""building wide"" a horrible idea). Housing adds nothing to the gameplay, and does nothing but make certain strategies impossible.-Religion has a few very noticable flaws. My 3 main complaints are:1: The 2 methods of spreading your religion are missionary units, and pressure emanated from cities. This is all well and good, EXCEPT THERE IS NO WAY TO SEE ANY REPRESENTATION OF PRESSURE AT ALL. You're left guessing as to whether you're having an effect or not. Now that religion is so much more important, something like this is MUCH more of a problem.2: It's possible to have your religion wiped out. If all of your cities are converted to a different religion after you've founded your own religion, CONGRATULATIONS! Your religion is dead. This would be a fairly minor thing if it weren't for the fact that the AIs get limitless religious units (as mentioned above), thus giving them a VERY unfair advantage religion-wise. It'd probably be tolerable, if it weren't for...3: Several times, I have had several of my cities stop believing in my religion for no discernable reason whatsoever. No enemy missionaries, no religious pressure of other religions. ABSOLUTE. BULL****.While I like the increased attention Religion has gotten, it has so many flaws that it's not a viable strategy for a player to use.-There's no tutorial for returning Civ players. I don't want a full ""how to play"" session, I just want to know whats different from Civ V.It took me an hour of reading the Civilopedia (the ingame instruction manual) to figure out what I know now, and I STILL don't get all the new stuff.-You can't rename cities. I play a lot of multiplayer, and renaming cities in Civ V was a very big source of laughs amongst my friends and I. It IS a fairly minor complaint, but I HAVE done a little bit of looking into it, and everything I've found suggests that it would be VERY easy to add. Seriously Firaxis, WTH.-They got rid of diplomatic victory. :(Overall:Civ VI is HORRIBLY flawed. The devs need to wake up and fix some of these glaring issues.If you want it for singleplayer, wait for the issues to be fixed. If you NEED singleplayer Civ, go get/play Civ V. It's very similar, it's balanced, and it's fun.If you want it for multiplayer (especially with friends), I would say get it. It's Civ, it's fun, and the biggest issues are much less present in multiplayer."

While the game isn't perfect, I feel the amount of negativity surrounding other reviews isn't a fair assessment of the game.  There are some loyal, passionate and long-time customers of the franchise.  Civ V being regarded as such a fantastic and well balanced game, shouldn't cause negative reviews for the newest installment in the series.I think the developers made some fantastic changes to the game, while sticking to it's roots.  Districts are an interesting addition to the game and I like the way Builders are used in this installment.  The Technology Tree and it's Eureka moments add another layer of strategy not found in it's predecessor.  Some of the Government Policy cards could use some balancing, as I often tend to use the same over and over.  However, as I've played with other civs and altered my playstyle, I find myself using cards that I hadn't in the past.  Sure, the AI behaves a bit odd and is something that can be easily beaten as you settle-in to the new mechanics.  They also have some strange behaviors.  These are not game-breaking issues and something that I'm confident that will continue to be balanced in future patches.  I honestly think these minor annoyances are the reason for the negative reviews.  Just because something isn't perfect, doesn't make it bad.  Patches have already been introduced to adjust AI behavior while in the meantime, Steam Workshop mods have been opened up (one of which is an AI improvement mod).  At the end of the day, the game still gives me that ""one more turn"" feeling.  I'll make a mental note that I want to wrap things up, and 2 hours later I'm still playing.  If that isn't the qualifier for a solid game, I don't know what is."

I tried it again now, years later, to see if my opinion has changed (or perhaps updates had improved it) but no dice.This game has made the misguided DLC features that were added to Civ 5 as core game elements. I know what the developers were trying to do and why but they went about it the wrong way. A Civ game should be about the player making large strategic decisions, and while one could decide to micromanage a little, mostly by allocation of civilians at cities, it was generally easy to ignore most of that and focus your attention on your borders and military forces, making appropriate diplomatic and militaristic decisions to keep your people happy.Civ 6 takes thing the opposite direction. It forces the player to spend an inordinate amount of time micromanaging their empire for very little benefit. The developers didn't need to hyper-focus on trade, religion, and tourism; these elements were already represented in much simpler and abstract way. Now I am arranging artwork in museums, constantly telling traders which cities to go to, and dealing with a constant influx of missionaries that flood over the borders of my empire.Civ needed new, bold ideas to describe different aspects of a culture and then gamify them, not a bunch of new specialty units and micro-games for a player to juggle and eat up their time.I do like some of the new aspects of city building. It was a clever way to add more customization. However, the overall general happiness system is removed and replaced with a more complicated amenities and housing system that doesn't really add anything to the game - just another tedious things to manage. I already have to worry about feeding cities to grow their population - now I have to worry about making them homes to? Will a future update or game add a plumber unit I need to order about to unclog drains?On the plus side, they got Sean Bean to narrate. Great choice."

I also remember how I wished they made some changes because it was like we were just playing a different skin of the same game.Then CIV 6 came out. I was so excited. I heard the game play was totally different. This is the only CIV game I have never finished one game. True, i've only played 17 hours or so right now, but for me, 17 hours was 17 hours on ONE game for the other CIV games.This game is in dire need of fixing. Case in point, Diplomacy.A nation will be your best friend on one turn and then declare war on you the next turn. At first I thought this was clever espionage, but nope. I wined and dined nations, gave them diamonds, i mean showered them with things that would make the other CIV games your best friend forever, Not in this game. Diplomacy is an utterable sh*tstorm. I cannot count how many times my declared friends sneaked attacked me...and i even tried it on all difficulties and even all different levels of army strengths and government alignments. Nothing helped. Diplomacy is truly broken. I didn't buy this game in late 2016 just because of this issue when i saw all the thumbs down. However, i figured they would have patched this by now.Housing.Dear god is this irritating. They scream for housing, your city stalls and yet no matter the districts, policy improvements, it's never enough. You think you've got a handle on things and 20 turns later your city is screaming at you for more housing. You can't add more districts because there is a population threshold and you can't reach that population threshold because you cannot add more districts.I do love the challenges on the other things like you simply cannot fill your city with wonders anymore...that's realistic.

But honestly this game cannot muster the foreboding you can feel in Civ V. The AI in Civ V just feels alive and as though it is genuinely plotting to beat you. I just don't get that feeling in Civ VI. Also, Civ V has WAY better quotes for the artworks and achievements and the narrator is much better in Civ V than in this game (and I love Sean Bean so I don't say that easily). Fun game though.

Even at my current playtime, which is 30+ hours, I'm 100% sure that I have not explored even 1/4 of the game. Civ6 is also educational for someone like me, who doesn't know much about history. You get to learn about past civilizations and a hero that lead them to the peak of their time.  You also get a description of every wonder that you build and every time you proceed on the science and culture progress, you get a quote regarding the matter that you researched which I think is also a very nice touch.I must also add that it is awesome having the ability to interact with the other leaders playing on the same session, declaring friendships, asking for alliances, doing trades, making them mad or happy with your actions etc. I can't compare Civ6 to any of the previous games because as I stated before I haven't played them. As someone who got introduced to Civ on this date and this version, I can't say I'm dissapointed that I gave this a try."

This was by far superb to its predecessor in its aesthetics. But that's where it stops in my opinion. The AI is abysmal at this point, knowing next to nothing about fighting a good war. They simply just suck at violence. Which leaves diplomacy, also pretty horrendously implemented. Alliances become fixed throughout the game and don't change dynamically at best, otherwise its just a deranged bloodbath with no end-goals. As for someone who got the deluxe edition, I'm still holding my breath but I feel like I got ripped off with this Viking DLC nonsense. The new wonders are a copy-paste job the way I see it, and I think most people don't care about the scenarios. I'm still waiting for the remaining two DLCs that I have been promised, but they better have some good and bulky content."

And yes, there are gamebreaking bugs right now.1. You want a military victory? Fine, take it. There will be no real defence from the AI. Why not? Well, even worse than in Civ5, they just stumble around with their units, have no plan what to do. If you have one Archer and one Warrior out in the field (not even near a city), you can beat up to 5 or 6 enemy troops easy. Why? Well, their archers often donÄt even attack you, but just stand there, while their warriors attack your one warrior like suicide-squads... it is funny to see, but in the end you win every war because the AI just doesn't use what they have.2. You want to talk with the AI? Forget it.2.1. Yes, they all have agendas... but that is more slapstick. Queen Victoria loves rich people because she loves money (okay...?), so in turn 288 she tells me that she loves my good income. Well, then she suffers a stroke, and while I still have the same income, in turn 289 she tells me that I am a poor bastard. Interesting!2.2. Roosevelt loves his Taoism. I am Catholic, he is my Ally. I see his 2 Apostles and 1 Missionary, and ask him to NOT use them o my cities. He says ""Yes"" and uses them in the same turn against my cities. I get informed that he broke his promise... and that is it. I ask him again, he says ""Yes"" again, breaks it next round again. There is no consequence. The AI will always say ""Yes"" to everything - No spies? Yes, of couse, but let me send you this spy. No religion? Yeah, just ignore my 4 other missionaries going to you right now.In the end, there is no dimplomcy, there are no promises, it is just a ""feature"" without any meaning or consequence whatsoever.2.3. So yeah, the AI is not able to win any battle, and not able to remember what they promised you 30 seconds ago, but when it comes to trading, WOW, they are hardcore. One for one? Hell no! The AI will only accept trades that are very one-sided, and maybe because of that they will not really trade with each other. When you meet a new Civ after round 300, they will suddenly make you big offers to trade goods... they could do that with all the other Civs, too, but since they all want 1 for 2, nobody trades in the end. Bravo!3. The ""Politics"" in the game are pretty meaningless. They simply are. The boosts may be great for pro-players in tournaments, but for a casual player they are just a big part of the game with little to no consequence for the gameplay. 4. The Civilizations are not balanced at all. If you start 5 games, you will always see the same Civilisations weak (England, hello! Germany, hello!), always the same civilizations strong (hi Mister Roosevelt, hi Tomyris!). This point is not yet a problem for me, because I don't played enough to see if it is really always the case or just a coincident. But I suspect major balancing-issues.So in the end, the game needs work. Most of the work is needed for the AI. Diplomacy is dead right now, promises are meaningless, when fighting, the big  and mighty leaders are just toddlers without a clue. I hope this will get fixed soon, because after just a short ammount of in-game-time, it gets old and the bigs are too much too bear.PS: Sorry for mistakes, english is not my naitive language."

I finally picked it up three years in and two expansions after release, and it's just... not a very good game. I had excitement and joy when I finally picked the game up and started playing, but things start to fall apart faster and faster as a game develops.There are buggy elements - the game has issues with unit pathing and ranged combat orders, for example, and while this is rather concerning for a game that has been out for three years, the problems with Civ 6 are much more fundamental than this.Balance is entirely off. Most critically, a civ that starts to snowball will get totally out of control - and can be on future tech while AI are still fielding knights and archers. Science and culture both also seem to outstrip production, even when production is being focused. Even playing on marathon, I often found units to be out of date only a couple of turns after being built. I believe this is at least partially due to the Eureka/Inspiration system for techs and civics. In theory it is a way to get nations who work on a particular thing to be better at that thing, but it instead becomes a puzzle (and not a difficult one) for the player to choose civics, techs, and production in the right order to achieve 90% of the boosts and nearly double their tech and civic rates. The AI is likely incapable of this reasoning, which contributes to it falling spectacularly far behind as the game progresses.Speaking of AI, it certainly feels like the worst in a long time. Despite having bonuses to all resources even on default difficulty it is totally incapable of keeping up, and waste resources to desperately cram in new cities so much that they will settle entirely resourceless snow lands with multiple cities 3 tiles apart. City-states fare even worse, being unable to stand on their own beyond the very earliest age of the game. The balance shift away from playing tall has hit them especially hard, and they are unable to even own the space around their home tiles by the modern era. This on its own would not be so terrible, but politically you are unable to protect them, while even your own allies may declare war on city-states that you are suzerain of. While they can sometimes be re-conquered, if one of your allied city-states liberates the city, they immediately raze it out of existence. Similar issues happen with the ""free cities"" which revolt from their factions. If you refuse to allow them into your civ, their city center will bug out and steal/culture bomb tiles around it when the game switches its affiliations. Even if you accept the city, it will still steal the nearest tiles from your other cities (they become unswitchable). Expect this to happen, as the AI loves to suicide cities directly on your border, which immediately start flipping to your culture.Your AI allies will do plenty of other annoying and nonsensical things aside, such as refusing any attempt to re-affirm a declaration of friendship, although they will always renew it themselves the next turn - along with any alliance. They will also complain about your military being near their borders - when you are fighting on the same side in a war, or shamelessly try to sabotage you with spies despite being perfectly aligned allies. The failure of Civ 6 is difficult to understand, but it seems to come more from general bug and balance testing and QC issues than any real misunderstanding of the game's main draws. When coupled with the new mechanics being a bit underwhelming (districts are probably the best, and I'm still not sure I'd recommend keeping them in a sequel), overall it winds up being a thoroughly disappointing experience."

But there are just  that make this very user unfriendly and can lead it to being just a complete tihs-show.First off: the tutorial is so bad it's just a complete waste of time. This game is very complex, and the tutorial amounts to teaching someone how to stand up and then expecting them to run a triathalon. I'm all for turning to the community (YouTube videos, guides, friends, etc.) to  at a game... but you shouldn't need to  there just to learn  (Side Note: bad and incomplete tutorials are a pet peeve of mine across all games as it just shows the lack of awareness and/or care that the studio or dev team have; that they're unknowingly using, or just willing to use, their existing community as a crutch to accommodate their laziness (like Bethesda relying on the modding community to FIX the bugs in their games)) The UI is miniscule and a jumbled mess. It throws almost everything at you all at once, in size 8 font. These letters that you're reading now in a Steam review are bigger than the key information displayed in the UI like Science production or the turn count. You're left to squint at the edges of the screen to figure out where or IF what you need to know is displayed. If I hadn't got my eyes checked just before the new year I'd think I might need new glasses.The lack of clarity is absurd. Even aside from the really complex systems of diplomacy and religion being so convoluted; just the  needs of your own kingdom beyond food is left almost completely up to guesswork. What are amenities and how to you get/use them? What's loyalty and how to you measure it? What's happiness and how to you gauge it? Why aren't I allowed to build districts anymore? The information is there, but it doesn't really help once you find it and it's such a tedious pain in the ass to get to it in the first place. The bloody fullscreen messages and notifications. Shut the F up Teddy/Genghis/Montezuma, I don't know if I can accept or deny your trade request or plea for peace or terms of surrender right now because need to have a look at my economy or military or just  and what I'm going to need or be able to do in the next turn or two. There's no way to minimize or ""tab out"" of those stupid messages to check to see if it's a good or bad decision for you, you have to decide a potentially game-defining moment... Some Civ ""Unique units"" that  units from the standard military tree  This makes units that should be a maintsay of a civ into a wasted investment. For example; the Gaul unique unit that  the Warrior (the very first basic military unit of the game that you start with) cannot be upgraded along the Warrior tech-line into a Swordsman (the second melee unit). That means that, while it can dominate the early game, it dead-ends by the next era and you're left with a worthless army and have to start from scratch in a stage of the game where you can't usually afford to. This makes no sense and when you encounter this dead-end that you don't have any choice but to run into for some Civs, it really sours the feel and flow game.There are honestly better 4X's out there these days, some of which are just the older Civilization games. In a competitive game there are just so many little things that add unnecessary frustration that mounts stress instead of fun in a situation that should be intense but still enjoyable."

While I obviously liked some aspects of each game more than others, the bottom line was always the same - I really loved all the main installments of the series ever since, and the spinoffs (Colonizations & Beyond Earth) a bit less, although my opinions of them were generally on the positive side as well. Not surprisingly, after playing over 60 hours, I feel pretty much the same way about Civilization 6. Sure, it has some problems. The AI, for one... ...well, I agree, it sucks. Also, beyond the tedious amount of time the game takes to load, even on decent machines (i7 Quad-Core, 16GB RAM and Geforce GTX465 here), it also tends to lag and stutter from time to time (after changing governments, for example). In some cases, the game wouldn't close on its own, forcing me to restart my system  just to get rid of it. The thing is, despite all those problems, I'm still having way too much fun with this game to dismiss it and put it aside. Even with the crappy AI, the lags and the stutters, the game is fun to play. Just like the previous games in the series, Civilization 6 offers the same gameplay mechanics we're used to, with a new, interesting twist, to make the mix familiar and intuitive on one hand, but refreshing and interesting on the other.One of my favorite additions is the 'Eureka' / 'Inspiration' boosts to scientific and cultural advancements. All sorts of things can stir you in the right direction for finding something out. Founding a city on the coast, for example, gives you a boost for researching 'Sailing'. Killing enough barbarians and clearing one of their outposts gives you boosts for a couple of military related advancements, and so on. This adds another layer to the way you might want to play, as the more such boosts you get, the faster you advance in general, but since you obviously can't get all of them, you might choose to focus on a specific direction, or to change the order of the topics you research accordingly. Another interesting new concept is the districts within the cities. If in previous civilization games you just spammed buildings all over, now you have to plan ahead. Each district allows building certain types of buildings. A ""Holy Site"", for example, lets you build religious buildings, an ""Encampment"" lets you build military buildings and so on. While each city can have more than one district, the space is limited, so you have to choose - not only between districts, but also between districts and tile improvements, as each tile can support either an improvement or a district (or a world wonder, btw). Just like the science/culture boosts, this makes you think and plan carefully.My bottom line is this - if you liked the previous Civilization games, I bet you'd like this one as well."

TLDR: The warmonger penalties alone for defending yourself against attacks are enough to make you quit.  BADS:  The AI is terrible.  But the ""warmonger"" penalties are absolutely, positively the worst thing I have ever seen in a Civ game to break it.  I get attacked by 2 AIs, I fight tooth and nail and finally get the advantage- my citites are all but burning down from war weariness and I push on and take both civs out that surprise war'd me together... and... guess what, the ridiculously broken warmonger penalties last the rest of the game and no AI will ever talk or trade with me again (for DEFENDING myself!).  SO I go on to lose because they sign dozens of research agreements, and trade amongst themselves but I am a terribel war monger.  Ridiculous.  Absolutely terrible and game-breaking.  MORE BADS:  The game is not ""paced"" right.  Even on Epic you move forward too quickly.  I'm not talking about drawing it out forever, but you advance faster than you can meaningfully build units.  By the time you build a unit you just researched- the upgrade is out (literally).  It's just paced wrong.  GOODS:  Not much.  There are some cool and innovative features like districts and how the culture tree is similar to the tech tree... but these small shining lights are put out by the HUGE flaws mentioned above.  So utterly sad.  I paid $29 for the game on special and that was $28 too much for this trash. Svae your money and hope they take these overall terrible ratings to the dev team for Civ 7."

But I can't recommend it more or less unequivocally, like most of the other games I've recommended here.Judged on its own, by its own merits alone, Civilization VI is a perfectly fine game. It has some issues- the AI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you over with unjustified surprise wars, the AI not suffering from warmonger penalties, a sometimes-clunky trade route interface- and there's some areas where personal taste may vary- such as the art style- but these aren't really dealbreakers, in my opinion, and it's certainly better than any of the competitors or knockoffs on the Steam Store. And there are areas where the game really shines- the soundtrack is absolutely great, as are the Governor and Free City mechanics added in the Rise & Fall expansion, the separate tech and culture trees are a plus, the interfaces are generally clear, the civilizations are unique enough to be engaging, and the little panoramic view you get when you construct a wonder is pretty sweet. If this was a new IP, or the first game in a series, I'd recommend it more or less unequivocally.But this isn't the first game in a series; it's the sixth, and in one of the gaming world's most prominent and successful franchises no less. Civ VI inevitably winds up in the shadow of Civ V... and it doesn't quite come out of it.  The AI in Civ V wasn't so wantonly and inexplicably dickish to the player, there was more content in areas like espionage and trade and religion, and while I don't have any problems with Civ VI's art style, per se, I do really like the art deco style that Civ V opted for. There are areas where Civ VI- in my opinion- does better than Civ V. The mechanics added in Rise & Fall, notably, but there's also smaller things; some of the new civilizations in Civ VI are just really cool, and thanks to the changes made to cities, I no longer have to worry about Stonehenge being constructed in the middle of the ocean. But overall, it feels like there's just so many things that Civ V does better than Civ VI.To summarize, on its own, this game is a perfectly fine game. It's enjoyable and, when going by its own merits, I recommend it. But it doesn't always feel like it lives up to the standard Civ V set."

Each and every one of them had their pros and cons. But the one thing that Civilization has always maintained is that 'one more turn' mentality. I've put hundreds of hours into each one. I've read that a lot of people trash this one due to its 'cartoonish' graphics and lack of 'realism' Civ V brought. Most people forgot that Civ V was a broken mess when it first came out too. It took two expansions for the game to finally feel complete and become the series standard.  Civ VI certainly has had some growing pains. The Rise and Fall expansion did a lot to fix some issues, and yeah the AI especially in the diplomacy area still needs some work. But is the game playable? Absolutely. I typically don't play online so I can't honestly judge how this game holds up in the multiplayer arena, but after putting nearly 200 hours into the single player campaign I can tell you I still enjoy that classic Civ gameplay. And the city planning system Civ VI brings to the table is a great addition. It allows for the specialization of cities, some being industrial, some being scientific, some being religious, and some being financial. It makes sense, and the adjacency bonuses make sense too (aka building an industrial zone next to a harbor for more production etc) The one area where I have to give super high marks for this game is the soundtrack. As a music fan I think what they did here with the music is clever. Every civ has a theme, and as you progress thru the eras that theme gets built upon until in the information era you are blessed with completely evolved theme song for your civ. My personal favorites are the themes for Greece, America, Scotland, Japan, and England. The soundtrack is phenomenal.  Is it as good as Civ V? I think they both have their merits. But VI is still a very entertaining game to play. And I wouldn't be surprised to see another expansion come out soon that will address other concerns, such as the AI diplomacy. Just one more turn..."

Civ 6 stands above 5 and quite frankly, most 4X games due to the flexibility of the game which increases replayability dramatically. Civ 6 does whatever it can to throw situations at you that differ campaign to campaign to spice up the flavor of a match.Gone are the policy trees of old from Civ 5. In are policy cards that can be swapped when you learn new policies in the civic tree that compliments the science tree in every 4X game. This adds an additional layer of strategy missing in 5. In Civ 5, what you picked is what you were stuck with. You started to go down the Piety tree only to discover 2 or 3 Civs were way better positioned for religion? Sorry, you just lost all of those points. The Civ 6 policy cards allow you to pivot and change up your game plan while staying ""realistic."" You can't swap them whenever you want, but it's often enough that you can shuffle into a new strategy if the old one is failing.Gathering Storm adds weather and natural disasters into the mix. You get a risk reward system in the early ages when settling. Do I settle next to a river that has flood plains (signalling it has flooded before) to get those sweet food yields? Do I settle on fertile soil near a volcano that could potentially erupt? These are all welcome situations that allow me to make meaningful choices in the game. Gathering Storm also controversially added climate change into the game. It's actually insane to me that people complain that it isn't ""realistic"" because it doesn't affect the game enough. Real life climate change is the subject of much heated debate, but the climate change in Civ 6 is far more disastrous than the real life one. Once you and other civs start building coal factories it doesn't take long for the ice caps to melt and the temperatures to rise along with the sea levels. Coastal tiles become lost to the sea and permanently destroy valuable districts with no chance to rebuild them. Essentially, climate change is in this game as if it was advised by Al Gore personally. I think a better system would've been just to have pollution. The more you use coal and neglect policies that enforce environmentally friendly policies the more polluted your freshwater gets and the lower your food yields are in tiles affected by pollution. I think this was a missed opportunity in an attempt to ""be woke.""Another change of pace is the overhauled diplomatic system. Gone is the old Civ 5 policy where city-states dictated your influence in the world congress. Civ 6 introduces ""diplomatic favor."" This is a new form of currency that you can obtain from city-states and other diplomatic means like following a promise to another civ. This diplomatic favor then can be used to vote on proposals (and eventually a proposal pops up end game that rewards diplomatic victory points) or you can simply trade your diplomatic favor for resources, gold, and other goodies from other civs. This system works better than the old Civ V one. Though, the proposals themselves are weaker in 6 than 5. In 5 I could actually choose the proposals if I had the votes and was hosting the world congress. I could really shape the world's proposals to benefit me and ♥♥♥♥ over my enemies. In this, it's pretty passive except for a few circumstances and you cannot control the proposals. What is a massive addition to 6 is the ""emergency system"" that is grouped in with the world congress. Is Genghis Khan conquering everything that breathes? An emergency could trigger which will allow all civs to vote whether they want to participate in this emergency to stop Genghis Khan. I love this system because it offers chances to team up with the AI to stop a juggernaut.Warring in this game is also a huge improvement over 5. Warring in 5 was particularly difficult in the earlier ages before you got your catapults going. In the early stages of 6 cities don't have walls yet which makes conquering them a much easier proposition. This is particularly useful in taking over city-states that might be serving as a buffer. Also, you can stack units again if you research the different corps and army technologies. This is a welcome addition as the end game in 5 could feature units everywhere like ants. Also, the attack animations look better than 5, but that isn't a big deal. Warring is also handled differently diplomatically. Grievances are generated for breaking promises or declaring instant surprise wars. This gives you a better handle on how the rest of the world views you. You can compare grievances with another civ to clearly see who the world would favor should you go to war. You can also unlock reasons to go to war as certain situations arise. A civ converted one of your cities? You can now declare a holy war for significantly less grievances because the war is seen as being ""more just."" It's a wonderful system that gives transparency when dealing with the other leaders. Civ 6 also introduced ""loyalty"" in Rise and Fall. This can be a fairly frustrating mechanic as newly captured cities might rebel and turn into a ""free city"" and really put a damper on your conquest. There are policies and governors that can assist in offsetting this. Best to capture that capital quickly as it can be a huge help in getting new cities under control. It also serves as ameans to prevent you from settling cities far from your civilization and near other civs to attempt to steal resources. That city could easily flip to the close by foreign civ.The last major change from 5 that I'll cover is the districts system. Gone are the days of building tall cities that only take up one tile with a bunch of resources. Now you can create specialty districts that offer adjacency bonuses if they are near certain districts or tiles. This allows you to specialize cities instead of building everything in the production list. Additionally, you can assign governors to cities that you can level up with Governor points. These governors provide massive bonuses that can be exploited if you specialize properly within that city. Again, this offers more strategic choices based on the lay of the land as opposed to just building the same production order as you would in 5 with every city with a few changes.Overall Civ 6 is some of the most fun I have ever had with a 4X. A lot of that is because this is the first 4X game I have played with friends which the game handles pretty well. It seamlessly allows you to switch between a ""cloud game"" and a live multiplayer game in the same campaign. I didn't want to move on from Civ V. I had over 150+ hours in that game and really enjoyed my time with it. But it's time to put 5 to rest and move on to 6. It is a superior game in almost every facet. Civ V will ""stand the test of time"" as a true 4X classic, but it is being put to bed by 6 at full strength in 2019."

I had not played Civilization V, nor had I followed the series. I knew that it was a strategy game- and so disliked it. However, a few months previously, I had bought Stellaris, and so grand strategy games were slowly flying into my radar, including Civilization V.Then, ManyATrueNerd started a Let's Play on Civilization VI. Suddenly, the game was the only thing on my mind. It was one of those scenarios where when I wasn't doing anything else, Civilization VI took up my spare head room. Gameplay scenarios and diplomacy screens and beginning screens in the game dominated my brain. When it finally came out, without thinking, I purchased the Deluxe Edition (kind of a let down, as the added civs since release weren't all that special- cool, but in relation to being DLC? Eh).Very quickly, Civilization VI became my most-played game on Steam (until I got into Paladins), and even more so dominated my mind. I will explain the reasons.Pros:-A very easily addictive game, Civilization is the origin of the term ""just one more turn"", and its addictivity is self-explanatory-The music is great (after about sixty hours I turned it off to listen to my own, though)-Most of my other points fall under the first point-The design choices that Firaxis made when deciding upon the new art style? MMM, daddyCons:-Most certainly religion. Even with the new rebuild of the system. Another civ began next to you, and happens to have a religion? Yeah, goodluck even struggling to keep your own cities worshipping your own religion. Any nearby religion will immediately bum-rush you, not even taking into account the fact that you are currently converting their cities. And it never ends; say you make a gigantic push into their territory, and convert five of their seven cities? Aw, too bad, they had seventy inquisitors just around the corner.-Diplomacy, obviously. Not only do enemy AIs completely ignore anything that you ask of them, including ""Pretty please, could you, like, STOP CONVERTING MY FU***ING CITIES"", but they also get angry as all hell if you ever do the same to them. You wanted to settle in a certain location, (this is especially applicable to the early game) and did so, but then the Kongo denounces you for settling to close? Oh, hey, one of their cities was shrouded in the fog of war. Whoops. You settled somewhere, then two turns later Germany settles right next to you? Oh, well, darn, guess Germany hates you now.Obviously, diplomacy is the largest issue with this game.Now, while it might seem as though I riffed on the cons for longer, its only because I feel very strongly about them, and so remember them that much more clearly. But really, isn't that the case for most things? We remember the bad with much more intense emotions than we do the positive, and that is heavily reflected in this review. But I know for a fact that I love this game dearly. Definitely check it out if you like 4X games, but admittedly probably hold off if you were really into Civilization V at the end of its development cycle."

This means knowing in advance from your previous knowledge of playing the game, what moves could yield in the desired effect.A basic early game strategy for Civilization VI (one of many) would be to rush Astrology and a Holy Site if you encounter a Natural Wonder in the first turns, so you can get ahead in the religious path with an associated Great Prophet permitting you to create an early religion.This is an example of a meta: you find a Natural Wonder in the early turns (a), you research Astrology (b), you build a Holy Site (c), you get your Great Prophet in time (d), you found your religion (e).There are plenty of those and the secret is to know in advance which one you will use to get to your goals. It's the motto of Civ VI and Sean Bean tells it to you during the trailer when launching the game ""you must adapt and press forward if you are to reach your journey's end"".Now here comes the problem: the AI will actively cockblock your strategy and ruin whatever meta you are trying to go for,  In other words the AI will constantly try to counter what you are doing in a way that is unproductive for itself and thus, will focus on destroying whatever sparks of creativity you are trying to put into the damn game.In higher difficulties, this behaviour . It simply gets percentage related boni on everything.It has some good points despite the AI mess however, the art direction is good accross the board and many animations are top-notch despite having a mobile game feel going on (it's only a feel though).Also, It is probably a nice experience when played in multiplayer, with an AI limited to controlling barbarians...Avoid this at all costs if you plan on mostly playing the singleplayer. Go for the previous iteration (Civilization V) or Endless Legend."

There's unbalanced civilizations, broken and abusable aspects which need mending and these Issues span from civilizations with obscene abilities to issues with Multiplayer. Having said that I'm not in the least put off. As an avid Civilization player since Civ 3 this is what I've come to expect from Firaxis. Civilization VI has a HUGE learning curve coming from V but I can tell you with 100% certainty that this game was worth every penny and I have zero regrets in either my monetary investment or the hundreds of hours I've put into learning this wonderful game. Even after putting a MASSIVE amount of time into the game I'm still finding things that are cool/new be it new strategies or new aspects of the game which are crazy strong that before I considered weak or was completely unaware this is not at all something I was expecting since in Civ V there were only 2 main Strategies and one specific wonder made all players quit if they didn't get itI'm quite willing to poke the proverbial bear in the rump by saying that a large portion of the negative reviews are posted from players who do not wish to abandon their beloved V(or equivalent)  and simply do not like the changes/time required to learn a completely new game from scratch (I still see people saying bull crap about ""Wide vs Tall, Unit Stacking etc etc"" It DOESN'T apply here it's NOT Civ V it's NOT Civ III THIS is Civ VI! SO STOP...PLEASE) When Civilization VI has been tweaked(just like Civilization V was after it was released... Yeah don't you remember how horrible that game was back then?)  as I'm sure it will be over time I plan to continue investing time into it as long as the naysayers who just want Civ V with upgraded graphics do not get their way. I hope to see/hear that others others are experiencing all the unique gameplay that Civilization VI has to offer.For all Civilization V or its predecessors' diehards who actually want to experience a new game after having invested 5k+ hours into the previous version pull up your panties because this is one hell of a bumpy transition. It's unique in many aspects and the game is not a polished product (yet) so if you expect to be able to pull off the whole ""I'll build cities/districts without units"" gig then you're going to be sorely disappointed when Barbarians and civilizations like Scythia come knocking at your door.Don't feel bad if you're against the way the game is set up. People have hopped off the band wagon between every civ transition to stick to their favorite out of the series (it took a lot to peel me from 4 to test 5) but don't hate on an undeveloped game just because it's unfimilar or different to what we grew to love in Civ V (Heck, any of the previous versions). Uncompleted games are something that we've determined that this producer continuously releases so that it can be refined based off of reviews.Overall it's a bang for your buck but keep in mind that it's still in development. Just don't let archaic viewpoints molded from a different game keep you from enjoying this one like I let mine hold me back from experiencing how grand Civ V was (and still is)!(Edit) I must say though I haven't found a game quite as addictive as Civilization VI, in which I can come back to and play over and over and over since Age of Empires II Age of Kings without growing weary of the game and even then, never have I put such a vast amount of time into any game in such a short time.(Edit2)Rise and Fall"

While there are some things in Civ V that I wish were in Civ VI, I'm overall having a lot more fun with Civ VI. Everything is more thought provoking, from Districts, to Espionage, to Religion. There are many valid points to people's criticism, but there are also many here that I think are absurd. Yes, the art style is better or worse depending on your style (I love it), but that doesn't warrant a down vote. The only true major flaw in this game comes with the Gathering Storm DLC, and that's the World Congress. I think it was done incredibly poorly and feels like a slot machine, the Civ V one wasn't perfect because of the City-State system with it but it's certainly better than the one we have now. Great game, but it's not worth the full price, especially the DLC. Get it when it's on sale."

Experiences might be anecdotical, but I encountered some very plausible reactions. Combat AI seems to be better too (don't expect wonders), although it still forgets to use the city bombardment.In the hope that the updates continue at this pace, I change my recommendation to positive.######Update: With the ""Fall 2016"" update, many UI-issues got resolved. The diplomacy AI is somewhat better (i.e. reasonable), though general and combat AI remain sub-par. Districts still can not be removed and there exists an unhandled bug that makes seemingly random production items take a lot longer than they should (negative production value at start, e.g. -120/80 instead of 0/80).I reckon I might be able to recommend the game after the next patch. I hope they will keep up the patching (""Winter 2016 Update"" next?).###+ New mechanics are interesting and do work in principle+ Game runs smoothly+ Multiplayer works+ (as you know) Sean Bean- Diplomacy is broken; always ends with everyone hating everyone^ possibly due to sign error or scaling of relation impact; this might be fixable- even with good relations, there are no fair deals with AI possible- Districts get more expensive, the more social researches one has^ Quite unintuitively, not communicated and makes no sense; districts get more expensive than wonders fast^ Yes, really. On standard speed, each Civic increases district cost by around 11 production (base cost 60)- Districts can not be removed^ very basic feature for any system of adjacency boni, one would think- minor, but unnecessary and enraging slip-ups in UI- AI is just as bad (or worse) in combat situations as in Civ 5^ not a challenge unless 3vs1 + tech advance- AI is bad in generalBottom line: Game needs 2-3 patches, so around 6-8 months work. Alas, this IS release weekend and the game is playable. Still not recommended at current state; has potential to be the best part of the series. Please Firaxis, make it happen!"

More people think that Civilization V is the better game compared to this game, in my observation. But I like this game better than its predecessor. I think this game is an improvement and that's why I like it better, although I also love Civ V. Here are some things why:* I like the visuals better, although I prefer realistic leader characters than a cartoonish ones like in this game. I also like the interface better. * Food is now less important compared to Civ V. Hence, cities in desert, tundra can be better now thanks to districts.* Growth is limited by Housing capacity. You can build districts, buildings, and improvements to increase Housing capacity in your cities.* District is a complex new thing in this iteration. There is much to learn for new player about districts. Districts are very important in this game.* City-States now have unique abilities that they offer to their suzerain. In Civ V the importance of city-states depend on their type, location and resources in their regions. Rather than using cash to gain favor with the city-states, now you have Envoys. This are limited depending on what diplomatic policy you have set in your government. You can also gain a free envoy by doing things like quests from city-state once for every era.* The civic system is now similar to the tech tree. Many of these civics unlock policies upon research completion. Player has policy slots for their goverment of choice, which they can fill the slots with unlocked policies. This offers flexibility you don't get in Civ V. Cost of these civics are not affected by the size of your empire like in previous game and I like big empires.* There are unique boosts for technologies and civics. You can do specific action in your empire to boost a certain tech or civic. This gives you a chance to compete better with your rivals that possess stronger science or culture generation.* Wonders now have unique placement requirement(s). A city with very high production capability or a leader ability that grants bonus to build wonders can't just spam wonders anymore. Some wonders are unlocked with civics.* Great People are now limited but have unique abilities. They're grouped into their historic eras in real history.* Culture is now used to gain Tourism. You win Cultural victory by accumulating Tourism points above everyone else.* Tiles now have Appeal value, which have effects like on generating Tourism, yield from Seaside Resort improvement.* More game modes added with expansions and updates. This offer more variety and challenge to your gaming experience.* Now you have Builders, instead of Workers. Builders now have charges. Constructing improvement now done instantly and consume a charge. They're gone once all charges have been spent. Compared to previous games, Workers can build how many improvements you want but that takes turns to finish.* Pillaging improvement now changes the status of the improvement to be ""pillaged"", rather than destroyed, which you have to rebuild if you need it. Also buildings in the cities may be pillaged, as opposed to get destroyed on city capture.* Roads are now automatically built by Trader unit assigned on a trade route. You can also order your Military Engineer to do that but that will cost a charge, which is expensive.* The soundtracks are awesome, as always with this franchise. For each leader now you got 4 new themes: ancient, medieval, industrial, and atomic. In Civ V you've got war and peace themes and themes for cultural groups like Asia, America, etc.On the opposing side, I prefer Civ V's movement system. Now you need full 2 points to enter a hill or forest. Previously if you have a remaining 0.5 you can enter such tiles or cross the river.I nominate this game for Labor of Love. Firaxis just released the new Leader Pass, just in time for Steam Awards nominations. Good timing, Firaxis! New content for a 6-year old game, for a game that already has so much replayability, adding even more replayability and more playstyle varieties, for a game that is already one of my all time favorite, is always greatly welcome. People are already talking about Civ VII. Some leaders from previous games return. Very nice!"

Playing a mechanically sound strategy game with inept opponents isn't very fun. When devs / modders fix the AI it'll be amazing. Until then, it's merely 'ok'.It has A LOT to like: city building, general improvments to how things make much more sense (Trade caravans build roads, techs get boosts for relevant activity, city planning), art style of the map (though leaders have really long faces), combat animations, tech / culture trees, unit progression compared to civ5, etc etc.;;However, while the game is a joy to play in a mechanical sense, it's lacking in two things that are kind of a big deal -- the diplomacy, and the AI.The long-hyped 'agendas' for the AI are honestly not doing anything. The AI is still insane -- declaring war on you with 7 warriors in ancient era and then wandering around getting picked off by archers for a bit before begging for peace. It's literally the same level of useless as Civ 5 on release, if not worse.The sad part is that giving the AI huge bonuses on higher difficulties doesn't really make the game more 'challenging', it just makes it more annoying. This might be my opinion but not being able to complete a single wonder and being PHYSICALLY unable to race with 500% (or w/e high bonuses AI gets) more science / culture / faith / gold on deity isn't my idea of fun. And the saddest part of it all is because the AI is so inept they'll still somehow lose to you in wars, with three times your numbers and straight up stronger units.Game balance is basically alright, with a few outliers. They've made warrior line have bonus vs spear line. That's good. Crossbowmen turn into Field Cannons that don't have 1 range like the freaking Gatling Gun -- that's very good! The new government system with cards is good; However, each individual card is so weak that basically all civs that have bonuses to government policy slots are really, really weak. To a point where Greece is downright useless as 1 policy slot + hoplites (that take extra damage from base warriors) just make it worse than rome in every way. Yeah, the 40 power legions are back with a vengeance, which makes me happy as a civ veteran, though I can imagine how it can be annoying for someone who starts near rome.But all that doesn't really matter past 100 turns because for some reason in 80% of cases the AI just refuses to upgrade units. I get it, bows and chariots are cool, but it's 1952 and I do think it's not that hard to invest in some muskets! OR EVEN SWORDS!The AI also doesn't seem to understand trade. Example: it offers me 52 gold for a resource, I click the gold away, then add the same exact amount they offered in the first place, and they refuse. Sometimes they ask for 2 resources and 200 gold for open borders; Sometimes they're winning war and peace out offering everything they have. I don't think it should do those things!All in all, not a bad civ game, with a lot to like, but just like Civ 5 it'll probably require a lot of patching and an expansion or two THAT WILL HOPEFULLY FIX THE AI to be fully enjoyable for me. It's not a bad game. It's playable. But jeez, how hard is it to just make GOOD ai again? You did it for civ3 and civ4, Firaxis. Civ5 and 6 are both easier games AND have worse AI. It just annoys me to no end =/Edit: Re-shuffled some thoughts, and added a few words on :It's basically the same as civ 5, maybe a LITTLE bit better. Played with 1 person on a standard size map, the first 100 turns were flawless, then the random desyncs begun. I suggest playing on small maps as I don't think there have been much improvments under the hood to remedy civ5's problems. At least it reconnected my friend every time through ~15 desyncs in ~50 turns. But that's really not an acceptable number for a triple A game that had the exact same problems in the previous installment.Upd: Desyncs fixed by saving and re-hosting the game, as it turns out. So if anyone has that problem this fixed it for me!"

My first experience with the series was Civilization 1. Not on a PC like most would, I used to play it with a grayish looking Super Nintendo. I had to build my civilization from chieftain to space-faring with a joystick (whilst Gandhi's atomic rage) because I couldn’t find a super-mouse to play it with. As the decades went by, my favorite of the series was Civilization 3 (oh the fantasy mods) and Civilization V, the pinnacle of the series' evolution. But before this gurl starts ranting about how the old times were beautiful, Civilization 6 is not the worst of the series just not the best as I hoped for. Weird decisions used to happen in my time as well. Civilization 2 was the worst one for me, but like here it was still decent. The problem is that now I see multiple games from other series in decline. Like EA’s Sims in general for example. It is no longer a bet of ""good or bad"" nowadays, its mostly capitalization over good potential.They did a redesign on the visuals and I didn't like it at first, all cartoonish. There is some graphic fidelity of course but everything artistic is falling into more of a Disney-esque stuff that I'm not sure I fully approve of. Their A.I. is much more intelligent for deals though, friendship or animosities that I approve.  Maybe they did this because we got new generations of gamers and let's say, that turn-based strategy isn't exactly booming for them, so it needs to look new and fresh, a different culture so there must be a different approach. As long as it doesn't become some action battle royale game, I think I'm good.Music and animation is also trying a lot of it, but it is trying so hard I can spot the effort. The main theme sounds magical at first as it is common with the series, but it is trying so hard that ends up silly. I'm not saying it is bad but it is definitely leaving the Civilization I know and love behind somewhere. In-game music however, takes another direction at least atmospheric and thematic, without being racist of course and with some variations - but there is no war songs anymore... so in the end, it is also not the best of the series.The gameplay has been affected by the same ""project"" and it is the first time I play a Civ game that isn't trying to be one. Fascism and two other suspicious types of goverment such as corporate libertarianism can be unlocked now, as totally natural options, showing you what the game's director thinks like. Sadly the worst problem is a nasty ""please wait"" bug if you have a lot of city-states, Civ 6 is very unstable. I got this feeling the gameplay interface no longer has this discovery beep, with classy fanfares making the addictive feeling of info on the screen, now mostly mild-interesting crap are doing the opposite for me. I can still feel it there somewhere but growing weaker. They managed to modernize some stuff and that's fine, but at the cost of sacred rules that were not necessary to change. Although I admit some changes are welcome, some others I'm not so sure. When you use the builders they'll eventually run out of units, like disbanding automatically. Workers no longer takes a handful of turns only to create a tile with some outside construction, they're consumed by each. That's compensation for new district rules so these tiles are mandatory tiles - even if you decide to slow down the turns in the options, the game still feels fast at its core and this is the main criticism I can point out right now. What hasn't mutated into faster stuff it has become easier. Roads for example are now gradually made through actual trading routes you assign, in between realms. Practical, intuitive... but this should have been an option for you to pick, not the only way to create roads. That's another flaw messing with oldies. I miss the ''raging barbarians"" difficulty option. At least if you activate them, they will be somewhat like that by default, because they can plague everywhere, but not exactly as violent but rather annoying instead. As for now, for the first time in the series, you can spare barbarian camps (for exploitation reasons) regardless of the risks. At some point due religious or policies, you can bribe or exchange with them into peace deals and so.  Unit A.I. somehow feels more worried about self-preservation, but I miss the occasional unexpected suicidal behavior. Civilizations A.I. outter strategies are kinda too forgiving even at higher difficulties, while in other aspects as I said earlier or such as building wonders, they can be tough to beat (because of ridiculous limitations now imposed) that human players would take time to work-around but the A.I. is just following scripts unrolling. I hate incoherence. When a challenge in any subject starts, such as lowering CO2 emissions accord, you may not have any points if you never abused CO2 at all - only if you actually got any decommissioned smog factories. Regularly out of bounds, like a world congress of emergency already taking place in the middle of a medieval era or dark age. Also, funny to see ancient advisors talking about future sea level rising, as it is marked on the map when founding monolithic cities... It is just weird. Past events in the series were more organic and unpredictable with that.Satisfying little stuff, such as finding ancient ruins is either gone or the idea is changing into active villages. Nameless, armyless, lifeless villages that I'm not sure if I'm sacking or if I'm greeting them, because nothing pops-up to explain. The general world map under the fogs of war is way too decorated, takes time to learn and avoid being distracted. Sound effects are highly detailed as ever before and that's great. Graphics are nothing special but the world's landscape is much more animated and this is a good thing, but the idea to make the world nature unstable is old as Civilization 1.That DLC with it isn't new,  from which his 10 years old game save still plays at the extreme because of it. Natural disasters or climate change are just being reinstated now, and being called a ""new thing,"" because they added details... too many details. The problem is, I'm not sure I play Civilization for managing inward systems. More about that down the review. Thankfully if you start a custom game, these things can be lowered down - because the idea of a changing world is good but it doesn't need to be that detailed or this complex.The game trying to evolve ancient ideas of the series and some of that stuff are done right, even if I disagree... While some others are nothing but criminal transgressions. But as for what doesn't work for me; overly plagued with DLCs and season passes and monetization in blatant abuse, like the most shady EULA agreement I have ever seen. Instability is also bad and in-game additions done there aren't the main reason for me to come play a Civ game. When I start a match I'm not interested in governors and vague district rules, because Civilization has always been an outward game, placing the player both as the chief but mainly as some all-seeing-eye deity. Not enough to dethrone Civilization V, only hardly updated enough to keep it alive.If you liked this review,  Thank you!If you like my content, would you"

It's such a shame because I am a huge fan of the series but I have to say this one is a backwards step from 4 and 5.First of all I shall go over the pros (in my opinion):1. Love the builders; they are an improvement on workers who just became annoying after a while on Civ 4 and 5.2. Love the trading! It has more depth to it than 5, which was a bit easy, and I like that they build automatic roads. A good improvement.3. One of the best improvements for me is the city state interaction. Sending envoys is an interesting and easy way to ally with city states, a big improvement on 5, which, unless you were Greece was pretty hard to maintain relationships with city states. 4. I really like the districts and how they work, it makes for a more deep and meaningful game, where city planning is of the utmost importance. Fantastic addition to the game. 5. The civics are also a good improvement in my opinion. Having such a diverse government system means there are hundreds of different ways to play the game and now you can really tailor a government to suit the needs of your empire. 6. Barbarians are now much more of a challenge and so have more meaning within the game.7. Absolutely love the fact you can create your own religion! That's about it for the pros. There is very little change in the battle systems and how scouting works, which is good because they were fine anyway. Right, now onto the cons, and although there are only two big cons they basically make the game much worse than 4 and 5.1. Map sizes have deteriorated badly! If you do a huge map with 12 civs then you will be on top of each other from the start. I have tested this time and again and I am usually 4-5 squares away from at least two other civs. There is no room for expansion and so wars are rife. It is impossible to play this type of game unless you plan on conquering the civs closest to you, which could easily back fire and means sacrificing religion, science and culture just so you have an army big enough to do the job. The civs will always put a city next to your capital before you have a chance to. Basically if you try and get a settler you'll sacrifice an army and the civ next to you will invade. Gandhi, Roosevelt, doesn't matter. They WILL invade and if you have a small army then you'll be wiped. Therefore the game is pointless being played on a huge map with 12 players, in fact, after much testing and comparing with 5 I believe that the huge map on 6 is roughly that of a medium on 5. If you want to play a similar experience to 5 (e.g. having space to grow your empire) then I'd suggest having six civilizations on a huge map. Any more and it is too congested. It's a great shame because I loved having all of the civilizations involved, not just a few of them. I can only guess that they have done this because of the new graphics engine, which does look good, but I'd have preferred 5 graphics with larger scale maps any day and I think most people would agree. 2. The civilizations are mental. By which I mean they will declare war on you for no reason whatsoever, they denounce you for being poor etc. even though you are richer than them, they will build cities next to yours even though it is hundreds of miles away from their capital. Basically the AI is massively flawed and must be tweaked. I have played three full games now and never had an ally. They always dislike me due to one of their agendas clashing with mine. It doesn't really work and just creates war. 3. You can no longer choose how many city states to start with! 4. After the renaissance era onwards the game slows down so much it becomes hard to play. I have a gaming PC with 32 GB of RAM and yet I am waiting roughly a minute between goes, sometimes longer! Again, this is down to the updated graphics.5. Still have the same issue as on 5 with iron not spawning in the your borders. However, on 5 you could avoid wars by being clever. On this one war will arrive within the first 100 goes EVERY TIME! Therefore army is key. If you have no iron then you will struggle and in my three goes so far I have had just one iron on my continent! It is such a shame that the game has these fatal flaws because otherwise it truly would be the best one of the series. I hope that they iron out these flaws but I am not sure whether they will be able to because increasing map sizes will just slow the game down even more. Therefore if you do get this game then take it for what it is: a war game. The flaws mean that wars happen all the time. In all my games so far there has been nonstop war from the ancient era all the way through. Most civs get wiped out by the renaissance era, normally leaving me and two-three other civs to fight it out the rest of the game. It is the same every time and it is for that reason why I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I will stick with it for a while longer and see if there is improvement but I can't see me playing this as long as I did 5, and I can even see myself going back to 5 sooner rather than later."

Districts are good, and there's a lot of little things and improvements that just make this a good installment. Say what you will about the DLC's and whatever, this Civ is genuinely fun to play in my opinion. You can also do a myriad of different strategies and its not as much a linear meta as Civ 5 or earlier titles. If you want to go with a cultural victory, religious, science, military- they're all viable and they all have their own difficulties and challenges. You can also go tall or wide in terms of empire expansion, and generally speaking just wonder spamming isn't as powerful anymore because you may be giving up precious time to develop districts, army or economic benefits- that isn't to say wonders are awful though they're very good still. My only gripes with this is the AI. The AI is very limited and doesn't use aircraft or artillery properly, and its been a problem with nearly every civ game I've played. Make sure you get AI improvement mods. Also- playing with mods is a hell of a lot easier than in 5. The mod support is a load better."

Civ VI lacks everything which made Civ V such a fun and addictive game. When I first played Civ V, I was instantly hooked on the gameplay. In my opinion, I felt that my game of Civ V was a dynamic, challenging game where my opponents each strategized and acted in the global scale. In Civ V, I conquered a Civ as Germany and instantly people were concerned about my expansion. Civ V was a mix of balancing agressive conquest without ticking off the other civs. Diplomacy mattered. In Civ VI, nothing the AI does makes sense. A warmongering spartan empire will criticize you for taking a city. Civs will declare war on you for absoluetly no reason and then move no units toward your borders, then beg for a peace deal. Ultimatley you do not feel like your civ is a part of the world. Civ V had interesting, yet understandable, mechanics which really made you feel like you were in control of your civ. Civ VI has a complicated UI which is not helpful. I really still don't know what i'm doing in this game and feel lost. In Civ V, i gained an unersanding in a few hours. I keep telling myself that another game will teach me somtehing that i'm missing that will help me like the game more. However I do appreciate the attempt to make the civs more dynamic by introducing specialty districts and whatnot, however the game is just too broken and not deep. The DLC is overpriced and adds nothing but a few civs and some crappy natural wonders. Overall summary: DLC is empty, meaningless money grabs that don't change anything and probably won't ever, game looks cartoonish and ridiculous and just doesn't work well as an art style with this specific game, ai is broken and makes the player feel like the player rather than another civ, UI is not helpful, mechanics are complicated and not realistic, attempt at dynamic civ ai behavior only makes them more chaotic and unpredictable.Overall Recommendation: If you want a strategy game that is far worth your money, buy civ V Complete. You can get complete on sale during a holiday event for $12. Even at full price I had no regrets. Too poor and can't wait? Buy Civ IV. Another great game with endless mods that are a blast. (I pre-ordered this game after I swore I never would again. I normally don't feel guilty buing games, but I wish I had my $60 back)."

In Civilization VI you lead a civilization from the dawn of civilization (3000 BCE) to the information era while researching technologies, building wonders, developping your culture, creating great works of art, music and writing, conquering your neighbours, founding religions  and all this on a hexagon tiled world map which might or might not look like a real world place with or without a civ which existed at this epoch. Never heard of the Industrial era Aztec empire in all his glory? Me neither but that what makes Civilization as a franchise so interesting.But what differentiates Civilization VI from it's predecessors? Well, first of all there's the district system. Basically you don't build your libraries in your cities but in districts which are placed on the world map. There's an adjacency system which gives bonus for well-placed districts (next to mountains or other districts). Also wonders have to be build on the world map and sometimes have to fulfill certain conditions like being next to a certain district and/or on a certain terrain feature which makes it harder to mass wonders which is in my opinion a nice change. Also wonders were nerfed compared to Civ V which don't make them anymore a necessity but more nice-to-have which is welcome too.Also another big change compared to Civilization V is the card system which makes for a more fluid and interesting gameplay. Do you want to focus on expansion or more on wonder building? Now you have to decide those things by either  putting a expansion focused card or wonder building card in your governement which starts with very few card slots to others with bigger flexibility. Also the choices of a government early games affects you also in the late game because former governments grant you a legacy bonus.The base game also includes religion and the new religion victory. Convert half the cities of all enemy civs to the religion you founded and you win the game (no religious victory for Kongo though). Alternative ways of winning the game are the science victory , cultural victory, domination victory and the score victory with their own unique flavour though spoiler If you buy the expansions, you'll be granted the loyalty system, the golden-dark age system, environmental effects, world congress, new 21st century techs and policies, and the diplomatic victory as most notable features as well as plenty other civs.All in all I would say it's a worthy investment in money and I'm pretty excited to see what's up for the future of Civ VIBe warned though that you'll might check the ingame time and wonder why you're still playing at 2AM."

I'm reviewing this with the  and  expansions.+ My monkey brain likes the Civ gameplay, and this game remains fundamentally Civ gameplay. Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate, make the planet yours.+ Research and Civics are split into two tech paths.+ District system encourages planning instead of ""just build every building in every city."" + Cities no longer increase the cost of research and civics. Instead, Districts cost more the more of them you build.+ Wonders take up a tile. Some of them have very strict placing requirements, which makes them feel more like wonders than another building. They also look nice.+ Government is based around putting Policies into Policy Slots. Lots of customization and ways to react to changing situations.+ Fighting to be the suzerain of city states feels rewarding.+ Workers are instant, expendable, and cost more the more you build. I've come to like this over the previous version of ""workers take 5 turns to improve a tile.""+ Espionage system can let you do things like steal works of art, cause political upheaval, and change city-state allegiance. Fun stuff in addition to just spying on players and taking their money or research.+ Tech and Civics boost system rewards particular gameplay actions and almost completely removes the ""free tech"" problem from goodie huts.+ Environmental catastrophes keep you on your toes and remind you that you haven't tamed the planet just yet. For extra fun, play on a Primordial map and die to volcanoes.+ Eras and Era Score are fun ways to reward good gameplay, and Golden/Dark ages actually mean something.+ Cities no longer need to be built on a coast in order to build ships. + Stop using your cities as canals and build Canals instead. (You can still use cities as canals if you want to or haven't researched canals yet.)+ Natural Wonders are fun to discover and fight over.+ Christopher Tin (of Civ 4's  fame) composed  as the theme for Civ 6 and this track is a right banger.- AI is dumb. It used to be malicious and dumb but now it's just the average kind of dumb, the kind that doesn't understand how to win because leaders pursue objectives instead of victory. Also still bad at combat. - A few unpatched (unpatchable?) exploits with trade and pantheons. 50 free settlers turn 35, let's go!- Civs are unbalanced. This never felt like a big concern for the franchise, but civs with unique districts are obviously top-tier in a way that's not even up for debate.- The Civilization-themed music loops can get extremely grating for some civs. This is the bad kind of grating where it's an earworm but also bad.- The cost seems a bit excessive.? People mention the cartoony art style for leaders, but what they don't mention is how this clashes with the rather serious tone of the rest of the game. There's a handful of funny quotes, but overall Civ 6 is very serious. I can take or leave the cartoon style, but it seems off-brand and out of place.Of all the Civilization games, this one certainly feels like another one. More wonders, ideas taken from the Endless series 4x games, bad/cheating AI, more civs, everything looks pretty, more mechanics to leverage. If you've never played a Civilization game before, this is a great place to start (but definitely get it on sale). If you're a fan of the series then there are a lot of new mechanics to explore. But if you're in these camps, then you don't need me to say anything about the game. I want to make a point, and the point is that, gameplay changes aside, the Civilization formula has remained the same for decades. There is nothing fundamentally different here that is not in another Civilization game. Nothing that makes me question and nothing that makes me feel. The only story being told is the one you make up for yourself, but it's ultimately the same story every single time. The moment I realized all of this is when I tried the pantheon exploit to gain a large advantage at the start of the game. Some hours later, I paused to ask myself what I was doing. Hitting arbitrary achievement goals. Recapturing enough carbon to lower the global temperature two degrees. Completing my seasteads and offshore wind farms. Renaming my Giant Death Robot ""Unit 01"" and escorting it with a supply convoy that I've named ""Misato Katsuragi."" Waiting One More Turn for a certain wonder or building or unit to complete so that I can feel some sense of achievement for raising my Era score. Just a big skinner box of my own creation. ."

I don't write reviews often, but I think the negativity towards Civ VI is entirely out of proportion.Civilization VI is definitely a worthy sequel. It took some getting used to coming from Civilization V and initially I was afraid I might not be able to go back once I did. The truth is that I don't even  to go back now.Civilization VI isn't perfect, but it improves many flaws from the previous games. There's also lots of new, quite interesting game mechanics that all give the game more depth and make it more interesting. If you're like me and like enjoy diplomacy, you'll love this game. Especially with the DLC. The AI is incredibly reasonable and doesn't suddenly backstab unless there's a proper reason for it (unlike Civ V from my experience).Gameplay in general is very satisfying, especially with a few mods here and there. All the major Civs in the game are interesting, well balanced and quite fun to play.My only real point of criticism would probably be the soundtrack. This time around music consists of your Civilization's national anthem (along with certain melodies like in the Ancient era). I do not like this one bit. While yes, e.g. hearing the Kalinka play and change style while playing as Russia really sets the mood, it also gets  old after so many eras, and so do the occasional tribal drum lines. I much prefer a random selection of classical music in various styles based on your Civilization's nationality like in Civilization V, because the current system is hit-and-miss, with it being more miss than hit.Aside from that, if you're a fan of civilization and its diplomacy, definitely give this one a try! All those negative reviews are undeserved. It's a far better game than some people make it out to be, especially after all these year since release!"

You might see some people saying that this game isn't as good as Civ 5. I have never played Civ 5 so I can't really speak to that, but if you are new to the franchise, I don't think this game will disappoint. It has great graphics, beautiful soundtrack, and so many different scenarios you can find yourself in. The game can be quite complex, but after playing one or two games you can easily learn the basics. Throughout the game, you really feel like you are building an empire. You'll be able to explore the world and find unique landmasses, world wonders and hostile entities. There are so many decisions to be made, around war, alliances, expansion, city development, world wonder building, research, government type etc.  The creators try to stay true to the actual historical background of each the civilizations. The AI, although they can be a bit dumb, do seem to have some sort of personality, with certain civilizations being more aggressive than others and having certain mannerisms. The ""just one more turn"" feeling is very strong with this one.  Would recommend buying when on sale, although this game is amazing, it's still very expensive, especially with DLCs."

That package adds a lot of additional content and game modes that really round out the experience. I now find this game easy to recommend as there is plenty of content to explore and it can be picked up at a great price when on discounts. I'm not a fan of the new 2K launcher that is now bundled into the installation, but a brief search will quickly find you a solution to that hurdle.Just a pretty quick review here, more of a ""my personal addendum to most other reviews"" than an actual review.Basically, I can't say I disagree with many points for most of the negative reviews currently on Steam. There are certainly some problems, some frustrations and some things just plain lacking. I don't disagree with any other those complaints. Likewise, there are some really cool features in the game that a worth experiencing for yourself.I find it a hard line to draw between those things that just don't work as I assume they were intended, and those things that are just different from what I'm used to in Civ 5 and I haven't learned to take advantage of yet.What I'd like to differentiate from all those negative reviews is that I would still recommend this game. There is some fun to be had, and I've enjoyed most of the play time I've spent in-game. Maybe hold off and see what the first major patch brings, but I don't see any reason why someone couldn't buy the game now and enjoy it.Fall Patch Update:Some improvements in some areas, but AI is still lacking. Played through a game since the patch, but haven't really noticed any of the changes from the patch notes."

With that, however, comes the challenge of adding new content to improve upon what's already there without bloating it. Civ VI's first expansion, Rise and Fall, strikes a remarkable balance between the two, with several key features that both complement and change up the base game.The Ages system works brilliantly with Civ VI's emphasis on careful planning and building a well-rounded civilization regardless of the victory condition you're working towards. A wide variety of accomplishments contribute to your score, from clearing Barbarian outposts and building Wonders to being the first civilization with a complex form of government. If you lean too heavily into one specialization, like science, you'll have trouble earning enough points in any given era to escape a Dark Age and its pitfalls. So even if you're two eras ahead of everyone else in your own tech tree, you're still susceptible to falling into a Dark Age if you fail to do anything else of note. As a result, a strong start isn't enough to carry you through Rise and Fall, even on lower difficulties--you need to work proactively and adapt your strategies at every step if you want to rule the world."

Warmongering is such a idiotic feature in this Game there is even a mod for that. Such things should not need a mod! It should be possible to defend yourself without offending the whole world!The End of Turn takes so long. You can read a book wile playing this game. Other games with much more stuff happening during the turns with more Factions make a AI Turn in secounds. Civ needs some minutes in late game. (With 24gb Ram on SSD and i7 Intel- 7700k)Different Speed levels are idiotic. It would be cool to reduce the research time and building stay on the same speed as on ""normal"" so you can actually enjoy every Aera. Like Classic, Industrial a.s.o. I really with i could build a Classic Kingdom with Classic Battles and after i enjoyed that Aera for a wile it moves slowly towards Medieval times and then i can enjoy this Aera.But no. On marathon everythign is just slower. So in the time you Build a Knight he is already obsolete because you researched Gunpowder. On ""normal Speed"" you research a better Unit type in the time you building 2 Actual Units. But its the same on Marathon. The only difference is that it takes 20 Turns insead of 10. Game speed levels would make sense if they just slow down the development of the Nations (Research and Cluture) but keep the building speed from ""Standard Speed""Why i didnt give the game back. Well its a Civ Game. You need some hours to find out how it is. Maybe a ton of mods and spend alot money on several Addons and Civs could make this game fun. But right now. Dont buy it please.

The only computer it works well on is my Mac. Hats off to Aspyr as they seem to have a better grasp on making a stable version. I have beta versions of more stable games from tiny dev companies that run better. 2K has to be the worst.

Yesterday I was looking at a game called Dominions and it hit me like a brick in the head that normally I'm the one getting on my high horse saying ""graphics shouldn't matter, it's how the game plays"". Needless to say I was soon on the Civ 6 store page again to see how far it had come with the expansions and noticed that now 90% of the reviews in the past 30 days were positive. A few hours  later I jumped in blind and was playing it, which leads me to my next point.I was also concerned after hearing it lacked depth; I'm not sure what it was like before the expansions but I certainly think it has a huge amount to offer now.  There's more to it than that though - it's difficult to explain but this game feels a lot more 'organic' in how it plays out compared to the other strategy games I play - for example I love all all Paradox games to bits but they feel more 'clinical' for want of a better word, with the exception of maybe Crusader Kings 2.Back to the graphics, although I don't think I'll ever get used to way the maps are presented the UI itself is one of the crispest and cleanest I've seen in a while. Furthermore everything just makes sense, I fumbled through to religious victory on Prince simply by doing whatever seemed sensible at the time without the need to look anything up. Now I'm sure some people will be thinking ""Oh but you can't do that on harder difficulties"" and they would be missing the point entirely... the point is that this game is laid out well enough and is accessible enough to be beaten on default settings by the average Joe - there is no need to spend tonnes of time reading wikis and watching tutorial videos trying to figure out what something does (or how to do it) and that to me is great design.In short I'm very pleasantly surprised and the game also runs perfectly on a Linux PC."

During the early stages of my first game (playing emperor difficulty), a neighboring nation declared war on me suddenly and for no apparent reason. I built up my defenses expecting an army to attack... they never came. A few turns later i decided to start attacking my opponent. I gathered a few units and was able to conquer the closes enemy city to mine with literally no resistance.... their capital.     Since i really didn't want to deal with war further, I started peace negotiations with my opponent. Can you guess what my rival offered me in exchange for peace? 6 of their 7 remaining cities. This lead to me absolutely dominating the match with almost no challenge whatsoever.  When i saw this, my heart sunk because i sensed that something was dreadfully wrong with this game. Yet i kept on playing in hopes that these events were just a fluke. They Weren't.   Almost every match I played after the one described above was plagued with horrible AI decisions and just a lack of challenge or fun. Any challenge the game does provide is a product of the AI being given cheese bonuses rather than making smart or strategic decisions. The whole thing just feels manufactured, fake, and cheap.    I was hoping the DLC would correct these problems. From the reviews I've seen others give that appears to not be the case. Extremely disappointing. A terrible addition to an otherwise great series. Fireaxis should focus less on shoehorning female leaders and more on making a game with functioning AI."

If you want to enjoy a better version of this game, get Civ 5 on sale.(Although the unreleased Humankind game does look very good too.)They have made some minor adjustments and very minor improvements since release, but the game is still slow.  The movement and general tasks of this game is atrocious when compared to what you can do Civ-5.  Moreover, the learning curve for how things actually work is still significantly higher than Civ-5 and the in-game civ-o-piedia is really worthless.   About the only good thing I can say is that they did get some better balancing mechanisms together in a few places then what was originally there.  Anyway.. I'll leave my original review below as almost nothing that I wrote then is out of date with the current version now.  With the only exception being this: there is a bit more balance on the tile production now versus then.  So the districts sucking up resources is still sort of an issue - but only if you don't go online and find the data on how to place them correctly and space your cities correctly (which can be a difficult thing to actually accomplish).Civ 5 is not perfect by any means, but I still think it is better than this, and there are plenty of active modders still working on it.  I'll stick with it from here on out.  2K will not get another dime out of me for Civ6.OH!  I almost forgot - The game still has glitchy-bugs!  Its been around since 2016 and they still have menu placement bugs!  Are you kidding me?  Its more then just that, some units are bugged too.  Nothing completely game breaking - but yea, after 4 years and all the updates, you should still expect to see bugs in the program if you buy it.  What crap.[Original Review Below]At this point in the development of the Civ6 game, I would recommend for those interested in this type of game to purchase Civ5 instead.  The basic mechanics of this version need some serious work, in essence it plays you - you do not play it.  Don't get me wrong, there are several things that Civ6 improves upon over Civ5 but many of the great features of Civ5 have been lost or thrown out for whatever reason.  These can truely make the game extremely tedious (at best) and utterly frustrating  if you are already familar with the mechanics of Civ5 already.Pros of Civ6 over Civ5:+Better political game play - definitly a large improvement in working with AI players, better information available on how to play/trade with the AI leaders.  Not perfect by any means but an improvement none the less.+Slightly better graphics - I really did not need better graphics or additional animations from Civ5, but I can appreciate that Civ6 did make some improvements in these areas.  Cons of Civ6 over Civ5:-Failures of Available Information.  Two simple examples: 1-the trade route menu & 2-the help menu.  In Civ5, if you wanted to find out what was the best trade route to use next, then you would click on the trade menu and a nice graphic matrix would pop-up and allow you to sort it by all of the different information columns, typically in 3 or 4 clicks I could sort it out in a minute and be on my way.  Alternately in Civ6, you have a single long list - no sorting, lots of repeats - it really is an information cluster-f***.  To be fair, it looks like there are buttons that should be available for some simple sorting but they don't work (at least in my game) and even if they did, this still would not fufill even 1/2 of the possible options of play.  Sometimes when I click on the trade-route menu, nothing shows up at all - so maybe its a bug of some sort, IDK.The help menu: in Civ5, if there is something in the game you can find it in the help menu - may take a bit, but for the most part it is there.  In Civ6 there is a lot of information missing - if you don't have access to the internet, forget about it - you may have to save the game and just try it.  But you should be prepared to go back 10 to 15 turns to undo that attempt at learning.  There is just a lot more information available in Civ5 about what your cities and units are doing or costing you, information that you can use to adjust your gameplay and make improvements.Which leads me to my last major Con:  Time to complete.  It takes forever to accomplish simple things - This is partially just how the game is but it really seems to me that it is easier to speed things up in Civ5 with the right resources and build options then it is in Civ6.  Some other thoughts on Civ6 deficiencies - One of the new items in Civ6 is the ""stackable"" units - they sell this as the ability to create armies, you know, a whole army: infantry, machine gunners, tanks & artillary.  Nope.  It's not that - It is just a slightly more powerful unit of the same type.  Of course, you can't easily determine if this is actually an improvement or not - what is the cost benefit?  Can't tell, there is no information available to determine the cost of a 'corps' vs. a 'unit'.  But now you have only a shot from that corps instead of two shots from two units.The Districts.  The new concept of building districts around your city instead of buildings in your city is interesting but currently flawed.  The failure to provide additional workable tiles around the city (still stuck at 3 tile radius) really makes this difficult in many situations.  Especially if you are working with a captured city from an AI player.  The AI cities do not play under the same rules, which is fine - until you capture one and have to work with what they left you.  At least in Civ5 you could build a settler and then raze the AI city at a later time.  That is not an option now.  You can choose to raze a city only if you capture it by force, and only at that exact moment.Also, you cannot move districts.  Pick the wrong spot and did not figure it out until later in the game?  Tough cookies - your stuck with it now.  Want to trade a district from one city to another that the AI built to close?  Nope, can't do that silly - why would you want to do that?City-State Envoys - great concept.  Why do they have to all die when an AI player takes over the city-state?  Taking with them thousands of years of effort also?  Not sure - not happy about it either.Some other thoughts on the Civ game, in general: Why can I not buy and sell land?  This seems like a perfectly reasonable way to negoiate with neighbors and make sure that we can actually get along?  The land tiles are the most important aspect of the game -  why is the concept of trading land rights so foreign & unincluded in these games?Also, why do I need a city to hold on to captured land?  I need a city to work the land obviously, but if I capture a city and raze it to the ground, why do I have to give up the land rights?  I only need an army to hold on to land, not a city.Anyway - buy Civ5 at a sale event.  Wait a few years for Civ6 to fix itself.Myself, I am going to learn how to Mod Civ5 with the good parts of Civ6 and then play Civ5."

While not as good as Civ 5 it does add some improvements. I do like how buildings are broken up into district tiles and builders are consumable, which makes you think more about how you are going to use them as opposed to putting them on auto pilot like in previous games. The fact that you can't construct roads beyond making trade routes and the fact that they will often times choose sea routes over land when you want to build roads between cities is a pain. In the future it would be nice to see if they can flesh out districts and potentially allow for districts to produce units/buildings separately from your city center. Overall I recommend this game as long as you get the expansions and am interested in what they do in the next mainline Civ game."

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The atmosphere is amazing. At first I thought I would hate the graphics, but since I've been playing they've grown on me (not in a weird fungal way). Yes, they do look less reallistic then Civ 5 (possibly even a little bit cartoonish), but they build an atmosphere for the game in a way that is just as immersive as the realism of Civ 5. The music is great, definitely superior to that of Civ 5 (maybe not as great as Baba Yetu, but then again what is). I also love Sean Bean's voice (no ♥♥♥♥).2. The city building is far deeper than that of Civ 5, and more strategic. You actually have to plan out how you will use each tile and where you will build improvements. You can't build every single building you want to in each city, and that forces you to specialize each city.3. The combat is a lot more tactical than in Civ 5. The new movement rules make a large impact on planning out your assaults as well as your defenses. Also bringing back stacking from Civ 4 in a limited way makes you make decisions about where you want to focus your strength. I also love the fact that it takes walls for a city to bombard; it gives you a reason to actually build walls.4. Each civilization is a lot more deep and it feels like each leader has a personality. I know that agendas are getting a lot of flak right now, but I actually really enjoy them. For example, I fought Gorgo to a standstill early on in one game, and after the war ended we actually became friends because she beleived I had fought honorably. It actually felt like she was acting like the historical figure actually would. Now of course the agendas need some tweaking to make the Ai behave normally but overall I like the agendas. Oh and as a side not Civilizations don't have just one bonus now, they actually have several, which makes each civ a bit more detailed and unique.5. The early game can be challenging if you aren't prepared. This especially applies to higher difficulty games, where in the early game you will more than likely have to deal with a neighboring civ or barbarians. You actually have to build units early game in order to protect yourself. Now admittely the ai does need to be fixed so it can attack effectively but I will talk more about that later.6. The eureka and inspiration boosts definitely take each game a different dirrection. The choices you make in game actually effect how your civilization progresses. For example, if you have a very peaceful early game, then chances are you won't be researching stuff like archery or bronze working for a while just because it is easier to go down other routes first. It feels like your experiences in game are actually connected to your technology and culture.7. I also really like how the civics tree functions. The whole card system feels a lot more fluid than the old social policy system that inevitably came down to going tradition and then rationalism. Again, it feels like you are reacting to your game, not the other way around. I also really enjoy the government types and the bonuses each one gives. The governments actually give you an interesting early and mid game in terms of culture and its bonuses.8. I know this is a small thing but I really like the fact that there are actually casus belli now and that warmongering penalties increase throughout the ages.9. Housing should probably go with #2 but I'm kind of lazy so..... I like the realism of being essentialy forced to settle around fresh water. I'm a history nerd so I absolutely love civilizations rising around major waterways like in the neolithic era and there being an emphasis on looking for water sources for new cities.10. The new and expanded victory types are defintiely a welcome addition. It is good to see that there a bigger benefits for focusing on relgion than there were in Civ 5. I'm also grateful that city states now function differently which has also lead to the removal of the diplomatic victory type, as it was just annoying to see other civs having infinite amounts of gold and overwhelming you with it in Civ 5. Also, I feel like the science victory is more meaningful, as it feels like you aren't just building parts for a spaceship but also trying to settle a new planet.The list of great changes for Civ 6 could go on and on but I think I got most of the major ones. Here are the few negative parts of this game that aren't an improvement over Civ 5:1. The Ai can be a bit wonky at times. It has a very hard time attacking cities properly, even with the overwhelming numbers it always has. The Ai can also have trouble upgrading it's units, although often times this is due to a lack of resources for certain units. However, if you are planning on dominating the world in Civ 6, it isn't actually that much easier than in Civ 5 (not that it was that hard on Civ 5), as the Ai will actually build updated units and it usually has a ton of units so it can be difficult and a bit of a meat grinder to get through them all. The Ai will probably be patched up to working condition within a month, so it really isn't that big of a deal.2. The Ui could use some amount of improvement, mainly in the way lists are sorted and making it more clear how your amenities are being used. This is relatively minor and will be a rather easy patch or will just require a mod or two to deal with if you are really that OCD.So in conclusion, while the game isn't perfect, it is already just as, if not more, fun than Civ 5 all while offering a  completely different expereince from Civ 5. I see no reason to wait to get the game, as it is already very much a fun and enjoyable experience, even without expansions (which could not be said of Civ 5 on release, despite it now being one of the best strategy games of all time)."

The AI works well (and can be further moded to be harder or easier, to change it's decision patterns etc... ot your liking), the civilizations are all very unique and allow for a good mix of gameplay and frankly the overall experience is most enjoyable! Civ 6 has simplified and streamline lots of micro from Civ 5 and added in tons of planning complexitiy through its districts sytem and adjecency bonuses. In my mind it's not about comparing Civ 5 and Civ 6 as they are relatively different games but rather admitting that Civ 6 brings soemthing new and fresh to the Civ forumula and it works well hour after hour.Recommended, especially if like me, you have been putting off Civ 6 due to it's strong design changes from Civ 5."

Also, having Wonders consume a tile on the world map adds further strategic dynamics; no more can you have the ""ultra-capital"" with everything under the sun built in it; you simply don't have the real-estate to have that one perfect city.-Graphically very attractive; the leaders have great reaction animations and well-executed hybrid style between cartoony and realistic. - Well balanced civilizations mean there is no single civilization with a clear advantage over others; everyone has a clear gameplay preference but no civ is a hands-down super-power relative to others.- New builder/worker mechnics and trade / road mechanics have short learning curve but clear balance advantages'; stockpiling workers is no longer feasible given they expire once used. Caravans make their own roads with manual road building a mid-to-late game option. -Difficulty levels scale more realstically. All difficulties pre-prince are still rather easy to win on. Prince is not overly challenging, but a happy medium. Notably, however, King is no longer excessively difficult. Tiers beyond Prince scale with progressive difficulty rather than being maddengingly egregious, allowing players to inch higher in challenge without rage quitting after 100 turns.- Separation of Science and Civics and new government system allows for more customization and adaptability as a leader / government. - The wide assortment of Natural Wonders and their varying benefits are a fun dynamic that makes the map / land grab a bit more intriguing than in previous renditions. The Bad- Sean Bean and Ygritte from GoT as narrators get old fast. Leonard Nimoy, they are not. After two playthroughs, I had to turn them off personally. - Like previous editions, the game has become very DLC focused: you get your stock of half-decent leaders at launch, but the game seems to expect hardcore players to dump another $15 every few months for a small leader pack and a pittance of maps and scenarios. This makes the game better left for 2 years and purchased as a GotY package with expansiosn rather than bought outright; an unfortunate trend amongst many AAA titles that punishes gamers who enjoy casually playing many games as opposed to buying one game and spending all their leisure time on it.- Religion combat can become tedious. Though the concept of the battles of faith has been given new breath, it is poorly explained and becomes overly tedious to have a barage of apostles and missionaries waging war in your lands and elsewhere. Though the concept of a civilization's religion is not as prevalent and directly impactful on diplomacy as it was in 4 and 5, it becomes a way of having a latent, petty squabble with a rival without declaring all-out war, adding a second method, on top of espionage, in which you can have a ""Cold war"" with another civilization. My gripe isn't so much with the mechanic itself as it is with the fact that it felt like it needing more explaining and / or fine-tuning.- For whatever reason that I just can't put my finger on, I dont' feel the need to replay the game like it's pre-decessors. I dont' know if it's the voice-acting of Bean and company or the mechanics, but I have hundreds of hundreds of hours I dumped into the previous games before putting them aside, whereas with Civ VI, I played for about 80 - 90 hours and was happy to put it down.All in all, not at all a bad game and a very fun to play, but a pricey way to dump your leisure hours and likely not the amount of hours you would expect from previous renditions.I give it a 9 / 10 on the game itself but only a 7 / 10 on value.It's just too expensive for a game that lacks that endless hours of engrossing entertainment that I got from the previous editions. Is this simply because of the enormous affection I have for the previous games?  Perhaps. But Civ VI just seems to be missing something that keeps me coming back for one more civ, one more turn."

I love the art style, very simple and easy to your eye. 2. I like the district concept, learning how to optimize your city using district is fun. District will likely make you play again. 3. Barbarians are fun to deal with, they are a challenge even though I would prefer more options to deal with them. Like declaring a joint war against them or actually interacting with their leaders (king beyond the wall). 4. One more turn urge, early eras are fun. 5. Sean Bean doesn't die, at least so far in my game.Things I hate;1. Freaking A.I spamming denouncing button on you, after I finish this review, I am going back in the game to nuke every A.I to teach them some manners. You will get denounced for no reason, you build a military to protect yourself? ♥♥♥♥ you I am denouncing you. You dare bring your units to close my borders even though they are in your terrority ♥♥♥♥ you I am denouncing you. 2. Trading with A.I is pointless, I wanted a luxuary resource ""Salt"", and this******* Tomyris of Scythia wanted 4 luxuary resources of mine plus 100 gold per turn. I mean like what the ♥♥♥♥? I nuked her later3. A.I can't fight period. Just get close to their city during and they will take off their clothes and give everything to you. Russia declared war on me for no reason, I was scared as I didn't know how much army he had. Turns out he had 2 horses and 1 chariot, 2 warriors. Well it will be understatement if I say I killed them, as I approached to his city with my mumulk (knights) and catapult and archers he ♥♥♥♥ his pants and gave me 300 gold per turn with 3 luxuary resources and the control over the city I was approaching in exchange for peace. Once the peace ended I declared war on him to finish him off.  4. Spying wasn't that fun, maybe I didn't explore that enough. But I would like more depth in espionage, in previous Civ games i remember you could start revolution through espionage, poison city's water supply, and etc etc. I like more options other the current options of stealing funds, art work.5. Can't trade technologies, can't trade maps, can't trade units (This one i am not sure, because I got no allies, forever alone). 6. A.I spamming missionaries, if I don't have open border deal with them, they shouldn't be in my territory. Tomyris of Scythia has been sending 5-6 missionaries to my territories even though there is no open border deal and they block your units, what the ♥♥♥♥ is that seriously. She had 6 missionaries surrounding my city, I nuked my own terriority in frustration to kill those *******. There are other things that are frustrating, it is so frustrating that we get our video games like this full of buggs. Shame on you Sid Meier for releasing a game in this condition. Doesn't matter if you patch this game (you better), this is not acceptable. This is total rip off, I don't see how anyone can defend this game. I would give this game a 2/10, is this game unplayable? no it is not. You can play the game but the intended mechanics of the game don't work. The reason why I give 2/10 is because if you are going to charge me premium price for the game then you better have something more than just a playable game. Just one note on technical issues, I haven't been able to exit the game properly. Everytime I quit the game using ""quit to desktop"" the game just freezes and I have to mannually restart my PC.Edit: Thought I add to my review after playing this ♥♥♥♥ game in 2022. The game was ♥♥♥♥ and still is ♥♥♥♥. Cosmetic update from cvi 5. No significant changes. I think they hired inexperienced programmers to code this game because nothing works as intended. Looks good on paper but once again execution is ♥♥♥♥. Zombie mod - This what happens when you do your assignment at 11:55 pm when it is due at 12:00 AM. Its just more ""barbarians"" endlessly spawning in your base and just in your base to kill you. They will ignore the barbarians and coordinate attack with them to destroy you. Just like barbarians they spawn out of thin air. It made kinda sense for barbarians to spawn out of thin air but zombies shouldnt be spawning like that especially within your terrority by numbers. And no one was killed which triggered the zombies. I have cleared the surrounding. And it seems they spawn at their fav location near a trader to mess with you.Heoric age: You go in dark age because you couldnt build enough wonders to satisfy your greedy of bastered population so 1-2 cities will rebel. Makes no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. Don't use this option AI gets their city rebelled every ERA because these developers cant code AI. They can't code simple game mechanic correctly so it is unrealistic to expect a working AIAI: Denouncing still a problem, less of a problem than before but problem indeed. Russai sends army of pedophiles into my terrority, despite me asking him i dont want his stupid religion, leaving me no choice but to declare war. I declare war so I can kill the pedos and save children within my borders. While I am waging war against pedophiles i meet three new civs. One turn later they denounce me. makes no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. But anyhow I expected pedos to support pedos so i continue. Some turns later war is ended and children are safe, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who denounced me start requesting to trade with me because they wanted my luxury resources. I think there should be an option to say ♥♥♥♥ you to your AI if they request to trade with you after denouncing you. AI get advantage for no reason (aka cheating), i am guessing that is the only way developers can compensate for their lack of skills. Corporation/industry: Another useless addition. No depth, it is laughable at this point how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the developers are. Custom maps: Another example of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers. They should join a coding boot camp or something to learn how to program. I can't believe that we dont have a working editor at this point of this franchise. Overall playable game, i didnt experience any crashes but I have a good computer maybe thats why. Considering what they are charging and it is the sixth game, I wouldnt recommend this to new players. if you civ player then you probably already own the game. but if you havent then dont bother."

I appreciate that, in terms of gameplay, Firaxis is willing to incorporate and iterate on what newcomers to the 4X genre are bringing to the table (in the form of districts as permanent map improvements).Here's where the game is the strongest:City planning - cities, especially your critical first few, feel more meaningful than in any previous installment.Battlefield strategy - there is a lot of depth to where you place your units.Aesthetics - visuals aside (personally I love them), the music is better than it's ever been. The average Medieval era theme and onward is as good as the best of the Civ V theme songs for each empire. There are a dozen beautiful and thoughtful arrangements of existing songs in the game. My personal favourite themes in the base game are America (really inspired choice of song), England, China, and Scythia (fun fact: this one's an original composition)."

Literally every run comes down to mere chance, and it's clear this game is being abandoned now that NFP comes to a close and the main team has moved to something not yet named. What's still broken? Diplomacy, early wars, BARBARIANS. How could they have screwed up barbarians so badly? It's not uncommon to lose a game because of barbarians - I just witnessed twenty swarm my land from all sides, some carrying a battering ram along with them. Yeah, because that's real fun on Deity when all the other Civs then declare war on you for no reason. If you don't believe the fact that this game is abandoned, look to the World Congress. After years, it is still the most disappointing system ever introduced to the franchise. You can't propose what you want. You have virtually no control over anything because the AI always votes against you. And don't even try to figure out what you're doing - it's the most cryptic thing ever. Civ VI is doomed, and despite being a financial success, it is nothing but a time sink. Get Civ V. Or Civ IV. Nothing in this game is actually worth your money.------I didn't want to do this. I really, really didn't want to do this.I pre-ordered Civ VI and was, admittedly, always skeptical about the release. The trailer, which was popularized almost immediately, worried me. Where was the game footage? Where was the story? Where was the beauty that had become synonymous with the series?When the first screenshots came out, many people's worries were realized. And you have to ask, what effect can graphics really have on games? Certainly, there's genres that can be cartoony and be smashing successes. But doing the same for a historical-strategical game was a bold, bold move. The consequence, was simple:  Though I have only 100 hours, I played enough to realize that I can't play any more. It's hard to imagine and immerse yourself in a game where everything has a joking, cartoon aspect to it. I want to build my empire from the ground- that's the feeling most of us had when we were introduced to Civilization. I feel like, now, the game is all about trying to impress me with things I don't necessarily care about. Sure, the cities look nice. But wouldn't it be nicer if I could pan across the world without my eyes bleeding, and I could conduct trade deals with leaders that look realistic and not made to be preposterous? The art style leads into a whole range of other development issues that I find concerning and worrisome. The military system is a disaster. Airforces have been effectively removed from the game with the introduction of districts. The cost to build their respective tile, in addition to the abhorrent production cost of literally everything, makes them useless. I still cannot figure out how to properly attack a city. Is it really that complicated, when I have strong units and my enemy has literally none? Granted, I have been able to win conquests before- but only while the AI was technologically crippled, which makes the feeling and strategy of fighting wars absolutely diminish.Foreign relations make no sense and are always unfavorable. Though patches have been made to make the AI more friendly, it still doesn't feel right, like Civ V. In Civ V, you felt fully in control of your relationship. This was a necessary thing: you, again, felt as if you managed your country and their policies. In Civ VI, you feel helpless. Isolated on a world to yourself, which you continuously press next turn to escape. The changes made to make the game more immersive do so, but only on the turn they're implemented. Simply, there's set objectives you have to achieve, and they stay standard across each game. Deity is, essentially, an early-game rushfest. Of course, there are other ways to tackle it- but that's what gets me the most, more than anything. Civ VI ostracizes players that loved the series for what it was: a fun, simulation-strategy game, where your goal was to create the most well-rounded and prosperous empire on the planet.It was never about abusing strategies. It was never about clicking endlessly and hoping for something to happen. YOU made things happen. With Civ VI, I always leave my games feeling empty, yet sad. As much as it pains me, the future of Civ VI is increasingly bleak. So many things are already cemented for it that it would need a massive overhaul to revamp.If you are new to the series and are intrigued by this edition, by all means, purchase it. You have an interest and it's certainly still a Civilization game at the core. If you come from V, stay there. It says a lot in the fact that V has substantially more players than VI."

It introduced several interesting new mechanics and there's some really good ideas there, but in the state that it's in I just can't recommend this game to anyone.The pros;- The map art looks amazing- natural disasters are fun- the tech tree, UI,  combat and general gameplay mechanics are all on par with civ 5 (although this certainly wasn't the case when the game was released!)The cons;-Eternal forest fires that make some maps unplayable-The secret societies doesn't really work- you basically just get a bunch of free governor titles in the ancient age if they're turned on.- Some Civs are so broken it's not even funny; Babylon can enter the modern era while everybody else is still in the classical age, Mali can purchase unlimited units for free on certain game modes, etc. etc-the loading times. Oh dear god, the loading times!-This game crashes. A lot.- The character art is fugly and disgusting.- are you playing on a team with a human player? There's an emergency that will occur occasionally that requires other players to give you as much gold as possible to win. Just pass the gold between yourselves for the next dozen turns; it's a guaranteed win!- No seriously- it will crash. It's not your fault; it's literally broken code. Good luck finding out which of the 9,723 reasons is responsible for you not being able to finish this game you've spent 12 hours on.- half of those 12 hours were spent looking at a loading screen. Usually because the game crashed.- there's a global warming system which causes sea levels to rise. This will break certain maps and cause the game to crash.-it's still loading- just buy all of the AI's cities, because you can.- Still loading... I think? Maybe something's gone wrong again....- buy all of the AI's great works as well, because you can also do that at almost no cost.- Oh look- it's finally loaded! Aaaand it crashed and started re-loading again.I'm pretty sure the devs are done with this game now, so I'm fairly certain this game won't be getting finished, which is a pity because there was so much potential here."

To start: I'll say that I've only genuinely played the Civilization franchise since 4. I dabbled in 3 as a kid, but you know, I was a kid, and it was a bit beyond me at the time. So a lot of what I expect from the Civilization series is based on that foundation.Civilization 5 was unfortunately a really big disappointment for me. It did have some redeeming features: the introduction of 1UPT, and the art, were some things I liked right from the get go. Even though I'll say the AI can't really understand 1UPT as well as it could and I think it should be something like a couple of units per tile instead. Regardless, Civ 5 did get some appreciation from me after it's final DLC came out, but it was still always hindered by global happiness and no health.At least for me.So while Civ 6 is a pretty big step backwards in the art design (at least with the leaders, I ended up not minding the world art after awhile), it's reintroduction of local happiness and health (in the form of housing) was a huge pleasant surprise to me. I did not expect them to ever go back that way, especially after Beyond Earth was released with just health (which was essentially global happiness reskinned). It's also easily the most feature complete release the game has had: with spies and religion making the cut for the vanilla game. On top of this the things it does add such as: the government card system, the ""army"" stuff, the culture research tree, and districts, are all pretty solid in my opinion. Admittedly I was hoping districts was going to function more like Endless Legend, where you'd grow your city out from the core, and then you could specialize them, but still it's a nice change of pace having more things moved away from the core of the city. Not just nice because it adds a bit of depth and thinking when building and conducting warfare, but also satisfies one of my gripes with the older games, where when founding a new city you basically had a ton of buildings to build in the core city, all the way from the very first age. Although this is still largely a thing, it's at least lampshaded somewhat.I'll end by saying that it seems that what a lot of people complain about with this game (namely the AI) is a thing that has been an issue since at least Civ 4. The AI could handle themselves better in 4 because the armies were stacks and there wasn't a lot of depth required behind warfare, but even if 4 didn't have the same diplomacy issues, they were definitely present in 5.That's not me saying it's excusable or not a negative for 6, it is, and it seems like the developers at least know this and are working on it. That's just me saying, compared to 5, 6 only really shares similar faults, but blows 5 away in its added features or changes. I hope this review was at least helpful to someone. Much love."

Of course I recommend it with ALL the DLC. I can now firmly say this is my favorite Civ game. Trying to play Civ V these days I get bored very quickly. There just isn't nearly the amount of content that Civ VI has to offer. 2016 Review: It's a decent game. Not great...yet. Keep in mind that I have almost 1,400 hours in Civ V, so I may be a wee bit biased. I just finished my first playthrough of Civ VI. I played on Prince difficulty and specifically focused on growing my cities, optimizing districts, and investigating the Tech and Culture trees. Out of nowhere, without even trying at all, I won a cultural victory. I don't understand the Tourism mechanics yet, so I barely paid any attention to it throughout the game. Obviously neither did the AI. I played as Gorgo who has a unique Theater district which I built early so MAYBE that had to do with it. I had a few policies in the beginning that got me Great Writers, put the works in the slots, and around year 1800 I got a policy that gave me +100% Tourism. Boom. GG everybody. So let's start with the good:-The graphics are bright and pleasant and the leader screens are really beautifully animated. Just incredible character work went into these leaders. -The sound effects and music are very nice and atmospheric (though not as good as Civ V)-The culture and tech Eureka bonuses provide a whole new level of strategy and planning. Early planning will definitely have huge optimizing effects down the line if you know what you're doing. -Barbarians are a much greater threat in the early game, which is great. This allows you to farm experience and build an army to use against your neighbors if you want. -City State bonuses are fantastic and very well explained. Maintaining allied status with specific City States that suit the Victory condition you're aiming for will be very worth while.-I love the new policy system. Being able to change your government and swap out your policies is a very gratifying level of management. -I like the district system well enough, though I don't think I planned my districts optimally. They take a lot of time to build and production seems really hard to get in this game. Maybe it was my start.-Religion is more complex, but not well explained. I'll check the Civilopedia to better understand it. -All in all the game succeeds in providing that addictive ""One More Turn"" feeling that we all expect from Civ.   The Bad (There's a lot):-Bad programming! I did a standard map size with 6 Civs I think. One of the AIs was my same Civ! When there's 19 to choose from! Come on!-Fewer options. Not even an Earth map! That's a Civ standard!-The new movement system is just frustrating and makes the early game drag out way too long. You really can't chase down barbarians because the damn Terrain is just too difficult to traverse.-The UI sucks. It provides both too much information and too little. For instance, you keep building these improvements for your districts, but there is no way that I can tell to check if they actually improve your yields! You can;t seem to easily check the yields on either your districts or Wonders! And they removed the City Screen completely! Instead of having one nice informative screen that tells you what your City is doing, they make you click through small icons at the bottom of the UI that are a pain to work through.-AI seems pretty weak. The only Victory they seemed to be aiming for was Religious (though they were very aggressive with that). Otherwise they completely left me alone.Never declared war. Never sent a spy. Nothing.-The Amenity system. Ugh. I don't know why Happiness got such a bad rap. It was much better and more strategic than this mechanic. With Global Happiness you had to consider very carefully whether or not to start new cities or start wars. With Civ VI it's just a pain to keep ammenities rolling in, and it requires the very expensive Entertainment distrct.-City growth...maybe I was not playing well but it seemed really difficult to grow my cities and get enough production to feel like I was truly progressing. I seemed to always be hitting a ceiling and could not figure out how to optimize my cities even with fully loaded districts and trade routes. Gold was the only thing that seemed easy to grow.  -As bogged down as I felt, I was light years ahead of the AI! They don;t seem to have any good strategies for city growth or scientific advancement. I feel like the AI does not know how to take advantage of the Eureka boosts. I know I was playing on a low difficulty but some of the AIs were still stuck in the Rennaissance by the time I hit the Modern Era. I never felt remotely challenged.-Buggy. I have opened this game 4 times. I have had to force close it twice.-This is a small complaint, but the cultural borders are straight lines and hard angles that hug the hexed map. Remember in Civ V and IV they were nice organic curves that grew and changed as your culture expanded. It was way mroe immersive and dynamic. -The art style makes the map cluttered and chaotic. It is much harder to keep track of your units and way easier to click on the wrong thing which just makes gameplay less fluid and enjoyable.-Overall, even though there are a lot of new complexities added to this franchise, the game somehow feels more hollow than its predecessors.I don;t know what to say, it just doesnt feel as satisfying to play as any of the Civs before it.With all that said, I will keep playing it. I bought the $ 80 Digital Deluxe version, so I am expecting the game to vastly improve with expansions and updates. It just seems like what is there is not tuned well enough to expand on yet. The game needs serious tweaking, and frankly I will not be uninstalling Civ V anytime soon. And because of that I cannot recommend this game to seasoned Civ fans like myself."

In comparison to the Civ5 it has a whole new aesthetic and art-style which looks brand new, smooth, and clean. There are some changes in terms of playing features, however, feels more immersive and connected, especially when discussing with other AI civilization leaders in game. With the new addition of leader's agendas, it gives a greater understanding of their motives and personalities when playing and really helps if you want to specifically annoy or remain at peace with specific AI leaders. For older Civ players it can take some getting use to, but doesn't take long to figure out after playing around with it for a bit. Overall, I recommend this game! With the new look and features, it is clean, smooth, and fun to play on your own and with friends!!"

The new Research systems for Technology and Civics are intriguing with their special bonus triggers.  The Spying system also is interesting and provides a good 'Risk versus Reward' gambling opportunity.  I like the way Great Leaders are earned in a competitive manner and their background biographies are a welcome educational side benefit.  World Wonders now are created separately from the City cores and, when completed, are given a special multi-directional foundation-through-final wonder visual presentation. Once you play Civ VI,  am pretty sure you will place this high on your ""One More Turn"" or ""Just 5 More Minutes"" list."

The series seems to get more shallow as they go along.  First there was sacrifices made to increase playability for multiplayer, then recycling content to continue producing expansion packs, now to broaden the playerbase there has been too much simplification that takes the fun out of managing your civilization.  It's starting to feel like Civilization Revolution which is very unfortunate.  All of this has ruined one of the greatest aspects of the game; replayability.  Returning depth to the managment aspect would increase the quality of Civilization by a lot."

I'm going to start with the negatives first, because even though I absolutely love this game it still has it's flaws.NEGATIVE:* Pricing. It is a point that many people before me have brought up, and many people will after me.   It is absolutely insane how expensive this gets when buying all additional content. I hope that this is something that we will not see more of in future titles.* Dialogue, or lack thereof.  I have only played Civ V and Civ VI, and one thing I cherished from Civ V is the recorded voice lines everytime a Civ talked to you. Also the text dialogue gets repetetive quick.* World Congress.   An aspect I certainly miss from Civ V is the ability to ""down vote"" a resolution.    And also Embargo.   I feel that there is certainly a shortage of fun resolutions.*Grievances and Denouncing  This is an amazing addition to the game, however, many a times have I had a Surprise War declared on me, and I believe it is then my right to exterminate that civ. So I do. Aaaand get 150 grievances against me from every civ. Then denounced. Then war. I think that sums up the negatives for me personally.This game is amazing fun, and you easily lose track of time. Having to plan out your cities or your warfare while keeping citizens safe and happy is the key concept and something that everybody does different. I would definitely say that I prefer this art and graphic style over Civ 5's but that's just me.I play with mods and cheats, because no game is ever good enough for me without me being able to act a God, and getting to play the game my way and my rules just adds to the fun. Civ 6 Vanilla is something I rarely play but when I do I get my ass handed to me. But it's still fun.Like I said, this is my first review so I apologize that it's not very good.To Summarize; Buy this game. Be it on sale or not, it's extremely fun and you completely lose track of your surroundings. You probably wont regret it, unless you have commitment issues. 'Cause you gotta commit to this game."

But after taking it up recently i found out that's not the case. First of all CIV VI has made all victories other than domination more interesting. Especially Religion and Culture, where you have a lot more to do to get yourself to victory. Religion has more units, and you can do religious combat. And a lens and just more info on the screen that help you spread the way you want to. Only complaint on religion is that you can't spread using your own trade routes, you only export pressure if they trade with you.Culture has also gotten a lot more depth. You can now have a lot of different types of great works like writings, arts, music, artifacts. Museums can be organized with same art from different artists to get a theming bonus. They also added the archeological museum that is a mini-game of it's own, where you have to build arcologists to bury up artifacts from around the map. Later you can also make national parks, with forces you to give up having improvements on 4 tiles to get tourism. And in the coming DLC ""Gathering storm"" they are going to add rockbands as an addition. All this are great improvement to what was very basic victoriesEverything you do is more impactful. Districts force you to think more about city placement, and that also makes city placement more important than ever before. Actual placement needed for wonders forces you to aim for certain ones. Because hard to fit them all and some have really strict requirements. Leader traits are a lot more powerfull instead of just passives. Thay can change your whole playstyle (Some leaders more than others). And that is really interesting. Especially when you play with friends on random leader and you end up with one you have not played much or at all.I think what mostly makes people mad is the A.I and the missing features from previous titles (for example Railroads and World Congress). And i've been playing this since release and i've felt it somewhat lacking. Like something was missing but don't know what. I'm just hoping Gathering storm will give us a more complete experience. And if not, don't stop there and give us huge DLC's. Because i think that this is possibly the best Civ game out there right now, but it's flawed."

Civilization VI is to a fault an addictive production. The longer we play, the more interesting it gets. One more turn and one more turn and we can play and play endlessly, and the production is captivating like in the old days. Civ VI resembles the fourth installment, but in comparison to it and other parts, it is distinguished by extensive micromanagement and other elements that greatly diversify the gameplay. Great music, eye-catching graphics and extensive gameplay that requires constant thinking about what to do in a given turn.A huge leap forward from average Civ V and the unfortunate Beyond Earth.Civ VI is still and all a great game. It's a title that never gets old and is just as playable today as it was five years ago. It is perfect, completely absorbing and still has the one more round syndrome.Pros.+ Still addicting and complex strategy+ Clear interface+ Renewed urban planning+ Differences between managers.Cons.- Too much micromanagement- The learning curve can be brutal for newcomers.Civ VI is the biggest, most beautiful and addictive incarnation of the long-running game series.If you haven't played Civilization yet - it's worth your time by giving the game a chance.As for whether or not it is better, it is a matter of taste.8.8/10"

I've played Civilization games continually since the mid 90's, and while I have stopped playing games of Civ IV due to slowdown creep, making it eventually unplayable and stopped playing Civ V games due to unavoidable gamebreaking bugs, never before this game have I stopped a game out of pure boredom.Designed like a mobile game, so that anyone could pick it up and play immediately and not have to worry about making poor decisions. There are no decisions to be made anymore. You're driving down the railroad that Civ VI has laid out for you.Also, Civs and leaders are now fully specialized towards a specific win condition, so no more will you play any civilization through the ages with the same goal in sight. No. Now you play civ A if you're doing scientific victory, because the game is designed that way, OR you play civ B if you're going for conquest, because they're got the vastly superior and useful units and war buildings. No choice, just follow the railroad track.Gameplay-wise, you never do anything but wait for building countdowns. You never have any grand plans, overarching or even sub-goals to achieve. You fight some barbarians here and there, wait for workers to make a field here and orchard there, wait some more for another stop on the dumbed down research railroad track to finish, then wait for some building or other to finish and on and on. There's not once a feeling of excitement about pressing the ""end turn"" button to realize some goal you're trying to achieve. You're just going through the motions, quickly seeing through the game's illusion of choice and just as quickly losing interest.Visually, the game lacks any progression through the ages. This is something Civilization has managed to do since the second game, where you clearly see your empire grow and develop. In Civ VI, everything looks the same, like you are the leader of a fisherman's village, a shepherd's hut and a farmer's community. Your cities never really change, they never really grow or develop with the times. They look like the same huts in 4000 BC as they do in 1000 AD. If you are a fan of the previous Civilization games' freedom to forge a story out of your own designs and choices, you will also hate what Civ VI has done to ""streamline"" the gameplay. It strips every possibility of you making the ""wrong"" choice, and in so doing also strips you of any agency to make your own destiny with your civilization. It's Civilization light, a high-powered mobile game based on real Civilization games.If you're craving a turn-based strategy game, any turn-based strategy game, pick up Civilization V with expansions instead. If you've played literally every other Civ game and still want more, ONLY pick this title up at 60% off or more. It's a poor excuse for Civilization and is utterly uninspired and forgettable."

Add to that the end game is more boring than previous civ games . Another noteworthy downside is map size its smaller than 5 and while discovering a new civ in CIV 5 was exciting this time around is annoying since there is not a whole lot of space to expand peacfully your empire  So is a no recommendation for me at least until they fix those 3  major issuesUpdate : Decided to change to  positive after GS update. More maps and civs is always good and more importantly the game adds much needed gameplay depth with GS expansion . AI is still bad and larger maps are still needed imo ( though that can be rectified with map mods )

The fast build was fun in the first game, but you were always putting out more builders instead of actually buildings or military units, and while they can get their ""build limit"" upgraded, it's still tedious to keep building them. Workers on Civ5 and CivBE are definitely better.2) Maps. This is probably the WORST FREAKING THING in the game, even worse than AI. You are there, setting map on HUGE, and after two or three turns... YEAH, YOU GUESS IT, YOU HAVE ANOTHER 3 CIV NEAR YOU, AND THEY ARE ALL GOING TO DECLARE WAR ON YOU. What's the point of having HUGE maps if you can't build cities where the hell you want because near you the other civs just keep spamming Settlers? And don't get me started on island types of map: they are my favorite type of map, and I love sending out my navy, but how can I send out my navy if you put me MILES away from the sea? I don't pretend to have my capital just on the sea, but at least to have it near, for a second city. NOT FOR A FIFTH. Map generator is STUPID, the one on Civ5 and CivBE was better.3) Research trees. It was a nice addiction to the game, having two trees and having the way to cut the research time in half. It WAS nice. But hey, you have to work your ass off to made it (as it should be), but the game decides that AI players have ALL the research times halved. Because why not?Am I gonna keep playing this game when I own both Civ5 and CivBE? Yes.Am I gonna keep swearing and raging against this stupid game when I play? Yes.Am I gonna keep telling you all to stay away from this game until they fix it? ♥♥♥♥ YES.EDIT: found out why the maps suck so bad. Small, Medium and Standard are bigger than their Civ5 sizes, Civ5 Large is way bigger than Civ6 Large, AND MOST OF ALL, CIV5 HUGE IS WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY BIGGER THAN CIV6 HUGE. To give you an idea, Civ6 Huge is basically Civ5 Large-sized. Yep. And you have to play in that map with 11 AI players plus up to 24 city-states.Way to go, Firaxis.POST GATHERING STORM EDIT: finally I can say that I'm starting to enjoy this game. Bigger maps, nice events a better AI (still stupid sometimes, but that's ok, it's not bas as it was 2/3 years ago). Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm added a lot of things and fixed even more things so it's getting better. New civs are always welcome, of course, and Civ DLCs aren't disappointing. I kinda wish there were more of them though, and since they're going also with civs like Australia and Canada, I think they finally could add Italy (instead of keeping it ""trapped"" into Roman Empire)."

They really have fixed some of the major issues and the game is quite enjoyable now. The AI is a lot better and victories are now more balanced (although Science is now the easiest one. On one game I went for Culture Victory from the start, but still ended up winning the Science Victory after seeing that I wasn't fast enough with the Culture and changed my mind at beginning of the last third of the game.). The game was now good enough so I bothered to really dig into all the features of the game, and I gotta say that I now ever prefer this over Civ 5.My only negatives are that the mid-game can get a bit boring for some time, but it gets better towards the enf-game. Also, the DLCs seem rather lacking and expensive. Do note that I don't own any of them, but they have received rather negative reviews, but maybe I'll buy some of them and see for myself.I can really recommend this now."

But if you want a good looking game too than Civ VI is a good option. But back to the important stuff the gameplay. With the new district system the developer find a new way to improve the game in a good way. First it's a bit strange compared to older Civs, because now you can't build everything in your city without caring about what you build. The new districts have to build on fields around your city. The same applies for the wonders now. There is also a population limit for the districts. So you have to be more strategical to deside what kind of city you want. I really like that improvement. You can specialize your cities and have to deside carefully. Feels different but in a good way. Same i can say about city-states. There are now city-states that improve your districts and come with different buffs if you hold the most envoys. For example you could build a special field improvement etc. That also makes the city-states more important for you. Well the AI is still not the best, but it's getting better.Another thing that works still good in Civ VI is the way you could win this game. War is not the only option to win. With the district and the city-state system that works in my opinion much better.But there are also a few things i dont like. For example the loadtime of the rounds in late game took very long. I personally like to play on big maps with many countries... There are options to reduce this, but this works in my opinion not very good. I couldn't see much changes here. Well it's still much better compared to Humankind, but still a problem.I'm also not a fan of the most scenarios they bring out. Feels a bit like they rename units, change some mechanics and that's all. I miss scenarios like the world war or future scenario in Civ IV, where they add new units and buildings. I also would like to see more unit options in late game. Everyone runs the same units. I know it wasn't much better in Civ IV and V, but maybe they could change that in VII. On the other hand there are mods too.There are some options to improve you gameplay too. For example you could choose extra mods for your normal gameplay like stronger environmental disasters and many more. That adds another reason to replay.And like always i really love the quotes. What is Civ without them?All in all i can recommand it, if you love the old Civs too. But the ""small Dlcs"" you should better buy in sale."

Everything looked very ""cartoonish."" Once I started playing, however, I immediately fell in love.  The graphics actually make the game very playable by not taking too much processing power.  Sometimes 5 and even Beyond Earth became too frustrating to play those larger games with more computer/human players.  The Civ team was very smart in not putting too much effort into the graphics by making sure this is playable on most hardware, even making it simple enough to easily put it on a mobile platform.As for game mechanics, this version introduces a lot and re-introduces what we love about previous versions.  New to the franchise, they brought districts to the map, limited actions for builders, policy card decks, envoys, super enhanced diplomacy, and culture ""researching."" Then they made sure to include features that I love about previous versions like religion, choosing government, rebels, trade, and natural wonders.  This makes the base game already feel really complete.  It's hard to imagine what they might include in the expansions, other than new civs and maps. Or maybe I'm just blindsighted at how awesome the game already is.For long time Civilization players, this is the game we've always wanted."

But the game is simply not good enough to deserve a good grade, although it's quite addictive.Here are the main issues:- The first, enormous one, is that the game constantly crashes. It's incredible that paying so much money for this game we're not even getting the bare minimum: a functionning game.- The second, even with new gen PCs, the game is extremely slow when playing on larger than standard maps. That's incredible to me. In Civ IV I only played in immense map modes, impossible to do so here.- The third, middle to late game is very boring, and one needs to really be into optimizing to find some fun after medieval times are passed and borders kind of settle down.- If you go for an expansion game, it does not get boring in middle to late game, but it does get painful having to deal with many many cities. - The fifth, diplomacy is a really really poor experience in this game. It lacks depths, it's repetitive. Every game kind of feels the same in that regard.- One of the reasons why the game is so poor in the middle and late games is that there are no events. So the game completely lacks interactiveness: choosing a religion is just about the bonuses, so is choosing a political system. It does not change much to what will happen to your civ in the long run. It plays into the repetitiveness of the game. Put simply, the game lacks lore dramatically, the difference between democracy and fascism are just different bonuses...For all these reasons, I can't recommend buying the game unless you're a historical CIV fan. But even being one, you will be disappointed."

Nowhere near the goodness of Civ V: BNW, and infinitely more frustrating than any other 4X out there.The biggest problem with the game is the AI. I get that Firaxis can't make a good AI, so they let them cheat in order to stay competitive (ignoring happiness, money, and warmongering problems; starting with additionally units; having more army damage than you; and so on), but the AGENDAS thing they added COMPLETELY F UCKING RUIN EVERYTHING.Almost every civ gets pi ssed at you for settling within 25 tiles of them, but the map generation is so trash that you actually spawn within that limit of multiple civs each and every game, even when you set the map size larger and the player count lower, there's a script that mandates civs spawn a certain distance away, meaning all you did was make more land on the outer edges of the map while maintaining the civ density in the center. So, they get pi ssed at you for even existing.THEN they get pi ssed at you for:- Not having a strong Navy in a landlocked environment.- Not having enough cities despite you, as a non-AI, having to deal with issues the AI doesn't.- Not having a strong Army despite being on an Oceanic map.- Being a warmonger even though you never declared a single war (only survived wars declared on you).- Not having a high enough population/city ratio despite being seiged constantly by people with the above issues.- Not being as scientifically advanced despite the constant wars.- Not being cultured enough despite the constant wars.an, my personal favorite,- ""Just plain doesn't like you.""Like, who the F UCK thought this was an okay system?! It's the worst thing I've EVER SEEN in a 4X. All it does is make ALL the AI in any given match go to war with you multiple times through the match, with almost no penalties to them for doing so (unless you take them out, but then you're REALLY the bad guy of the match, even if the civ you took out was literally Hitler. Imagine if the real world was upset that the Allies won WW2 because it meant squashing a civ.)After all this, there's the dumbing down of the UI and in-depth options, like City Screens and Citizen Management to name a big one.I desperately wanted a BNW equivalent DLC for this game, something that made it good and redeemed it like what happened to Civ V, but that never came.2/10, I want my money back, and an apology from Firaxis for making such trash after the glory of Civ V: BNW------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Optional material:Here's what happened in my first game of Civ 6:> Play with friend, spawn not too far from each other. We think it's luck because in civ V you could spawn on opposite sides of the world.> Within 10 turns meet three other civs within Nuclear Missile distance. We wonder what they did to map generation that allowed for such a high density of civs in one area.> Have Harold declare war on me, despite our friendly relations, because I didn't have a navy in the middle of a Pangaea map (landlocked and impossible to have one). [He was also landlocked, btw, so massive hypocrite there.]> Fend him off with my smol army in a mountain pass because AI is dumb and didn't compute to go around the 3-tile range.> I get called an early warmonger by Cleopatra for this, and she never lets this go.> After the war, Cleo's angry at me because I have a tiny army. Naturally, this means war. [Ah ♥♥♥♥♥, here we go again.]> Survive two wars within 80 turns, and still somehow on top with tech and culture (because I could trade and deal with friend).> Cleo and Harold fall in love over mutual hatred of me. Go to war with other civs in the meantime. Germany starts getting jealous of my shiny things that he doesn't have (even though we were friends for the longest time).> Cleo declares war on me IMMEDIATELY the turn our peace treaty ended.  I decide to squash this warmonger before she gets too big. I'm doing the world a favor, here. She's warred with nearly everyone by now.> I take one city, friend takes another. Big mistake, since now the world hates us for kneecapping her destructive powers. Joint wars are declared on us by Harold, Germany (Barbarossa), and Pericles. We had to stop with Cleo to protect ourselves from the Axis, but she's def out of the game at this point.> The war is beyond easy for my superior tech units, rolling over their pitiful arrow carts in my tanks. Eventually, they saw their 300 units were nothing compared to my 4, and wanted peace. Sure.> Cleo is still mad at me for having a small army, but my face when my now 5 tanks and 4 arty could wipe out her TWO arrow carts in the blink of an eye.> She declares war on me. The AI actually thinks because she had produced up to 12 arrow carts that her military could stand against my <12 tanks and arty. I wipe her military in one turn, and laugh. Afraid of further pi ssing off the other civs (America was nearing Bombers, monkaS) I didn't take any cities, and eventually peace was declared.> Nearing a science victory, Germany and Teddy declare joint war on me because I'm settled too close to them and they're jealous of my shinies still. Teddy was locked behind other civ's borders because that's how the map generation works in this game: peopel are too close to each other to even traverse the area.> Cleo declares war on me. This is, maybe, the 5th time this game she's done this, and for the 5th time I mop the floor with her, as she still only has ARROW CARTS AGAINST MY END-GAME UNITS. I fire my lazars and liquify her carts in a single turn, again, but at this point I was going to win soon and decided to drop...  on her.> Cleo gets nuked back into the stone ag...  er, she was already at the stone age somehow, so I guess she just got nuked.> Despite seeing Egypt get the Japanese treatment, Teddy and Barbarossa evidently wanted a taste of the Fallout life. I obliged, then won a scientific victory shortly afterwards.It was a slow, gruelling, and unbelievably infuriating game, but I was glad it was over. After tweaking some .ini files to see if I could fix the starting spawn distance (didn't work), I tried to play another game with same friend and the SAME ♥♥♥♥♥ happened in that game, just with different civs."

Two expansions in it's amazing, and I've gotten my money's worth easily.  There are still some goofy bugs, nothing game breaking, but I'd like to see them fixed before I call it a tightly revised game.  That said it disappoints me to say that the next time a Civ game comes out I'm not buying it until all the content is released, and the game is 'done'.  I'm sold on the civ franchise, but playing the first two iterations of the game is like beta testing it for them.  I'm going to wait until civ 7's several years old before buying it, and to Firaxis' credit: with civ 6 I won't be anxious to move on.  For posterity I'm leaving the review I previously wrote down here, approach it as a two year old review:The game, despite its fantastic vision and wonderful components is unplayably broken.  Not from balance, though it is shockingly unbalanced, but because it's an amniotic mess of untested garbage.  I gave the game a try because I heard that after a few patches it was playable, but the past two patches have worsened it significantly.It pains me to say that such an inspiring and beautiful game's not worth it, but the fact is it's so overly ladden with bugs it's not playable.  I've spent hours in the past couple of days trying to literally, LITERALLY get the game to start, because the latest update is causing many people to be unable to access the basic game.With a little TLC this game could be great, but the company making it doesn't care to beta test the game or something.  I feel like I should be getting payed to troubleshoot this game more often than not.Firaxis: have some pride in your workProspective customers reading this review: don't buy this game; if you love the civ series, unfortunately the franchise needs some free market tough love."

I've really tried to like it, but the game is just no fun.I like to play on huge maps with huge empires, but the civilizations in Civ6 are so close by that you have no choice but to go to war after 3 or 4 cities. A war you basically cannot lose. And once you have defeated the AI's directly around you, there really is no reason to stop. You have the armies and AI is truly pitiful in its defense. Any other strategy feels like giving yourself a handicap on purpose.If the fights were fun, it might not matter that much, but they are not. Moving your army around is just slow and boring. No fun at all.So all games feel alike, with no challenge or sense of accomplishment. Why play?"

The UI and overworld are more vibrantly detailed. Whereas, the leader animations are accompanied by a lackluster backdrop compared to detailed scenery in Civilization V. The science tree, culture tree, and civic cards are a vast improvement upon the previous installment, and allow more flexibility for players to accompany the more volatile environmental changes.Tile placement vastly surpasses the previous installment. The only drawback to the improvements of making tile placement more consequential is the lack of opportunity to build tall. This could easily be resolved by allowing additional layers of tiles over a city when certain conditions, techs, or cultural tenants are met. Though, I do like that expansion is actually encouraged in civilization VI, which makes for a more enjoyable experience, where, conversely building tall was more encouraged, and expanding was penalized. The music has been completely overhauled from previous installment. The music sets the world stage that better engages the player as they take one more turn. Aside from the lack of ability to build tall, the only other issue this museum theming mechanic. Other than that, and the background of the civilization leader animations, all other aspects are vastly improved. Upgrade to Civ VI if you haven't had the change to play. (Or give it another chance if you could not get over some of the major changes to play style favoring expansionism over building tall.)"

The only way the computer could have gotten them is if they given the units free.Same thing goes with barbarians.  They will send out a scout, once the scout sees you it returns to base.  If it gets back the barbarians will ramp up production and attack.  On the surface it seems like a great system, that the barbarians won't attack until its scout reports on you.  Unfortunately as with all other AIs it will be given free units and easily outnumber you within the first 10 turns.If you like playing a warmongering civ you might be able enjoy this game.  But if you stop making units for moment just to make a simple granary you will be outmatched and surrounded.

New game play, mechanics, and well... Civs and stuff (don't wanna spoil it too much). Gotta say I love this one, and dare say it's a huge contender for the title of the best in the series.The changes are pretty dense, but easy to roll into after a few epic fail plays. When you get down to it, they really add to that feel of grand strategy, think big and plan ahead. No two cities are the same, nor feel the same, even if you follow a pattern for them. No pre-made scheme will work; you'll need to adapt and evolve with the round, every few turns. Everything is alive, like never before.I've played the hell outta aggressive Civs and laid waste as I haven't in any other Civ, smirking and maniacal laughing all the way. Terrain matters now more than ever, and will be every war's crunch and glory. The hexed grid means that in every battle, you'd better make the most of the spots you can decently use, or pay in blood for it. I do feel like a military mastermind as I lay siege, city by city, and deal with the consequences. THIS is war.""Passive"" Civs shine too, and well played cultured peace makers and science lovers can be utterly unstoppable. ""You can't kill an idea"" comes to mind every time I play these.Oh and the multi... Oooh the multiplayer. Sooo muuuch fuuun!Yep. Sid also decided to jump into the let's-get-every-dime-outta-player-pockets DLC train with Civs V and it isn't coming off of it in VI. It actually threw in the whole egg basket, chickens, Old McDonald with farm and ea-ea-oh's.If you wanna play this game, the actual complete game, you'll have to chuck out $60 for the shell game (it feels like a fully featured demo), and another $60 for all the DLCs (and that's just so far to date).Another great one, another love of mine gone down the pay-wall drain...

The AI can defend itself a lot better, plus they are more likely to be fond of you rather than just being upset and denouncing you. Diplomacy is a good bit better than Civ V IMO. The agenda system is an improvement, if your not warring Gorgo or Alexander will dislike you so if you're playing peaceful, starting next to them is a challenge.The game is at the right difficulty now IMO. In my recent Emperor game I was going for a Culture victory but fell a bit behind on Science. When I had Field Cannons and Musketmen, Australia invaded me and took me out with their tanks and Artillery. Not only did they have the more advanced tanks, they are ""Army"" tanks, not just single tanks.I also tried to go for a Culture victory on Emperor with Kongo, a powerful Cultural Civ, but I was really struggling. Before I used to have good success at Immortal difficulty, but I got took out fairly early on in my 3 Immortal games so far. I feel like i'll have to get a lot better before stepping up.Civ VI base game is a lot more complete than Civ V with all it's expansions. You can found an Empire rather than just going Tradition, founding 4 cities and rushing Rationalism, which was by far the superior way to go in Civ V. I also like that Spies can steal Money from other Civ's and that you can create rebellions in other Civ's cities. The ability to steal Great Works from other Civ's is nice.So overall, having put over 2000 hours into Civ IV and 849 hours into Civ VI, I say I am definitely content with how Civ VI is and like the direction it is going. IMO when it gets all it's expansions it will be superior to Civ V, and who knows, it could even challenge Civ IV."

It's stupid,weak and unpredictable. - No production queue, no demographics etc. - Tech and cultural trees are nonsense. Developers know that and every single update they try to make it better, but no result till now. IMO it was a bad idea to divide the tech tree. - All ""DLCs"" are garbage till today.

Civ II and its expansions and forks set a new high bar and showed where Civ could go. Civ III was all about trying new things, but whilst I liked it from the start it really needed the Conquests expansion to bring the new systems together, and even then they were still a bit ropey. Civ IV was, until now, my all time favourite, and the BtS expansion is easily the best Civ expansion pack ever. The depth of strategy and systems, and a slightly fussy interface, mean it's not a great one for first-timers, but the joy of Civ is in understanding how everything works as well as using it. Civ V, however, was dire. The vanilla version was so dumbed down I was completing games in three evenings without really thinking about them, and although the expansions helped a lot it still felt like it belonged more on a console (no offence to console gamers but the reason you invest in a super-fast CPU is for games like Civ).  So, knowing that a lot of Civ V's systems were to be ported to VI, along with the new map and city systems that bear a striking resemblance to Endless Legend, I wasn't sure what to expect, and the hefty price tag on the full fat version almost made it the first version I haven't pre-ordered.However! From the first seconds of the beautiful opening sequence I knew this was going to be something a bit special, possibly even as good as Civ IV. The greatest Civs (I, II, IV, forget the forks) are those where all the systems from the map, through city management, to science, diplomacy, religion and war, all work together. Where they jar against each other (III) you end up being forced into making nonsensical decisions and it breaks the immersion. Civ VI, with some early teething problems, absolutely nails this.The map is the star, and the new strategic fulcrum of the game. Firaxis did well to flatter Endless Legend, and there are other parallels that made me worry this would be too much like it, but this is still very distinctively a Civ game. And some people don't like the cartoony style, but I do because it evokes Civ I, we can agree to differ.The new city building system, also borrowed from Endless Legend, works exactly how it should do. It takes a little while to learn how to exploit it to the maximum, but then if you want something you can master in a couple of playthroughs then Civ isn't the game for you. The science system has thankfully been un-dumbed from Civ V and the structure of the tech tree has some nice nods back to Civs I and II, and the eureka system adds a bit more fun. Religion, one of the better systems in V, has largely been ported from it, and now fits better with the other systems. And culture is a similarly good port, although the culture victory is far too easy (turn if off if you're definitely going for any other victory condition). The two weaker systems were war and diplomacy, but the patches and DLC have done a lot to fix the balancing issues - even though at the moment I'd still rather not start near China (and for those wondering, Ghandi is still a warmongering ****). It's still not 100% perfect, but no system in any Civ game ever was (anyone remember diplomats in Civ I?), the point is that they all work together in a way that only the best Civs manage. So why does it have the edge over Civ IV? Partly because the visuals and sound are beautiful - the main music in the game is the traditional song Hard Times Come Again No More, and I love the way it develops into a crescendo in the late game. And partly because the late game is now worth slogging through - and yes, the cinematic ending and stats have been restored. The new map adds to the fun to be had here, so rather than just rushing towards your choice of world-ending weapon it's actually worth building a balanced force, even if you're not going for a domination victory. And it's also worth building thermonuclear weapons even just to try one and reload just to see the pretty new fireworks.  So as a Civ veteran I'd say ignore the negative reviews. If you're a long time fan who wished Civ V had never happened then you should find all is forgiven. If you're new to the series then just be aware that you're making a long term investment - Civ is supposed to towards the harder end of 4X strategies but it's nowhere near as impenetrable as it seems at first. Take a few games to learn it and keep experimenting until you find a playing style that suits you.Civ VI claims the Civ crown, and reclaims its place as the best 4X ever."

This is not yet the greatest Civ ever, but it has potential.Good:There are plenty of new design tweaks and features.Social policies are researched with culture, as a second tech tree.Governments provide slots for policies, which can be interchanged according to situational needs.Terrain improvements are made by consumable builder units.Some world wonders have pretty specific requirements, requiring long-range planning.Barbarians are much stronger and more aggressive.Trade units are more important than ever.As with every installment in this franchise, there is vast replayability.Mixed:City districts ""unstack"" the cities, prompting more careful city planning, but the restrictions can feel heavy-handed and artificial.Religion is fun but not strong enough to matter much except to lose the game unexpectedly, and there is no way to recover from losing the initial race to found a religion.Boosts for technology and social policies are a nice way to create incentives like mini-quests, but they can be pretty hit-or-miss in actual gameplay.Regional bonuses to production and amenities extend to nearby cities, requiring a compact cluster of cities in the later game.Production costs of new districts and cities increase dramatically as you build them.City states provide unique bonuses to their dearest allies, but the bonuses are not well-balanced.City states sometimes claim large chunks of the map, leaving no way to recover this territory short of direct conquest.Compared to Civ V, the AI has gotten better at commanding military units, both by sending them to attack in waves, as well as killing off the most vulnerable enemy units. However this is more than nullified by the terrible AI performance at the strategic level.Bad:The AI is very poor overall. By the mid to late game, AI opponents seem to lose steam entirely. Even at high difficulty levels, it feels like playing in sandbox mode by the end.AI opponents are given egregious cheats, especially early on.There are fewer techs in the tech tree and fewer upgrades for military units.The unique traits of civilizations are poorly balanced.It is hard to find a difficulty setting that feels just right.Not enough attention was paid, in general, to balancing the game.The game has become more buggy with recent updates.Unit movement across the map is too slow.Diplomacy is a no-fun, lose-lose in this game. Warmongering penalties are too harsh.Despite all the changes, gameplay feels remarkably similar to Civ V."

The changes made to districts and city building as well as the policy system and the fact that city states finally have an actually considerable military are all long overdue additions to the game. The only thing which stayed the same is the abysmally horrible and mindbogglingly cheating AI. Compared to the current state of Civ 5, the AI of Civ 6 is even worse.In multiplayer with fleshy opponents though, Civ 6 truly shines, and although it still remains to be the fastest and easiest win condition to just steamroll over any other plather not entirely focused on military might, there is a good amount of interesting win conditions which make the game also very fun for peaceful settlers.Civ 6 is probably a lot faster than any of its predecessors and save for intensive warfare, a full multiplayer game should not take any longer than 4-5 hours.Personally I am really liking it, but it still has a very long way to go to even be remotely able to topple Civ 5 from its currently very well-polished state.Rise and Fall, the first addon, actually made matters worse and more convoluted instead of actually adding the the depth of the game and presently should be skipped entirely.A great title for Civ fans, but all the same, don't expect it to be better than Civ 5, for it is not and probably never will be, even with further polishing."

I've always enjoyed the empire building throughout the eras and this version continues my enjoyment of this series.  This review includes updates through the Rise and Fall DLC.  As with the more recent entries, the DLC makes a significant impact on the game and I expect future DLC will continue to strengthen the gameplay. For newcomer to the series, Civ is a turn-based strategy game.  In the beginning, you must start building your empire from scratch, gathering resources to build, expand, and protect your empire.  As you explore the world, you'll find new resources while your technology improves to allow new structures and new military units and even great wonders of the world.  You will meet other cultures and leaders.  The question is whether you can build a civilization that the stand the test of time.For veterans of the series, Civ VI biggest change from previous versions was how the cities are built.  In Civ VI, each new building, zone or improvement has to go on a specific tile. This changes some of the city building stratgy that leads to a more focused build for the cities which even impacts the type of Wonders you may want at a particular location. This sort of decision making is what makes Civ VI amazing.  But as with new changes, it has caused a bit of a drawback.  At this point, the AI doesn't do well with this added dimension.  Even at the Deity leve (most difficult), the AI is still overmatched. However, the patches and DLCs continue to improve the game and the AI and I believe by the end, Civ VI will be even greater than the final version of Civ V."

Gameplay elements introduced in Brave New World, such as Tourism and trade routes, make a return while new elements like the Civics tree and AI agendas provide new challenges and opportunities for playing the game of history. It’s a shame that Civilization VI is so fundamentally flawed that these new elements feel ill thought out, and basic mechanics are suddenly far more clunky and annoying than before. As of right now, at launch, I would not recommend Civilization VI.Civilization VI is undoubtedly a very pretty game, especially when there aren’t any battles being fought. The level of detail is some of the greatest I’ve seen in a 4X, with your city centers growing and evolving with the technological era and units looking civilization-appropriate. The strategic map is gorgeous; the colors are bright and vibrant while the terrain and resource drawings are lush with detail. The leader portraits and animations, as well as the victory movies, are very pretty and much more satisfying than Civ V’s stiff images and animations.Unfortunately, Civilization VI doesn’t know how to pace itself. Researching technologies and civic policies is simply too fast. Part of the problem is that the standard Civilization tech tree is now split in two, and researching both at once causes you to advance at a far faster pace than your economy can take advantage of. With the new Eureka mechanic, it’s astonishingly easy to start researching Future Tech before you get your first nuclear weapon. Resource yields from tiles, improvements, and buildings are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you’ll probably spend most of your time focusing on gold or faith so you can just buy everything instead of wasting dozens of turns building them. I suspect the decision to make buildings give flat yield bonuses was so that policy cards and strategically placing districts and wonders would have greater impact on the gameplay, but it was a dumb decision because production now takes forever, meaning you can easily skip over entire eras of buildings and units and end up with Crossbowmen and Jet Fighters in the same war.And even if you buy an army, moving units is far more difficult than it needs to be. Often times you’ll be told your unit lacks the movement to go up a hill or through woods, and no unit can cross a river tile if they had moved previously in the turn, no matter how much spare movement they have. It slows exploration and warfare down tremendously, and it shouldn’t surprise you if you cannot uncover a full Standard-sized world before you reach the Atomic Era and get access to the Earth Satellite national project which reveals the entire map. It doesn’t help that you can’t build roads without an expensive unit, making moving within your own empire just as difficult as moving in the wilderness.The end result is that Civilization VI feels both very slow and very fast. You’ll race through history, snatching up technologies and civics far ahead of the AI, but struggle to build an empire as your production queue bottles up thanks to low yields, even with helpful civic cards. You could easily, and will probably be forced to, bypass most unit and building choices to focus on achieving one victory condition. And in a single-player game, it will probably feel like a completely undeserved victory.The single-player AI is terrible. There’s no other word for it. It can’t make strategic city placement choices, it can’t match a player in terms of technology or civics, it can’t even fight a war despite outproducing most players in terms of units because all it does is throw outdated, obsolete units into range of your cities and wait for you to kill them. And in every game, there is at least one AI player that thinks it’s a city-state and focuses on pumping out units to protect its capital, even if it produces a settler. It’s a terrible AI, and the only way it could possibly be competitive is by cheating at yields to increase production, but since it would still make terrible strategic choices it would still be a horribly easy opponent. Surprisingly, early-game Barbarians are more of a threat than the AI civilizations. By default, they behave like Raging Barbarians in Civ V. They keep the Ancient and Classical Eras interesting to play through if you can’t find other civilizations to pound on. It’s a shame that they never improve though, and it’s a hassle to find that they continue to spawn outside owned tiles throughout the game since they’re just a nuisance by Medieval. Speaking of owned tiles, spreading your borders is incredibly slow and the art for districts and improvements is disappointing. You’ll never see an Endless Legend-like conurbation, densely packed with buildings and sprawling across entire regions. Everything will be squeezed together, and it will look like a small town until it suddenly springs skyscrapers in the Modern Era, amidst fields and mines and wonders. Culture growth is slow no matter what you build, and even now I’m not entirely sure what causes borders to spread. You’ll always be wondering whether you should cannibalize an improvement or resource, or spend gold to expand. This is probably to balance the fact that cities now sprawl out over all tiles, so that you have to focus individual cities down to a few districts, but it means your empire will rarely expand to an impressive scale.A lot of Civilization VI’s new mechanics aren’t explained, even if you set the advisor level to “New to Civilization VI” in the options menu. Besieged a city? Great; why and for what purpose? So defenses and defenders don’t heal, but nothing explains it, not even the Civopedia. Not enough amenities for your city? You have no idea where they went and little idea which ones they’re benefitting from. Civilization VI holds your hand through the most basic mechanics, but won’t explain any of the more complex ones it introduces.The UI is a major factor in obscuring information useful to the player. While it is a little cleaner than Civ V’s, it gets rid of a lot of information and shortcuts to more detailed information. Wondering how many amenities you have and if you can trade any of them away? There’s no list of them. Trying to see the attack range of your ranged units? Unless an enemy is actually in range you can’t see it or see the effect of any terrain on it. Getting told your cities are getting unhappy because you’re lacking amenities? The actual information as to why and the rate at which they are approaching rebellion is hidden behind several buttons because the devs didn’t want it cluttering up your city screen. Actually building things in your cities, telling your trade units to move between cities or start new trade routes, and even switching between selected units is a chore. Buttons for lists and views are spread to all four corners of the screen, forcing players to focus on all the farthest corners if you need more detailed information. And most of the information is too wordy and dismayingly uninformative. It’s hidden away because it clutters the screen, but most of it is so much empty numbers and statistics that finding the data relevant to you in any given turn is more difficult than waging a war. People say that vanilla Civilization V was a mediocre, stripped down game compared to Beyond the Sword Civilization IV. I actually enjoyed vanilla Civ V, and the expansions only made it better. Vanilla Civilization VI is a legitimate mess. The AI is like a child, the UI is a chore, and the game’s mechanics actively fight you when they’re not hidden and unclear. And that’s without touching on the game’s sense of humor, which injects itself into every sequence of text longer than seven words. It might or might not be to your liking, much like the game itself. But I would say it’s not worth the price."

Sadly, when put together, these elements make the game feel like you're playing ""Sid Meier's: Civilization Jr.""For now, the DLC situation is frustrating bordering on insulting. Individual civilizations should NOT cost $5.00 USD or any localized equivalent. I felt a sense of sick irony, when rewatching the opening cinematic. A moving video, illustrating the pinnacles of human achievement, which once, literally brought me to tears and convinced me to buy the game. Now when I watch it, I can't help but reflect on Firaxis/2K's greed, and how they are trying to nickel and dime their player base. The lofty ambitions of that intro video feel a bit insincere now.If and when some major DLC is released and bundled in an affordable package, I may change this review. Until then, Civilization 5 is a much, much, better and more complete experience."

They have become nonsensical and frustrating to deal with. I don't play this game to be frustrated. I play to be challenged and to express creativity, but the absurd AI actions around diplomacy have come to make this very difficult. Examples of this include:1. Surprise wars with no diplomatic repercussions, either once or repeatedly by the same characters.2. Nonsensical peace options, such as taking a city from a player that has declared a surprise war on you and then becoming the target of an emergency. How does this make sense?3. Random denunciations with very little contact with the character. This one really breaks reason.4. Denunciations or demands from characters centuries after the last peace deal. Complaints that a former city of theirs is ""occupied"" when it was the transfer was agreed upon in a peace deal.5. Very little relationship building. Character relationships often feel predestined from the start.6. Overall, character relationships feel childish and stagnant. This is certainly not representative of any real diplomacy. And, while I understand this is a game, is it not trying to replicate parts of reality?I'm sure there are others that I'm currently not able to think of.Now, none of this is to say that the history of war and diplomacy has been full of reason and rationality. However, one is typically able to see quite simply the connections between 1) one's desire for war and 2) the declaration of war itself. In other words, one's desire and the action to seize this desire. This is not the case in Civilization VI.I recommend reading Machiavelli's The Prince and overhauling the AI accordingly. Until then, I'll be sticking to Europa Universalis IV."

I enjoyed this actually a bit more then Civ V due to how it felt like you were expanding your empire beyond just the city base with the new districts and although to be fair there were somethings I miss about Civ V such as the the permanent workers. After so long this game was a pleasure to play especially during the pandemic but, I am sorry to say this is where we part ways. After the launch of their new launcher I CANNOT play this game in a conventional manner. The Launcher says I do not own the game, but when I press the buy option on the 2K launcher it proceeds to lead me back here where it says ""I already own this game"". I contacted 2K support and I went through every available bypass they could give me and the one that the community had provided to start the game without the launcher. I deleted the T2GP folder as they requested and then the launcher started up AGAIN, proceed to update itself and fail AGAIN. I made sure the files were updated, I made sure the game was not running on admin, I double check just to make sure the game had the same patch as the current one. I SOMEHOW manage to get the game to launch if only barely by the MOST convoluted way possible and it did not help since I could not actually play the game. While a friend was playing I clicked the option to join his game and to my shock the game started up but once i joined him the UI was beyond broken and beyond moving the units nothing else could be done. I reinstalled the game 5 different times and I waited until the FInal update which was today on April 22nd to see if maybe this update would finally resolve the issue. It did not solve a single thing. I am beyond exhausted at this point trying to find ways to play a game I paid for in Full. For those who can get the game to work for them then I recommend it to the fullest."

Not as much as some other diehard civ fans, mind you, but a respectable amount of time just the same. I bought Civ IV with all its DLCs, and while it felt a little to chunky and cramped for my tastes, I can still see why people enjoy it. That said, I preordered the ""Deluxe"" edition of this game, and was fairly excited to see what the finished product was. I wasn't sure how to feel about the new district and wonder system, but I was willing to give it a chance.And now here I am.This game is just not fun. I do not enjoy it at all. Even mods can't make this exciting.I actually like the new district and wonder layout system, and I think that some of the little things that they added, such as sending envoys to city states and being able to stack certain military units with strategic units, are great additions. The policy system seems alright, not overwhelmingly great, but it had potential. I thought it was great that they replaced happiness with the new amenities system.With that stated...THE ONLY WAY TO WIN ANY TYPE OF VICTORY IN THIS GAME IS THROUGH WAR. Seriously, in Civ V, by the late game, the world would always hate me, but it was understandable because I had already conquered many empires. But this game is ALL ABOUT WAR. Diplomacy is a joke, and an unfunny, broken joke at that. The AI, even your supposed ""friends"" will just randomly declare war on you, often rushing you early game. War is literally the only way to win. Spread your religion through war. Boost your science output by taking it from other civs. Steal culture and great works through wars and peace deals to win a culture victory. Seriously, the easiest and only viable way to win is to be at war almost ALL THE TIME.The AI is still stupidly bad. They just spam out religious units and cover half the map with them so you can't move past them. The other leaders will end up hating you no matter what because the ""cool new agenda system"" is broken. Take someone like China, for instance, who dislikes Civs who have more wonders than them. Is there any possible way that being friends with China will benefit me more than any wonder? No. And considering that being ""friends"" with a civ doesn't mean anything because they will still betray you, it's more like **** NO!Really disappointed with this game. I didn't like the cartoony artwork either.Save your money. Buy Civ V and its DLCs if you really must have a Civ.EDIT: Recently came back to try this game again... Still garbage! And now it's garbage with spyware! Fireaxis and 2K Games really done screwed up this time. This will be the last Civ game me or any of my friends every purchase!"

If you're on the fence, let's be realistic.  First, sequels are different.  If it was the same, we'd just keep playing Civ V.  Second, the art style is a matter of taste.  I personally love it.Now, if you're still on the fence, go back and read about Civ V when it first came out.  People declared Civ IV as the Alpha and Omega of all strategy games and Civ V was a diseased mongrel that just soiled your grandma's rug.  Now, Civ V is the golden child and Civ VI has the AUDACITY to try new things.  I think you can see how 99% of the complaints are by people who were never going to like Civ VI out of the gate.Finally, remember that satisfied players are out PLAYING.  We're not on the forums complaining because that's time that could be spent crushing the AI.  Is Civ VI perfect?  No.  Is it crucially flawed?  No.  A small number of people have technical issues that are unfortunate but are part and parcel of PC gaming.  Games not working sometimes, that's a risk we all accept due to the inherent difficulty in programming for the PC platform vs. consoles with standardized hardware.Now, if you're new to the series, this is a very welcoming entry.  On lower difficulties, the AI is a declawed house cat.  Come to think of it, on higher difficulties you're still kinda playing against yourself.  The AI gets more aggressive but they're still tactically feeble in combat.Should you buy it?  Absolutely.  It has everything you could want from a 4X game and no matter what anyone else says, the Civ series is still the 800-lb. gorilla in the room compared to everything else."

Civ 4 has better AI, UI, Tech, Tutorial, and Modding. They both have good Government and Civics system and Even Civ 4's graphics are awesome. The conroversial change from unit stacking to 1 unit per tile was a good thing, but overall my conclusions are that you should buy Civ 6 (on sale) if you're interested in it, the gameplay is solid and the community is very active. Civ 4 is very good and I recommend it to anyone new to the franchise and even people who have played Civ 5 looking to buy another. My personal favorite is Civ 4 as the good AI heavily weighs out the unit stacking. I still really enjoy Civ 6 very much and it's worth the money.

Surprsingly no, it doesn't. In fact, I was very impressed with how many mechanics were not only carried over from Civilization V, but dramatically improved upon.Faith was a neat add-on in Civ5, providing nice perks that made it worth the effort to get involved with religion. However in Civilization VI, religious benefits aren't dramatically different, but the whole religious warfare aspect is much deeper. There's something incredibly satisfying about being able to fight a religious war with units, without the bloodshed of a full fledged war. The unit variety is smaller and religious units obviously can't attack anything but other religious units, but it provides a surprising amount to do, especially during the mid-game.City states feel much more fleshed out. You actively compete for their loyalty without needing to constantly run around completing quests that may or may not either go out of your way or worse, result in unwanted war or hatred from other civs and/or city states. This was improved upon in Brave New World, but Civilization VI absolutely tops it by making the loyalty itself a mechanic you can directly contribute to, while keeping ""quests"" as an alternate way to gain loyalty.Great Works and culture feel just as fleshed out as they did in Brave New World, making Great People such as Writers and Painters feel valuable by contributing Great Works. Added too are relecs which work much the same, but just goes that not only was nothing lost, but a little was gained.The World Congress isn't in Civilization VI right out of the gate, but if Firaxis is to be believed, this was due to not being entirely sure how to best add it. Just brace yourself and don't be surprised if it's in a paid expansion pack.The new mechanics work very well and give you a much stronger sense of control. City districts are surpisingly strategic, especially later in the game when you start buffing their output, specifically via adjacency bonuses. Even something as simple as builders building instantly but having limited charges makes the act of improving tiles feel more meaningful since you're actively seeking improvements with a finite resource.However this is also where one of the biggest issues of the game start to glare their ugly head. Transparency, or a lack there of, is a major concern. The new mechanics add a huge amount of depth and breath of life into the game, but the mechanics, both new and old, seem to have taken a major step back in terms of ease of visibility for important stats. Information like district output, housing/amenity income, great work locations, etc, are difficult to find, assuming it even exists, and is often burried and consolidated into generic numbers, making it unnecessarily difficult to keep track of and micro-manage them. It's almost as though the game treats these mechanics as less important than they really are. And tooltips are a lot less helpful than you'd expect them to be, either displaying generic information, seemingly useless information or relevant information, or just not displaying anything of value that you can't already see by just looking at it.The game also has a surprising number of glitches or AI quarks. I've seen cases where certain overlay features will get stuck on - such as traderoutes, cluttering your view. Trade deals seem very broken in that on more occasions than I can count, I've asked AI for a deal that they thought was better, only for them to actually ask for less or even offer me more. I've also been actively either dismissed or praised by other civilizations for not having a high gold income when my profit margins are very strong. I've even encountered an issue where a civilization will declare friendship with me - only to declare war on me two turns later.All and all, the game holds a remarkable amount of promise. I have little doubt that these issues will be ironed out in Civ6 just as they were in Civ5. That being said, it can't be emphisized strongly enough that this game released in what feels like a far, far more ""complete"" base game than Civilization V did when it was first released. If Firaxes trend is anything to go on, it's very easy to imagine that this game has the potential to be the absolute best Civilization game yet."

Well this is not fair, if you want to compare Civ 6 with something you will compare it with the plain Civ5 - thus with a game without religion, great works  of art and a silly unit upgrade system with which you end up with lots of melee units that had 2 or 3 (useless for them) ranged unit  promotions . But even if you decide to compare it with the complete civ5  the game have all the elements and less flaws of a fully developed Cv5. It has religion, great works of art and also have interesting new concepts that vastly improve the game. Concepts such as districts (districts with their adjutancy bonuses bring a whole new way of city planning), consumable workers (no more Idle worker at the end of the game), an improved Great people system taken from the founding fathers of colonization, (I still remember myself laughing with Picasso appearance in ancient era in Civ5), the ability to create armies and armadas (a lost civ4 concept) and more. To be honest the only new concept that I do not like is the way roads created in the game.So even if  you decide to compare the Civ6 vanilla with the Civ5 including both its expansion packs, thus compare a game that has 1 year of development with a game that has 6, the verdict still goes to CIV 6.Sure there are bugs (all games have them) sure the AI is silly (It was more silly in Civ5 when it first released) but all those can be corrected  in the future .So  If you see things with a clear mind Civilization 6 starts from a better position and with a greater potential  from all its predecessors. It is more complete and It has lots of new  elements that bring a fresh approach to the series. Some people just wanted a Civ5 with new graphics. Well thank god Firaxis did not listen to them."

I regret the time I had to put into this botched attempt at a Civ game in order to come to this conclusion.The first 100 or so turns seems cool, but as you progress it becomes apparent that there wasn't a lot of thought put into making the game compelling, but rather meeting deadlines. It just doesn't seem like the developers put much pride into this beyond the shallow and cosmetic. The mathematical underpinnings of the game are fundamentally flawed, and it shows through painfully once a game gets going. I got bored before way I won or lost every game, because nothing seemed to matter. I have 966 hours logged on Civ 5, but I was bored with Civ 6 in under 50 hours. This game is a big step backward from Civ 5. I'm not into the mobile/WoW graphics like many others, but further there's a real feeling of laziness behind the graphic assets. There is no real variation between units or buildings of different cultures. Everything is uniform. China looks just like Mexico beyond the early game. It's homogenous, and that's disappointing for a game that costs $60 and supposedly celebrates all these various cultures and epochs. There are mods made by hobbyists for Civ 5 with more depth diversity. It's just shallow and very low-effort on the part of this supposed AAA studio. They subtracted a TON from Civ 5. For example my infantry went from musketeers in breastplates to WW2 troops to mech. They removed the United Nations, and replaced it with a diplomatic system that is impossible. Everybody will hate you, and if they don't it means they are about to declare war on you. The elegant diplomatic solution that made Civ 5 so interesting was just removed, as if they had made a mistake with Brave New World. The diplomacy is brutal and stupid.I do like some of the features like city districts and...well I do like the districts. The fog of war artwork they did is cool.The AI is so bad it might as well be totally random, which might actually be an improvement. It is so disappointing to be anticipating a big battle, only to have the enemy force disperse for no reason. I'm sitting here frustrated by an opposing army as if they were my own crew of ♥♥♥♥-ups. There's no sense of accomplishment in defeating an enemy that defeats itself. Almost every AI algorithm in the game is straight up broken, and that sucks when you put a bunch of effort into it for nothing.I would say save your money, and maybe buy it on sale, but even then I'd say save your time and invest it in a game of Civ 4 or 5. This is the junkfood of Civilization titles, and I'm really sad to have to write this negative review. Maybe it will mature with DLC, but after a week I'm playing Civ 5 again to scratch my empire building itch.I dunno, maybe since Civ has gone ESPORTZ I should play some multi-player stuff before reaching a conclusion. Playing against the computer is just too dumb for this to be a PVE game on par with its precessors."

The game has opened up a lot more with the DLC and the balance changes which allows you to be more creative with your strategies. The AI is still meh, but the game is generally more fun than Civ V for me now. There is more min-maxing in this game than Civ V, so if you like that, then you will like this game."

This game is a micromanagement chore. Not strategy. The maps are too crowded. The units have no place to move around. I feel like a traffic constable trying to clear a rush-hour traffic, particularly from mid-game. One unit per tile, with AI non-military units blocking user military paths is a glaring flaw. The AI missionaries spammed all over the map do not help.The UI is a disaster. It is unintuitive, and indecisive. Finding resources on the map is a tedious task, with inadequate filters on the map. The camera keeps resetting to units of its choosing after every action I take, giving me a headache. The AI is incredibly hostile and illogical (stupid?), always cooking up wars. I felt like I was in a sorority house trying to win a date to the prom. Trying to understand the AI's motives involves digging deeper than into Facebook's privacy settings. They might as well have just used excel sheets as UI. The gameplay is not fun. The pestilent barbarians force you to grow militarily. The technology tree is pre-destined by giving away eureka points for specific actions. Choice has been curtailed for such gimmicks.All these elements come together in a deleterious way, forcing you to play a tactical, reactive game than a strategic, proactive game. This game is not for rulers, it's for bureaucrats. No real choice, just an illusion. This game is one sequel away from being turned into a pay-to-win freemium mobile and console app. Yes, this game could be something great, but why should one pay for just a possibility?"

No, at the present time, this is not as complete of a game as Civ 5, nor as balanced. It certainly has some issues. BUT this is the biggest single overhaul of the Civ franchise so far. They've introduced a lot of really interesting and innovative concepts that admittedly do need some tweaking, but are not inherently flawed, and in fact really make it a unique and fun product.There are some big cons that need to be addressed, but as I will get to, all of the negatives are fixable problems. The core gameplay is as good as any version of Civ, and will only be built upon.Now let's get to the breakdown.PROS+ The district system is excellent and makes you think a lot more about how you want every city to play out+ The concept of builders really removes the tedium of worker management that has plagued every other version of Civ+ NO GLOBAL HAPPINESS. The worst concept of Civ 5 has been thrown out the window in place of a localized amenity (happiness) system, and for the better.+ The return of large empires. A lot of people seem to see the fact that you're encouraged to expand more as a negative, but to me it's definitely a positive. You now feel like you're building large, sprawling EMPIRES, but it's not just settler spam everywhere. That said, victory paths for building tall are still available for those who wish to play that way.+ The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Yeah, I know people miss the realistic graphics of Civ 5, but I find the graphical style of 6 to be far more aesthetically pleasing. I love the colors and the way the maps look.+ Better-designed maps. Movement across maps feels more natural and the maps just feel less crowded.+ City-states are better. In 5, you could get by without significant city-state diplomacy unless you were going for a diplomatic victory, but they feel like a much more important and impactful part of the game now. Suzerain bonuses were an excellent addition.+ Early game pacing also feels better than in 5+ The religious victory is a great addition, and religion in general just builds off of what 5 gave us and turns it into a more dynamic, impactful feature. The most fun games I've had have usually focused on religion.+ Tech tree specialization encourages different play-styles and advancement paths. Splitting of tech tree into science and civics is a cool idea.+ ""Card-style"" civics system to replace social policies is great for adjusting play style to current conditions.+ Love the idea of leader agendas, although there will be more about this in the ""cons"" section.+ Spies are so much more useful and flexible than in 5.+ Can combine units into corps and armies in mid/late game, which is excellent for unit management.+ Combination of civics cards, tech tree branching, and district usage encourages alternative play-styles and long-term strategic thinking to a greater extent than in any previous version.+ Most importantly, it still has that great ""just 1 more turn"" Civ feel.CONS- Diplomacy has been nerfed. Aside from luxury trading and war, there's not much reason to contact the AI. Deals often feel imbalanced as well (although the 2 patches so far have helped somewhat). There's no World Congress or diplomatic victory in general, which makes the late game feel a bit empty.- Diplomacy is especially bad when it comes to the ""leader agendas"". It's impossible for every civ to like you because I think the diplomatic bonuses/penalties are too weighted towards agendas. The AI denounces you far too often. In 5, when you were denounced, it was a big deal. In 6, being denounced just happens all the time. This is made worse by the overly long diplomatic animations (the animations themselves are great, but they're too intrusive).- AI is mostly incompetent when it comes to warfare, especially when it comes to taking cities. They're too passive, cannot use siege/ranged units effectively, and don't upgrade their units often enough.- The pacing of the late game doesn't feel right. You blow through the tech tree too quickly, and production times just get too long in the late game. It's possible to advance far along on either the civics or science tree while leaving the other behind, and there's far greater tech disparities between civs than ever existed in previous versions. I often finish the tech tree before properly utilizing late game units.- Tech tree is TOO branchy. There's too many dead end techs, and some missing prerequisites that allow advancement along certain tech paths to be too OP/simply not make sense.- Missing a few key notifications (such as a notification for city bombardment) and some of the UI feels incomplete or cluttered (city screens need an overhaul, for example, and trade routes really need to be sortable).- NO TEAM GAMES. Come on Firaxis, what are you doing here? This is one of those things that feels generally inexcusable.- No Workshop support yet (not a huge deal for me personally at the moment, but something that is definitely vital for the community).That may seem like a long list of cons, but the thing about the cons is that they're ALL FIXABLE PROBLEMS. Firaxis has created an excellent base game, and a wonderful set of features that gives 6 the potential to be a very deep, consistently compelling game. I have faith that they can fix the AI to at least reach an enjoyably competent level, and that further patches and eventual expansions will add additional diplomatic options. Some big-time balancing is needed in the late game especially, but again, that's a fixable problem. People want to compare it to Civ 5 with all of its patches and expansions. Honestly, 6 is a more complete game than 5 was on initial launch, and I remember people complaining about a lot of the same things.I have no problem with any of the base features of the game. The cons all have to do with the AI, diplomacy, and balance that I have faith will be sorted out with time!Currently would give an 8.5/10, but there's the potential for a 10/10 game here. Still would recommend, ESPECIALLY if you aren't going to compare every feature to the complete edition of Civ 5."

I hope this will persuade people to at least try the game before passing it off as a terrible attempt at making a successor to Civ 5. The Base game is very bare-bones and can seem a little stale after a few games, the addition of civics and civic tree adds a huge amount off diversity to the game, all victories excluding Domination which can be a little hard at times. this may seem to be bad but I highly recommend getting the dlc if you want the best out of this game.Rise & Fall adds new leaders, the introduction of Eras and Loyalty which alone add so much but with Gathering Storm which adds so many more units, natural disasters and world congress all of these add so much to the base game that makes each playthrough different from the last. The Positives and Negatives:+ DLC adds so much to the game and makes it more unique and way more fun+ Each Leader is unique and brings something to the table and no one leader feels the same as another+ Natural Disasters happen at random times, which would seem bad but is actually really fun.+ World builder is really fun and easy to use, adds a lot to multiplayer games when you share it with friends+ The new way that Builders are handled are a lot easier to handle and don't require micro-managing+ The UI is less cluttered than Civ 5 and is more easy to navigate through+ Having a tech and Civic tree- Base Game can become stale after a while- Having to buy DLC to enjoy the game for a longer period of time- The Cartoonish leaders aren't for everyone- Somethings are missing from civ 5 (Might be added in the future) such as persuading other leaders to go to war with each other, Happiness is replaced with amenities and a lot of the little challanges that can be found on the loading menu.- Agendas can make some leaders easy to deal with such as Scotland as they tend to be very Passive and will most likely will be punished for it. (This is my only real dislike in the game as in 5 uses a much better system in which the way they act is on a scale, the only thing i would keep from the agendas is what the leader will always like and dislike not the way they act and the hidden agenda maybe affecting the scale making a normally aggressive leader more faith focused or a more pacifistic leader aggressive and likes warmongering better).For Civ 5 players who are put off by the cartoonish take on leaders please try to look past that and try the game as you actually might like it, I am not saying that Civ 6 is better than Civ 5 but i would say that Civ 6 with DLC is Now officially on par with civ 5. It is an enjoyable game with lots of new content that makes the game so much fun and you will find yourself losing hours to this game without realising it."

Might be a little long:- Turns take longer. Not necessarily sit and wait turns like late-game Civ 5, but each individual turn throughout the entire game has you managing things, so Civ 6 lacks the fast buildup phase that the other games had. That's due in large part to the next issue, which is...- Miltary conquest is happening, whether you want it to or not, regardless of difficulty. I enjoyed the civ building aspect of the series in the past, often ignoring military expansion in favor of just building my own civ. Can't really do that here, you will absolutely need to focus on defense, and often military units and actually using them just to get reasonable tech advancement. - Advancement doesn't have the same rewarding feel to it, either. The culture system and tech tree only have a few spots that feel like milestones, and the rest just quickly become ignored. It all seems built with a very specific goal in mind from the start, so you focus on getting certain cards and a government to support them, with no organic feel to the buildup. It makes it a bit tedious to play for hours, because there's little adaptation from an initial strategy you're somewhat bottlenecked into from the moment you pick your civ's leader. - The new spy system is atrocious. Build a spy, then you're forced to choose not just what city to defend or go against but also individual districts. For a larger city in late game, this turns into a maddening display of micromanagement that you're forced to repeat after a fairly short number of turns for each spy. - I'm also not a fan of the new builders. They're expendable units with a number of charges, rather than being persistent. You can't automate anymore. Some things they can repair on pillage, others have to be fixed through that city's production screen.- Barbarians are annoying. They ramp up in tech, your units don't wake on seeing an enemy in Civ 6, they're smarter about pillaging, and the map is worse about letting you know where to combat them. They aren't hard to deal with, they're just a constant aggravation that stops being fun fairly quickly combined with all of the other management you're doing.- Enemy civs are aggressive, and they stockpile units like crazy. Even at farily early turns it seems like you're being swarmed, and with so many of the civs being military-centric they don't hesitate to declare war on you. This is probably fine if you enjoy Civ as a wargame, but that's never been what I liked about it and I still don't find the combat any more compelling in this version than it was in 5. - Wonders don't feel that wonderful anymore. They take up precious expansion hexes, they take forever to build, and often it's a tossup if it's even worth it. You're not going to mass produce them like past games, it's not even possible. The screens when you do complete one are neat, but you're rarely going to see any of them. - At 1440p the UI is ungodly small. Little tiny X's to close windows, and a number of other issues make it a bit frustrating to get the information you need when you need it. It's not that Civ 6 is a bad game, it's just only going to be a good one for a particular mindset of player. This is a less casual, far less relaxing game than the others in the series that focuses far too much on armies and not enough on the things that always made Civ stand out to me from other strategy games. It also seems like games actually take longer to complete in Civ 6 than they did even in 5, but at least the save feature is a little better. It'll be better after an expansion or two to streamline things, but right now I don't recommend it unless you're the warmongering type or only ever played the previous entries in the series on the highest difficulties."

That’s joyous.+ The music of this game, especially the start screen is beautiful and powerful+ Voice acting is on point and is throughout the game in every aspect+ AI is realistic in the personality of the leaders.

The leaders act how they would if they were still alive, so very realistic.+ Amazing strategy game that defines the 4x genre+ Steam Achievements+ Steam Trading cards- Initial Civilizations introduced with the release, I was hoping for more leaders and some specific ones that were not included- Some people find the graphics cartoony, I like the graphics.- I don't like the way they do the DLC of releasing new leaders- This review was written 3 days after release and the game can still use a few balance patches to get to perfection P.S. Civilization 4 was my favorite until I tried Civilization 6. I can only imagine it gets better with mods and DLC."

Historical context is important, and I think this game really nails it; although, I feel like the game completely leaves out a huge array of notable historical moments, people, things, etc that could easily be in the game.Here are my Pros and Cons lists:Pros (with some cons):1) Graphics are astonishing; however, it seems like there's an unecessary mix of more realistic, yet cartoonish feel to the graphics. Civilization 5 had more realistic looking scenery, units, and buildings, and should have just been updated off of that. 2) Unit combat: Unit combat is far more intruiging to watch; the animations are more compelling to see play out. 3) Unit Stacking: FINALLY! Unit stacking is incorporated into the game; however, you can either only stack a military unit with a support unit, or stack numerous units of the same type into the same hex... this, I still don't understand. I don't fully grasp the idea as to why the developers seem to not understand anything related to how an actual military functions.4) Leader Interactions: Interacting with a leader is more pleasing. Leader animations are far more enjoyable, and they have expressions depending on if they're pleased or upset. 5) District building: Incorporating districts is a huge plus for this game. You can view all the buildings under construction as well as when they're finished; everything isn't just assumed it's in the city like in previous games. The layout of the districts also is really neat. Placing districts, like a holy site, nearer a mountain actually helps improve the income of faith because you're next to a mountain. Harbor district is my favorite, because wonders are really neat to build around the harbor.6) Wonders are far more interesting, and enticing, to build. Wonders build up more and more as you construct them, which is fun to watch over time. Once complete, viewing the wonder in it's animation completion shows the surrounding area in which is built, which makes it that much more intruiging. The Wonders, themselves, look very impressive.7) Attempting to achieve other victories rather than just domination is more enjoyable. Disctricts and Wonders help with drawing you to win the game with other victories. I haven't won the space race yet, but the steps it takes to get there seem really interesting (building a launch site [district], orbital satelite, moon landing, mars landing). Unfortunately, the CONS outway the Pros:1) Setting up a game isn't nearly as in depth as Civilization 5. Theres very few map types, ""Huge"" isn't even huge at all for maps; you are placed really near other civs. There's no Earth map, which is a big thumbs down for me. 2) There's no point in trying to win the game on anything beyond Emperor difficulty. Starting on Emperor difficulty, other civs start with WAY too many military units, cities, and benefits. The Emperor difficulty is the third from hardest difficulty, so how do the developers expect you to have ANY chance of winning on Deity? Starting out the game, the only thing you can even try to do is constantly produce military units, but even then... there's not a great chance to win this on Emperor difficulty.3) Map sizes are not NEARLY big enough. I'm partial to having the biggest available map possible, and I'm sure I'm far from being the only one. I want large scale battles against numerous civs across numerous continents. HUGE on Civ 6 isn't even close to giving you that opportunity. You'd be lucky to have more than three cities. Huge gives you 12 civs to play against, but the map puts everyone far too close to one another, and you have little opportunity to expand or build large armies. 4) The Graphics have too much of a cartoon feel for my liking. Yes, there are GREAT graphical aspects to this game, but there's too much of a backwards step for me to thoroughly give the overall graphics a good enough rating to enjoy. 5) The Hex tiles feel like they were made larger in this game. I could be wrong, but that's the impression I get, which makes the game much smaller than it should be. 6) Yet again, the diversity of units is completely lacking. You have numerous unique units for every civ, but most only get one unique unit. The Germans get only the U-Boat... really? They had some of the most specific units in military history, and they only get 1 unique unit.7) NO MOD SUPPORT! Supposedly there's going to be mod support, but this should have been launched with the game. The developers have specifically stated that the MOD aspect of this game is one of the most popular aspects to the game itself, since freelance developers can make the game much larger, and more enjoyable to play. Until Mod support is released, this game is simply not as enjoyable as it could be. 8) Having a very limited game being launched, such as Civilization 6, displeases me. Games used to be made as complete as possible back in the day, and these days, developers seem to just say, ""Well, looks good enough. We'll just release patches as we go along."" No, I bought this game to play NOW, not wait 6 months for me to actually start enjoying the game. Overall, I'm disappointed with the launch of this game. I know the game will improve, but I don't buy a game to enjoy later. Don't purchase this game until AT LEAST mod support is released."

There are similarities amongst all of them, differences amongst all of them, and at release, all them seem to create some controversy. Civ5 created controversy when it moved to hexagons from squared map tiles and only allowed you to place one unit per each of those tiles. And more recently, Civ6's mobile-game art style and city districts have caused an uproar – amongst other things we’ll get into. Through the years we’ve ended up with a heralded pillar of the video game world divided up between six different iterations (more if you count spin-offs). Most of these iterations are playable today. How do you choose which to play? And just because you prefer one over the other does it make all others inherently bad?Civilization VI, for whatever reason, never seemed to catch on and win the fans over as others eventually did despite some holdouts. I know of one person, for example, who still plays Civ4 and refuses to leave – with 10,000 hours in, I’m beginning to believe him. Does this make Civ5 or Civ6 bad games? No. They just aren’t  game. His Civilization is Civ4. In that respect, sequels to Civilization don’t work the same way as they do in other video game franchises. You don’t simply move on to the next. Once you’ve invested so much time, so many turns, learning the game’s systems forwards and backwards, it’s hard to move on. And that’s okay! You don’t have to. Civilization games are designed so well that there’s never a reason to leave. Pick your Civ and stick with it if you want. Civilization II, to this day, remains my favorite. No one forced me to move. I still have the Microprose disc ready to go.This game uses the same ideas as those that have came before – take your civilization and stand the test of time. And now not just your civilization, but also your cities. There’s characterization that goes into each them. City planning is emphasized in this generation with the advent of the district mechanic. The game asks the question, “What do you want this city to be?” And from there you’re going to be managing each city created based upon that question. Will this city be a bastion of science? Commerce? Industry? Faith? Culture? Once decided you will build subsequent districts that reflect that. From there, the macro goal becomes guiding your civilization through time, the micro goal is managing each city to align with your guidance. Ultimately, your choice is going to come down to which victory condition you want to achieve. Oddly, the victory conditions sap some of the fun out of the game. It’s almost more rewarding to enter a game of Civilization without a victory condition in mind. Simply play. And figure it out as you go along – of course, this is much more problematic on higher difficulties. However, victory conditions aren’t why most people play these games anyway. It’s all about the journey. Not a three-picture slideshow on your diplomatic, military, cultural, or religious victory.AI and diplomacy almost  modding. Without it, the game is partial to other civilizations over the player. Why are people blaming me for winning a war I didn’t start? If Montezuma invaded my lands, pillaged them, took my border city, and tried to ruin my reputation without provocation – what’s wrong with me doing the same thing to him or more? The game doesn’t consider the fact that some civilizations behave like psychopaths, particularly if you have access to resources that they want. They WILL betray you to get what they want if you don’t keep a watchful eye on your borders. And if they can’t beat you, they will hate you out of jealousy for it, and always side against your interests. The latter part I don’t mind. We see that kind of thing going on in the real world. But when it comes to war, eventually, you’re always the bad guy. No matter how justified you were – you are a warmonger. Even if your warmongering, real or imagined, happened ages prior. What keeps bringing me back to the Civilization franchise is the simplistic celebration of humanity’s accomplishments and shortcomings. It's never a deep-dive, it's surface-level nationalism that doesn't come with baggage, a playful exchange of differing cultural achievements under the guise of a video game. And it's always done with a cute undercurrent of silliness.It’s honestly just exciting to create The Pyramids, The Great Wall, The Eiffel Tower, and The Statue of Liberty. Amazing to develop radio, flight, super highways and spacecrafts. It's bizarre that we need alliances and borders, terrifying that we build battleships and nuclear weapons, and important that we all have our own civics and government. To take all of that, the good and the bad, and shake your head at how remarkable it all is because it's actually real. WE did that. Everyone. And Civilization VI does a pretty damn good job of exploring that while also recreating, however simplistically, the personality of each peoples whilst time moves on through the ages. I, on however rudimentary of a level, identify with Teddy Roosevelt. I am American after all. And when that emotionally-manipulative American prairie music plays, it’s tapping into something. It's nice that there was an honest attempt to capture the personality of each civilization. And it's fun to see exactly what they come up with and how each civilization's personality meshes with the game's mechanics. For example, Scotland doesn't like you fighting with civilizations that you share land with. If you do that, you and Robert the Bruce are going to have issues. And it doesn't take a historian to figure out why this was placed in the game. Most people know that Scotland has an  history of warring on their own lands - thus, they don't like it. And there are over 30 (counting the DLCs) civilizations, meaning that there are 30 different examples of this in practice. Any base-level history nerd will have a field day here. Is this Civilization VI going to stand the test of time? Probably not by comparison. There are presently several other Civilizations (sadly, not 2) available across Steam right now and each one of them is viable and unique in their own way. Occasionally, in a better way. That doesn’t mean this version is bad, or the wrong choice to play. It’s more of a question of which is preferable. For right now, I see myself sinking more hours into Civilization VI. And, I say, “Bully for (me), Mr. President."" Additional Details:Played on RTX 2080 Super (Runs 60fps in 1440p).Expect to play at least 20 hours before having a solid understanding of systems.Playthroughs vary in length, usually 8-15 hours per playthrough with very high replay value.Good game for newcomers, has several different difficulty levels to accommodate all."

I think most things they've done has been a positive improvement from civ 5. The gameplay changes have all been brilliant, meanwhile I'm not impressed with the AI, although they are still fun to play against.-Districts & tile improvement got a big overhaul. This is definitely the biggest and most important change in my opinion. I really like the new way city tiles are developed with builder's having a limit on improvements and the use of districts. It's a really brilliant change that makes city building more dynamic and engaging. The traders make building roads less hand-holdey and more reasonable as well. Cities now have housing which is a new way to limit population. Housing initially is set on the available water (rivers, coasts), but can be increased with things like granaries etc. Definitely an improvement.-Combat movement is overhauled. Now if you want to climb a hill you can't spend 1 movement point on an ending turn, you have to either have enough movement points, or be on the starting move tile. This completely changes how fights work out. This can be a little frustrating when you're used to marching spearmen over hills, but overall I think it's a more clear representation of spending movement points. It does however slow reinforcements and army mobility down, which can slow gameplay a little.-The new civics tree and great person aquisition is also much better. The game is more dynamic with the 2 tech trees separating technology and government, and great people have an ergonomic section built in to see progress.-Art style is all cartoony now. At first I hated this, since then it's grown on me. Civ 5's style is very nice, but once you start to get used to all the new designs the Civ 6 style I feel looks very polished and easy on the eyes.-City states were overhauled, you use envoys that you earn from the civics tree and influence points to gain city state's favour. I think this is a much better and more controlled mechanic than the money throwing method civ 5 implemented.-Spies are now more like units than an extra feature, able to carry out a number of tasks such as sabotaging rocketry (preventing science victories), stealing techs as before, stealing gold/production etc. These spies are a lovely change to the straightforward civ5 spies and makes non-war civ interaction more interesting.-A negative to mention is that the AI's have seen little to no improvement from civ 5. They are needlessly aggressive, to the point where if you go to war with someone they also all hate they will happily drop all ties with you and scream Warmonger as loud as they can. The warmonger penalties are huge and unrealistic. All AI's seem to hate every other AI and player and it's a particularly boring and confusing way for them to act when it would clearly be in their better interests to turn a blind eye and trade for luxuries instead. There are a few workshop mods to help this but I think it needs more attention from the developers.-Another setback is no cross-platform compatibility. I initially bought this to play with my friend and I can't because pc and mac versions are different. Feasibly they'll eventually be the same once the mac developement catches up so hopefully this will sort itself out.-The performance is a little demanding for a turn based strategy game. Probably moreso than civ 5 so if you don't have a war machine, watch out.Overall I'd recommend it over civ 5. Although the AI are just about worse, the gameplay is much better and civ 5 AI are not exacty anything to praise.RISE AND FALL DLC:Rise and Fall causes a huge change to the pace of the game. The biggest change is the loyalty mechanic, causing cities founded too far away or too close to other civs to rebel unless you keep under control with governers. This was a lovely design choice and addresses why your own cities blindly follow orders. There are also dark and golden eras, relying on era points you gain by doing thigns such as buildings wonders or meeting people etc. This change adds a nice new dynamic to consider during gameplay, but I personally think the eras should not be so hard-set in what age you get, ie. a darker<dark<progressive<golden sorta thing. It also tweaks many wonders and policy types to balance the game. I'd recommend if it's on a decent sale, but it's a bit heavy on price without one."

I’ve played one back in the day on Playstation but got bored quickly, but I was a child back then. So my impressions are from the perspective of a newcomer. I know that I’m still a complete noob to this game and I probably don’t know many things yet so hardcore players may find many things I’ve missed.You choose your civilization and your goal is to make it prosper. There are many ways to accomplish that. You can fight wars and be a strong empire crushing everyone on your way to dominate the world. Or you can try and avoid wars as much as you can and focus on technology or art which will drive your civilization forward. It’s up to you.You can choose as one of the famous historic figures and try to be something they were in real life or be a complete opposite. You can even download a Hitler mod. I laughed so much when Hitler changed his government to fascism and then started to invade countries.You need to know which path you’ll be going from the start. You can’t be good at everything. If you’re going for the culture victory then you’ll probably won’t be very good at was or science. But don’t like having all the best theaters and museums where people are having good time. But all that can be ruined by Ghandi’s or Hitlers invasion.It’s very important to have a good relations with as many civilizations as possible if you’re not going the military route.  Please others, send them gifts, trade with them and don’t expand very close to their big cities. By the way you expand you borders by buying tiles and increasing your population. To do that there should be enough housing and other necessities. You need to build farm, fisheries, mines, but to do that your first need to research the technology for whatever you want doing. And that takes a lot of time, so choose carefully.I’m a total noob at this game so maybe I just don’t know how to play, but AI seems very illogical at time. They might attack you all of a sudden, you could coordinate attacking other civilizations with your allies but suddenly after several turns they decide to make a pact with their enemy, then after more turns ask you to help invade them. Doesn’t make any sense to me.The game has huge replayability value. Each time you play you can do something differently. Even starting on a different location may change the gameplay drastically.You can recruit famous people like scientist or artists and change the history. Same goes for iconic buildings like Eiffel tower.There’s also different government forms to choose from which affects the development of your civilization.I absolutely love the graphical style of Civilization VI. All those rulers look so cute this and brings playfulness to the game. I don’t see this as a very serious game, it shouldn’t be serious like Hearts of Iron or something like, it’s all about ridiculous events and making your civilization look ridiculous at times. World map graphics look great too. Especially all those iconic and important buildings for your civilizations. Seeing how you launch a rocket to the moon is so nice.It’s a very good game, but some DLC’s should’ve been in a base game or at least it could be cheaper. It lacks scenarios which supposed to teach you how to play the game and usually have a clear goal. Other than that I can’t think of anything too bad which would break the experience completely.I recommend this game to anyone who love strategy games and who want to have freedom on how to evolve your civilization."

New features over since 5 like loyalty, districts, natural disasters and the diplomatic favor and grievance systems have improved my enjoyment of the game to the point where I prefer to play a game of Civ 6 over a game of Civ 5 every time now. Natural disasters in particular were a feature that surprised me the most. While my first impression of them was poor, I grew to love the excitement, uncertainty, risk, and reward they bring to the game. Now, with the New Frontier pass just releasing, Firaxis has proven again that they now understand where the fun lies in 6 that's unique to any other Civ game and can still come up with new ideas for Civs and leaders that bring new flavor to our hexagonal worlds.

The opinion here is about the base game + the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions. I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THE BASE GAME AT FULL PRICE. JUST LIKE CIV 5, CIV 6 WITHOUT ANY EXPANSIONS IS A PLAYABLE, BUT INTENTIONALLY CRUDE, EARLY, AND UNFINISHED GAME LACKING FEATURES THAT WOULD BE ADDED LATER AS PAID EXPANSIONS. IT IS A RIP OFF. Thankfully it looks like people have caught on and likely explains why regular Civ 6 keeps going on sale for $15.Before anything else, if you're a huge fan of Civ, I'd recommend trying before buying. Civ 6 is so different and such a huge departure from the standard Civ formula, you might not like it. The new district system will either make or break the game for you. Additionally, wonders now consume city tiles so you can't stuff them all into 1 city anymore.As for my personal feelings, after playing for 50 hours I absolutely want to recommend Civ 6. It grew on me a bit to the point I like it. But its very flawed and I can't for the following reasons:THE UI - User interface is confusing and takes a lot of getting used to. Its lacking and just terrible in some places. This is the first Civ game where clicking on one of your own cities doesn't bring up a city window telling you everything you want to know. Buttons appear in the lower right corner of the screen instead. Certain civ screens are missing or hidden. Military is a huge one. I thought there was no way to find individual units until I noticed clicking on the unit name in the lower right opens a tab showing all your units. I learned this by accident after about 40 hours of play. Another thing I learned by accident was finding out 'quests' was a clickable button on a city state screen. Baffling design choice given quests aren't complicated and can simply just be shown on the city state report. Another glaring problem is information on luxury resources. Just like 5, luxury resources are important for your cities' happiness. But (unless I haven't found it yet) the only way you can tell which ones you have is by trading with another civ. And even then, there's no way to tell the lux's you've currently got from trades AFAIK.STRATEGIC RESOURCES: Civ 6 has decided to treat strategy resources like currency stockpiling them and spending them to build units or buildings. This is fine, but this changes once you hit coal. Coal, being a fuel, gets consumed 1 per turn for whatever uses it. Which, again, is fine, but strat resources are rare, yield 2-3 per turn, and can't maintain much if you're lucky to have 1. There are no buildings that produce or increase a strat resources' yield. Then you hit oil and things become stupid, dumb and bad. Almost every late game unit requires a fuel resource. A tank using oil? Makes total sense. But infantry. You know them... The basic military unit you build when you have no resource. They require 1 oil per turn in Civ 6. What! Why? Are they drinking it? Mechanized infantry does too when it didn't before. As if a lead designer pointed at the unit and said, 'duh, that's a car. car = oil.' Aluminum is profoundly idiotic. I would think you'd accumulate 20 aluminum to build a helicopter. No. Helicopters need 1 aluminum per turn like its fuel. What planet did the people who made this game come from? Military late game is a disaster! You can hardly produce any units thanks to resource restriction. How could they screw up the resource system so bad in this game? Its inexcusable.CLIMATE CHANGE: Ecological fallout from pollution is not new to the Civ games, and it should be part of the series. There are real life consequences from treating your home like a toilet or garbage dump after all. What bothers me with Civ 6 is this appears to be there because of real life politics from alarmist faux environmentalist hipsters. Its JUST CO2 pollution from fossil fuels. Its highly exaggerated. There are techs and buildings present in earlier games that are not present here just to push this ""Making energy = CO2. CO2 is the devil.' agenda. This extends to nuclear power which Civ 6 believes produces CO2 for some, unknown reason (reality check: nuclear produces 0 air pollution IRL. but it does produce radioactive waste) And, hey, whaddaya know, there's no concept or message of toxic, solid, or water pollution, human (poo poo and pee pee) waste, or recycling in this game at all. Funny, that. The 'clean' energy like solar or wind farms are tile improvements and not buildings for some reason. Hydroelectric (and related wonders like Hoover and 3 Gorges Dam), a clean energy source, is also non-existent. GOVERNMENT POLICY SYSTEM: This is the absolute worst thing about Civ 6 and makes me want to tear my hair out. There are a ton of government policy cards granting specific civ bonuses. The government you have offers a few slots for these cards. To make most efficient use of them, you will be wasting a lot of time micromanaging these every time you discover civic. Its one of the really obnoxious parts of Civ 6 that makes me appreciate how simple and straight forward Civ 5's social policy and government system were. then there's the one part I'm split between liking and hating:NEW DISTRICTING SYSTEM: I like it because it introduces a new strategy to the game. But I hate it because you can't move a district if you build it in the wrong place and you can't destroy it if you want to replace it with a different one. The districts are also severely limiting and slow city development down tremendously. Outside of placement bonuses, districts provide a place to build specific buildings.You can't just build a library anymore. You need to build a campus (science) district first.the thing I hate most about Civ 6 though is the followingYOUTUBE UPDATE VIDEOS: Its October 2020. The channel Sid Meier's Civilization puts out a video on youtube about an upcoming 'FREE!!1' update.Watching it, I'm reminded of Beyond Earth. A game that is full of a lot of weird Indian references and is a potentially good game ruined by confusing, bad, and dumb game design to the point I feel it should be called Singh Meierdeep's Beyond Earth since I know Sid isn't Indian and capable of better than this.Based on that October 2020 update video, the source for Civ 6's confusing, dumb, and bad game design is easy to identify. There's only one place people that insufferable and full of themselves could come from.This game should be called Reddit's Civilization 6.Seriously, the self congratulatory smugness and narcissism oozing out of that video says a lot about Civ VI's development team and who the game is made for (an echo chamber).Based on everything above, I can not recommend. Its a shame, since there's a lot I like about Civ 6. Most of the game's assets are appealing and good. The animated civ leaders are emotive and look fantastic. Civ 6 has gone back to animating wonder construction after they've been built. Being a very different game from the rest of the series doesn't bother me. I actually like some of the new takes. And unfortunately Civ 6 has the same problem Beyond Earth has. There's a good game here brought down by genuinely bad and sometimes baffling design choices. Civ 6's worst mistakes could easily be corrected by Firaxis, but I doubt they ever will. You'll have to rely on mods I suppose. My biggest criticism with Civ 6 and the main reason I don't recommend is its not an improvement over the earlier games.I would recommend both Civ 4 Beyond the Sword and Civ 5 (which needs Brave New World to be good) over 6. These are simply better games with more competent design.Civ 4 Beyond the Sword still offers the best traditional Civ experience.Civ 5 Brave New World provides a simplified, yet still engaging and challenging take on the game.I've left the comments open so you can call me a stupid dummy poo poo head and tell me how wrong I am."

I've played Civ-Civ VI. I've played Alpha Centauri and Civ BE. I'm trying to like this game, but as it is now, I'm thinking of uninstalling it. The Cons have been said ad naseum (bad AI, mid to late game slow down, random unit selction, ect...) So I'll add my two cents. First no matter what size map and no matter the difficulty, the game insists on putting a ton of AI civs directly next to you. As I got sick of AI civs next to me, my new strategy is to take their territories ASAP. (Please note: I don't want a domination victrory). In the latest game, by turn 21 I had an American scout, Russian scout, and Brazilian scout show up. I kill off Washington (about 15 tiles away, mind you, on a huga map), then Russia and Brazil declared war on me. I take them both out by 860AD. But, Norway  has this huge army. So I know how bad this game is for AI city spam and I ask them to stop settling near me. They say OK. Then they spawn a city between two of my existing citites. As China I was superior in technology against their warrior horde (I had many promoted units), but why keep playing? Domination isn't fun for me and yet I'm being forced into that playstyle. Can we please stop having AI next to each other every game? There are 5 AI civs next to me, yet other parts of the world are largely empty. No thanks.Second: Informtaion notifications need a bit of a overhaul. I'm having trouble seeing what ameneities and housing are needed. We still have the issues of auto explore with units who will happliy walk into 3 AI units before calling my attention to it. These same units will stop 3 tiles away fromt he goody huts.  Make it so units within three tiles warn you of AI enemies. I could go on, but I think you get the drift.Bouns issues!City states spam units and just move them around endlessly. Maybe give us some IRL time per turn back by just having them fortify unless they have a need to move.Why the hell does the AI spam so many religious units? They are ultra aggressive in spreading their religions. Also on the lowest levels they seem to be able to spam missionaries and apostles in mass quantites. This needs to be fixed.Conclusion:At this stage of the product, I think you should hold off for a patch. There are a few bright points, but IMO, it's a ton of frustration right now."

We will keep playing this game forever. In early stages the problem was the parents. Now the problem are the kids, wifes(and husbands), and work. In the future i really dont know what the problem will be, maybe shortseeing... But i know that I will keep playing this game. Could it be better? Yes. Does it deliver a CIV experience with new things? Yes.  Are the DLC / Expansion worthwile? Some. The expansion has good value the DLC are medium. Wait for sales.  To you all i just say: we can be a bit hard on the game, but it is just because we love it... P.S. The IA is terribleAfter another 1000 hours i keep my review.

I have been playing the Civilization games since Civ II/ Alpha Centauri.  I have also, in between releases, played many of the turn-based strategies that clearly owe a lot to Civilization, including the Galactic Civilizations series, Age of Wonders, Total War,  etc., all since the early days (I realize that I am betraying both advanced age and a misspent life here).  Civilization always felt like the original and for that reason special.Ironically it has taken a lot of work to break this game so completely.  The root of the problem lies in a slow progression of intended improvements to the game that have both totally outstripped the abilities of the AI and have erected impediments in the ability of human players to do things which used to be straightforward.  Many of the core problems arise from the decision, in Civ 5, to de-stack units in an effort to make combat feel more tactical, and then impose this tactical combat framework on the strategic map.  That decision created loads of obvious and basic problems that many others have already commented on in the context of reviewing Civ 5: e.g., tactical battles that stretch over hundreds of years, a confused crowding of the campaign map with units, etc.  Because there was a lot to like about Civ 5, I had hoped that Civ 6 would find a way to improve some of these issues.  Unfortunately, they seem to have gotten worse.The first and most obvious problems with Civ 6 relate to the complete inability of the AI to play the game.  Computer players in Civ 5 were dumb, but in Civ 6 now they are beyond dumb- they simply cannot function in a way that is rational at the most basic levels.  With respect to discrete tactical battles that involve more than a couple of units, the AI is utterly helpless.   It neither exploits advantages or guards against weaknesses- not even to the limited extent the AI could do these things in Civ 5.  The AI is even worse when it comes to managing armies at a strategic level.  The AI is utterly unable to mount an effective invasion force even between two neighboring cities on the same continent, let alone on a broader scale.   Adding water tiles to the mix completely flummoxes the AI, as units without escort repeated kill themselves by hurling themselves at your naval units and well-fortified coastal cities, without support or the slightest possible chance of success.  Forget the significant overseas naval invasions that the AI would sometimes surprise you with in Civ 4: that is completely beyond the capabilities of this game.  I have played  Civ 6 quite a bit already have yet to have an interesting tactical engagement with a computer player (fighting of hordes of uncoordinated horsemen is not interesting).  On top of all that, for some reason, the AI in Civ 6 seems much worse than ever before at advancing itself technically, and seems to prefer spawning hordes of older units to mindlessly throw at you.  I am not saying that I am some genius and that I am so much smarter than the AI.  Rather, I am saying that a lobster is smarter than the AI.  In sum, the dynamics of turn-based tactical combat on the hex-based strategic map are just too much for any AI to handle.But the problem goes beyond just the AI and the Computer players' inability to play.  In essence, I can understand why the AI has problems, because I too find it exceedingly difficult to assemble and move even a modest-sized mixed-unit force from one place to another.  Because units can no longer be organized into stacks, each step in the process of mustering an army, moving it, transporting it, supporting it, and attacking with it, is a horrid logistical mess.  And because of that, each step takes multiple turns, so if you try to do it in an organized way, many years will pass (hundreds of years if you are early on in the game), units will obsolete, etc., all of which is just dumb.  And again, Civ 6 exacerbates rather than alleviates these problems by adding layers of additional technologies, structures, and districts needed to recruit and organize a mixed-unit army.  For example, I used to enjoy putting together a solid force of land units supported by a navy, and move them over to assault coastal cities.  That was fun in Civ 4, a real pain but doable in Civ 5, and torture in Civ 6.  At the most basic level, Civ 5's experiment with attempting to overlay mixed-unit-tactical combat on the strategic map has failed on multiple levels, and Civ 6 has amplified that failure.  The AI can't handle it, and although it can be fun in very limited circumstances, for the most part it doesn't work and is more of a pain than a benefit.I'm not sure what to recommend.  An improvement in the AI would be a big help, but given the complexity of this game, I am not sure that is possible for any AI to handle it.  Another option would be to allow a partial or total stacking of units, which could not only help the AI, but solve a lot of other messes created by the hex system.  Regardless, something needs to be done, as the game really does not work as it stands."

That said, the work it needs is not what Firaxis' current development path appears to be prioritizing.Civilization 6 is in a weird place right now. It's been over a year since launch and only minor improvements have occurred with the game's core features, and not in its most critical failing areas (like AI). Firaxis at the same time, is only producing content ""culture"" packs of new civs and scenarios without any announcement about an expansion that would add new features, techs, or alter elements of balance and pacing. This has set a lot of the community against them, and frankly, they're right to do so. The individual/paired civ DLC packs are BS because they don't address the thing we all actually want: new and/or improved *mechanics* and tuning on AI and Diplomacy. That said however,  I went back to Civ 5 for a minute in order to refresh my memory and . . . frankly Civ 6 at its base is fundamentally better than Civ 5 with all of its DLC with the exception of content (# of civs mostly). All the features from the fully expanded 5 are present in 6 either fully or in a way that's either improved upon or just altered in a manner that's different enough to make a direct comparison invalid. So for the question of ""is this vanilla product better than the prior installment's vanilla product?"" Yes. It is. It gets a thumbs up for that reason. However, this game REALLY needs new mechanical content and re-balancing/tuning. Especially when it comes to pacing the tech/civic development. Splitting technology into a tech tree and a new ""Civics"" tree means you burn through both more quickly (especially the civics, of which there are far fewer) and end up over developed in both well ahead of the timeframe you would expect *even when you don't focus on it*. I have consistently maxed both trees out at around the 50-60% range of turns passed in a game on normal and epic game speeds. In the late game you can develop replacement techs faster than you can build the unit a tech unlocks. It's ridiculous (you need a mod to correct this now, but you shouldn't have to). What the game needs (desperately) is an expansion like Civ 4's Beyond the Sword, which brings in some more late-game tech, potentially brings back corporations and natural disasters, rebalances the development path, and improves AI so it's less reliant on starting buffs to be competitive. Ideally, they'd improve upon that idea and integrate more modern issues too, like terrorism from non-state actors, corruption of government, and potentially civil disturbances due to cultural/ideological clash within your own civ. These elements might clash with the comic book/cartoony/PC theme the game has embraced though, which is a shame. But sticking with the release of only small content DLC packs makes me (and I think others) worried that no such expansion is on the way any time soon. You'd expect at least an announcement by now, anyway. The ball is in Firaxis' court to address the problems with their game, but all is quiet on that front thus far. Hopefully, this will change soon.(EDIT: Aaaand a week later now, they announce Rise and Fall. Here's hoping it's good!)"

I used to hate anything 4x/grand strat/rts-related, but this game sold me. I found Civ VI to be fun, quick to pick up, easy to learn the deeper mechanics and strategies and crack-level addictive. I now understand the 'just one more turn' jokes. I've spent a lot of hours trying out various civs, playstyles, victory strategies and all the rest. There's a lot to experiment with. Haven't played multiplayer so can't comment on that. There's a good wealth of Workshop mods as well, I particularly enjoy the mods that add improvements and balancing to the core game. The devs are sold on keeping this game going as well, it's a shame that so many civs weren't shipped with the core game and left as DLC but when on sale it's not too bad to snatch up the ones you're missing. Negatives I would say, personally, the AI aren't as intelligent as I'd like them to be. Difficulty doesn't seem to change their behaviours much either, and even with AI-adjusting mods they are still pretty predictable. Essentially, I would have liked the AI to be more active and crafty. Sometimes multiple eras go by without a single notable war. Another gripe, again with the AI, is that trying to conduct a joint war with another civ is pointless. The other civ almost always takes a back seat and does absolutely nothing while you do all the work. It'd be nice to have a 'buffs' difficulty like what is currently implemented (bonus/minus to certain aspects for AI and the player) and an 'AI difficulty' so I can game fairly with no bonus/minus on Prince but compete against some very crafty, intelligent opponents. Perhaps this is where I need to hop into multiplayer. All together, though, fantastic game and a great starting point for those wanting to get into Civ or the majority of other 4x/grand strat franchises."

I'd love to know what it'd be like to play in Eurasia or Africa but after restarting 20 times I always started in South America and on occassion North America despite trying several different civilizations.The setup tool never remembers what you selected previously so if you have to click everything to get what you want.There are NO scenarios!  Unless you play online in multiplayer.  NOT A ONE.  But, I they just released the Vikings for an extra $5.  How ridicules.  You can't create your own maps, scenarios, or mods.  There are a lot less civilizations as well.I will say one thing for this game.  Because of the limitations and what I spelled out above you will not find it addciting as earlier versions.  I'd wait to buy it until after all their B.S. of trying to ring extra money from you for something as petty as a single civlization (e.g. Poland) is over with.  This game feels unfinished and the lack of maps, ability to edit and make maps and scenarios makes it a bore.  Maybe in a couple years it'd be worth buying."

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2016 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 30 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I was releuctant at first to accept the new city-building feature of the game, but as my 225+ hours of gameplay will tell you, I quickly fell in love. As perhaps the biggest change to the game, it has added a new dimension to Civilization, changing it just enough to keep it interesting but not so much that the game is unrecognizable *glares accusingly at Civilization Beyond Earth*. The game has been great for a Civilization veteran like me as well as my rookie friends. I anxiously await the next expansion."

I haven't touched Civ 5, since Civ 6 came out - it has captured my attention and is a fresh experience that I am continuing to enjoy, after almost 2,000 hours in game.If you like Civ, get this game and stop listening to all of the nit picking.  90% of the () complaints are either: A. Things that you will get used to (or even come to enjoy, like I did with the graphics) B. Things that you can fix/change with Mods (like the UI, including the missing Produciton Queue)C. Are complaints from people who already didn't like the major strategic changes from 4 to 5 (they didn't undo hexes and 1UPT). D. Are the top 10% of Civ players annoyed that the AI isn't challeninging enough (which is true compared to past versions of the game).  If you have never played Civ, you are doing yourself a dis-service.  The originator of the enitre 4x Genre, Civ 6 deserves it's place at the top of any strategic game player's library.  Some would reccomend getting a full version of Civ 5 with all the bells and whistles on some sale, but at this point - I would actually reccomend just jumping into Civ 6.  I'm not going to go into all the details of what this game is about, or what's better about 6 vs 5 vs 4, etc.  but it is a more evolved and full featured game.  Personally I simply cannot go back to playing 5 or 4.If you like Civ 4, and specificlay don't like Civ 5 - honestly, this is probably not the game for you.  It still as 1 Unit Per Tile, it still has hexes, and it doesn't have the years of stability and full conversion mods you are probably used to.At this point, I  reccomend getting it on sale.

With the addition of Gathering Storm, it's easily the best 4X game I've ever played. That being said, it's always been marked by bad publicity, so I'm going to try to explain the game's history and mixed rating. At launch, people said it was worse than V, largely because of a few bugs that have since been resolved and new mechanics that weren't explained well, but also because V is a very good game in its own right and some people didn't want big changes from it. After launch, people criticized the DLC policy -- that is, having each added Civ be its own DLC. They've reverted to big expansions now that add both Civs and new mechanics, though a large number of Civs are still purchased separately. Last year, Redshell was exposed in a large number of games, including Civ VI. It's been removed now. Now, there's controversy over part of the EULA which people are misrepresenting as something specific to this game. I'm not going to address whether I think the criticisms the game has received are valid or not, nor am I qualified to. I just wanted everyone to be aware of the game's history and one fact: none of the major criticisms the game has faced are because the actual gameplay isn't fun. It's a very good game that's had a lot of bad things surround it, which has given it a very mixed reception.tl;dr The mixed rating is not due to the actual gameplay. If you play the game, you will enjoy it."

Having played 400+ hours on Civ 5, I had become accustomed to its style and depth, as well as the art style.Civ 6 has proven to replace its predecessor for me in under 20 hours. There's a great deal more routes to take in every stage of the game, making it feel less linear than 5. Without going into much detail, the main concerns of AI stupidity haven't made themselves apparent to me, and I quite like the more cartoonish style. Religion is much more dynamic now, with theological combat being separate from diplomacy and allowing you to essentially play two games at once.City planning is ever more important with the district system, but it's now much easier to build a sizeable empire with the amenity and loyalty systems that replace the empire-wide happiness system in 5 - this now feels more like an empire-based game, encouraging you to sprawl outwards instead of sticking to a few cities as your luxuries become more stretched (at least from my previous game tactics).The AI are far from perfect, not using units to their potentials (particularly in terms of religion), but the grievance system makes a certain amount of sense and is more transparent than the warmonger system of 5.Overall, I would definitely recommend the platinum edition when it's on sale (£40), but it would be very overpriced otherwise."

I'd only recommend the Gold Edition if it's on sale (like Summer Sale discount), because it's the best deal. + The game expands on the features brought in Civ 5 BNW and G&K+ Cities are much more interactive to develop and the district system is very enjoyable to experience+ Workshop mods can be used in multiplayer without file adjustments like in Civ 5- AI is not improved, but not that much worse; I've noticed city spam is a big issue however- Tech Tree order feels off to me, and seems to have some early dead ends* Overall it's not as bad as some say, but it is far from perfect. It doesn't live up to Civ 5's reputation, but it has a lot of potentialEdit: DO NOT BUY THE BASE GAME ALONE (you can't get the bundles for yourself and buying the civ packs separate is a scam)"

In all reality the game is very fun, well made, pretty, and better than the majority of games in it's genre. The real problem comes in living up to the Civilization name, specifically because Civ V is one of the greatest video games in history, and Civ V is also on sale for like 5 dollars all the time.The majority of complaints when Civ VI came out have been solved: we have mods now, the AI is smarter than it once was and less needlessly hostile, and most glitches have been ironed out. I think the art direction is perfectly fine, and I think it's just a vocal minority that isn't okay with the new style. The new district system, City-State Envoy system, and seperate Civic and Tech trees make every game of Civ VI more different than a game of Civ V. After putting hundreds of hours into both games, I can say for certain that I have a more varied experience every time I play Civ VI, but that still doesn't change the fact that something feels missing compared to Civ V. The lack of world congress may be it, but I think a large factor is that it simply isn't a cornerstone of the Steam community yet, and thus can't be enjoyed with as many friends as people do when they play Civilization V online."

In those days you could make a cup of tea and have a bite to eat while it terraformed your playing area at the start. Understandably, there's got to be something in it that has grabbed my imagination and held it for so long. Ultimately, it's a turn based management game. Every turn decisions need to be made on technology, military, industry, empire expansion, trade, diplomacy. Nowadays the range of decisions has expanded considerably from those early days. The graphics are infinitely better as you'd expect and the game play far more complex. Its a compelling game that rewards the thinking player."

It has a lot of improvements over V but each game has their ups and downs.Civ V is more rigid but on a grander scale. The maps are bigger etc. It's also familiar and relatively simple to grasp.Civ VI feels more streamlined and scaled down but with more attention to detail and playstyles and things you can do overall.   The maps are smaller, the Earth Map isn't anywhere near as big as it was in Civ V which was a huge bummer to me but apparently that's just because of the way Gathering Storm works and it would cause too many issues on a larger scale.    The AI is a lot better compared to Civ V, there's a lot more diplomatic options you can use like asking civs to join in current conflicts and wars, and you can make alliances which level up the longer you have them.Most importantly though is the nukes. They're beautiful. I thought they were great in 5 but in 6 they are absolutely devastating. The fallout they leave behind damages units if they end their turn in it, and it also prevents absolutely any activity on the tiles they infect, including cities. So if fallout contaminates a city it's pretty much unable to do anything useful until it gets cleaned up."

To think that all they need to do to take away ownership or how you play a game, no matter how old the game is, is just to update a new user agreement.That would be like Nintendo in the 80's locking a NES copy of Super Mario with radio waves and not letting you play it unless you mailed them a signed letter.

I feel much like I did with the Beyond Earth one … bored. I hope they fix a lot of things, because I only played a few games when Beyond Earth was released and deleted it a few days a later (reinstalled a few weeks ago, but couldn’t play an hour before deleting it again.) Civ 6 is looking like a good candidate for that.So the first thing I notice is that I can’t modify my civilization / ruler name and can’t rename cities. This bothers me a lot. I know not everyone feels that way, but I recall that always being an option. I would rather lead the people rather than a leader that the company selected for me. I mean they allow you to customize the religion so why not the other stuff? I remember playing hot seat with my brother with Civ 2, 3 and 4 all the time and we both did it. The other thing I noticed was the lack of map options. Seriously I can’t stand city states and I want them off, and I know I am not the only one that feels that way. I also noticed that I couldn’t even set how many of them popped up. So I started and had one right north of me, south of me and two my west. East was water so I am sure if it wasn’t there would be another there.Here are a few notes (and these are my opinions not an attempt at insulting anyone):1.	Terrible AI!a.	The AI can’t seem to take my cities even when they are barely defended and swarmed by the AI units. They also can’t defend cities very well.b.	Unescorted settlers keep coming to my border. “Thanks, again for the free city!” I swear the last game on a standard map I build 4 or 5 cities from settlers I captured. I wasn’t even looking they just popped up near my units!c.	Diplomacy is like playing Axis and Allies with a bunch of ten year olds. So instead of playing nice I found that domination was the way to go.d.	Strange expansion. Cities all over the place or settling places that is rather poorly suited for a city.e.	Barbarians are tougher than the nations!2.	Districts Fail!a.	Nice idea, but it just makes building take even longer. I get they want to force people to specialize cities, but it doesn’t work in my opinion. This was really something right out of the Endless Legend game which isn’t installed on my computer anymore; it didn’t work for that and I don’t see it working  for Civ without major changes.b.	They look terrible. If they are built next to the city center can it look like the city and blend together? To add to the terrible look the trade route roads get really messy especially playing as Rome. (and borders are terrible)c.	The cost scaling is harsh. I don’t understand that just because one city has a port then why does it cost more for the next city to build one? If history went with this then the US would never have left the eastern seaboard!3.	Wonders – not feeling it.a.	Them being outside of cities doesn’t always make sense.  Some don’t justify needing the entire square because they are not really that big. Pyramids I understand, but Eifel Tower, an opera house taking up essentially the same space as a metro downtown? b.	They are pretty weak. That is a lot of time spent making something that just doesn’t have much impact especially since I take up some usable plot of land.4.	Civilian units get more expensive for each one you buy / build. I can’t fathom why it should matter that because one city built some improvements that another city would have to pay more. This really slows down the empire building aspect of the game I like. It took so long that I decided to just send my Army on the war path and forget all those fancy things like farms, mines and luxury … that stuff is for the weak.5.	Build queue? Why is this thing missing? I mean does it make sense that when the crap hits the fan that the city says, “No sir you can’t train a slinger, we are building a cultural district that will be ready in a few centuries and we can’t stop working on it for anything.” My response .. “Uh, you want to tell the barbarians at the gate that?” Iknow in previous Civs I used it a lot. Usually when I needed to churn out troops because Nuclear Ghandi has decided that he wants my land  so I need to pause all construction and focus on a war economy. I know that sounds like fantasy and that stuff never happens in history.6.	Border growth … how long and which tile is coming up. Oh and why do borders take so long to grow?There is probably more (UI, and confusing unit scroll), but I think that is enough of a list. I know when 5 came out there were a lot of issues and they worked it out, but still needed a lot of work.  I am now debating if I will play 6 again or wait for some fixes. I know it sounds silly, but being able to name the ruler, civ and cities is the one that doesn’t make me want to play. So what if I want to be Gozer the Gozerian of Gozeria? Oh, this had better be in a patch, if they make us pay for it then I am done with Firaxis games, after all the game was expensive enough."

Cities not properly defending themselves until an encampment district is built ( every city should have a military unit in it at all time's anyway to defend against Barbarian's, but i miss Cities being able to shoot at range like in Civ5)8.  Way too easy too boost Tech's ( nothing like being four ages ahead of Diety AI )9.  Way too easy overall, upon playing the 1st game realizing it's way too easy, start a new game on Diety as Rome, beat it first time through like a bad joke (have over 600+ hrs in Civ 5 & still have not beaten the game on Diety)  Overall if you have never played a Civ game & want to start the Series this is a great game for you, if your a Diehard Civ fan keep playing Civ5 as its way better overall"

However, there are a few reasons I can't recommend it right now.1: The AI is godawful. You thought the AI in Civ V was bad, next to the Civ VI AI however, it looks pretty smart. I think part of the reason the AI is so bad is because they fleshed out the cities into districts. This requires a large amount of planning, something the AI is incapable of. You often find the AI settling in places where they won't be able to take advantage of their district placement. In the event the AI settles a city in a good spot, they place the district in random (it might actually be a RNG controlling this) places where it serves no purpose. When you get into wars with the AI, it is PATHETICALLY easy to fight and EXTREMELY predictable. The AI is only a challenge in wars when they have a sheer numbers/tech advantage, and I don't mean one civ, I mean like a 3v1 where they have one tier unit above you. In higher difficulties the AI units deal more damage, which doesn't actually make it any harder, it just draws out wars because the AI is so stupid in the first place it won't do anything with them. The AI also doesn't get rid of units, so if it never gets iron, you can bet there will be warriors attacking your infantry.2: UI/tips are awful. The UI, while cleaner, is more confusing because you have to click 3 buttons where you should only have to click 1, and the tool tips are absolutely no help. I had no idea how to mannually open my government tab until the medieval era. The tool tips offer no help. Oh, you put a city under siege. Ok, what does that do? Oh, the garrison won't heal (I had to look this up online, it wasn't even in the civlopedia).3: Wonders: I HATE how the wonders take up a tile now. This seemed like a cool idea in theory, but in practice it is just bad. Espesially now that you have to build districts, you are REALLY pressed for tile space. Oftentimes, the wonder isn't worth it anyway.4: The split of the tech tree into science and culture. Again, something that sounds really cool, but was poorly implemented into the game. The rate of advancement can be rather...skewed sometimes. With the eureka moments, you can often get almost all techs in half the time if you plan it out, which is crazy.I have no doubt that the game will become more streamlined and simpler after some patches and maybe and expansion or two, and the game is really fun as is. However, I cannot recommend it in its current state unless you are a big fan of the civ series.Verdict: 6/10, not enough cowbell."

While the art style of the game has been decisive from the start, I for one enjoy the more cartoon-y aesthetic, especially when it comes to the animated leaders. They are extremely expressive, granted some more than others, and I feel they greatly contribute to the interactivity of the game.Don't get me wrong, the game is by no means perfect. The most glaring flaw by far for me is the AI. It often seems unable to prioritise correctly, not using its bonuses to their proper effect. The AI, in my experience, rarely conducts war well, relying on sheer number rather than using proper strategy to win, resulting in quite easy to fend off attacks. That being said, I think that the AI has greatly improved since the game was release, and hopefully it only continues to improve.I have recommended this game to friends, and I would easily recommend it again. My only caveat would be that if you're uncertain, wait for a sale - but that stands true of almost any game."

When the last DLC pack of the Deluxe edition was announced, people were obviously pissed. The deluxe edition was stating that buying it was cheaper than buying each DLC individually. This was proven false as in Brazil you would have to pay like 10-15 dollars more for the deluxe edition. I pointed out (in a respectful way) that this might constitute grounds for legal action. I was summarily banned from the forums. Once that ban was finished, I asked on the forums if it is usual for moderators to abuse the power in such way. Obviously I was banned yet again.It is true that they added a few more DLCs to break even so it is not false advertising anymore, but it was for a time.The game is average, I find civ 5 more enjoyable (mostly because of the expansions and mods), but I can't recommend it when the forum moderators are so toxic and abuse power so blatantly.Proof of what I am saying is found in my public artwork folder."

During wars the AI often just walks to your cities without attacking anything and just waits within the range of the defending archers.- There is no feeling that your civilization is taking off.

Moreover, some passive bonuses are not directly displayed in the tech tree and are only shown via Mouse over. The cultural tech tree is even worse, since there are only four different icons for policies:- You have to wait for the leader animations to accept/refuse an AI initiated deal. Pressing escape aborts the whole diplomacy.- The GUI provides almost no info about the adjacency bonus, which you gain by building an improvement or an district- The City screen is cluttered (e.g. the main city screen only shows food income. Food surplus is hidden in a sub screen)- You have to select the city before you can see the maximum populace for the city- Warnings only pop up if cities are overpopulated and not if fully populated- Some sub windows (Building selection, Carawan destination) are drawn ontop of other windows in a weird way:- The scrolling via moving the mouse to the screen edges does not work well. - The icons and text are often very large, presumably because they are optimized for touch or controller input giving you the feel of a console port.- You cannot bypass automatic unit rotation by quickly selecting another unit after the first unit has finished moving.

Districts and wonder placement and the way they effect the tiles around them add a gigantic layer of depth to city management. Corps and army mechanics give the perfect compromise to the unit stacking of 4 without being too obnoxious, support units like siege towers and medics add a much needed depth to the combat and the new government system allows you to tailor your entire civilization towards your victory goal like never before. Civilization 6 is also a beautiful game, hands down the best the series has looked.It's not all fun and rainbows though, the single biggest complaint of mine is the same as it was in 5... You really do need to buy the expensive DLCs to fix some of the fundamentally broken aspects of the game. Rise and Fall makes the AI the best it has ever been, giving you opportunities to create political justifications for war and lessens the impact of annihilating Civs that declare war on you. Never again will the Aztec come out of nowhere with a surprise war with the end resulting in the player being globally vilified for winning the war! It also adds in a loyalty system which is a much needed political layer of difficulty which can hinder a warmongering Civ if they cannot generate golden ages as cities can become rebellious and join other Civilizations. Gathering Storm adds in natural disasters that a savvy Civ can use to their advantage with flood planes and volcanos creating fertile soil, and natural disasters becoming a political weapon in the late game that can be manipulated into events where you can garner huge favour and benefits from aiding a victim state or Civ. Global pollution also plays a huge role in the expansion, if the co2 levels reach dangerous levels coastal cities become damaged or destroyed and natural disasters become more frequent. Global warming much like the other aspects of the DLC can be manipulated into political war, which is a common and invited theme of Gathering Storm. Overall Gathering Storm seems to be less impactful than Rise and Fall but it is still a great expansion.The other huge issue for me is the pricing. I did get the game and both expansions for around £50 in the recent Gathering Storm sale but I am still missing content which I believe was purposefully cut out from the game upon release in order to sell Civilizations as DLC and make the Deluxe edition more enticing. This is not an uncommon practice but it does feel unethical when you go to play a structured scenario 'campaign' and realise that you have NONE. They are all locked behind paywalls which is a series first, and the scenario/Civilization packs combined cost more than Gathering Storm! Not to mention that the DLC Civilizations are objectively much stronger than the ones included with the game adding a thin layer of Pay2Win.[TL;DR]Overall the game is phenominal, adding in features I have only dreamt about in the past but the insane pricing and the way the game is spliced into pieces and sold as expensive chunks stops it from being a must buy for me. I could sit for hours and talk about how great the game is but when the question of seller ethics degrade the game into a 'buy on sale' title you know they are bad.9/10 game with 4/10 value making it a title you should strictly wait to be included in a sale. I hate publishers. You are a business that exists to generate profits, I respect that I really do but there are limits."

I have been playing video games since 1985 and I've clocked countless hours on the Civ franchise, I have played on pretty much all of the PC iterations.  This is the first Civ game I do not like.  The summarize the game, great ideas and concepts, poor execution.  A few examples:Lenses:  Great idea, allowing you to focus certain aspect of the map such as good colonization spots.   Poor execution, cannot focus on strategic stuff such as units or special resources.Luxuries:  One luxury only serves 4 cities.  Worst, if you have more of them, you cannot use them if you have more cities, you can only trade them.  Even more aggravating, you do not have access to a report showing you who got what to figure out the best deal you could make.  You need to cycle all of the leaders and test them individually for interest...Reports:  No useful reports.  In previous games you could access reports and easily figure out where resources were needed, diplomatic landscape, etc...  Not in CIV 6.Unit management:  Trying to find a specific unit...  You need to pick one unit, then click the name of the unit in order to see a scrolling list of all of the units...  The UI is also kind of wonky and when you think you are specifying  a destination for a unit, it sometimes jumps to another unit and by the time you figure it out it already jumped to another one.  Good luck finding out which unit you ordered to somewhere if you missed it (or if you have many of them).Units:  Corps and army add some interesting flavour to late game and is ok, but waging war is a pain in the butt.  Special units have all kind of abilities, which are not documented in Civpedia and you need to scour the internet to find out about them (maybe).Cities:  You do not get punished for distance from the capital, but you can get seriously punished with the amenities system and it could have been better (especially with the luxury system).  My biggest gripe:  NO PRODUCTION QUEUES!  With the district system, especially because of the limiting factors attached to the cities, they could have at least provided the abilities to create units in parallels.  For instance, city center could produce anything, specialized districts could produce stuff in parallel: Encampment for military, Commercial for trader and commercial building, city center whatever else.War:  So...  I got this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Kongo neighbour who kept declaring war on me.  Managed to keep him at bay but everytime I would manage to get near his town, he would keep suing for peace then after refusing a few time, I would have 2 other power declaring war on me.  I finally managed to get one of his towns, get two other morons declaring war on me, managed to make peace with one of them, the other kept insisting to receive ridiculous amounts of money.  Kept going, not understanding why I was still losing trade route, since the guy I was at war with was landlocked,  just to find out that my ALLY was nerfing them and sent troops after me.  That is when I rage quitted.To finish up:  I do like the districts idea, adds an interesting  level of complexity and the Great Wonder mechanics are also interesting.  The religion system is ok, I like the civics/technology mechanics, they are a neat idea (especially insights) and tie in neatly science and culture in the game as a coherent system.  But the lack of in-game information about special units, wonky UI, strategic overview information panel and overall frustrating war mechanics, I cannot recommand this iteration of Civilization.  The leaders are outrageously ugly, graphical animation needs to be turned off if you want to keep the game pace bearable (especially late game), the historical comments are just meh and you just cannot get that mighty imperial feeling from being limited to a few cities...  Go for CIV 5 with all of the major expansion instead (or Civ 4)."

Once everyone's borders lock tight against each other you're really just stuck with the same Aztec and Babylonian neighbours in space as you had pushing right up against your borders in 1000BCE. Civ challenges you to build an empire to stand the test of time. It doesn't mention that every single one of your end game neighbours will also have 'stood the test of time'. There is no split of the Holy Roman Empire, no German unification, no decolonisation of Africa, no life. The game is essentially about a bunch of fat men crammed into an elevator bouncing off each other's beer guts. There are nearly 200 countries in the world today, try telling that to Civ."

Civilization VI takes the fun to a whole new level of intensity with the improved AI, the enhanced art, & the combat systems. I only came to Civ V lately, as in this year. I’ve barely played a bit of the predecessors, just to get an idea of what I missed before the paragon that Civ V is graced my monitor. There are balancing issues yet with Civ VI. And the achievements need more challenge. But, for those who may be waiting for some of the reviews, I will just give you my list of 16 reasons I think the game succeeds as an heir to the Civilization throne. It’s much more than just the lovely map art, & the view of a map before the world is uncovered. They improve decision making just like all the other menus in the game. Pins are added to mark the map for exploration. You can retire a GP, convert him to a collectible or unit upgrade, keep him around for passive boosts, or even pass on him altogether; saving your points for the next GP in the lineup. If you want a GP & are losing to another civ, you can throw some hard earned gold into the GP pool to steal him before they are able to recruit him.

But, also you can view a gallery of all your collected art & relics anytime, which are also obtained as relics from religious martyrs, & found in villages. Where movement is slowed down from geographical features on the map, you quickly feel more boxed in at first. But, this feels more natural because you begin to live in your own civ, not really moving out to see the world until mid-game or later. This forces you to be more aware of your neighbors than it did when you branched out all over the map.  This is actually going back to Civ IV &, it definitely is a no-brainer. No reason why we shouldn’t be able to bind a soldier to our settler & send him around the world. Being able to build armies & regiments takes the warfare to a new level, in terms of power on the front line in a small hex of space. Lends a greater personal investment in “The Great White Arrows,” when you know you are sending them to their death with 3 promotion levels down the drain. There is a randomization feature that is great for getting these crazy names, if you don’t want to name them Jack or Fred.  Yet, options are still present for making individual road segments with the engineers. Military engineers & builders are like specialists, compared to the workers from Civ V who did it all. The trade routes system is simpler to use, but you can NOT tell where you last sent specific routes. Of course this doesn’t seem to be a problem, since it’s easier to see at a glance & by popping out the right side tab where you already have routes currently.  You can boost your bank account by investing in the Commercial Hub, or beef up production, Military, or Science at any time you need an edge in a certain direction. This gives the player more control over the outcome, & certainly allows for serious strategy. Wonders are bigger. Also, you can see the great works & trade them. Camera orientation during combat needs correction. It is necessary to edit game files to gain certain optional controls that should have been in- game, like spinning the map & stopping the infernal unit auto-advance. It does have the appearance that they weren’t quite finished with this aspect of the game at release. The art & graphic changes add greatly to the experience. For example, you can hover over districts in other civs to spy out what great works are hidden in which buildings, if you are planning to steal some art.  Conquering a CS removes those resources & the protection buffer they provide from the other civs. You also have the ability to conscript their military. So, it’s more to your benefit to keep the CS intact. You have a choice about whether or not to invest in training spies. You can choose what action they take; steal art, siphon money, sabotage production by burning buildings, etc. Or, you may use them as counterspies, protecting specific buildings & their adjacencies. Roleplay is enhanced by choices for escape when detected. If you capture an enemy spy, you may trade him back to the opponent, or not.  Not only are the wonders showcased on individual tiles, but they’ve made the details more visible, like mine cars zipping around the track. The art & music become a part of the world around you, with increased abilities to place & move works physically. Before, you had little options for dealing with those missionaries wondering into your civ, tearing apart the fabric of your culture. You couldn’t attack them or remove them with a unit without a war dec. The inquisition is more realistic, & dying apostles leave behind relics, which can be placed in temples, or traded as valued great works or stolen. I did find it unfortunate that I can’t rename my religion to a certain denominational name if I choose the Christianity symbol. You are able to choose a generic zodiac symbol & give it a name of choice, but that really is illogical. You should ideally be given more choices in personalization, not less than in Civ V.  Alliances are totally expanded, allowing you to form relationships on different levels. It’s possible to convince the AI to change its plan to attack. The AI is more responsive to diplomacy, behaves more rationally & gives you feedback on how you are meeting their agenda. You are given more options for holding the AI accountable, as in being able to denounce them, or make them pay for spying on you. Sometimes the option appears to ask them to remove their units from your borders. But, this is not yet consistent.  Over time, they fade from the game as you begin to encounter other civs. I don’t encounter pirates in international waters. A slider to increase the appearance of barbs would be great. Either way, the combat is definitely one of the best improvements in the game. More siege equipment is available. The improved landscape features allow for greater defensive power. Fighting is more visible & realistic looking. Some are pulled from the Tech tree, the ideologies, & policies of Civ V. Taken together with the Tech tree, it adds a masterful touch to the gameplay & just makes more sense. With the system of card slotting & governments whichever you choose, you can reach the victory of your choice. This expansion gives more control over boosts, & allows you the chance to steamroll your game, if you are wise enough to “lead your people well.” Comments & questions are welcome."

Each time they come up with a title which keeps me sit infront of my PC and greed me to commit 1 more TURN .Civ VI feels more dynamic. It's moved away from a static progression style for your civics, government and research where once you picked an option, it was there to build on for the rest of the game. VI lets you do things like gear your social policies toward producing a more effective military, and after the completely justified war, shift focus to rebuilding your cities and keeping your post-war populace happy.Speaking of war, you can now also use casus belli - justified reasons for conflict with enemy Civs -to massively reduce the diplomatic penalty for warmongering usually tacked on to declarations of war.Progression on the huge scientific research tree is now no longer entirely determined by an abstract ""science"" production value, and you can get contextual bonuses based on how you play. Kill an enemy with slings, get a bonus to discovering Archery.The breadth of the new civic system, the expanded cities, deeper diplomacy and research tree make your choices feel more personal, important and specialised. You feel like your Civ is your own, not like you're racing to the end of the tech tree for the umpteenth timeCivilization VI in my opinion is a must buy . There have been a lot of improvements and many new models have been set up giving players more openess in the game."

This review is after ~50 hours of game time.Full Video:lets get the bad sorted... And this is mostly contained to two areas, that do impact the game quite a bit, these are AI and the Interface.The Ai is bad. It makes illogical choices, it uses it's resources badly and even on higher difficulties and with the cheating the Ai does, it still doesn't make sense. On top of the cheating Ai, it also tries to keep up with tech by just skipping entire trees of research. Which is very frustrating when they are somehow landing on the moon, without having done any of the research. which also makes your spies quite a bit less useful.Secondly - the UI is pretty sub-par. Information is often hidden behind several screens and tabs and even explanations on certain features (how do cities without amenities rebel game? HOW?). in their quest to show us the damn pretty graphics and animations, they have stripped important information away, and in a game where every bit of information matters, that is not cool. I hope mods will fix this problem asap even if the developers don't, as most of this information is available in the game in some form. Thankfully we do have mod-support from day one and that's a good thing. As i said, there are 2 main drawbacks, and those are it - if you can deal with those this game is damn good. The removal of global happiness for a multi- faceted system is great and gives more ""local"" controls, the addition of district is also a nice change and provides more choices to the player and information they have to weight in.I even like the switch with the wonders taking up a physical tile and the builders having limited actions.The one aspect i'm still divided on is the tech tree, as while i love the new civics system and government options, i don't like that the tech tree feels quite dressed down due to the splitting into two segments.Overal, i like the game quite a bit and find that the major issues are very annoying and frustrating - but for me at least, not game breaking."

It definitely feels like the most polished version.I’m loving the depth we’re now seeing with Nations, leaders, Wonders, Natural Wonders. The naming of the mountain ranges, seas & major landmarks is a great touch which enhances this depth. The previous versions had espionage, diplomacy, & environmental effects of sorts but the new updates really make them a part of your strategy, rather than simply random events to be managed. The same goes for the addition of governors & more control over great people & their generation.The way you can develop your government in a myriad of different ways which provides a narrative as to what type of people live in your empire is great. It allows for some pretty crazy combinations.The new History timeline is also a nice touch.Great work, I’m looking forward to what its 7th version might be like."

The cities look great & the graphics are easy on the eyes.  I loved finding new & amazing natural wonders too.Having said that, there are some things that really get on my goat, you can't name your cities??? What were they thinking?  You do not seem to be able to put your units in sentry mode, it is fortify or skip (& sometimes there is no skip even???).  You can not use auto end turn, or it runs out of control with no way to stop it, the game even ran in the background playing whilst I tried to change the setting back!!!  Even clicking on wake unit only seem to work if you could do it in the nano second of your turn, the same for trying to move a unit.  Barbarian camps appear with no notice, & the screen does not jump to their location if they appear... nor if any inter your space, or move out of the FOW;  so every turn I have to search my large border looking for a brown camp on a brown map (I often couldnt see them if they were on a resourse on forrest or jungle).  You can not put your units into an extended move, or they run right past the bad guys, you need to move just the alotment of each turns movement, or they miss their target.  I can not bump the edge of the screen to scroll up, it will work left, right & down.  The auto explore had my scouts taking a step left, then one right for 25 turns... so I was actually left feeling tired of micro-managing & interupted by having to end every turn manually & move every unit 1 tile at a time...  so 100% for polish, but 30% for actual game play.

As such, fans of the former will appreciate the cartoony style, but might be turned off by the slower pace and greater challenge. Fans of the latter may think this is too watered down, too simplified. I appreciate the fact that this game attempts to forge its own identity and improves graphics while still feeling like the other entries. While 5 had a huge focus on armies and various combat modifiers, 6 focuses more on city building. So while the combat has certainly been simplified, the cities reach a whole new level of complexity. Now, you have districts that each take up their own tile, and placement is crucial because of various terrain modifiers. For instance, a Campus will produce extra science when placed adjacent to a mountain tile. The Harbor district must actually be built on a water tile. The Great Pyramid requires a desert tile. Each wonder takes up a tile, so you can't just pile them all up in the same city. There are so many government types in this one and I feel like they did a good job differentiating each one. You can mix and match various policies, many of which are not unique to just one type of government. Because of the new religion system, you can now have a Theocracy, which allows you to purchase military units using faith instead of gold. Faith is a new fourth commodity which is needed to purchase specific faith based buildings and units, but can also be used to unlock a Great Person early. One gripe I have is the fact that you can be very close to unlocking a Great Person only to have another player swoop in and buy it using gold or faith. This happens extremely often on higher difficulties, as if they have endless amounts of gold and faith available for that specific purpose. On the plus side, Great People are now split into different categories and there are buildings, policies, and research projects which allow you to obtain extra points in specific categories. So if you're going for a military victory, you can focus on getting Great Generals. I think the new religion system is well designed, though it is one of the more time consuming winning conditions and it does get annoying trying to hold off endless waves of enemy missionaries trying to convert all your cities. Plus, other players get royally ticked off when you try to convert their cities. Now here's where it gets tricky: you need a Great Prophet to found a religion. Each player can only get one. But there are a limited number of them, and never enough for every player. So if you don't immediately start working toward a religion, you may miss out. Also, if another player does manage to convert all your cities, then it is impossible to get your religion back. Any missionaries or apostles you recruit are followers of the religion that city currently follows. So when your Buddhist city gets converted to Catholicism, your citizens become Catholics and the only way to turn them back is to recruit a missionary from one of your other cities that still practices Buddhism.In other Civilization games, you use science to unlock new technologies. You still do that, but now you have Civics, which are unlocked through culture. This is cool because you can't just unlock everything through science alone and you're also not unlocking just one new thing at a time. In addition, you can speed up the process by meeting certain conditions. Another new system worth mentioning is amenities. In a nutshell, you need to mine, farm, or trade for shiny, valuable things to make your people happy and productive. The number you need depends on population. Otherwise, it takes forever to build stuff and they may eventually revolt.So here's what I really like about this game: you have to plan. You can't just steamroll your opponents through military might. You have to make strategic choices not just in combat, but in where and how you build your cities, which technological advancements and civics you choose, trying to fulfill conditions to get them done sooner, and maintaining diplomatic relations so you can get favorable trade deals when your people demand more amenities.What I don't like about this game is the fact that I have no interest in multiplayer and the AI ""diplomacy"" is a bit wonky. They declare war on you for the dumbest reasons. They get angry when they offer you a completely one sided trade deal and you turn them down. If you declare war on one player just once, you could find yourself getting repeatedly denounced for war mongering by every player for the rest of the match. Here's an ironic but annoying example: Ghandi declared war on me even though he was on the other side of the map and I hadn't done anything to him. He kept sending troops on boats and I kept sinking them. However, when you have battles taking place too close to a city, it creates war weariness, which lowers amenities. So as my production grinded to a halt, I attempted to negotiate peace with increasingly ludicrous offers and he simply wouldn't have it. Eventually, my people revolted, causing powerful barbarian troops to surround my capital and begin razing my farms and mines. So here I am stuck in a war I didn't provoke or start with the most unlikely antagonist and I can't produce troops, build up my city, or expand my population. As you can guess, it's more difficult to get a military victory now, but ultimately, it is for the better. It gives you more incentive to actually try to maintain peace and attempt other winning conditions. I would simply advise that you tread lightly when considering declaring war, because there is no coming back once you start down that road.In conclusion, I consider this my favorite Civilization game, I consider it an improvement over previous entires in many different ways, and I definitely recommend it!"

The game itself maybe doesn't seem so, but 30€ for a DLC that adds so little to the game. Or the new expansion pack coming out soon, 40€! Wtf?! 40€ for an expansion pack! Who tf is responsible for the marketing?! 5€ for a new Civ and a scenario??Also I don't like the cartoony style, I liked the one from Civ V much better. I see what they tried to do with that whole district thing, make the cities bigger and make it feel more lived-in, but it doesn't really work and is rather annoying imo. Also, the unexplored area is kinda beige-colored, while the area that is explored, but not in the range of vision is a brighter beige with a little transparency, and the overall game looks yellow-orangy. I don't know how many times I was sending my scouts to an already explored area cuz of that, I had to download the Civ V Clouds mod to fix that.That being said, the mods feel much more stable then on Civ V, I had like 3-4 crashes on my 60h, and that's not too bad I guess.The rest of the game really just feels like Civ V with ""brave new world"" and ""gods and kings"" already build in.Witch is not really a bad thing, and after you get used to the district system, it's actually quite fun. The first 20h I was hating the game really much, but now it feels enjoyable."

I really enjoyed the district system. It was a fun way to spread your city across the map, making elements of your infrastructure more vulnerable to enemy attacks, and vice versa. The culture update was really great, I loved culture being split off from the technology track. The new way governments work made that system feel way more useful than Civ V. This game has its flaws, but on the whole, I thought it was a good entry into the franchise. It tired a lot of innovative stuff, unlike Beyond Earth which was just a Civ V skin."

However, I feel as if nearly every improvement is nullified due to the unbalanced nature of the AI in Civ VI.I've spent hundreds of hours on Civ V, and after playing a bit of VI, I think it's time I moved back. VI simply isn't as good of a game and, arguably, not a good game in general.Its AI has infuriated me. They are very tempermental, even on the lower difficulties. They will offer bogus trades, such as 10 gold for two of your luxury resources. They will denounce you a single turn after meeting you, immediately again after the previous denunciation has expired, and for the entire length of the rest of the game, simply for following a different path of government. Diplomacy is nonexistant, and only is maintained by walking a fine line, which in turn makes the other AIs hate you. I understand that AI isn't human, but I feel as if it was better and more human-like in Civ V. It feels like the AI are playing you, instead of playing alongside you.If you have and enjoy Civ V, purchasing and playing this would most likely be a waste of time and money. If you are new to the series, only purchase Civ VI if you plan on strictly playing with humans. Otherwise, purchase Civ V. Regardless, until there's a suitable overhaul, this game cannot be recommended."

In addition to all this, it is accompanied by some new leaders and civilizations with their own leadership capabilities, a unique unit, a leader action plan, and unique improvements.When it comes to Civ 6. You play as a chosen civilization. Choosing your game avatar which gives you specific benefits.Another amazing thing is that some events can also bring a lot of benefits to you. As with floods or eruptions, damaged plates can increase their yields. The new climate system can also affect the frequency of these events.Regions are a major new feature of Civ 6 designed to move the machines of social development out of cities.Pros..Lots of content.

After 50 turns, you've pretty much won and by the time you have a modern army, you can send your modern armor against their musketmen and knights with ease because the AI really can't tech, and it never seems to upgrade its units.Diplomacy is non-existent and just straight up doesn't work, Wonders are also generally pretty weak and very few are worth losing a usable tile.I regret buying this instead of playing CIV5 and the EXCELLENT community balance patch."

Looking at the history of Civilization, and especially comparing this to Civ V, I feel that this is gonna be a great platform for future generations, to introduce them to the world of Civilization. The 60 euro price tag, can seem a bit daunting for some, but I'd recommend buying this game if you are a veteran of Civilization, and if you are new player, wait for a sale, at which time, most of the bugs that are currently in the game will have been fixed.This is what  should have been, A complete game, that doesn't feel like just another dlc with a high price tag. Best Regards,Yilmas - Staff of the  communityRight of the bat, we are met by some really astounding cinematic, a bit doe eyed characters though, and background music, This of course doesn't change the game, but makes us believe that they actually put some effort in to the game. But lets head on into the review worthy parts of the game, that we all want to know about.From the very beginning when the first gameplay videos surfaced on youtube, we were all met by a dramatic change in the style choice, which at first glance looked a bit plastic-like. Many was upset about this aspect, but I personally decided to reserve my judgement for when the game had been released.After a full standard map game on Prince, (research victory), I've come to a bit of a bland feeling about the new look. It definitely looks great on my 4k running at max settings. But does it change the gameplay in any good or bad way ? No. As the game progressed I found myself using the strategic view more and more, as the screen was cluttered with unit and information. However, this was something I was expecting as it was the same for me in Civ V. In the beginning of the game, I did feel though that the style was pretty to look at, but after some time it was the gameplay that caught me and the graphic was ignored. Which is just the way I believe Civilization should be. This game should not be selling itself on its graphics.The user interface is very clear cut, I didn't feel they were wasting the space they had, and for once the UI scaling worked great on 4k.We have all the information we need, and the rest is found through ease-of-access menu buttons, located where you would expect them.One a side note, I was very much annoyed that you couldn't right-click out of a town interface, but had to click on a unit and then right-click to hide the info-cards. The changes with the mechanics behind builders I felt to begin with was quite drastic. And as the game progressed, I've come to feel that 3 uses of a builders is a bit too little. I think 5 would be ideal (7 with policy card). But overall, it didn't change too much gameplay wise. Though the point of killing the ever-living builder principle worked out. All right, so this is probably the biggest difference between Civ V and Civ VI. The districts. Even after a full game, I still don't know whether or not I like them as much as having multiple buildings. Because let's face it, they are basically just buildings. And with the builders mechanic change, the districts is just a way to fill out those improvement slots that are left available now. Can you dedicate a city for one or two purposes, yes. Could you do it in Civ V, yes. Does it feel different after a full game, no. Sure the cities looks much nicer than Civ V, with these new districts. But I just don't feel like it makes such a big change in the game as it was promoted to do.I decided to bump this sections rating, by ""1"" because of the aesthetic aspect that the districts definitely brings.The civic or policy aspect of the game has been changed quite drastically compared to civ V. But I really love this new iteration of it. I feel you have so much more power over the customization of your nation's policies. And the use of the governments are perfect. Especially the ""legacy"" attributes are a nice idea.I love the new relation window, as it gives you much more useful information about the other leaders. And the feature of each leader having a secret and known ""policy"" was integrated perfectly in my mind. Though it does take some time to get used to it.I expect Firaxis will be releasing a patch (once all the crash-fixes are done) to boost the AI's strategies. Now of course, I only played it on Prince difficulty, but the AI compared to Civ V was a bit dumb at times. Moving too much around instead of attacking, and misplacing the encampment districts."

When I saw the trailer for civ 6, I couldn't have been more exited. I even decided to pay extra for the ""digital deluxe"" edition, which at the time said it would come with the expansions that would eventually be released. The game is solid, not as amazing as previous entries, but it's fun. The new mechanics like religious wars, and the new ways builders work is a lot of fun, I was really enjoying the game.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game because of how 2K has handled it. This game's EULA basically tells you that it will steal all of your information, I'm sure you've seen this in other reviews, but that's not my only issue. On top of the disgusting invasion of privacy that is their EULA, they make it so the additional civs you can play as that you can pay for have a huge edge, so players HAVE to buy them so stand a chance against others who have already purchased it. All that is enough for me to tell you not to buy this game, but I have personally been burned be 2K with how they handled this game. As I said, I purchased the digital deluxe edition, and at the time, I was told by 2K that it would include the expansion packs. When the expansion packs came out, I noticed I didn't have them in my steam library so I reached out ro 2K. They had apparently removed the promised expansions from the digital deluxe edition, which I understand, but I paid for the expansions, and I didn't receive them. They had no intention of giving me the expansions I was promised, and for that, I urge you to not buy this product. I wish words could express the huge disappointment and resent I have in 2K for how they handled this title."

Every now and then I play it just for a change of pace between bouts of Civ V (which I LOVE), but I never stay around for long.  If I hadn't been spoiled by Civ V already, I might not have been so hostile toward VI.  I was very leery, after being addicted to IV, when V came out and I read about its big changes over IV, but I really warmed up to V over time.  I hoped the same would happen with VI, but it hasn't happened yet.  I hope if Civ VII is ever made, that it at the very least goes back to the adult artwork of V.  If they're going to do great works of art in VII, I hope they give you snippets of great musical works instead of just teasing you with a name.

Because it takes more than 2 hours to see how bad this game actually is.On first glance, this game looks really good. The visual style is neat and well executed, and even if you don't like the cartoony look it's impossible to say that it looks bad. The music is great, and bringing Christopher Tin back was a brilliant move, as the opening music is superb. It's only once you've played the game for a few hours that you notice all the cracks in the makeup.The AI is *horrible.* They will parade units through your land while at war and never attack you. They will keep their warriors until the modern age and never upgrade them, and send them to their deaths against your strongest units. They almost never settle new cities, even when surrounded by land, so as long as you build settlers you are guaranteed to win. They make promises and NEVER keep them. Every AI will happily promise not to convert your cities, then send in 5 apostles the very next turn to convert you. It makes it so the only way you can possibly play is to declare war on your neighbors, for which they never, ever ever forgive you.The game is buggy. It doesn't seem to be able to close without crashing. You will recieve declarations of war from yourself at random during the game. (When playing as Rome, Trajan will appear and declare war on you, even though there are no other Romes in the game.) It's almost impossible to use the city bombard feature, as every time you click it realigns the viewport. The absolutely insane unit selection process will cause you to accidentally right click on distant parts of the map with the wrong unit, sending them off in the wrong direction. When you promise not to convert AI cities, but the city gets naturally converted on its own, you get a diplomacy penalty and a warning for breaking your promise.But worst of all, the game is boring. AI can be improved. Bugs can be fixed. But the game itself is a tedious slog. The problem of having too many workers bogging you down in earlier Civ games has been eliminated, but the same problem was reintroduced as trade routes and spies. Once you enter the atomic era, almost the only thing you do is re-assign spies and trade routes each turn, each of which requires multiple clicks just to get them to keep doing what they were doing. With the AI so bad, very little goes on in the late game except sitting around and reassigning these units.They did a good job of fixing the features in Civ 5 that weren't great, but they didn't really add much to the game. Religion is virtually the same, but slightly more interesting than before. Governments work different, and are one of the genuine improvements on the game, but still feels a little shallow. They didn't really bring much new to the game, but it feels like much has been taken away. It feels very similar to Civ 5, just with much fewer leaders. And with the Aztec civ being released as DLC, it sounds like they have come up with a nasty way of making DLC content -- nickle-and-diming you for leaders and civs. Despite this being number 6 in the series, it has a pathetically small number of starting Civs and leaders. There's a decent representation from around the world, but why must Civ restart with less than 20 Civs at ever new version? It feels like taking a giant step backwards when there is such a long tradition that they could build off of.If you're a die-hard Civ fan who was playing Civ 5 up until the moment this was released, you will probably see it as an improvement (once the attrocious AI and the bugs have been fixed, anyway). If you're a general 4x/history fan, you will probably be sorely disappointed, as there are much better games out there. Civ 6 doesn't innovate, it just reinvents the wheel, and doesn't feel as complete as the previous game in the series."

You want to sell me another DLC, to present new concepts, BUT the AI is still not able to grasp the BASIC things like protecting 1st Settler!!No, no, no ..... with such an AI it is a NO, NO, NO, to continue SELING new content.I really support the series ...over 2200 hours Civilization 5 on Steam, Civilization 4 even MORE, and Civilization 2 and 1 even more .... so for sure more than 7000 hours of Civilization ... but sorry to say ... without a decent AI there is NO VALUE in all the nice marketing.Atm Civ5 complete for 11,- a much superior game ...WAIT with Civilization6 for 1-2 more years and then buy the Civilization6 complete for 15 eur ;)  ... try to escape the marketing trap.And here the part from FEBRUARY 18th:NOT RECOMMENDED to buy, if Your focus is on SP - not before all DLC come out and not before the ""finished product"" get ON SALE.Having played civilization from civ1 on, I sadly have to confess that the last great and epic Single Player games I played, was CIVILIZATION 4 Beyond the sword!!In Civ 5, after being shocked by the unfinished product of vanilla, I did everything right, and waited a few years and bought the complete game ON SALE ... and really enjoyed 2000 hours of MP.Civilization 6 has really a long list of positive and nice features and I honor all the effort in creating a visually appealing game and adding more layers ...but sadly Single player is unplayable, due to terrible AI, which is not capable of ""understanding"" the many layers of game-play.Also, the way of presenting a unfinished product, and then by ripping the players off by selling a lot of extra DLC I also don't consider long time effective, and morally not acceptable.Having in mind the price and the price of all future expansions and DLC, I can NOT RECOMMEND to buy this game if Your focus is on Single-player due to an AI which will NOT deliver the ""one more turn feeling"", and mid and late-game where you will feel ""no more turn please"" due to time-consuming boring game play.I really wanted to believe that Civ 6 will make a step forward making half a step backward and picking up the ""one more turn"" feeling they lost in Civilization 4 Beyond the sword.I really gave the game a fair chance by investing more than 200 hours - and I AM DONE!! Maybe in a few years on sale I pick up the ""finished product"" for a fair value for money and not to high expectations anymore.I don't worry for Civilization 6 because of a great fan-base of dedicated modders who will for sure, once the modding tools get released, do a great job and make this game shine in future, as they always did.I really wish well for the Civilization franchise, and I honor the 25 years of Civilization, so I decided this to be my 1st review of more to come."

I've been playing since III was released. I know my way around. This time, the game just seems off. I don't mind the unstacked cities. In fact I like the concept even if the execution feels weird. I could learn to love it.  As others have mentioned, the AI is insane. I can have the largest claimed area and Rome will still make mention that I haven't expanded. The barbarians need tweaking. Even on easier settings, I am spending most of my early game just building units to protect my one or two cities as wave after wave almost instant spawn from camps. Cleared camps will be replaced by new camps a few squares away within a single turn and then the cycle starts over. I'm pretty happy with the near complete elimination of unit automation, but it makes exploration a chore as most scouts end up ""exploring"" by running from the overkill barbarians. The flip side of the barbarian issue is that the game is boring without them, so turning them off is a bad option.Now, the technical issues: There are sound issues: the music and voice clips will stutter randomly. Clicking the ranged attack icon on a city with walls will flash the ranged attack targeting before needing to be clicked again (sometimes repeating the problem. The camera resets to the capital all the time: we need persistent unit focus. Every-so-often the mouse just doesn't seem to function completely. The cursor can be moved, some UI elements can be clicked on, but not others. Switch mice and keyboards didn't resolve input issues on either PCs on which I encountered these issues.Finally, the praise. I really like the art style.  I don't really want the hyper-realism that so many people have been clamouring for. The colors are bright and interesting plus the models are different and well animated. The UI is forgetable, however, but it stays out of the way.EDIT: After buying some of the DLC and letting the updates settle in and smooth things out, I am finding that the game is downright forgetable. I am not engaged in the game, just bored with the bad war mongering AI that offer no real challenge. Civ 6 is boring, and I hate that, but it doesn't change the reality of it."

Me and my wife loved to play Civ 5 so around December we went and got Civ6 Deluxe Edition so we can play it together.

And we did a fresh Install (after every patch, or new civ) and all the things we found on diferent forums about that missing civ bugs. One day Aztec, Vikings and Poland simply poped up as playable civs....sill waiting for the others civs to work....Other then that the entire game seems more like a beta version at best: Resources seem to get bugged out and you either get them or not at random on every turn.

Almost feels like they try to go back to CIV Revolution(Xbox 360 CIV that was very fun and very dumbed down so newer people getting into civ will have a better time playing that one). The only good thing out of this base game vs CIV V is that you can pair units to each other so that you can have a warrior guarding a settler. Other than that don't buy this if you don't plan on getting the DLCsWith the DLCs on the otherhand. They are absolutely amazing. Things like natural disasters, World Congress being REVAMPED, Climate Change, and so much more makes this game feel so good. I just can't stop playing.  I Mainly play in two ways. Singleplayer when I'm feeling bored and want to conquer the world and Multiplayer with my friend and/or my Girlfriend. I don't play random multiplayer matches so I don't know how that experience is.No matter what CIV you play you get a different experience out of every single match.

You've probably heard the term ""Just one more turn,"" which is what will keep you playing this game for hours.There's a great sense of progression in this game, especially with the Rise And Fall DLC, seeing your civilization slowly grow more advanced. There's nothing quite like the feeling you get when you're in the atomic age, with the whole map revealed and thinking back on when you started, settling your first city, fighting barbarians and meeting other civilizations, slowly growing. Remembering back on previous conflicts with another civ, thinking how far you've come. The game isn't all great though. In the late game, it's quite easy for it to turn into a mess of poorly paced micromanagement, and can be quite boring if you're at a great standing with all the other civs, just waiting for you to finish launching a rocket or two for a victory. Production in this game is also too hard to come by. Later in the game, when you get new units, they'll often be outdated by the time you've actually finished building some, because the level at which you produce stuff doesn't match the level at which you research. Playing ""tall"" (Building a fewer cities and making those great, instead of playing ""wide"" making a bunch of cities that aren't as good) is way harder in this game too, it isn't really built around that, which limits certain strategies.Otherwise, though, Civ VI is a great game. There's nothing quite like it out there. It really is worth it's asking price"

Pro - Polished, features complement each other, civ gameplay that gives the ""one-more-turn-phenomenon."" Con - AI cannot handle features and 1 unit per tile. Diplomacy is still bad. Late game usually falls flat like previous Civ games. The UI is worse than Civ 5 UI.Civ 6 pros and cons, and mixed feelings...Pros:Cons:Mixed feelings:Civ 6 is a solid civ game. I have been playing civilization series since civ 3, and I have enjoyed all of them. Its hard for me to pick a favorite, but if forced to I would have to pick civ 4. I have put hundreds of hours into each, and I think each of them had strengths and weaknesses.Civ 6 was probably the best launch of any civ game I played. It was a complete game from the start. People say it is missing features, but honestly it has a ton of features. It added a lot of new mechanics, kept most old mechanics/systems, has good graphics, and maintained the hex grid/1 unit per tile game play that made civ 5 unique and complex. With all this in mind, I want to address the complaint most people bring up with every civ game. The AI. From this point, I will mainly be discussing the Civ 6 AI, and it is more of a discussion rather than a review.The civ 6 AI sucks. I suspected it would suck. Every civ AI has sucked horribly since I started playing civ 3. However, in Civ 3-4, the horrible AI got to stack all their units and it was not quite as apparent how bad the AI was in those games because the game was ""simpler."" With 1 unit per tile and increasing # of features/mechanics that have been implemented in Civ over time, the flaws in AI become obvious.Civ 6 is by far the most complex civ game I have played in the series. This is not a complement. I think it is a bit too complex. AI cannot handle complexity, and it makes the game look silly sometimes. I don't think people realize how complex it is to make a game that is 1 unit per tile with all the features included in civ 6. Every new game the map is randomized. Each tile has random features. Now, you throw ~8 civs on this new random map, with some random city-states, random barbarian placements, and resources. Now the map is generated and the civs (with their unique special bonuses) are placed on a map relatively randomly. You will begin to move through a tech tree where the units/districts/resources available are always changing at a different pace for each civ on the map. New to civ 6, your research/progress is map-dependent. You have to find things/accomplish things to speed up your research. Also new to civ 6 you're placing districts and wonders on the map. The AI has to have some sort of programing to make decisions. The game is complex, and I am not sure that AI that can be run on computers that meet the min requirements is robust enough to handle it.So what happens? In order to make the AI competitive, high difficulty civ AI cheats. The AI cheats in every Civ title. In Civ 6 they spam districts and units, but they do it poorly. They throw units away in war. They cannot handle 1 unit per tile combat. This is a huge negative in my opinion. However, it does NOT ruin the game. The game is still fun, it still has the civ charm. You can still min/max your civ making super power economy, high-tech military, or a tourist culture. I played it day after day at launch and really did enjoy it. At launch, I was playing on diety and winning most games. However, after one of the first big patches I had trouble on immortal and always lost on diety. Considering I always played civ 5 on immortal, I feel like the developers already had a sense of how to start changing (or buffing?) the AI to properly challenge hardcore civ fanatics. I am assuming I would still struggle to win on diety now. This does not mean the AI got ""better"" it just means the developers made changes to higher difficulty AI to appropriately challenge the hardcore gamer. I typed up this review because I honestly felt the huge number of negative reviews does not really reflect the quality of this game. Civ 6, in spite of its flaws, is good. Worth buying on sale for sure. I bought it at launch, and I do not regret it."

And the way they designed this aesthetic, it doesn't matter if you have a high or low end PC, they still look gorgeous.  - The animations are great, both in-game and on the leader screen. The leaders are delightful to watch and their actions are full of personality. Sound: - I'm not a big sound afficiando. They're pretty good I guess. I love Sean Bean.Gameplay: - Fantastic. - The different civs are varied and entertaining, and show a range of creativity (I love that they pull from non-mainstream civilizations to populate their game). - The districs are a unique twist to the game that adds a ton of personality and customizability to each city. Each city will build out in different ways due to different disctrics, their set bonuses etc... I now have a hard time imagining playing a civ game without districts. Don't be put off by the mixed review. Give it a chance, its very entertaining."

With every new edition to the series, though, the game changes in fundamental ways that can take time to adapt to. If you’re just getting started like i am,  the game’s thorough tutorial and adviser system are great for helping you get your bearings. Civilization has traditionally focused on founding a city in a single tile, and working the surrounding land to produce resources that build and grow the city. These tiles are represented as hexes. Each city can work hexes that are within 3 hexes of the city center.In Civilization 6,  the city actually uses these surrounding tiles to build structures that would have previously been built in the city center. Cities can designate a particular hex as a “district” that can build certain buildings – like the “Theater Square” where cultural buildings can be built. The maximum number of districts a city can build is determined by the city’s population.The Civilization series has often struggled with how to deal with the fact that managing a large empire often becomes micromanagement hell late in the game. Both Civilization 4 and Civilization 5 had mechanics that tried to impose limits on the amount of cities you could build before your whole empire started to grind to a halt.Civilization 6 largely ditches these systems in favor of trying to make each individual city become self limiting. Global happiness has been ditched in favor of local “amenities” – the larger the city, the more amenities are required in order to keep it growing. If your amenities count goes into the negative, there’s a chance that the city will rebel and spawn enemy military units nearby that you’ll have to deal with.Some of the victory conditions in Civilization 6 are directly carried over from previous games.Military victories (and the strategies you use) are pretty much the same as they were in Civilization 5. The AI is still really terrible at waging an effective war, and often ends up giving up any advantages it has by employing a total lack of strategy. The cultural victory in Civilization 6 is very similar to Civilization 5 with the Brave New World DLC. In short, you have to generate tourism that overwhelms your opponents’ culture production. Defensively, you need to be generating enough culture so that others don’t overwhelm you. The science victory requires a combination of both high science output and (in the very late game) high production output. You’ve got to research the required technologies so that you can build the various space programs, and then launch them in order to win. Religious victories are brand new for Civilization 6, and they’re easily the fastest way to win. You can start almost right from the beginning of the game, and if your opponents aren’t on the ball, you can end things very quickly.Civilization VI stands above its predecessors and brings the addictive joy of turn-based gaming back to its fan base. There’s nothing like returning to conquer an opponent that pushed you to the brink of extinction, finding a way to decimate it and pushing your nation back to the top in the process.Civilization VI sits beyond its contemporaries and takes the addictive thrill of turn-based gameplay back to the fan base. It's not just a great game, it's a remarkable comeback!"

Through the use of the excellent district mechanic and various reworked older elements such as great people, spies and religion it has introduced a lot more inherent conflict that wasn't previously present. As such, I've enjoyed every single victory condition (Science, Domination, Religion and Culture) more than I have before. It still suffers from poor AI (now especially noticable due to the poorly executed agenda system) and sadly Civilization VI has suffered in the UI department as well, but regardless I've highly enjoyed my time and can definitely say it is a great basegame worthy of your time.

I've had a leader yell at me for building my cities too close when said leader is on the opposite side of the continent. I randomly had a joint war declared on me from 2 leaders that were both pleased with me. Something like +16 relation. Likewise, they were both on the opposite side of the continent so we barely even interacted, no border friction or anything.The reasons leaders like and dislike you are downright cartoonish and it's hard to make sense of anything they really do. I understand it from a game mechanic standpoint to a certain extent, but it's just so hard to stay immersed."

Of course, as the difficulty increases, it gets harder to overcome, but I still think it's a good game for its time and should not be missed by people who like strategy games and spend time on such games.

There's this usual deal - if you make a sequal to game, it's only logical people will compare. And in case of civilization, the game is always exactly the same, just features change. So if you come with a sequal, it should be better then what the players already have, no? Obviously no. It's better then vanila Civ5 - but only because it incorporates features added in datadiscs. Sadly, with some of them tweaked and some removed, the whole game doesn't work nearly as well as its previous incarnation.WARNING: Wall of text ahread. If you want a conclusion, seek the last paragraph.I'll start with the good. Active research is pretty good, it keeps you active. Over a few playthroughs it gets rather repetitive, because it's usually just build 3 something or something else, but still, cool idea and it works. The districts are not bad at all. They are a tad too complicated for the difference they mean, but they are a fun decision and add dilema to the game, since a city typically won't have everything it wants now. Placement of wonders also feels pretty good, you finally won't have pyramids built in jungle and three gorges in desert. Nice touch :)So the two aspects the game was marketed with work all right. Still the bright side I kind of like how great persons now have slightly different abilities that change thematically with progress through eras (early scientist can bring belief for example). Only kind of though, since for most great persons, the dilema known from civ5 was removed. Do I use great writer for one time culture boost or great work? Should my great prophet go on conversion tour, or should he become a holy site? Not here - the role of the character is given and while merchant/scientist/engineer differs at least a bit, the only difference between writer/artist/musician is name of their works and slots they fit into. Thumb down.The removal of dilemas is responsible for a lot of my dissapointment. City states are now gained by sending ""envoys"" into them, envoys being gained via quests (like infulence in civ5) or via a separate ""influence"" resource, which is used solely for this purpose - there's no other use for it. Using money was definitely much better, addign the decision whether they should be saved for unit upgrade, used for boosting city development or invested in city state.Similar thing happened to tourism. In civ5 late game it's an important asset, because it sways other powers towards your ideology and so it matters even if you don't go for for culture victory. Not so here, it again has sole purpose and if you intend to win via diplomacy or religion, you can safely ignore its existence.Remember how you couldn't wait for your new civ5 cultural policy to be finished, because they were all strong and super useful? How every policy branch supported different playstyle? Ok, so you can forget about it. There's a policy tree similar to tech tree now, so you're more or less forced to invent everything. You get policy cards that go into government slots. There's a lot of cards and very few slots. So you'll be using maybe 5% of what you've discovered. Baaaad idea. Actually one of the worst I've encountered here.Above issues are conceptual - they are part of the game, I assume they will be tweaked in datadiscs and one just has to take them or leave them, because it's what makes the game after all. Then there's technical side though.UI is definitely a big step back. I'm constantly struggling to find information which is either hard to reach or not available at all (not even in civilopedia!!!). I was used to getting a comprehensive breakdown on almost everythign by right clicking - it's comfortable and it helps the learning curve, because it helps me understand why do the numbers look the way they do. Here I struggle with finding out what's on individual tiles, what the tile yield is, why are my people unhappy. I can't find my units - they are difficult to spot, the ones that already moved look the same as fresh ones and there's no unit list that would help me find that archer stationed in some backwater colony I've already forgotten about. Attacking from a city is an annoying minigame where you first try to move camera so that you see the attack button hidden behind city garrison and then you wave your cursor around, hoping the attack arrow will appear. If you click too soon, bad luck, it's back to step one again.The idea of chaining escort/support unit to military was good, but why the hell are they not melded together into one unit? If you get artilery with observation baloon and great general, it's two ""skip turn"" and one attack every turn, that's just crazy. It has also often happened to me that my ranged ship sailed right towards the enemy melee, because I had escorted admiral selected instead of main ship and didn't notice. Graphic is personal opinion, but units are less detailed and their attack animation much less interesting for me, the same goes with AI leaders who are... rather unimpressive looking and bland. But really, this is the first thing I'm willing to forgive if everything else works.AI leaders and AI in general - it really really need a patch. I can more or less put up with fact my tanks are meeting club armed warriors someone forgot to upgrade. But then there's England boldly declaring war on me. Driving 18 heavy chariots to surround my city (defended with a musketeer, ok, England is a bit backwards). And then it probably realizes attacking would be futile and just stands around, driving back and forth, doing nothing. I suspect that with such high number of units, it might even be able to break through the defenses eventually (losing 17 of them and maybe getting a city). But no, it just watches how fire from the city massacres them and that's the point where I'm considering just dropping the game till a few patches, because there's no challange in it and no fun.To give a final point - it's a good game, which is hardly a praise for a sequel of a marvelous game. It urgently needs AI patches. It would benefit from redesign of UI. Features are... okeyish. There's the feeling of novelty and there's the promise of datadiscs making it grand again. But so far it's merely good."

With the expansions, it finally achieves apothesis, becoming an actually good game.The smartest improvement has been the new Social Policy system, which allows you to select various traits and bonuses from a deck of cards that you can change at any time. Need an early military boost? Slot in the card that increases production towards military units. Need more money? Slot in the card that rewards trade routes. A very simple, but absolutely brilliant system that elevates the game head and shoulders above its predecessor.Civilization happiness is now no longer a major concern; the happiness system from Civilization V has been replaced with Amenities. (I was able to ignore happiness). Civilization VI emphasizes playing Wide Empires and rewards carefully planning and placing districts, which occupy neighbouring tiles to your cities. Now, use of workers is de-emphasized, with them being relegated to setting up the early stages of a city. (Workers are now disposable and can only perform a limited number of tasks before they die, just mere cogs in an increasingly industrialized machine.)Not all is happiness and rainbows, though: my favorite civilization from its predecessor did not enter the arena. And the base game, while good, is not great; it is only with the two expansions that the game is truly incredible."

Really, why all this bashing on Civilization VI ? Did any of you played Civ V without expansions and DLC ? In its initial release ? It was one of the worst Civilization to date and most of the people were saying how they preferred Civ IV (With all expansions again) than Civ V (Without Expansions)... it was justified cause Civ V was just a skeleton of a game in it's release (No Religion?!). Although the new skeleton (no stacks of Doom) was better and so it grow to be better than it's predecessors. Now it's the same for VI...though it's not justified. Cause it's the best initial release of civilization until now! It's the first one that not only revolutionize like V (Unstacking Cities) but also having almost every feature of it's predecessors(with expansion) without expansions! So please be mature and stop talking about the unit graphics and clash of clans and see the essence of this game which is much more strategic and full in its release. It has the best skeleton to build upon. Also except units, which for the first time have different looks in different civilizations (without mods), the map and cities are gorgeous and much, much better than Civ V with it's chaotic and ugly architecture of super, one ultimate type cities and labyrinth of roads, simplistic wonders in wrong place (pyramids inside a frozen lake! :P ), with useless worker in every hex. P.S. If you learn to play with unstacked cities you can never go back to the old mess. Same as when we learnt to play with unstacked units we couldn't go back.﻿ Overall I would say this is a must play game and really addictive down to its all cores."

I must admit, I initially had a pirated copy, but once the Gold Edition and Gathering Storm went on sale I paid up, because the game is now as it should be; fleshed out with dozens of leaders to choose from, and jam-packed full of features. Coming from Civ V I despised the graphics at first, but they have grown on me massively, particularly with a mod that replicates V's colour scheme. It's actually a beautiful game, and the unit animations are pretty cool too. The wonders, districts, buildings are all incredibly detailed, and city planning has never been more intricate, made more so by the district system. Seeing your cities sprawl, as they tend to do in real life, and the effect of the day/night cycle on your cities; at times I just flick the mouse around gazing at how it all looks.But back to the district system. This is the pièce de résistance of this release, and I had in the past envisioned a system like as being the most realistic, organic, and logical way to develop cities, rather than just on one tile. To see it come to life in Civ VI is spectacular, and the way all of the mechanics of the game blend together make it, in my opinion, the most complex (in the good way) and detailed release in the series. You have to consider each district, building, tech, civic, era progression etc. so carefully, and balance each choice with how it affects all of the other components of the game. It's like the most advanced game of chess you could ever play, and my postgrad degree is going down the toilet as a result!Although I am ultimately a neophyte when it comes to winning a game, my main focus is building cities and optimising every aspect of its growth. This therefore demonstrates that the game is suited to different playstyles; those in the forums who power through on deity chasing specific victory conditions, or players like me who assess their geography, leader style, and go from there. I think the AI has improved a bit from release; it's not perfect but it may not ever be. So many aspects of human history - culture, technology, religion, money, military, diplomacy, geography, etc. are all present and it's all so well thought out that you will be thinking five, ten, twenty turns ahead about the ramifications of each decision you make. Whichever style of play you choose, you should be able to develop strategies and pursue your aims, utilising your environment and leader's abilities. It truly is epic, and while expensive at full price, mos def worth it on sale. The latest Jun 19 update made further improvements, and the idea that Firaxis is continuing to listen to players and implement changes is another plus. (update Aug 20 - the improvements have kept on coming and Firaxis has gone from strength to strength).In short, I hope Civ V players who were sceptical at first give it another look. The graphics should grow on you, but more importantly because the way the game's systems are intertwined is so complex yet logical. Civ V was like this too but VI's systems seem more logical and are next level because of the district system."

They need to completely re-work the AI, units, and strategy of the game itself. It can be a fun game and I had fun playing it but CIV really has to step it up."

The art style of the game is too cartoonish, the gameplay has a lot of content but little to no depth in most of the choices you make. The same base civ concepts are great because they are just the same thing from Civ 5. I find this game to be more tedious and more boring, I felt like there was too much unnecessary additions and goals added to the game. On top of that, just doing the bare minimum essentials to try and succeed in the standard game is a chore every few turns. I like being nervous every once and a while in Civ wether its barbarians or an actual war on my hands but I do not enjoy the amount of stress that you have to manage in this game.

And I won't even go into the INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USAGE that you have probably already read in other reviews.Bottom line is Civ 5 is a more fun, more complete, more visually pleasing game. Buying Civ 6 is spending 60$ to realize that all the negative comments were accurate, and then leaving one of your own to warn everyone else from making your same mistake. I speak from experience."

It's very sad to see the legacy being disolved away by poor development and money hungry DLC policies. Although there are some positives, I cannot recommend it in good faith because there are too many major flaws.Civilizations 4 may be the last great Civilizations game ever made, because Civ 5 and Civ 6 just never learned from their failures. That being said, I will go over what makes the game good and what made it fail.Pros:-Lots of diverse countries-Dynamic diplomacy options with minor city states, and even major civs-Simplified mechanics appeal to broader audiences. If you've never played a Civ game before you can easily learn this in one campaign.-The Civ5 setup of only allowing one miliatary unit per tile allows the potential for more strategy than stack-spamming, like in earlier Civ games.Cons:-Lack of balance with leader strengths and weaknesses: some are super OP and others are useless.-Compared to Civ 4, the modding community is dead (and has been since Civ 5). In Civ 4, there were so many total conversion mods it was like ten games for the price of one (Fall from Heaven 2 was my favorite). The mods for Civ6 are mostly just GUI tweaks.-The AI has major glitches and exploits. The ""warmongerer"" penalty is one of these, but I would say it is a minor one. The AI is very poor at standing up for itself against other AI, so what will happen is if you leave a large group of AI together for too long, one will be dominating all the others (most commonly through religion) and skew the game victory conditions. It makes the game more of a rush to squash the AI in distant lands before they get squashed by one major AI. I wish the game was instead multiple civilizations with equal power/inteligence that you had to wisely navigate around, all fighting to win. That's what Civ 4 was like. Not just 6 AI letting 1 AI win versus you. (Winning is still easy, it's just not as satisfying because you have to bum rush everything because of this design issue).-War weariness is bugged, and has been for years according to the forums. Whenever I am at war for an extended period of time and wipe-out another civilization, my cities go into permanent unhappiness. This should go down over time, but never does. It's happened in 3/4 playthroughs so far. Liberating a city from a civilization you conquored seems to make it happen more frequently. -New DLC policy is just greedy -- we should pay $60 for a complete game, not $120. I got the deluxe edition and Rise&Fall DLC for roughly $45 and I still feel the experience is not worth the money. -Technology, culture and production are all massively unbalanced -- worse than other Civ games. Every game I wind up having 12th century knights lined up with WW2 infantry, or I'm building ancient walls around a fully modernized skyscraper city because there aren't any modern alternatives. I also tend to be discovering modern democracies in medeval times. I think they could update this and add in new transitions between techs and civics to balance the madness. This would fix these issues, but they don't seem to make any significant updates to the base game. Also districts take way too long to build, and they are a major cornerstone to the game.-There is a lack of significant support. They haven't made any major updates or improvements that don't require you to pay more money. Their attitude seems to be ""we have your money, that's all we needed.""-There are not enough diverse scenerios. -Systemic inertia among the development team has made them ignore fan feedback. Instead they just seem to repeat their ""9/10"" reviews like a mantra thinking they are always on the right path. They've developed such a reputation for the Sid Meier name from their previous games that even if they publish a half-effort trash game, some famous reviewer nerd will still give it a good review just because it has ""Sid Meier"" in the name.TLDR: Civ 4 was way better than Civ 5 or Civ 6. Civ 6 costs way too much because of DLC cash grab economics. This likely won't change in future Civ games, because they like money. It's a fun game (kind of), but they could have easily made it way better if they tried. It's not worth what they charge. Don't pay full price unless you hate money."

Let's say that until the game goes through thorough testing and adjusting, I'd have to go for ""No"".It's a Civilization game, just like its precedessors, and as such I've having fun and not regretting my purchase. But my god is the game trying to make it as unfun as possible. The AI goes out of its way to ruin whatever you're trying to achieve, and pushes you toward an aggressive / military game even though you may not wish to.What I like in the Civ franchise is that, contrary to most 4X games, you can have a complete game without ever having to focus on war. In this one, as far as I can tell, it's going to be hard. All other civilizations, not matter what kind of agenda they're pursuing, tend to act irrationally:- their opinion of you swings unbelievably fast from one turn to the next (I assume it happens when you're too close to some behavior threshold and oscillate around it), resulting in an artificially schizophrenic behavior- when you're bargaining and asking them for what they'd like several times in a row, their demand sometimes goes up, sometimes goes down llike a druken-man random generator- barbarians and religious missionaries do only one thing: swamp you. Even when you're first in Faith generation, another civilization will have 4-5 times more missionaries than you and invade your whole territory with them. Even if you're only at turn 10, two barbarian camps can pop next to your only city and produce 2-3 units each to lay siege to itAll games in the series made the AI behave unfairly because the devs have never been able to make it actually strategically sound. But here it reaches new heights of irrationality and stupidity. The game goes from challenging to frustrating, because you see the AI mismanaging its own civilization in order to make you have a bad day, and nothing else. Generating frustration inside the game is good, but outside the game, not so much.Everything related to interactions with other civilization tend to be like that. Perhaps they're so much driven by their newly-added ""agendas"" that they're too busy to care about whatever diplomacy you're trying to do. Perhaps it's the reason why they removed any form of diplomatic victory?This aside, some of the additions to the game are really nice. Managing a town in its full glory, with districts and forcing you to care about the terrain and adjacent buildings, is really pleasant. The UI gives you a much better access to a lot of info than Civ V's UI (with a few strange exceptions, which become noticeable when you're managing a wide civlization and need a thorough overview of all your cities, or when you're having many trade routes).Technically, on Mac the game is good without being great. On a HD7950, it really slows down in the late game, and even went unresponsive a couple of time in the civ leaders cinematics. It also seems to slow down after a few hours, with short freezes after many actions, but comes back to normal after you quit and relaunch. And it's unable to close itself when you click back to desktop, and must be killed.All in all, I'm not too worried: Civ V was a disaster at launch and ended up being a very good game. This one is not a disaster, but it certainly could use some gameplay testing and some bug fixing before it can seriously be recommended to everyone. :)"

The card-based government system is a novel concept, but doesn't allow for more freedom; the majority of the options presented are terrible, while the rest are so situationally effective (based on what victory type you're attempting to win with) that there really isn't any choice at all. Parallel research and culture tracks are interesting, but victory type largely tailors your research/culture research paths down a pretty straight line. Hidden civ AI agendas appear to make AIs appear unpredictable, but their behaviors are still pretty predictable, and grow entirely predictable after you discover what their hidden agenda is. Civilizations offer drastically different powers, but are wildly imbalanced, and many of them are close to useless. And so on, and so forth - the game's features offer the illusion of choice, but optimized play involves linear paths that grow tedious after approximately the medieval era.Furthermore, there are two other major drawbacks, which are:1. Some technical functions are still buggy. Path tracing will incorrectly register hovering over locations as movement to said locations, which can lead to disadvantageous positioning (or poor combat, which can be disasterous during war). Autoexplore defaults to redundant paths and is effectively unusable. Nothing game-breaking, but annyoing and warranting of the sort of micromanagement that isn't enjoyable.2. The game is enjoyable through roughly the first 100 turns, where decisions feel meaningful and victory could go any which way. After that point, a winner has largely been determined, and the rest of the game feels like ""going through the motions,"" and largely not worth playing. As a result, several features implemented with the game - from tourism to espionage and more - are almost vestigial because of how little they impact the parts of the game that matter.Overall, the game feels reasonably playable, and somewhat fun, but certainly not as breathtaking as one might expect from a virtually AAA title. The game might be worth purchasing at $20, but i certainly wouldn't pay $60 for it, much less $80. If you're a devoted fan of the franchise, wait until it goes on sale; if you aren't, this is a largely passable title"

The negative reviews about the game almost held me back from buying it. I've played civilization IV and V for a long time. And hoped this game would bring me something new, but also gave me that nostallgic feeling that I get when I play Civ. That absolutely happened. With the new districts you can specialize your cities even more than in civ 5. Because be honest, when you just build every building you can in civ 5 nothing will go wrong. And with city's that can do anything and everything winning is easy. In civ  6 you don't get acces to some of the buildings because you didn't unlock the right district. Shame on you for making a mistake. This makes city planning more important and crucial to win a game.I did'nt really care for the spy's in the game. Until i noticed how easy it is to siphon funds from others into your account. Money makes the difference. It really adds something in the game.Also I really like the AI with their open and hidden agenda's. Even though i somethimes think the hate towards me is kinda hard. Yes I took your city. But only because you declared an suprise war on me and pillaged my whole country!! Its fair pay. And also happened more than 700 years ago for christ sake! It makes frends more valuable because the one or two you can get will be useful in trade.In the other comments I read that the focus is more and more on the armies and fighting. But for me it did'nt feel that way. I tend to keep small armies with one combined three star unit in every city, and can defend properly. The warmongering penalty can really ruin your game. At least for my personal playstyle focused on science and trade.Tl'Dr: AWESOME GAME"

(Try the free demo if you are unsure)Full Review:I have played every iteration of Civilization ever published, including the branch off games (Civ Revolution, and Civilization: Call to Power) and I think that this is an excellent entry in the series.  Don't let some of the most recent user reviews sway you, this is a great game.  The biggest thing i've seen in the negative reviews seem to be some sort of backlash over DLC prices, but that doesnt make a game bad since the game is plenty good enough without any of the DLC.The other more legitimate complaint i've seen is that the AI is poor and will declare war for no reason.  This is both true and untrue.  The AI Civs have certain agendas and working against their agenda will earn you their ire.  WHich i think is a better mechanic than Civ 5's AI that was just trying to win the game and would go hostile toward you if you were getting close to achieving a victory condition.  The AI in civ 6 is more of what I would call Role playing AI and will act like a certain personality would act and will be slightly more predictable IF you know all the factors about their agenda which requires some intel and diplomatic ties.In fairness to the detractors though, some of the AI agenda items can be a bit nonsensical, such as hating anyone who has more luxuries than them.  Odd agenda items can cause a previous ally to become distant or even hostile over what might seem like a minor issue to our modern sensibilities.  However i think if you look at history you'll find that Civilizations went to war constantly over the most inconsequntial issues simply cause one side had something the other wanted.  Deciding if the AI's touch and go loyalty is a deal breaker will have to be up to you though if you are concidering getting the game.The AI issue is the only real legitame con I see in this game.  The rest of the game I think is done extremely well. The new district systems are very fun and adds a new layer of strategy to deciding where a city is going to go.  Geography of the map becomes valuable as mountains provide faith and sciense, placing an industrial district surounded by coal or steel or other strategic resources can make a city a power house.  Also the ability to build a harbor district means that you know longer are forced to have a city directly on the coast in order to have a navy.  The whole thing add an entirely new set of factors to analyse and opens the door to many new strategies and different ways to play the game.I also enjoy the new religion mechanics and religious unit combat.  The ability to win the game by spreading your religion around the world is entirely new and has a completely different feel than traditional conquest.The ability to link civilian units to combat units for protection is also a great quality of life feature.The way the new civics work also adds a good amount of customization to your play style.  As you earn culture you will progress on the new culture tree (similar to the tech tree) and earn cards with different traits such as extra production of builders, or naval units, or land units.  or extra gold and faith n the capital or +1 production in all cities, etc.  There are a lot of them. Different government types will have different ammounts of military, civic, and wild card slots so depending on your government type and the cards you choose you can greatly vary the playstyle of your Civilization.All in all despite a couple of hiccups on the AI end I think this is an excellent game that the vast majority of Civ fans would enjoy, and if you have never tried a Civilization game but enjoy grand strategy or 4x as a genre you need to try this game.If you arent convinced there is a free demo for you to try out the game.  If you got this far thank you very much for taking the time to read my post and I hope you enjoy the game!"

Once you figure out how to resolve the issues with the laggy framerate and hang-ups caused by the 2k launcher you will still be plagued with constant crashes starting from the mid-game onward and I did have one save become unplayable at turn 20. I don't know what the bug is exactly but the solution for a lot of people to resolve most of the crashing is to play completely without city-states, and they're kind of an important part of the game. I still had crashes although less frequently in the late-game without city-states or mods and that's where I gave up. Hope I saved somebody a couple bucks and time with this!"

Districts are a great idea. Bringing back governments, and making it impossible to have cities that are all things to all people are great. However, there's big problems.My least favorite part is the changes to religion. The idea of religious combat sounds fine and all, but in practice, it's horrific: You are in a religious war EVERY TURN OF THE GAME, healing units requires going back to a city, and you have a whole 3 kinds of units to wage this war with. This makes religion a huge attention drain that you can't ignore, because an enemy AI will be going for a religious victory. Let someone else take over your religion? Great, now they must be your primary target for military war, because otherwise, a military path might just hand the other player the game!There's also no way to really get anywhere without a large empire: Culture? You won't be able to house enough great works to matter, as the maximum number of great works per city is tiny. To increase that, you also need religion, going back to the paragraph above.Another mechanic that makes us need huge empires is military: An extremely large majority of units require strategic resources to be built. Nobody is ever going to trade you for them, so you must expand wildly. Lacking an iron mine in your starting area? Congratulations, you have to rush forward in tech, and hope the strategic resource is anywhere near you.But let's not forget, that science makes things more expensive: Yes folks, moving forward in the science track makes creating districts harder, so you can end up being unable to do very much because you moved forward in science too fast. Nothing like creating a new city, and seeing that it takes 70 turns to build anything.So my veredict is that it's way too easy to get yourself in very unfun situations for the game to be worth it today. I'm sure it'll be fixed eventually, but right now, I can't recommend the game."

I would have changed my review after all this time, but the game currently isn't very playable.Edit: After the patch that came with the new leader dlc I can happily say I've been enjoying myself. Crashing is no longer there. I would recommend you download some UI mods to make a cleaner experience, but that's it."

Balanced, challenging, inifinite replaybility.So Civ6 has to live up to that.  It is definitely better than Civ5 was at release.

It took civ 5 plus all dlc to get a complete game. Civ 6 builds on ease of entry that civ 5 had with a layer or two of complexity forcing players to not just rely on automation. Finds a nice middle ground between the recent easier civ versus the more complex older ones.

And that easily means the best strategy game in 20 years!In my opinion. with the sole exception of 'Sid Meier's Civilization' of 1991 itself, 'even' Civilization projects seem to be far superior to 'odd' ones. 'Civilization II' was just great - it still plays and even looks much better than many modern strategies!'Civilization III' had some interesting gameplay ideas, but terrible looks and tiny and colorless units and everything.'Civilizaition IV' featured excellent visuals, but stripping usual features in favor of separate add-ons was really a bad idea.'Civilization V' had the most innovations in the series, but here we again had a number of paid DLCs and addons - and that plain black style of the graphics and the interface was quite ugly for my taste.:* The visuals. They are now as bright and cute as they had never been before! You feel as you'd want to lick the buildings and the units :)* The leaders. Yes, they are best-looking (and even almost historically true-looking) since, well, the first and probably the second game!* The completeness. No major feature is stripped down in the original vanilla edition, wow!* The districts. Great idea, actually - even if it is the only major innovation. Not just seeing a city growing randomly, but laying out its urbanizaton by hand is extremely satisfactory.:* The bugs, of course. Yes, it is a very big game, but it still could have been tested and proof-read better. I had my load of CTDs and freezes, and some Russian texts surely need some editing. Still, I have no complains of AI - some leaders are stupid, some are treacherous, some are plain weak. Just like in real-life politics, you know.* Some interface drawbacks. Where is the good old list of all my units?! I have a crowd of writers and painters who are waiting for the next amphitheatre to be built - and how am I supposed to find them scattered all over my little big empire?! And when Pericles declares a sudden war on me - how can I gather all my military who have not fought anything else than idling for many centuries? I am not even sure they will add it in future patches...* Well, this complain relates to every 'Civilization' game since II, but I would still love to see something like 'Palace' from 'Civilization I' or 'Throne Room' from 'Civilization II' again! Much better than just a boring statistics screen. And what about getting back screens with real people rioting or celebrating 'We love our Ruler' days?! Oh, forget it - they will never give us back that joy unfortunately.Of course, it would be blasphemy not to recommend 'Civilization VI' to everybody - especially if the bugs would be finally corrected!"

But this is a different story, because for now you want to know why this review goes against a mainstream - why cannot I recommend it?1.	Unfinished / unpolished product. I was afraid of this most, ""for this has never happened before, and here we go again..."" The game is not only half-finished - in fact, it also misses some key and significant things which ALL previous civilizations had always been proud of, such as:  - NO STEAMWORK - 0 scenarios (all previous games contained some scenarios in vanilla games),  - 0 maps other than computer generated ones, it does not even have a simple Earth map to start with (even Civilization 1 had it). - can rename a religion - which is a bad thing in mp - though cannot rename your country or cities (which is very strange) - no auto work function for builders - no alert button for units - the game makes it clear from the start what future DLC will contain (which in my opinion is an insult to players considering the $ 80 price tag for vanilla game) Of course, many of those things will be fixed by modders sooner or later - but that would be a different game, why should Firaxis get a credit for the things they were lazy to implement on their own in vanilla game?2.	AI. Lots of advertisements pointed out to the improved AI. I have not seen it, for I only see some scripted personalities which predictably react in certain way. In other words, there have been no significant improvement here: - AI still makes similar stupid mistakes as in Civilization 5 - for example, exploring with its own settlers, building cities in illogical places, having no tactics against a player other than sending waves of enemies until being defeated.  - Adding to all that, AI does not know how upgrade its own troops, so you may end up in situations where you see chariots, archers, etc. accompanied by submarines... This might look funny but when it happens over and over the game not only loses immersion but also some logic. - Like in previous games, AI still spams player with useless offers, praises and denounces3.	Multiplayer. I must admit that there is a big improvement here compared to civilization 5; however, it is far from being ideal. Desyncs, crashes happen very often, mp games are still very slow, especially at late game (wait times before player turns are unusually long). Also I do not understand why the game ""does not officially support"" more than 8 players in multiplayer (you need to manually unlock it) - even though we managed to play with 10 players, the fact that game says it is a bad sign as it only adds to what I said in point 1 about unfinished product.4.           Although the district / Wonders placement is interesting in theory - it has many issues in practice which only make life harder for players (which is especially the case in mp). Thus, when the game starts, you can only guess which tiles might later be useful (where is oil, iron, etc.) - so you start building districts, Wonders, and then in late game you realize that (1) you have no room for new more districts or Wonders (if you play on small islands map, this is a big problem), (2) the above mentioned tiles contained some useful resources which now lost forever. - This would be not a big problem  - (a) If the AI was in same circumstances - but unfortunately AI always know where to build due to scripts, (b) If the resources could be obtained by having Wonders on it, or (c) If the districts or Wonders could be transferred to other tiles. Now, keep in mind that you cannot remove your districts or Wonders, even if try to build it once but in few turns decide to build something else - you will be stuck with cosntruction on this tile forever.  - Unfortunately, all this makes Wonders a bit useless, especially if you play an island game - where every tile might make a difference. So, I think the game will improve if players would be allowed to build Wonders in districts (for example, 1 Wonder per corresponding district) - this would greatly conserve the space on the map and simply make the map look better. - Another problem with Wonders is that sometimes they look weird - I understand some Wonders like Pyramids or Colossus must be built outside of the city but why cannot Eifel Tower, Big Ben, etc. be built in the City Centers, which is the case in real life? Also, why do they need to look bigger than an actual city on the map?There are also some bugs and mp glitches which I do not want to talk about for now - I will give developers an opportunity to fix them, for we know that they know about it - they did test a game after all, am I right?So, at its current stage the game deserves 6.0 out of 10."

It was so much fun learning, exploring, growing an empire, etc. I had no issue again sinking 100+ hours in to Civ V. I loved creating custom scenarios and playing them out, I loved getting huge maps on the work shop and playing far-too-massive games on them. I thought the whole international council and diplomacy mechanic was handled in a pretty refreshing way- I usually mod out/avoid late games in the Civ series, capping technology at the medieval or renaissance era, but Civ V actually convinced me to play into the eras I dreaded from Civ IV a few times, and it was actually pretty fun.Going from the stunning steps forward in Civ V, and noting where systems were lacking, it should have been very easy to make Civ 6 and excellent game, and well, it's very far from that. I've only put in about 12 and a half hours, and tbh about two hours of that was the game running in the background while I did something else. I don't feel the desire to play more, because even if I put the game on a higher difficulty, the challenge won't feel rewarding, because the actual strategic skeleton of the game is so hollow.I mentioned the game seeming vapid earlier, and to expand on that idea I feel like I need to articulate that Civ 6 feels like it has a lot to say, but if you listen it's truthfully saying very little. All of the systems implemented in the game are surface deep. There's no sense of anything growing to be more complex than minor bonuses to your civilization. Religion, like in Civ V, is still a joke- and I'm pretty sure many of the modifiers from it have just been copy/pasted from Civ V to here. This game's AI diplomacy makes Total War's diplomacy look like the UN. Everything is still surface deep, the AI is still extremely erratic and often nonsensical. The civilization series has always prided itself on its diplomatic and peaceful approach options, yet to me these have always been headache inducing considering just how poor the AI is on both a tactical and strategic level. This game is by far no exception.Civ V made late game diplomacy interesting, at the very least, in a system where you vie for international votes in the late game world council, in this game, hoooooooo boy, be prepared to be let down.The world council first convenes when you enter the medieval era. Let that sink in- the UN is established before the chivalric code. Resolutions are passed amongst nations that have never met. You seldom ever get to decide what resolutions there are, either. You're told to vote on for two options for two resolutions, and pick a target for that resolutions. Are you trying to get a diplomatic victory, by the way? You get points for this by picking the resolution that passes in the medieval world congress, which is easy enough because the game often hints at what resolution will pass. BUT you also need to pick the correct target of the resolution, be it a civilization that gets bonuses or hindrance, or one of 30 luxury resources that gets banned. Good luck, ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This can be made easier by having a crap ton of diplomatic points to just sway the world in your favor, but the cost for each vote is exponential, so even this has limited effect.So, to cap off the last section, the UN begins by having every medieval civilization meet up and decide to arbitrarily ban cinnamon, almost unanimously. I get these games aren't meant to be that historic, but having a system this stupid in a game that at least pretends to care about history is just really, really strange.It just feels like every aspect of this game leaves so much to be desired. Above all this game just feels like it lacks tactical challenge and those moments of clarity and learning that make strategy games feel amazing to play.  Nothing about Civ 6 is malignantly bad, but nothing justifies its still high price tag and all of its very overpriced DLC.TL;DR, go buy Civilization V if they ever put it on sale again. It's a much better time sink than this.I will say, though, this game has some fresh-ass main menu music."

CIV 4 changed alot but the game was so much of a challenge and had so many different and new ways to go about a victory I ended up falling in love.  CIV 5 kept that tradition of change but still kept me loving the new CIV.   CIV 666 just doesn't do that at all.  What they have managed to do is change EVERYTHING that I had come to like about CIV 3-5 and now we are left with an empty shell of what used to be a great strategy game.  My first thoughts during my first runthrough was the mechanics of it all seem almost like they wanted to make this a mobile app and changed their minds at the last minute.    All that being said, I did end up getting used to it and tollerating the game as a new strategy game, NOT as a new CIV installment, because I don't care what the title says, it isn't. So spend $20 on it and be confident that that is a fair price to pay for a new nation building strategy game that was inspired by the best, but ISN'T a CIV game, just looks like one."

They probably made it better though, at least that's what happens with all civ gamesRight now I would still recommend it to anyone fan of 4x games, but if you are not into this genre, I would suggest trying older titles before making the investment on this one.High difficulty player here, and a long time fan of the series.Probably the strongest release Civ, has most of the basic systems from CiV V complete, and some other things added as well. It's missing the diplomacy win, but honestly it was the weakest and less interesting part of the game on V. And on top of that, has a huge gameplay change; The Districts.First off, lets start with the issues people have.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Barbarians.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The early game has changed a lot because barbarians are a threat once again. On Civ V they were extremelly weak, they didn't pose a threat at all due to the changes on City mechanics from IV to V (city strenght + bombardment). On older civ games, you had to keep military around because cities didn't have any kind of defenses, a single barbarian could wipe out your civilization if you left your city undefended.On Civ VI we get the middle. Cities have lost a lot of their early game power due to losing city bombardment. Now to get it you need to build walls. Even without it you still have city strenght, which means a single barbarian can't just walk in your capital and end your game.Then we get the new Barbarian AI. Basically right now it's posing a threat to many people that used to only focus on infrastructure back on Civ V. Right now you can't do that, and it's completely fine, the biggest threat on the ancient world was barbarians, and this is what you experience on the few first turns.Even with the Barbarian AI being better, all you have to do is make sure the barbarian scouts don't actually see your cities. If they don't they won't launch a horde of units at your cities. If they do there's ways to stop it as long as you didn't fall for the monument trap. (seriously you don't build the monument until you have at minimum 3 units)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~AI~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is probably the biggest problem with the game right now, but it's not a new problem. The AI on all Civ games hasn't been espectacular, and it's somewhat expected. Building an AI that can play a game like Civ is extremelly difficult. Even then, there's some problems that have no reason to exist. (Like joint wars still giving you penalties with your ally)What I believe is the biggest problem people have is that they once again playing the game way too much like Civ V. You really need to understand that Civilization has never been a franchise that just copies and pastes things, changes graphics and ""new game"". They actually make the effort to change the gameplay, and this is one of the reasons as to why there's always a different lead game designer on each iteration.Some tips for the people having trouble making allies: send delegations early, give trade deals early, and help your neighbors. The new AI doesn't like isolationist players, so go out there and make friends.This still doesn't excuse some things, but nothing that can't be fixed.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UI~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Basically the UI has problems, like certain information isn't there on plain sight, like the experience bar for your units is extremelly small, or not actually showing up that certain techs/civics give you certain boosts (you have to hover over them to see them, on past games there was an icon for it) nothing unfixable, but it's kinda annoyingAlso GIVE US BACK THE OPTION TO RENAME CITIES. (there will probably be a patch around december that should fix most of these things.)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Religion Game~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Right now religion is a new victory condition. One big problem I have is that you can immediately lose that victory condition if you are not able to found a religion. You should at the very least be able to take over other civilization religion (by possibly conquering the holy site where it was founded).The other big problem is that Religion units should be able to move on tiles which have military/civilian units from all civilizations unless you are at war with them. Right now, the AI can get a huge amount of faith generation, and just spam a huge amount of missionaries and clog up the mapThe religious combat is kind of dissapointing. There should be more unit types, and not just be a fight over who has most apostles and got the right promotion.Even with all of these problems, it's a big improvement from Civ IV and V religion game.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Districts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Probably the biggest change the civ franchise has made. Basically, districts are a place you put in the map, near your city, where you put the buildings of a specific type. For example all Scientific buildings go in the Campus, and the district itself gets bonuses from things, like mountains.This means your city no longer is stacked on a single tile, and it spreads on the map. This makes very interesting gameplay changes, and due to the bonuses each district gets vary depending of terrain, you have to plan your cities on advance, and there's more ""improvisation"" on the game. You no longer go a specific route to win the game, and you have to adapt more.What I dislike about this is just a pet peeve of me. Since cities spread on the map, you lose the feeling of ""epicness"". What I mean by this is that the game kinda feels more like a city manager more than an empire manager. (which has honestly always been more a city manager more than the other). And all of this makes the world seem smaller.Wonders also work like districts, meaning they take a tile on the map, and are not just another building in the city tile. They also require specific terrain to build them, which means there's more opportunities to get wonders on higher difficulties (which was impossible on previous games).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Production~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Production has become more important with this iteration, because production costs for districts go up over time, and to win science victory you need to make a huge project that takes a lot of production to finish. Once again, I've seen way too many people just focus on growth and science like on Civ V, and then suffering with productions costs.Basically you need to use your industrial zones and plan them well, because they can affect more than 1 city (with the factory and power plant). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Final Thoughts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~So the big question. Is the game worth it?Yes absolutely, but only if you are a 4x ""fan"" or at least enjoy this genre. If you are new to this, I would recommend waiting for a sale, or get an older one when they are extremelly cheap (they go by like 5 bucks complete).Also I would like to point out, that the game isn't ""incomplete"" even though I said there's things missing, and also I am not excusing them for not having them done on launch. It's just that game development, and feedback ""on house"" won't give away all the problems. And there's going to be bugs or certain problems that millions of players will find faster than a couple of playtesters.So if you excuse me, I'll go back to play one more turn..."

A lot of overhead removed and the new builders I like better than the old workers. Limited uses is better than late game having 100 random extra units everywhere. Trade routes auto building roads is just another QoL improvement but people are complaining about their skillcap. On that note, you can still manually build roads later in the game so nothing has changed besides improving the trader unit. Graphics style is great to some people while others prefer the old style. I personally like the new one and the interface is definitely improved. I am sure there will be some things later that I notice or miss about an old version but right now, if you are a Civilization fan, I highly recommend."

Spending century after century on the battlefield with glorious victories cannot earn you a great person whereas a timid moron with an encampment constructed at the early stages of the game can earn at least 2-3 great generals in 35-50 turns. Great people being dependent solely on the corresponding type of building construction is completely absurd.This logic may be applied to a great engineer but why should I bolster my construction to get, say a great scientist, a great general or a great merchant for that matter? Age fixation(golden age/dark age) also ruins the game imho, simply because it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a steady acquisition of age points when you step into the later stages of the game.Dark age is almost inevitable if you're playing in deity difficulty and with dark age come the endless loyalty issues which ultimately ruin everything that you've built up so far.It becomes almost like a tradition for the CIV franchise that AI needs to suck at ridiculous levels.It's beyond easy to challenge 20 nations in deity difficulty, especially in terms of militaristic and commercial competition.This ridiculous 'survive for the first 65 turns and you're good to go' motto should have been completely dismissed long ago but it's still the same even after decades. Alliances are almost futile, militaristic alliances are almost non-existent, it's a game that has numerous incredible premises at the start, but in a very short time frame, it becomes repetitive,dull and relatively easy. The Death Robot is probably the worst idea being posed by the developers, it diminishes the level of realism and depth we are accustomed to see in entire CIV franchise.Last but not least, the maps are small, even huge ones are small, this needs to be a grand strategy game with the ability to handle more than 30-40 nations in one map without cities being founded and stacked one onto another. Finally, we are getting increasingly bored with Suleiman for the Ottoman Empire, he wasn't even the best there was,he simply reigned for 42 years with an iron fist, that's all. Try Mehmet the 2nd or Mustafa Kemal as a 20th century revolutionary figure for Turks. Tomyris was a nice touch but in Turkish history, Tomyris did not have the reputation you attributed to her.Osman the 1st, Mehmet the 2nd, even Emir Timur had been, by far, better than Tomyris and finally, of course, Mustafa Kemal surpasses them all."

Many things have changed. Some you'll like, and some you probably won't, but I won't poison your mind by stating what they are. I'll leave that for you to discover.The interface hasn't really changed much from Civ 5, so there shouldn't be a big issue here. The biggest change here is that there is no longer a  panel. Now you just click the city, and there are individual icons to click, and find the info of that city.Builders, and building roads went through the biggest change here. Again, I'll let you discover this. I don't thinks it's bad, but it is different.You can now stack two units in the same hex, a feature I always thought was lacking. Now your infantry can be supported with tanks, anti-tanks, or anti-air units. This is also good for your weaker builders, and scouts to have some protective escorts while traveling.The bugs are minor, in my opinion, and I feel that patches will clean up most of the annoying ones that are flooding the Steam forum. I myself, haven't experienced any that I can bring up. Just read the Rumor has it that there will be a  for it, and in the game folder, there is an empty Mod folder. So I can't see them putting that there if they weren't going to allow Mods. Even in the game there's a Mod section.I got the  version for the upcoming 4 DLC's. So if they come out at $5.99 - $9.99 per DLC, you'll save some money here. I don't see a substantial sale coming during the Christmas Holidays, so if you're excited to play it, then go ahead and get it if the price tag meets with your approval.Keep on gaming."

DLC might fix it, but it's not worth playing until then.Why don't we have a ""Neutral"" recommendation button? We need it for Civ VI, because while this is an acceptable entry into the series, I can't ever see any reason to play it over Civ V.There are a bunch of great new features (Districts make you feel more like you're playing Endless Legend, though that game still does tile based city building better imo), but they're all held back by some really awful design choices, a few bugs, and horrible AI.Pros:The foundation is clearly here. With 2 or 3 big expansions (DLC's bleh), it could easily be a great game.The inspiration system, makes the science and new civic tech trees feel fresh and exciting without feeling overly powerful.Natural wonders feel far better than they did in Civ V (They now tend to give bonuses to tiles around them, making controlling them far more beneficial).Global happiness is no longer a horrible limiter in the mid game.City-States no longer require massive sinks of gold to get small perks, rather you complete quests and are granted envoys who give you bonuses.Cons:Art style is awful compared to Civ V, personal preference obviously, but Civ V was a beautiful game. This feels too cartoony and isn't whimsical enough to warrant it.AI is atrocious. We're talking absolutely worse than Civ V. They'll make wars with you they can't win for no reason, will build cities in horrible spots, build districts poorly, and even get destroyed by barbarians near the start of the game. As someone who played on immortal difficulty in Civ V and really wanted better AI this is quite possibly the most disappointing thing about the whole game.Movement and combat of units is tedious due to how the system of movement has been changed. You will not catch a scout unless they corner themselves. The actual combat hasn't changed, but the changes to movement and how impactful rough terrain can be makes it all so much slower and less engaging.The UI is bad. Menus don't pop up when you click the city, but rather you need to click other buttons while the city is selected to see actual details. There's no game log of any kind so if you miss the fast messages telling you what just happened you'll never see it again. The UI also seems to be hard to directly interact with. The amount of times I try to view a notification only to select the ground beneath said notification is too high.Lastly bugs. There are tons of them. Bugs with the steam overlay, with not being able to name cities, issues with loading saves, and even a strange issue where I kept getting notified stonehenge was built, 300 turns after it'd been built."

Since the dislike list is short, I'll start with that.Dislikes : 1) Cartoony rendering.  Civ 5 had a great athstetic which worked brilliantly.  Not sure why there was a choice to make everything look cartoony, it was a slight turn off.2) Fog of War rendering - Neat, but actually kind of annoying.  Just show me the map grayed or darkened would have been fine.3) Simplified UI but...not so:  The tabs for policies/religion and government type was very confusing and was a bit much to take in and figure everything out.   Since it was a trial by fire in a multiplayer game, figuring out what these things were was quite daunting.  The cards and slots for policies is actually kinda pooey.  A simple list of things would have been fine for each category.  Cards dont make it any deeper.4) Armies.  Feel a lot less epic.  Where we would see rows of warriors in Civ 5, now we get a handfull of unepic looking drudges.Likes:1) Love the new victory conditions.  Makes looking out for things, including opportunities much more nail biting.2) Being able to hyper focus on an aspect of your civilization is pretty neat.  As England, I was able to really drive home a maritime monarchy pretty well.3) Envoys makes it much easier to deal with City States, not as much poking and prodding at CS's to get them to be more agreeable to you.4) Traders make the world go 'round.  Building roads along the way makes it a lot less tedious than sending builders.5) Not having to maintain builders.  Other than to keep pumping them out for odd jobs here and there, the fact that workers in the late game don't have to sit idle.  They just do a job.  And no more having to make worker boats.  Yeah, that was an annoyance.6) Districts made the game more interesting.  I very much like this aspect of city building, and it makes you think that in a limited time span, how would this city work best for your empire.7) The aspect of spreading religions is a great addition, sometimes annoyingly so...unless you think you have a bigger god to play.  It's a sneaky way of warfare without having to burn down cities.Overall, in my limited experience with Civ 6 I like it, after playing for so long with Civ 5. I could really have done without the cartoony graphics; which is probably why I stayed away for so long."

I've played many of the games in the civilization series, and have 1500+ hours on civilization v on this account alone.Every time I played Civilization V I would literally play an entire game and spend HOURS in one sitting. The graphics seemed great for the time of release, and even before the release of DLC there was alot of replayability.When Civilization VI came out, I was so excited. I heard that the gameplay was totally different.This is the only game in the Civilization series in which I have never finished an entire game. I know i've only played about 7 hours on this account, but for me, 7 hours was about the time I would spend per game in Civ V!There's so much wrong with this game.Case in point, Diplomacy.A nation will be your best friend on one turn and then declare war on you the next turn. At first I thought this was clever espionage, but nope. Its nearly impossible to win over nations with trade deals. Diplomacy is an utter sh*tstorm. Declarations of friendship are almost meaningless. I can't count how many times my declared friends sneaked attacked me... Diplomacy is truly broken. I didn't buy this game at release just because of this issue when i saw all the thumbs down. However, I figured they would have patched this by now.Adding housing was a mistake.Dear god is this irritating. It's nearly impossible to satisfy your people. You think you've got a handle on things and 20 turns later your city is screaming at you for more housing. You can't add more districts because there is a population threshold and you can't reach that population threshold because you cannot add more districts. It's a never-ending cycle and it gets annoying early on. This was never a problem in Civilization V.There are a few positive aspects of the game that I like.They made the game more realistic and balanced by no longer allowing people to hoarde wonders in a single city. It used to be that whoever had the most production would get all of the good wonder, but i'm glad to see that this has changed. Also, despite what other people say, I actually like the new cartoony graphics. But overall, this game was just a complete let down for me. I couldn't say that I would recommend this game, but I would definitly recommend it's predecessor, Civilization V. Perhaps this game will be improved with future DLC, but I just don't find it enjoyable in it's current state."

I also welcomed the new religious victory condition (even if it's kinda flawed, will write about it later).On the other hand the new graphic style and the lack of “penalties” for large empires (the game actually forces you to rush creating new cities in your empire, will write about it later) dragged things a bit down for me.So, in detail, the overall mechanics of this new Civilization game are very good, overall positively evolved from Civilization V, but since the game forces you to rush on city building you get a few very bad side effects:Capturing cities feels like a joke, for example you may end up capturing 10 to 15 cities in just a few turns with no real side effect on your empire.For the same reason (too many cities) religious victory condition is a mess, you will see 3~4 priests per city battling (yeah… that is lame) for religious supremacy which is beyond annoying.Again for the same reason it's just easier to colonize to get certain resources rather than initiate trading with other empires or trying to acquire influence over state-cities.To get you the idea,  forget about Civilization V Enrico Dandolo play style, it's just impossible with the current state of the game.Something I was worried about, because so many people pointed that out, was bad AI, but I have to say that in my 2 games AI was quite good, just a bit too aggressive, in everything (e.g. Teddy building a city in a tile between two of my cities, ending up with a oblong, space crippled city or Hojo declaring war just to move through my territory).Finally I have to say that at the moment leaders offer you a little bit of variance only at the very start of the game, middle and ending phases of the game are more or less the same whichever leader you get to play: huge empires, fought at least two or more wars, fairly high in all compartments (science, culture, etc).Would I recommend this game, yes, no doubt about it, but don't get it right now, wait till a few DLC are out (or even better a GOTY edition “final” pack) because there are both “flaws” and lack of diversity at the moment.EDIT: My review for this game is a bit dated and should be totally reviewed now that a few expansions came out, but as I wrote back then... now it's time to buy it and never regret it"

Civ VI is by far better than the base game of Civ V without the expansions. In due, time we’ll all watch this game flourish even more with the introduction of expansions. Civ VI has breath taking graphics in comparison to any other game of this category in my opinion. I’m comparing this to most 4X games such as Endless Legend, Sorcerer King and previous Civ games. I must also compliment the new combat focus, it’s by far one of the most engaging I’ve come across in a long time. The AI feels more balanced and gives a deeper depth to the game, multiplayer is a lot of fun with good friends for playful banter or a more serious approach. Barbarians are as annoying as ever xD and more aggressive than what I remember in my 175 hours of Civ V. As a fan for 4x games, I’m impressed by this game as a whole; there are a lot of positive points in Civ VI. Please don’t let others alter your thinking about a fantastic game."

When the first few gameplay videos came a massive wave of disappointment was already being announced and when we finally got to play the game we got even more disappointed in how awfully designed the game is. I have 1037 hours in Civilization V and too many thousands to count in Civ IV but Civ VI is just too boring and I will explain why.The district system is an interesting idea do not get me wrong but the fact that they actually made building tall (high population per city) pointless and you can basically spam as many cities as you want unlimited whereas in Civ V you at least had a form of balance to prevent that.In all Civilization games there were rewards and downsides in going tall and wide (lots of cities) whereas in Civ VI the only benefit is going wide and not tall at all.The districts do not help with this either making your low population cities extremely overpowered. all you need is the commercial, industrial and there you go, the harbour if coastal and/or Holy Site or Campus and basically your city wont have to grow any larger because Civ VI is all about money and production, you rule those you own the game.This is the dumbest way of designing a game the fact that production costs SCALE with how much you produce something is even more idiotic. This was their idea of preventing you spamming cities but it turns out its working against you, want to make more infantry and tanks to fight the wars the dumb AI starts all the time? Oh sorry, you already made too many tanks, its 40 turns to make one now. They also completely ruined culture, its pointless now, I cannot tell whether it has an effect on border growth because they completely butchered the interface and dumbed it so much down its counterproductive. The policy idea is also another great idea but poorly implemented, the idea of enacting your own policies is very nice indeed but it basically costs you nothing, everytime you research a culture policy you can to change your government. This is silly so what is the point of culture? Its basically just like science, its only there to make you progress and the theater square is pretty much pointless as you already can amaze good culture output through buildings and religion. Then we get to the real big ugly flaw of this game, the AI itself, its the worst AI I have seen in a strategy game and believe me I play and have played a LOT of strategy games, I seen AI's from 2002 that are smarter than this and that is sad. The AI was very smart in Civilization IV after the final expansion pack, the AI was pretty dumb in Civ V but even then it was still capable of doing SOMETHING. In Civ VI the AI is utterly useless in war, even with mods the AI is so crippled it scares me, it cannot do basic manouvers it just spams units at you which is pretty silly at least in previous Civ games the AI would try to come up with basic tactics. The AI is also really bad at economy and city placement, early games the AI may be ahead of you but then you suddenly start getting ahead of the AI really fast.As for the graphics this is a matter of taste, but I always prefered the more realistic art look of the previous games than this new cartoon look which looks silly in my opinion, are we playing a game for kids now? You may think so considering how dumbed down the game is in general.I have also noticed how Firaxis are releasing lots of small DLC's, seeing how this is going it looks like they have adopted the Paradox Interactive strategy of just spamming lots of tiny DLC's for what may appear like small prices but when you start adding all these tiny DLC's together you suddenly end up with prices like 100 euro or 300 euro, Europa Universalis IV is probably 400 euro by now if you want all the DLC's. This new strategy by game developers is disgusting and frankly puts me off completely from buying their games in the future, it was bad enough with the death of Expansion Packs and the beginning of DLC's but Firaxis still kept making good DLC's for Civ V.And finally, I want to give Firaxis my middle finger, Civilization V is the most successful strategy game of our time so far, and there still more people playing Civ V today than VI, you could have made MORE profits making DLC's for Civ V and expanding the game further, a lot of people may not realise this but the district system could EASILY been implemented in Civ V, you could have fleshed out the future era, you could have made space colonisation a thing, the fact that Civilization Beyond Earth was not made a DLC for Civ V puzzles me.Game developers today are extremely lazy and it seems Firaxis have joined the club, expanding already extremely successfully game franchises with more content is too much effort these days, Firaxis promised us many years ago to fix Multiplayer in Civ V and add mod support what do we get? An entire new game that costs 60 euro at launch, thank you Firaxis for sinking to a level even EA Games have yet to reach."

I have played all of the Civilization games from Civilization IV until now. Most of the reviews are comparing Civilization VI to V, so that is what I will do, because this is the game that will replace V. VI has many sweeping differences like the visual style, the district system, diplomacy, government types, civic and technology trees, and even different win conditions. These changes bring new methods to playing that users have to adapt to in order to succeed, for example, city planning is major. City planning can make or break your cities in that you cannot just settle near luxury resources and thrive, you need to have locations for districts, and if you're cunning, have good adjacency bonuses too. Wonders also play a major key in city planning, some wonders require that they, for example, are next to a river that is adjacent to a Commercial Hub (type of district). Now all of these changes bring the question, is it any good, and then, is it any better?+Visual style is refreshing for this series+ Districts and wonders require careful city planning+ Difficulty settings are more difficult than before+ Barbarians are relentless and seem more true to life+ Leaders have agendas that fit ingame scenarios and historical ones, too+ Declaring war must have reason, or you are considered a warmongerer+ Fantastic visuals on leader screens (individual hairs and pores!)+ New score is incredible and enticing. (personally, I like it better than Baba Yetu)+ User interface redesign is intuitive and detailed- Game is difficult to get involved in, more so than previous titles- Visual style is comparable to mobile games- Minor bugs and removals that are apparent (may be fixed soon)- Minor spelling errors (no periods, you instead of your, etc)- Some inconsistenties and weird stuff (dialogue when demanding stuff is the same as when trading)Civilization VI is a new title, released on October 21, and is still getting its footing. It has large shoes to fill for its predecessors and will certainly take some time to get everything in order, with bugs and DLC expansions to fix these issues or lackings. Now, the DLCs are still to come and there are minor issues to fix, so this review can't confirm or deny that it will get better, but it is likely. In conclusion, it is worth the full retail price of USD $60."

I wouldnt necessarily be apposed to this, if they actually did anything with their wars, obviously their tactics leave a little to be desired, but, not only are they unable to capture city's without a significant tech lead on you, they will often lose 2-3 city's in their wars, that THEY declared, they seemingly dont prepare at all, and then YOU will be labeled as the warmonger because they are terrible at wars THEY declared. It is fixable with mods, but no game should get a positive review if it is described as ""fixable with mods"", so i wouldnt buy until its at a significant discount."

I paid £50 for this. That's allot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ money and for a game that's worth less then civ 5. The game is so focussed on it's gimics that it forgot how to be a good civ game. The unit variation is woeful. The tech progression is terrible. You'll find people with tanks fighting against spearmen frequently. It feels like there's nothing here except a few gimics. I honestly would have got a refund but because civ is so long I went over the allowed time. SO now I've wasted £50 on a game i don't like playing. Don't make the same mistake as me. Get civ 5.

Districts are sections of your city that are placed down on physical tiles outside of the city-center tile that gain bonuses depending on the surrounding terrain. For example, commercial hubs gain more gold if they are adjacent to a harbor and/or a river, and industrial zones benefit from mines and quarries.  Developing your cities and planning district placement is always a puzzle to be solved that rewards good strategy and forethought.  Another major addition in 6 is that the tech tree has been split into two: the tech tree and the civics tree.  Technology works the same, but many of the things you might expect from a cultural or civics development is placed in the civics tree.  New government unlocks, religious perks, and the majority of world wonders are unlocked in the civics tree, which you advance through culture rather than science.  The mechanic is done very well, and as a civ veteran i welcome anything that makes science less important!The last major change worth mentioning is the new Great People mechanic.  In Civ6, players compete for great people.  There are only so many classical era Great Generals, so if the other players work hard enough they can deny you great people entirely!  Also, each great person is unique.  Galileo is always a renaissance era great scientist, and he always has the same ability which is unique to him (science gained for each adjacent mountain.)  Whereas Hildegard is a medieval era great scientist and always has his ability (holy sites generate science too.)  This gives a lot of character to what was previously a very boring mechanic.The biggest complaint about the game I have is the pitiful excuse of an AI when playing a comp game.  The computer-controlled civs are even dumber due to the higher complexity of civ6 and rely on even larger starting bonuses and global buffs at higher difficulties to counteract their stupid play habits.  But as anyone who has been a longtime civ player, bad AI has been a hallmark of the series so this is to be expected.Overall, I would recommend Civ6 to anyone who has played and enjoyed previous civ games.  The bad review scores of the game i believe come from a bungled launch (that I wasn't a part of, to be fair) and a knee-jerk reaction from the community."

The overall city-building aspect seemed diminished overall because of the sheer power early game has potential for.2. Early game overpowers everything by far. If you don't have about 20 tiles between you and the nearest competitor, one of you can easily get facerolled by the mass production of low-level troops because cities no longer have their ability to attack units within 3 units of their hexagon, meaning that four warriors can just blatantly mass siege a city with little to no penalty for waiting long durations of time, unlike in Civ V where if you fortified and waited outside of an enemy's city, regardless of size, they could retaliate with little attacks to, at the very least, wittle you down, but it was very significant early game.3. AI is terrible, as usual, but this is exceptionally terrible compared to previous Civilization games due to the added depth of the Civil tree and Technology tree, as well as trying to determine when to build districts vs when to build regular improvements via builders, and they seem to only focus roughly 80-90% of their resources on ""improving"" themselves, but I have personally seen people have Settlers for over 50 turns sitting in a single tile at their city center, but I am not sure if it's because they can't find suitable land to settle a city on or if they are just uncertain of how to settle a city.3.1 AI seems to denounce randomly. If you declare one war and win or take anything of value, it will almost always have a huge penalty for the late game which usually involves every single AI in the game denouncing you and then eventually declaring a massive joint war against you due to ""Warmongering."" However, typically, they are very unmilitarized so you can defend very well unless you completely abandon all of your cities and leave them completely defenseless.4. The art style has caused a lot of various flak and such, but overall, I didn't mind it too much since I run on a more low-end PC. However, the art style feels very cartoonish, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it constantly feels like the map is extensively crowded. I cannot exactly pinpoint this issue, because Civilization 5 has moments where it feels more crowded, but something about the icons makes it feel very condensed and unreadable, and I believe it is because you cannot zoom out as much. Not really a huge issue, but still a complaint that didn't help the game overall.5. The separation of the Civics tree and the Technology tree as long as the added addition of the policy cards seem more like a tag-along for ""added depth,"" when in reality they just feel poorly designed overall, more specifically the card system. There are some cards that are overall better in almost every situation, especially early game, and do not harbor any benefits that can be established from the overall diversity of other cards. For example, the first two military card options you are able to choose from are recon units gaining more experience from exploring, or bonus damage against barbarians. Due to the very oppressive presence of barbarians, it is almost never a good idea to choose recon experience over the damage to barbarians. Not only that, but to level up any unit requires a turn where the unit is required to be dormant, meaning you have less time to actually explore, and in the early game where recon units are most impressive, you should always be competing to find tribal villages to jumpstart technologies and gain advantages. You can argue that in the long run, bonus recon exp pays off, but if barbarians have the opportunity to pillage your lands and stunt your growth, late game doesn't matter anymore because you simply don't have one, you're just another city waiting to be plundered at that point. And barbarians can very well utterly obliterate someone at the beginning to hinder their growth dramatically and leave them well open for invasion, and it can be a case of bad RNG from barbarian spawns. This also ties into how hard it is to defend cities early game.Overall, I'd say the separation of the Civics tree and Technology tree wasn't a bad idea, it was indeed a very GOOD idea, but the execution with the addition of cards seems very poor and needs a rework or overhaul, or at least tweaking. Balancing issues are overly abundant with early game civilizations have very obvious advantages due to the ability to mass spam units and faceroll an advantage.I paid $80 for this game, which is part of the reason I am very disappointed. Even if I had just paid the flat $60 for this game alone and not the future DLCs, I would have expected at least some bit of reassurance that my money wasn't entirely wasted due to unreleased content. It was fun in some moments as a relaxing, casual game, but overall, it provided little to no challenge due to the AI difficulties being additional cheats for the AI instead of actual reasoning or tweaks to the situational awareness.Within a few patches, I believe this game will be far more enjoyable, but don't buy it at full price unless you plan on waiting a few additional weeks to months for quality gameplay."

The new city districts system is a whole new level of management and I could not imagine playing Civ without it again. The music, art style, and leader animations all bring this alternate history to life in new and exciting ways. Now, time for the elephant in the room. The AI can act very wonky. They are unpredictable and will do whatever they please regardless of their friendship status with you. I had Rome, my game long ally and friend, declare war on me when I completely outmatched them. Their whole civilization gone because they decided they wanted some bananas. I just wish it would take more into consideration before making a game changing decision like that. Not to mention how their agendas tend to make them act like entitled brats very quickly. Agendas should add to the complexity of diplomacy rather than dictate tantrums because I have one more luxury resource than them. However, considering this is the most launch content any Civ game has ever had, I'm very hopeful these will be ironed out over time. I am so excited to see what the future holds considering we already have what Civ V's major expansions were (no World Congress though). All in all, the game is still extremely addicting and fun to play. It can only get better from here, and they are off to an outstanding start! Now excuse me as I go take one more turn."

I like the power of traders and trade routes, though I'm not really a fan of now long it takes them to build roads. Speaking of roads, it's kind of cool that workers now have a number of charges that can be spent to construct an improvement instantaneously, rather than labouriously over a number of turns. However, I do miss their ability to construct roads. In addition, the city districts mechanic means you can really specialise cities. Also R&F's governors offer some useful bonuses for cities that lack in certain areas. On the other hand, some (I would have thought) essential features have been stripped away. For instance, what happened to the city overview screen? On Civ 4 I could F1 to see ALL my cities' size, health, happiness, production, income, etc., etc... I found this almost essential for civ management - losing this is a real blow. There are many other respects where knowledge is kept from the player; for instance, if you're aiming for a cultural victory, there doesn't seem to be any way to predict how man extra tourists one will expect to acquire on a given turn. This can really frustrate late-game decision-making.I've also noticed some irregularities in the tech tree. Last night I constructed a spaceport and launched a satellite without having ever discovered electricity, which I would have thought a pretty essential technology for spaceflight. Perhaps my Romans simply used it without understanding it!Lastly, some civs seem to have really useless bonuses (boni?) to the extent that I can't be bothered playing with them. Norway is garbage, Spain is rubbish. Too bad for those guys, I guess.What else, what else? Warmongering penalties? Oh my god, WHY are there eternal warmongering penalties for capturing and holding cities, even when you are not the aggressor? This effectively ruins the diplomatic side of the game.

Absolutely no thought or dare I say effort has gone into balancing this game, it's about as balanced as a clown on whiskey after an all night bachelorette party. Do I mean the game is too hard? I wish. No the game is too easy because the AI is retarded and the broken game mechanics allow you to cheese the game in ways you couldn't even dream of in a civilization game. For example there is no downsides to having too many cities in your empire, you can literally spam or conquer as many cities as you like and the game will just keep giving you more science and culture. you'll often find yourself steamrolling science and culture so fast that you're in the atomic era before you've even built the most basic buildings like water mills.The AI is mindless. Often they will have horsemen and catapults in the modern era who proceed to throw themselves at your units, killing themselves. The same goes for diplomacy. If you want an idea of what diplomacy is like in this game then let me give you this as an example, I once got denounced by france 3 turns after meeting them because I WASN'T spying on them. The AI will constantly freeze the game to ask you for all your luxury resources in exchange for nothing while denouncing you for every irrational thing you can think of. You'd have more luck engaging in diplomacy with a Walker from The Walking Dead than you would have with the AI in this game.Something else to keep in mind, the game is as non intuitive as a game can possibly get. You can't automate builders in this game which means if you want all your worked tiles improved you have to manually spawn or create a builder and improve them all yourself. and considering in this game you're going to have at least 30 cities(50 is a more reasonable number) that means you constantly have to go through a bunch of menus for every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ city to check which tiles need improving. In fact unlike civ 5 all important info requires going through a bunch of menus wheras in civ 5 you could just click on a city and it gives you all you need. Don't worry though through city spam you won't need tile improvements or EVEN BUILDINGS. Just by spamming cities you have enough science and culture to go over 2 eras ahead of all the ais even on the highest difficulty.Wonders are worthless. Remember in civilization 5 how completing a wonder was a big deal and had a huge impact on the game? Here wonders aren't even worth bothering with. Since the key to winning civilization 6 is to just keep getting more and more cities, wonders become completely pointless as they take too long to build and often give you small worthless bonuses. One time I built a wonder for the hell of it on a city with fairly high production and by the time it was finished I had already advanced an entire era ahead. The game advances so quickly that building a wonder is a pointless act. A settler gives you more bonuses than a wonder and that is just pathetic. Why spend 80 turns building the eiffel tower when I can build a settler in 5?This IS NOT civ 5. In fact I don't think the people who designed this game understand even the most basic aspects of a civilization game. Nothing works the way it's supposed to in Civ 6. Diplomacy is broken, the game mechanics are broken and it's tedious as hell to manage your cities. There's only one way to play Civ 6 and that is to spam units and settlers and nothing else. That's not a joke or an exaggeration. There's also religion if you can be bothered with it the AI is too stupid to stop you from winning a religious victory apart from occasionally attacking your religious units with their own if they get too close. You can literally have your apostles idle on a religious site and the enemy apostles will just suicide at you.How this game got pushed out to release in this state is beyond me. Nothing works and the game is broken and unbalanced. I keep seeing all these reviews from people who have only played a few mere hours, even I'm guilty of thinking this was a good game within the first few hours. But the truth is this is an unacceptable level of quality and I expected so much more from Firaxis. I haven't seen a single games journalist have a deep look at the mechanics of this game outside messing around for a few hours.If you do not listen to my review you're going to see the cracks in this game eventually. They really have some nerve to charge so much money for this crap because they know that fans of the series will pay for it. I will think twice before buying a firaxis game in the future."

Its ok, not great, just ok. Why is it just ok? Pros: Its a beautiful game. Textures are smooth, flash flare is pretty, text boxes float fine, lovely to look at. Much of the cumbersome clutter from prior Civs have been smoothed out. They have somewhat reimagined city construction so that district system is kind of fun. Coming from Civ IV they've added quite a large number of amazing mechanics that show quite a lot of *potential*. Potential. Po-ten-tial. Cons: Its way way too simple. The amazing mechanics that are in play are relatively shallow: tech trees are very small, combat is mostly the simple same, way too few units, same simple rock-paper-scissors unit dynamics, unit experience/leveling is so stupid simple there is no real choice, way too few Civilizations and Leaders, C&L differences do not seem to change the flavor of different games overmuch, some C&L are way overpowered while most others are crap, religions while more integrated still do not seem to have the 'real world' impacts despite the investments in them, too few constructions (buildings/wonders/others) that do too few stuff, great people are still two dimensional, artificial intelligence (AI) is still pretty crap, AI on harder modes just cheats to win (cheating AIs piss me off), though I can tell they tried to work with diplomacy its still meh, trading is powerful but somewhat limited to mid-late game (by that time power creep has overrun trading civs)...So I looked to the modding community for some complexity, difficulty, and dynamism but though there were some amazing modders none of them were able to add the depth I sought. I thought that after three years the DLCs would flesh it out but wait another three more years. Addendum: Also do NOT like the childish cartoon style. Started on Civ II way back in the day, absolutly hated that they change it out a few series ago, and hoped they'd change back. Nope. For a community of nerds who likes number crunching, hexed based strategy, civics planning, experiencing history, exploration... why in the ever living ♥♥♥♥ did they move to saturday morning cartoons? By its nature this game is not for babies! ... in the end is feels just like a fancier Civ IV but for kids who like pretty colors.  (Not insult)"

In turn, Civ6 is a title targeted at tablet users, leisure strategy gamers, and players looking for ""nation builders"" with occasional challenge.It is still a fairly complicated game, and as players have varied expectations, I can understand for some people it offers enough challenge, while others don't even play for the sense of achievement. However, unlike good few earlier installments now, that offered a very decent difficulty options, Civ6 draws a hard line between those types of players, leaving people enjoying a tougher, well planned gameplay with essentially nothing to be found here.While many innovations look pretty sound on paper, in practice they either cause ridiculous things to happen (AI behavior), remain insignificant despite their major balancing role (pollution, happiness, etc.) or are implemented poorly (civics).Elements affecting AI behavior, while somewhat varied (culture, religion, etc.) are implemented in ways so simplistic, they will often cause other nations recklessly act towards their own doom eg. declaring war on stronger nations because they have more wonders...In terms of balancing, Civ6 (sadly, like most modern 4X games) completely dropped restraints on rush expansion (city spamming), that were a most basic feature for years now. Effectively, as long as you land grab early on, you pretty much can't go wrong because the exponential growth of cities pretty much decides the entire campaign in the first few eras. Playing tall is like a self imposed handicap now. Other balancing mechanics, like pollution for example, despite being a flushed out DLC feature, is still more of a nuisance than a real concern, because profits outweigh penalties, and even penalties themselves can be further reduced as well.When it comes to additions, most notably the Civics, while it's a grand idea to have a second, culture based ""research"" tree, the implementation is deeply flawed in such a way, that for every nation/playstyle only a small subset of cards are actually useful, meaning that progressing said tree largely consists of acquiring things that have virtually no use, just as means of reaching those few ones that do. Lastly there's the issue of graphics being maybe not as much ""worsened"", but shifted towards mobile aesthetics, which I personally don't like, but for the record, as a personal preference I'm not taking it into consideration in my final recommendation. Same thing goes for the EULA debacle. This game has enough issues not to be recommended for its own merits."

As a civ fan I really was looking forward to playing it, after some time has passed, Rise and Fall coming out, mods, all that. And it dissapointed me in the worst way - by showing promise and then not delivering, by being good and full of features, but not enjoyable in the end.Make no mistake, it has a LOT of good stuff in it. The features that were added and were seriously improving the game are:- Districts. It gives more substance to city specialization, it forces you to plan for the future and creates incentive NOT to build EVERYTHING in every single city. You must sacrifice a tile and opportunity to build other districts to build one. Since you can only build districts after growing your city to certain sizes, one at a time. Eventually you can build all of them, but it's gonna be near the endgame. So you have to chose what is more important for this particular city for the coming era - science? religion? economy? military? culture? production? happiness?- Diplomacy system.- Culture progress like a scientific one, with civil tech tree. Governments can be changed like in Civ 3, with slots for various policies. It could be potentially a very good feature.- Barbarians with their scouts, that have to return to outpost to inform them to start popping out units for invasion.- In R&F - era score, which forces the player to do something instead of sitting still. If you wantr to avoid Dark Age, you've got to earn some points, hunt barbarians, conquer somebody, found a religion, find a natural wonder, anything!- Religion is much better made, conversion given easier to understand quantification.- Loyalty system and ability to lure a city into a rebellion against your neighbors.- etc etcBUT! And here are the cons:-  It was all poorly executed in the end. Mostly when it comes to balance. Things either become too easy or too hard, everything is snowballing like there is no tomorrow. And snowballing kills all the fun.- Too much micromanaging. There is no empire-wide management, only manual control over every single city. Workers are the worst part - they are finite now, have 3 charges and can only make 3 improvements before disappearing. It forces the player to constantly make new workers and micromanage everything they do. NO AUTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT! Be so kind and manually direct your workers! And the problem is - as you empire grows in tiles and cities the ammount of micromanaging becomes tedious and tiring.- Culture progress was nerfed too far and now the limited ammount of policies means that there is not much incentive to worry about cultural output. There is no real rush to unlock a social policy, since now you can't use it anyway unless you disable one of those already in use.- Worst of all - AI. AI is bad. Very bad. Stupid, self-contradictory asshats. They have no correlation between diplomacy, war, economy and other aspects. They value their agenda so much that the moment you so much as fart in the wrong direction they become maniacs hell-bent on destroying you even at the cost of their everything. They declare wars on you on schedule, regardless of how many soldiers they have and where they are. They send soldiers in small waves at random direction. They completely suck at wars despite insistently starting them. And more. They regularly glitch and get stuck with their first settler, unable to send him, unable to build new ones without using the first one, stuck with one city forever. They lag behind in science even at higher difficulties. AI is the worst part of the game.So in the end this game is pure frustration. Great start with all those features and shiny shinies. And then everything becomes irritating. Constant idiocy from the AI mixed with regular turn interruptions when they want to tell you that you suck or you rock or you suck again... There aren't even any reply options. And you have to constantly check on improvements and order workers and control them. Meaningless constant wars with obsessed neighbors that lose all rationality after the first time and become your sworn enemy. Air and sea combat is pure madness. Ai are terrible at everything, but sea and air game takes the cake.Don't buy, you'll regret it, and refund won't work since you'll play for more than few hours before you realise it's unplayable. Better install Vox Populi on civ 5 and enjoy the real civ game.Update after the Gathering Storm:I once again tried to like this game. And failed. Some things were fixed, but major problems remained.Good:1) Natural events add flavor. It is somewhat like events in civ 5 vox populi  with more special effects. 2) AI no longer obsessed with their agenda, so they at least are not going to flip once you chop a forest or convert a city.3) Diplomacy system was refined and made more complex (not that it helps with AI being so dumb).4) AI no longer get stuck with their first settler.Bad:1) AI still sucks. They can't wage wars. They disperse their forces, send them in small waves instead of concentrating. They don't see how offending a stronger neighbor by attacking their vassal city-state is bad. In my most recent game playing as Inka, Spain tried to take Antananarivo, which was my vassal city-state. Not only did they give me an excuse to destroy them, they couldn't take a city despite getting it to 0 HP, because... they retreated with mellee units for no rerason, leaving a bunch of ranged units to shoot at a city with already broken defences.Also AI with a lot of Great People for whatever reason don't use them. They don't spend their charges, they don't pair them with units, they send Great People as... scouts? I mean Spain from the same example had like 6 or 7 admirals in that war - ALL of them sailing alone near my shores and dying meaninglessly to my privateers. It is not unusual to see a Great Writer running from barbarians in a desert on the other side of the world from his nation.Also Science is still AI's weakest point. They can't keep up.2) I found some new faults with city-states. Their bonuses are overpowered in early game. Meeting a few scientific city-states before anyone else garantees that you are the top dog for the ancient and classical eras, which easily translates into a snowballing advantage throughout the entire game. AI can't use that advantage so it doesn't help them BTW. I would make 1 envoy bonuses smaller or perhaps it is better to disable the 1 envoy reward for being the first to meet the city-state. And I believe that city-state quests are too simple. Like, ""build unit X"" or ""build district Y"" - WTF? I would upgrade my troops and build districts anyway, why do I earn an envoy for basically no reason? At least make city-state tasks as difficult as tech and civic boosts (which are also too affordable).3) Natural disasters are too easy. Volcanos and river floods are a boon if anything, anything else is irrelevant. A rare storm is the only dangerous thing. Rising sea level can be a danger ONLY if by industrial era everyone is equally advanced and have CO2 emissions, otherwise you simply don't build coal power plants and rush for computers tech. Generally, sea levels haven't bothered me even once on emperor difficulty. Maybe you have to play on deity?"

It looks like a beta at best, not a production-ready AAA-title. Firaxis has many game-designers and screenwriters which create new nations and skins, but this game is not playable as Civ 5. I'm talking about fair multiplayer game. You cant play equitable match in vanilla civ6, you need to install third-party mods that provide you better UI, better balance, fewer bugs. For example, for this 6 months Hellblazer brings much more things, features and bug fixes than WHOLE FIRAXIS Dev team. I do not literally understand what they really do.

Rather than have all of your buildings indistinguishably occupy one physical hex grid on the map (which is a really odd way of looking at cities, when you think about it),  adds Districts to spread your urban centres across a much larger landmass. These unique tile upgrades are separate to the farms and mines that still exist to provide your people with vital resources like wood and stone, but make expansion more creative while giving you a level of customisation over cities.Victory conditions have also received a considerable shake-up in  – Diplomacy is no longer its own victory condition, while Religion is.Improvement – is applicable to almost everything in . From its various routes to victory and how those methods of play intertwine; to its leaders and the numerous interactions between those bold and colourful characters, this is a supremely strong strategy experience.For such a complex and in depth game to feel so intuitive and remain fun is impressive.  is the best 4X strategy gaming to date.- New diplomacy, research and city building systems make this the most in-depth Civ made- It looks gorgeous- The best of a 25-year-old series.- Underlying formula remains as engrossing as ever- Learning curve can be brutal- Certain ideas could be better explainedDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING |"

I'm surprised.If you haven't played or know much about Civ V, then this review won't be much of a help.. most of the others won't be either.- There is Tourism and Religion in the basegame, which were monetized DLCs in case of Civ V.- The graphics changed. Some people make a big deal out of it, for me it depends on my mood... sometimes I prefer Civ V, sometimes Civ 6 (I recently played both games, and probably will as well).- The AI is questionable for sure (just like in Civ V), but it's not impossible at all to find challenge in defeating it. Just because it doesn't act the way you'd want it, or even logically, that doesn't mean it isn't serving its purpose.Regardless of what some other reviews imply, Civ V, Endless Legend, Endless Space and any similar game's AI can be really annoying, or can be abused hard. Humanity still sucks at creating AIs, deal with it.- The card system for Policies is actually pretty awesome, although it can be intimidating at first. You have to commit for a few turns, but it still remains flexible throughout the game.If you know what you want to do in the next 10-15 turns, the icons make is easy on you to find which card you need.- The new Culture-tree is also a nice addition...- ...especially with the Inspiration and Eureka moments which intertwine with every aspect of the game.There have been serious changes made regarding how you build your empire, I'll probably get a bit technical here:- The district system spices up the gameplay, city planning is more important than ever, which can be frustrating for new players and for everyone without experience.- Add to that the new Builders which I consider a huge negative. During development we were told that Workers would be changed in a way that they won't require extensive planning on how improvements should be built, which was a nice idea. Except with the new Builders you basically have to plan for the whole game, since they're expended when used. This also forces you to plan ahead (or risk wasting resources).- Certain Districts, Buildings and Wonders have serious pre-requisites (more so than Machu Pichu or Neuschwanstein), which guess what: forces you to plan ahead.Overall as good as those mechanics are in the last 3 points, combined they make it really hard for unexperienced players to play to the max, or even just try certain things. However they work really well if you know how and when to do what. These things go from very frustrating to awesome when you start paying attention.Additional thoughts:Extremely unlucky for Firaxis that their old game is still competing with their newest release. Look at it this way: they can't NOT develop a Civ game for 10-15 years, but it's also really difficult to make a clearly better game than Civ V.And it's impossible to meet every player's expecations.For Civ V lots of people paid 100€ or more, while they obviously can't charge that much for Civ 6 on release, yet players expect the same depth and possiblities... which the devs actually delivered. They implemented new mechanics, kept the old and good ones (from Civ V AND its 2 extensive DLCs) and made a game that might look very similar, but offers a quite different experience. That's the best they could do on a basegame release, and MUCH better than most other copmanies would do.It's yet to be seen whether we get TRUE DLCs, that aren't just new civs. No verdict on Digital Deluxe yet.Even without knowing those I recommend the base game."
