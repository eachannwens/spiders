I highly recommend this game, it had no flaws and despite it coming out in 2013 it was easily one of my favorite single player games I have ever played.

For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.The storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.Speaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.Last, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.Should you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience."
4,1,The Sightless Swordsman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSightlessSwordsman/,163,1,1,77.7,"Posted: 21 July, 2014",153,3,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/fb217601451b2b195b3568b2c87e84b5937183ed.jpg,"While I've seen many people who disagree, I think this game is magnificent.  The story, the characters, the gameplay, it all goes together very well.  While I have not played any of the older Tomb Raider games for any extended period of time, I can tell that one difference is that in this, Lara seems more human insofar as she actually has emotions.  There are tons and tons of games where the character you play as just seems to lack emotions in many cases, most often combat situations.  They just go and kill the enemies like it's an everyday thing for everyone.  I've seen people say things along the lines of Lara being 'whiney', but I disagree.  She was just a regular person, and never went through anything outstandingly terrible at the beginning of this game.  What would you do if you were thrown into this situation?  You would probably freak out, and she did, making her character be realistic.  My one complaint is that sometimes it seems like half of her dialogue is some kind of grunt or scream.  Yes, again it is kind of realistic because you and I would likely be grunting and screaming as much as we are talking, but still.  Some of it seems much more high pitched and girly than necessary.I've seen people say that Lara takes too much punishment to be able to walk and run around.  Yes, this is true, but think of it this way.  She is in a survival situation, the adrenaline would help keep her going.  Besides, what fun would a game like this be if it were 100% realistic?  You get shot once and you're dead?  Boring and frustrating.  She got impaled through the abdomen at the beginning, you want her limping around slowly through the whole game?  Again, boring and frustrating.  Although it can be said that they could have skipped the injury entirely, it actually does contribute towards the game, showing that she initially does have at least an above average pain tolerance, still being able to climb around when necessary while still showing obvious signs of more than just a little bit of pain from the injury.Now, the story?  Well, it's hard to go into detail of why I like it so much, so I'll put it simply.  I've played through the whole game twice the first three days I had it, and now I'm going in for a 3rd time just because I love it so much.  Enough said?Also, graphics?  There's a graphics option just for the quality of Lara's hair.   I think that speaks for itself.  It also absolutely KILLS my framerate when I turn it on, too.  My PC is decently powered too, frames are really smooth otherwise."

This is the reborn, the first story of our favourite adventurous girl in the world. The game has a lot of good and bad aspects, ✓  if you are planning to buy both  and  I would play this first as you are gonna find several references to Yamatai and Lara's friends in them. It's not necessary at all to play this game to understand future Tomb Raiders, although the experience is way better if you read all the documents you find on the island.✓  one of the most visible changes for all the players;  with a beautiful enviroment, great lighting and character models. We cannot forget the  mode which allows you to make Lara's hair more realistic and beautiful (back in 2013 this was something incredible)✓  you can jump, run, tumble... Map design is cool as it allows you to explore the whole area✓  you have hours of entertainment in front of you... Did you just finish the game? No problem! Now you can try to obtain all the achievements, hidden tombs, upgrade all your guns... However, as you have no elections during the story nothing will change if you replay it✓  sometimes it feels like  because of the brutal killing animations with both your pickaxe and bow. You can also crush your skull against a rock (which looks painful)✓  hit an run. Use your bow (it feels  to use it) and go Arthemis-like all around the map, or just make everything explode with your shotgun. The game offers upgrades so you can make them deadlier, which feels nice and is actually very useful✓  possibly the best feature of the game. You are probably going to fall in love with Lara because you'll see her origins. If you are a TR fan or if you have played old Tomb Raider games it's worth to mention that this story is ""not going to make any sense"" because it has nothing to do with them as"
8,1,❤ Lusty ❤,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Envy_Me_1_Forever_Till_Death/,957,2,1,23.1,"Posted: 2 December, 2013","1,161",26,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/12edc22c76e07099e3dccecbed0e3cdaaf047688.jpg,"Do you remember Lara Croft? That femme fatale from a certain adventure series? You know, the buxom beauty that has a starring role in nine games, two films, and countless other media? She's the one with Barbie's warped proportions, Batman's agility and cunning, and whose confidence and grit are as palpable as her impressive dimensions? If you do remember, then you certainly haven't played the latest Tomb Raider series reboot by Crystal Dynamics. After playing this game, you will have forgotten everything you know about the old Lara Croft.This new and younger Lara is vulnerable and uncertain of herself. She cries and shows genuine sorrow when she loses a friend. She laments killing animals that she hunts for sustenance. Her every physical action painfully reflects her lack of experience, her desperation and dread at the seemingly insurmountable odds laid before her. Yet she perseveres through her story, dealing with the physical pain and emotional anguish, and grows all the better for it. Lara goes on a tremendous journey, and takes us right along for the ride.The story kept me interested throughout, action was pretty intense and didn't feel over the top or overused. I really liked the character development of Lara and her progression towards becoming that bad ass chick from the original games. I noticed some people complained about narrative and story not making sense, noticeably during scenes of Lara being upset and all of a sudden on a so called 'killing spree', I felt that the developers did as a furthering of character development in such a way so that Lara had to always be on her toes so to speak. Those reviews seemed to have a bias or an unwanting/not caring to understand Lara's journey so don't let them put you off. Graphically a beautiful game to witness, I had to slow down at times just to catch some cool shots of the island in its various weather conditions. Cinematic scenes, just wow tbh. The use of weapons was well integrated into game play and non seemed unnecessary, the bow is one of the most satisfying weapons I've used in recent games and it almost feels wrong when not using it.To sum it up, just buy it. It offers an enjoyable experience regardless of whether you're familiar with the older Tomb Raider titles."
9,2,Murphy's Lawyer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/murphyslawyer87/,449,35,1,34.7,"Posted: 11 September, 2015","1,122",10,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/8bd1c38fe4f91ae0c8b93dd51cebd8490f2f5b80.jpg,"(Full review follows below) is absolutely one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played.  The single player campaign mixes in a myriad of well-crafted elements to create what I personally would define as a 10/10 gaming experience.  There is also a multiplayer mode, which actually has the potential to be fun; unfortunately it has nearly no community, and many of those who do play: cheat (driving away potential new players).  Nevertheless, the game is a total gem for its single player campaign alone.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes playing great single-player video games, regardless of their usual preference in genres.The graphics and animations are absolutely stunning, and the soundscape is enthralling and AAA quality.  This is the kind of game that makes it worth having an expensive/powerful GPU.  Drawing from the gorgeous graphics and animations, the game is a heavily cinematographic experience.  This takes the form of both longer, elaborate cutscenes; as well as short, little camera cuts that are integrated right into the gameplay as you explore.  This is all reinforced by an interesting narrative that is well told, with excellent voice acting to back it up.  It is the kind of game that definitely feels like an interactive movie.The gameplay mechanics and the gameplay itself are also a delicious blend of tasty ingredients.  There are many interesting and atmospheric areas to explore throughout the game, with various collectibles to find (many of which elaborate on background stories).  There are “puzzles” to solve ( classic Tomb Raider games) and there are secrets to discover.  Besides exploring, the combat/action sequences are also quite fun.  Headshots, finishers, explosive barrels—all the necessities are there.  And as the game progresses you get new weapons and weapon upgrades as well, which spice up the combat scenarios.  There are also high adrenaline “escape” scenes, where you are trying to escape a collapsing bridge, or burning building.  Mixed into all of this, and again drawing on the cinematographic experience, there is also just the right amount of quick-time-events littered throughout the game.The game runs on a checkpoint system.  I will always prefer manual saving/quick saving in PC games, but the checkpoint system in this is pretty flawless.  Collectibles save instantly, so if you die you don’t have to recollect them.  Also the checkpoints are extremely common; so if you are learning how to win a fight, you basically always restart right at the part you messed up.  There is also a decent fast-travel network, so you can return to gather collectibles at any time (including after beating the campaign).Lastly, as I alluded to, there is also a multiplayer mode separate from the campaign.  I have played it a bit and can honestly say it has the potential to be pretty fun.  Unfortunately barely anyone plays it.  Although, like most games, it isn’t  dead; you will be able to find some people on here-and-there.  There is a high percentage of cheaters, though— which is also common for low-population multiplayer games.  In short, I wouldn’t count on the multiplayer mode adding any value to your overall experience of this game.So, in summary,  is an outstanding game, with several great features contributing to the experience.  It is an amazing blend of adventure and action with a strong narrative and beautiful aesthetics— a truly “top-shelf” game.  I recommend it to all gamers who enjoy great single-player experiences.   Even if this style of game isn’t usually in your wheelhouse, this is the kind of game that creates new fans of the genre."

It was very apparent to me that a lot of time and care was put into the making of this excellent game.The visual effects were stunning.  Cutscenes were directed very well and provided for a lot of great screen shot moments.  Character animations were realistic and played smoothly.The writing was done pretty well for an Origin story.  The plot mostly takes a survivor story spin with a small amount of adventure thrown in.  The story is linear, though once you get access to fast travel, you can go back and get collectibles you may have missed earlier.  The game took me roughly 20 hours to complete on normal difficulty settings.  Voice acting was also very good.  I really enjoyed seeing Lara starting out so green and inexperienced and then grow into the seasoned adventurer that she eventually becomes.  The game is very tough on the young Lara and I could not help but feel bad for the character as she gets battered and bruised repeatedly throughout the story.Combat takes a cover shooter approach.  The game does provide some small amount of stealth activities to take out enemies silently but few options exist to stealth past encounters entirely.  There is a simple progression system that allows Lara to aquire skills that improves combat and survival.  There is also a system that allows upgrading and improvements to weapons that Lara acquires throughout the game.  I found the progression to be extremely well-paced throughout the linear plotline, much like the Arkham series of games.  In addition to the shooting, there were a good number of well-placed QTE activities that mixed things up a little.  The maps were very nicely done and made full use of all dimensions to provide for lots of platforming opportunities.  The game auto-saved progress regularly and had very generous checkpointing so that you will not have to redo much at all after a death.I only had a couple of issues with the game overall...There were a few crashes as I played through the game.  Especially if I ALT-TAB frequently.  My system is well above the recommended specs but found that reducing settings helped a little with the sudden crashes.  The game still ran very smooth when my settings were maxed-out but those occasional crashes did get annoying.For an action/adventure type game, it was a bit heavy on the action and a little light on the adventure.  Not quite what I would normally expect from a genre that is heavily inspired by Indiana Jones.  Shooters are one of my favorite types of games but this one felt a little too ""shooty"" for my tastes.  I was not keeping a tally, but Lara would have claimed a body count the size of a small army by the time I completed the game.  Boss encounters were also very lacking.  I would have liked to have seen more tombs that had something to do other than simple physics-based puzzles to complete and ways to complete more sections of the game through stealthy non-lethal means.One other minor complaint are the death animations.  I already had a hard time seeing Lara put through some of the tortures of this adventure, but a few of the death animations were a little over-the-top.  Not sure if getting impaled through the face was really necessary after failing an action event.Overall I was very surprised and pleased by this game.  I am hoping that we will see further adventures for this rebooted series with the same attention to quality."

This title follows the gritty origin story of Lara Croft and her ascent from a young woman to a hardened survivor as she must fight to unravel the dark history of a forgotten island in order to escape its relentless hold. Being quite the cinematic experience from start to finish, this title quickly pulls you into a fantastic adventure and simply will not let go which is what a truly great game is able to accomplish with the right story, eyecatching graphics and edge of the seat action. Along the way you'll also get the opportunity to explore many tombs and solve some challenging puzzles as well. However, during the course of the game this title did make me cringe alot because this young lady manages to take quite the punishment from all manner of falls, injuries and combat yet despite these horrible events it was very inspirational to see her persevere through it all and emerge such a strong and confident female. This is a truly great origin story that will set the pace for what will no doubt be an excellent continuation of the Tomb Raider franchise.Graphically, this game is such a stunning showcase of visuals. Even though this title came out in 2013, on ultra settings one could easily mistake this for a ""next generation"" game as it's that gorgeous. The CG and rendering is amazing. The lighting is simply spectacular whether you're scaling the cliffside of some random mountain at high noon or quietly walking around a darkened tomb with a torch. Also, each area of the island is varied and has a uniqueness of it's own. This is definitely not one of those games that uses recycled environments...yes I'm talking to you Dragon Age II. One of my favorite things about the visuals in this title is the fantastic attention to detail and immersion that Crystal Dynamics took. For example, when Lara walks through a forest the shrubbery and foliage moves apart as she trudges through it. You can also hear twigs and leaves snap and rustle as you step on them it's simply brilliant. The game also does a fantastic job of seamlessly blending transition sequences and quick time events into the gameplay. There are no loading screens unless you're entering or exiting the game which is a very nice touch and really shows the amount of polish that Crystal Dynamics put on this title.The musical score and sound effects in this game are also exceptionally done. Jason Graves does a fantastic job with the soundtrack appropriately scoring action sequences, tomb raiding as well as dramatic moments of shock and awe which are quite abundant in this game. That ""attention to detail"" that I mentioned before about the graphics in this title definitely extends to the sound quality as well.  I've been a fan of the Tomb Raider franchise since the very beginning so when the series was due for a reboot I was very excited and rightly so because this is just an amazing title. I originally preordered this game and started playing at release a few years ago but, I'm sorry to say, a few hours into the game I ran into a big problem with the prompts not showing up during the quicktime events which was extremely annoying at the time...I believe I punched two maybe three babies I can't say for sure?! Crystal Dynamics eventually fixed the issue but before that happened I stopped playing and had moved on to something else but I can't believe that it has taken me this long to come back. With its gripping story, dazzling action and added multiplayer I'll no doubt be playing this game time and time again. There are also a multitude of achievements to seek which, if you're a gamer like me who loves to explore and find things, is a welcome addition to the gameplay. This title should be in everyones Steam library...highly recommended!!!"

It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. In the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda piss you off.+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value. Buy it used if you have a console, wait for a sale on Steam if you have a PC.For a much more in-depth critique, please check out the full version of this review:It talks about the Lara Croft Reboot, Character Empowerment, Ludonarrative Dissonance, Design, Platforming, and Quick Time Events.If you like what you see, join our Steam group for updates!"

When the Endurance is grounded on the shores of an island while on an archaeological expedition, young Lara Croft must face the armed and dangerous inhabitants of the isle in order to save her friends while discovering the mystery that has been causing shipwrecks and airplane crashes for centuries.: This reboot of the franchise takes the game in a whole new direction where your young and naive character learns to survive against the harsh weather and homicidal community, all the while exploring the island. You train your skills with the experience points you amass from battle and from uncovering tombs and dozens of hidden collectibles, including relics and journals left from the earlier Yamatai Empire and other people who ended up on the island through the centuries. You also collect salvage and parts with which to craft and upgrade your various weapons. The story is pretty interesting in itself, you'll feel halfway between  and  through most of it. The platforming and environmental puzzle solving is optimized for a game controller, and the rest of the gameplay is ducking and shooting which seems pulled right out of the  series.: The interaction with the environment can break the immersion in subtle ways, from the climbable cliff sides that are exclusively located at way too convenient locations, to the fact that there usually is only one specific pre-determined way to solve puzzles or reach specific areas. Ammo is also too convenient: loot an enemy who was attacking you with a bow, and it just happens that the only ammo he has is the one for that machine gun you haven't reached full ammo capacity, yet. The more cinematic scenes are often resolved by a quicktime event involving timed or repetitive button pressing. A mere handful of side characters get any development, and there's nothing you can do to save those that will face a story-determined death.: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!This game is much better than I expected it to be. It might not be genre-defining, but it's a franchise-changing success that convinced me to get my hands on . Fans of the original games beware: this one is very different. But if you never cared for the franchise before, you really should reconsider and give this iteration a try!—————————————————————————"
17,2,W=F.SCOSθ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LOLPPPWW22211/,63,1,1,20.7,"Posted: June 9, 2020",724,3,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/a2c30aa64433d2624393c30f43c424718908829a.jpg,"This time reviewing a perfect rated game. First of all, I have completed overall 100% of this game (not by achievement side) means all collectibles, challenges and everything. So let's start.★ Gameplay ➜Tomb Raider is an Action, adventure,puzzle-solving third person game based on an open-world environment. There is only one map in this game and enough to explore the whole world. There is no mini-map. By its name, the game series should be more focused on searching for tombs, artifacts, relics, historical interest, puzzle, traps, etc. I was expecting that but it doesn't exist properly here. The thing is something different. First 80% of gameplay gonna be end by saving your friends and learning the survival tactics which makes this game more enjoyable but doesn't judge its name properly. But the developer arranged the whole trilogy successfully like the next sequel is going to be more tomb searching rather than learning survival tactics and the main protagonist of this game Lara Croft going to be a great adventurer and experienced.In this game, the gameplay is mainly focused on using environmental stuff properly, learn survival tactics against some crazy enemies and weak animals. So hunting is a part of this game but not so much enlarged. There are some RPG elements I have found. The skill tree was really good but expecting some more useful skills. Combat is based on weapons bow and cover as well as playing stealth is important to success in Lara's opinion. Bow, Weapon and it's customization is also great, you have to explore for parts which are really enjoyable. Here searching for collectibles is interesting because every time you have try something new, so never felt bored and reveals interesting information. Climbing is my favorite part in this game because it is not only restricted in 'W and Space' but also using equipment is also necessary as there are climbing-axe,rope ascender, rope arrow etc . Enemies are crazy, they do everything to get Lara. So every time searching for something new is required to survive their ambushes. Quick time event and close quarter combat were like an action movie. I think this part made this game famed. Besides insane fighting with enemies, there are some optional Tomb which is not so much puzzled in my opinion. Lara has got a great instinct, you have to use it to progress in this case. Using fire torch in dark caves thrilled me. There is no repetitive content so I never felt bored. But I have felt some lacking like there is no underwater part as Lara is on an island. There are no survivors without Lara and it's team so there is no side mission in this game. Lara can't climb trees etc.★Story ➜Story is really cool, some people suggested me to explore it's story. After completing the story, I am fully satisfied by story progression. Basically, Lara wanted to be an explorer and adventurer from her childhood, wanted to explore the beauty of this world. So as part of his dream, she was in a team traveling by ship intending to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai which is the Island of Japan. There is a famous archaeologist in that team but the whole team always listens to Lara as she has got good instincts. According to Lara's speech, they changed directions and their ship crashed by a dangerous storm. So they stuck on a mysterious island as there is no escape for dangerous weather and separated from teammates. Now the journey starts from here.The story was full of mystery and suspense, related to their whole team like a Hollywood movie.Story was large enough to enjoy.★★ Graphics, Optimization, Soundtrack and Miscellaneous ➠➠➠As a game of 2013 graphics designing was really cool. Design of Character, Environment, Jungle, Tree, details, texture, shadow, water, bloom, lens and flare, sky, cloud everything was fine. Not best but fine. The combination of shiny and stormy weather was amazing. Optimization was quite well. But I was expecting better sound quality and more music. Faced a lot of bugs like I have executed jumping upward but Lara jumps on right or left and dead. The animation and movement screen during the quick time event like escaping a collapsing cave was up to the mark. I was amazed by their story representation.★Multiplayer ➠So many don't know about the multiplayer of this game. Multiplayer is actually quite fun. It is totally PVP and has got a match instantly. Ping was Under 150 which means totally playable, PVP rewards are good, can be used in single player. Multiplayer of this game is also recommended if anyone wants to spend time.Personal Overall Rating -19/20As a Tomb Raider rating -6/10 (Less historical stuff and puzzles, more action,adventure and RPG)By the way, Lara is one of the greatest female thief in this world. Sorry for any mistakes If I made any"

That said, it offers an interesting storyline for developing who Lara Croft becomes and provides some neat avenues for that to happen.The gameplay is reasonably fluid, climbing and navigating have their moments of frustration, but overall it's a positive experience. If you're into the cinema feel, this game is like living in a movie: the cutscenes are impressive, the lighting and textures are gorgeous and the whole feel is immersive. As Lara gets beaten and bruised throughout the game, you'll find yourself wishing for a reprieve for her, because the events just never let up.Achievement-wise, the collectables offer a little more backstory, and I was able to get them all in the first playthrough before finishing the game, so that earns props from me.The important factor, is it fun? Yes, you'll have a great time climbing and fighting throughout the game, but your experience is more limited to being along for the ride in Lara's story, rather than actual feeling like you're influencing anything she's doing.Overall, it's a solid adventure with a great cinematic feel, just don't expect too much control over it."

I thoroughly enjoyed this game (this is the first TR game I’ve played so I can’t compare it with Lara’s previous outings) and, a few gripes aside. Visually, this game is very striking. It also has a pretty good AI and enjoyable combat. The voice acting is good, and the storyline, despite being conventional, is better than average. The mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, combat, and parkour-style platforming is well-balanced and satisfying and gives the game a much broader scope than most. A couple of the QTEs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying, but on the whole the set-pieces are well choreographed, impressively designed, and fun to complete. The save system is also a little frustrating, especially if you happen to mistime a jump halfway between checkpoints (sadly us PC gamers are used to this). Overall TOMB RAIDER is an impressive example of excellent game design and is immensely enjoyable to play."
22,3,PrinzEugen,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030080447/,64,3,1,40.4,"Posted: January 23, 2018","1,264",6,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/6abfb3b0370812bcbe792c57af80f6269b7ff068.jpg,"This game is one of the most widely praised on Steam, currently sitting at an average rating of 95%, a figure that is all the more impressive since it is based on over 60,000 user reviews. I played it several years after its release in 2013, but even almost five years later, it still holds its own in almost every domain.I only touched briefly upon the earlier instalments in this series, so I won’t be comparing the reboot with the games that preceded it. And just like any game, a reboot, being a fresh start of a series, deserves to be judged on its own merits. In this case, those merits are abundant: I have seldom enjoyed an action adventure game as much as I did here. The story starts promising, with Lara Croft on a discovery towards an almost mythical archeologic place together with a fellow professor, a film crew and the ship’s crew. Things do go awfully wrong very soon, and the game tries to evoke how Lara evolves from your next-door archaeologist into a very tough survivor. Although this is a great concept, it’s not executed to perfection: Lara becomes a battle-hardened killer and an extremely tough survivor way too soon to be believable in any way. Still, I quickly felt a connection to Lara, mainly thanks to the impressive voice acting and some neat details like her “thought by the campfire” which come up now and then. The fact that she looks gorgeous, and far more realistic than in the earlier games, surely did play a role in this as well.Not that the game aims for realism in any other way: I’ve seldom seen a character survive falls from such heights, and even taking several bullets in a gunfight can’t get our heroine down. The story doesn’t entirely convince in the end: although it is expertly told, it ultimately suffers from too many clichés and foreseeable twists. But I doubt that the majority of the people playing a  game are really wanting a believable story. This game is all about fast-paced action scenes which get the adrenalin pumping and more relaxed exploration, looking for as much loot and collectibles as possible in order to upgrade your weapons (which look great) and to unlock new skills. The feeling of progression is definitely there, and since the enemies become tougher and more numerous, the game never becomes overtly easy despite Lara’s weapons and dirty tricks packing a lot of punch in the final stages of the game.The actual gameplay is very smooth and pleasant, both in the combat and in the pivotal exploring (climbing and sliding included) department. Playing with an Xbox 360 controller, Lara felt very responsive indeed. Graphically, this is still an impressive game, despite its age. The island off Japan’s coast comes to live vividly, thanks to some wide views over both ocean and land, and an abundant use of vertical space: climbs, rockfaces and hills feel for once almost real, not diminutive. There are enough options to suit everyone’s taste and the game ran extremely smoothly for me at 60-75fps on my mid-range pc (see my profile if you’re interested in the specs).I didn’t buy any of the dlc, since it is mostly geared towards the multiplayer element of the game, which seems dead by now (early 2018). So I cannot comment on that aspect of the game. Sadly, for those aiming for a perfect game achievements-wise, a fair amount of those can only be obtained through the multiplayer, so it would be almost impossible to get the game towards 100% anymore.In the end, this was a very pleasant gaming experience thanks to the highly polished state of the game, which executes a good overall plan almost to perfection. It didn’t go beyond that, however: the experience probably won’t stick in my memory, as I never felt truly emotionally involved or intellectually challenged. But there is nothing wrong with a game that just wants to be excellent entertainment, after all."

When I first discovered Tomb Raider, I was so enthralled that I played it three times back-to-back, only stopping because my backlog was crying. The first thing I noticed were the gorgeous graphics.  There are tiny details everywhere, from incidental carvings that you'll only see for a moment, to the way Lara shivers in the cold, or the way her arms shake with exertion when she lifts something heavy.  The cutscenes are beautifully-directed, and add much to the story.  The voices, music, and sound effects are superb, and every aspect of this game weaves together to form a stunning and vibrant tapestry. EVERYTHING is beautiful, even the ugly things. is multi-faceted, and you can tailor it to your preferred style.  Want to face your enemies head-on, Rambo-style?  You can do that!  Prefer to explore and learn everything about this island and its inhabitants?  You can do that, too!  My personal preference is option #2 with a healthy dose of I-Am-The-Night stealth and silently removing enemies before they know I'm there. are many, ranging from relics, treasure maps, and journals to area-specific quests like blowing up old sea mines.  I am a completionist, and one who loves finding every last scrap of story and information in a game, but there is an incentive to find everything possible, even for the Rambo-types... Experience and Salvage. nets you Skill Points, which are used to upgrade Skills: Survivor, Hunter, and Brawler.  I won't bore you with the list of possible upgrades, but here's an example of each: Increased Exp when looting, Increased ammo capacity, Dodge skills  allows you upgrade your various weapons: Bow, Pistol, Rifle, and Shotgun.  You'll even find weapon parts if you look hard enough, which increases the power of your weapons even more!The  will show all of the items that will get you to 100% completion on the game, but do NOT show quest items, ammo, orange plants, or salvage, all of which will also add to your Exp & Salvage totals.  Another great way to earn both is by hunting and looting, especially if you go for those headshots I mentioned earlier.  (Bonus experience; ka-CHING!)Want those treasure maps?  The secret tombs are where you'll find them.  These tombs are pretty hard to miss, since you'll hear a chime play whenever you get close to them.  Raiding a tomb consists of puzzling out how to get to the payoff (large chest, ho!), and generally take about 10 minutes each to complete.  They're a great addition to the game, and the experience bonus is a GREAT incentive to go exploring!Throughout your travels you'll find , which serve as extra saves points (the game auto-saves), and will also allow you to apply the skill points you've earned and to spend your salvage on upgrades.  They also serve as """" points, and will allow you to transport to different areas of the map instantly.  Be aware that fast travel is not always available, depending on where you are in the story.There are intermittent  that will require you to... well, to survive. lol~  If you're dexterity-challenged such as myself, I recommend sticking with it -- It's absolutely worth the many times you'll end up dying. ;)There are  available, 15 of which are for multi-player include Concept Art (too many to count!) and 18 Character ModelsIn closing, to me Tomb Raider 2013 is well-nigh the perfect game, blending all of my favorite elements with a hefty dose of knuckle-whitening action, and leaving me with nothing but a feeling of total satisfaction.  I cannot stress enough how good this game is, so what are you waiting for?  PLAY IT NOW!!"

In this game however, Lara is NOTHING like she used to be, she is weak, scared, unexperienced and had just graduated. She does not go out raiding tombs and treasures, because she wants to, she just gets thrown into this life by destiny. When she and her comrads sail to the island Yamatai to film it and discover some 'treasures' for money, their ship gets caught in a mysterious storm and everyone gets seperated. Now it's up to you, to find your friends and escape this island. Throughout the game you need to learn how to hunt, fight, craft new weapons, survive... and sometimes raid tombs... in order to get out of there alive. Lara quickly learns, that the island and it's presence is her greatest enemy. The animals are not the only ones, that want Lara dead, but also an ancient army (which I'm not gonna go into more detail here) and fearsome hunters who inhabit the dangerous island.Tomb Raider is a solid singleplayer third-person action adventure with a catching story, great gameplay and beautiful visuals. The gameplay does remind alot of the 'Uncharted' series, which is not a bad thing, considering the games are both similar. A multiplayer mode, similar to 'The Last of Us' multiplayer is also included, but not a big highlight and definately not needed. If you think of buying the Game of the Year edition, there's no need in doing so, since it only comes with one 5 minute tomb and TONS of useless multiplayer skins, which noone needs anyways.I strongly recommend 'Tomb Raider' to everyone who likes action adventures like 'Uncharted' and games with great gameplay and graphics.9.5/10"

The storyline for Tomb Raider made me care about each character and what happened to them throughout the duration of my playthrough. It never felt tedious and was excellently written. Loved it.- Open World is a plus. I really liked how the developers made the environment open for exploration in each level, which really encouraged you to look around for secret areas, items, etc. that would spawn around the map.-Fighting is well programmed. Fights in Tomb Raider always felt smooth, and through the style of the game, it put YOU in the driver's seat on how to engage enemies. The variety of weapons in the game match these various styles too, and they sometimes even have uses outside of fighting, which I found interesting. - The Goal in the game is clear. Tomb Raider is a perfect example of great script writing in this sense. I never felt like I was aimlessly doing something in the plot. I felt like every action I made had some meaning that pushed me closer to the end of the story.- The game is challenging, but not overly so. Playing my first run-through of the game, I had no idea what I was getting into. At the same time, the game can be very conducive to new players, teaching them the mechanics of each tool early off in the game without deliberatly giving you a tutorial that has no meaning to the game. That being said, I died many times, but quickly learned how to avoid the situations that had killed me in the past. - Game Environment is gorgeous, VERY immersive. Each scene has a picturesque feel to it. You can be running through an environment and be awestruck from just looking out into the distance. You feel like you're there beside Lara Croft.CONS- Won't hold your hand. This game can be very conducive to new players, but I was frustrated with certain levels in the game and their difficulty. This game will not hold your hand, whether you like it or not, it'll throw you into the deep end with no floaties. Prepare yourself!- No substantitive DLC! The DLC for Tomb Raider consists mostly of player skins, but I would've loved to see another few missions added as something a little extra. I understand the studio that made this game was planning to make Rise of the Tomb Raider and didn't want to creatively drain themselves, but I would've loved to see some post-story missions or thematic material. This has to be one of the best games I've ever played. If you're still looking to buy Tomb Raider, it's always on sale during Steam sales, but it is always worth it to buy this game. I literally have nothing bad to say about it functionally or about the story. You WILL be amazed. 9.5/10"

The game has plenty of action parts, and plenty of exploring to be had. I have finally finished the game, which I never thought I could do, but now I want more. So now I will go back over the island to my last save camps and teleport back and forth, and try and seek out and find as many unfound items, relics and diarys that I have missed and perhaps complete some small task challenges as well.If your a fan of Tomb Raider and love Lara Croft, then this game is a must play, so if you have the game and have not  gotten around to playing it yet, then you really should add this game to your ""to play list"". The game did not disapoint, and my laptop handled it really well, but I had to have all settings set to low and I was very impressed with the quality my laptop presented me. It does make my laptop run at higher core temperature's as I have noticed, but never crashed or coursed me any mager issues. I have not tried out the Multiplayer side to this game, and not sure if its still viable to do so. I would like to give it a try at some point in time, just to see what its like and if its as good as single player.Yeah I know my review is not so great, but I just wanted to share that I finally finished this game, but not 100% completion, as I still have multiplayer acheviements to be had (I may not get any of them anyway) as multiplayer may be dead.Anyway the game was fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even if I did die plenty times."

Despite my deep and abiding love for Indiana Jones I never had any interest in her games, not until the distant Guardian of Light made it to Xbox Live Arcade. That primed the big Tomb Raider reboot to be the perfect place to jump on the raiding train, especially with its open world features and collectibles that felt included just to appeal to hopeless packrats like myself. I expected a bit of spectacle with it but what I got far surpassed my expectations, both in enjoyment and intensity.Forget the T-rex slaying supersoldier Lara you might remember from your childhood, this one is a humble researcher on an archaeological expedition. The crew of the research vessel Endurance is on the trail of the lost Japanese kingdom of Yamatai somewhere in the west Pacific, and ends up shipwrecked on a mysterious island. Things go south for Lara and her friends very quickly as the island’s ruthless inhabitants hunt them down for their own ends. Pushed to her limits, Lara begins to grow and adapt into a warrior who can fight back against her foes and save her friends from threats both familiar and fantastic.“Pushed to her limits” is not just flowery language, as much as I like being flowery. The hallmark of the Tomb Raider reboot is struggle, illustrating exactly what dire circumstances transform Lara from a bright-eyed scholar to a stone-cold killer. In the first twenty minutes of the game she wades through filthy water, eats a chunk of rebar to the gut, and weathers a brutal assault. The game never really lets up on poor Lara either, reuniting her with friends before cruelly snatching them away, sending aircraft and entire villages tumbling at her, and sticking you with some of the most disturbing death animations around if you foul up certain escapes. Honestly it can feel like a horror game at times if you’re not so good at avoiding the quick-time-event fatalities.I’m getting this out of the way because it’s an important caveat to an otherwise magnificent game. You’ll need a bit of a strong stomach to get through this one, or at least suspension of disbelief that wading through pits of fouled blood won’t kill a person via disease outright. Lara’s journey is a harrowing and stressful one but it’s also full of incredible sights and setpieces to experience. Early on you have to climb a radio tower and the sequence is done so well that I began sweating and second-guessing my actions, even while marveling at the incredible scenery. The many escapes from collapsing or exploding structures are done just as well, and the story beats that accompany them help build the legend of the warrior woman Lara becomes under your control.In terms of control, Tomb Raider plays much like other third-person adventures like Arkham Asylum or Shadow of Mordor. The melee brawls of those games are traded for fast-paced cover shooting and vicious ice-pick takedowns here though, so if you were looking for more blood with your tower-climbing and spelunking this will do the trick. Lara isn’t Rambo (yet) so your best options are always going to be stealthy takedowns and long-range gunning, though later in the game the robust upgrade system opens up additional options for close-combat management that can alter your playstyle. Weapon upgrades also provide you more reliable tools for staying in the middle of the fight and always being the last one standing.The real meat of the game is the exploring and, dare I say it, tomb raiding, and in these areas it does not disappoint. The vast island you find yourself in is divided into discrete regions that can be fast-traveled between once you establish camps in them, and each contains a variety of artifacts and notes to turn up. The collectibles are very well done here, providing valuable backstory on the bizarre events in the island’s history and entertaining challenges in reaching them. The tombs themselves are by far the highlight of the game, cleverly-designed puzzle dungeons that will tax your brain at least in a small way before allowing you access to the historical riches within. If I were to lay one real complaint against the game it’s that there aren’t enough of these tombs to raid, both because they’re so entertaining to raid and because it’s the name of the game for God’s sake.Even four years out the graphics are breathtaking at times, tracing every detail of ancient villages and ruined bunkers in the very grain of rotting wood and cracked concrete. Locations look both real and fantastic, images right out of National Geographic of places you can barely believe exist on the same planet as you. Vast caves, cliff-side temples, and snowy peaks await here, matched with some expert sound design that brings it all together with meaty impacts and threatening booms. It’ll take you nearly twenty hours to see everything this title has to offer, and every minute of it promises to be an incredible journey. I may have missed out on Lara’s early adventures but this reboot does more than enough to make me a huge fan, and eager to see what comes next.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at  or on my !"

Thin, small, young student with no relevant skill which  main protagonist of action game should have. But yay, we still have that tight shirt and jeans. After a while, you already know what's going on. Lara is war beast who knock the f. out army of occultists with wide variety of arsenal.Story is banging. Opening even more. Starting things up with awesome cutscene where is our beautiful new rebooted Lara reading on the boat and boom, you wake up in some cave where ugly mountain bastards wants to eat you or kill you or both. If you pay attention, you might say the whole story was pretty predictable but surprises are way way way up and there's lot of them. Singeplayer will last you for estimated 8 hours, (if you go for 100% then maybe 12) but to be honest at least for me, going for 100% was nowhere near to being annoying. It is one of very few games where I really enjoyed getting collectibles and challenges. Places are absolutely beautiful, from deep raining jungles to underground caves, from sandy shipwreck beaches to town from post-apocalyptic movie to amazing ancient asian spots, tombs, houses and villages. Tombs are pretty easy. Maybe first one will be kinda medium, until you realise how the game works, but rest is really obvious and few of them you'll finish within two minutes. Stealth option was funny too.Multiplayer is just to extend your gaming experience. It's nothing significant, after a while it gets really boring, but it's worth putting multiplayer time in to finish achievements. Sometimes when you get nice crew, it can be fun, and some matches you will really remember, but as you can probably see, its understandable that it's not made to be big as BF, but just so Square Enix can sell DLC. This reboot was really great idea, and I am so glad that they did it. Lara is beautiful, it's fun with her and Tomb Raider 2013 is true success. I can't wait to finally play Rise of the Tomb Raider and I wonder if it'll be close to this, or even better!"

Even 7 years down the line (as I write this in 2020). The island you explore is bustling with fauna and environmental effects that make the island feel alive from the get go. And as you explore it only adds onto that. The characters have their own personalities and backstories that make you feel like you're on the island with them. And the story is so raw and down to earth, as you play as Lara discovering her true potential as an awesome historian/archaeologist, you feel like you could be a Croft yourself.There are some character game-play issues throughout, but this was more than likely due to the fact I was not actually supposed to do those things. I only experienced a couple of clipping issues, but considering the level design and fluidity of progress and movement in-game, it wasn't game-breaking.. (I probably deserved it for pushing the game in such a way).Something well worth noting is with optional areas and in-game objects. There are many 'artefacts' and 'documents' that really flesh out the whole game, bringing a sense of realism to the history of ... Well everything! (Other than the common enemy, the Solarii ... There are an unbelievable amount of them on what is supposed to be a lost-unreachable island)But other than a couple of very minor personal issues I experienced, the game itself was one of the best stories I've invested my time into, and for anybody who likes single-player games I couldn't recommend it anymore...And for those that remember the old games, you'll be happy to know with great character design and clever game-play camera angles, Tomb Raider has never looked better! ;D"

The combat feels great, the graphics are excellent, the mouse and keyboard controls are fluid and the game is very optimized. The story is pretty predictable and not that great. Despite being a Tomb Raider game, the tombs are optional and the puzzles are quite easy to solve. The platforming has been made much more simplified now that Lara can stick to almost anything she comes near. There is some exploration in the areas but not as much as it should be. You can go back and revisit the areas since the island is ""open-world"", but there isn't much stuff to do there aside from collecting some boring collectables and the optional tombs. All of the weapons in this game feel great. I liked how the guns evolve when you get enough parts. For example, the WW2 submachine gun you start with turns into some sort of AK-47 and your trench shotgun turns into a SPAS-12 combat shotgun. The weapons sound great aswell. The game sometimes tries too hard to be cinematic, especially at the beginning of the game which is a scripted QTE fest. Actually, there are too many scripted sequences in the later parts aswell which got dull pretty quickly. The QTEs for keyboard are terrible. They use these stupid icons mainly instead of just showing the actual damn key. Sometimes the game does tell you which key to press but it should have been like that in the first place (I would have preferred no QTEs though).Lara goes from innocent girl to stone-cold killer very early on in the game. When she does her first-kill, she goes like ""OH MAH GOD, I KILLED SOMEONE"", then the next thing I'm pulling 360 n0sc0pe headshots with the bow with ease. The survival elements are not very deep at all and feel kinda phoned in. There is hardly any resource management since you can find a ton of ammo on the ground and Lara can regenerate her health. The combat is your standard over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter that you've seen in the last few years, though with a bit of jumping here and there. It's pretty good for the most part. The game holds your hand too much, however. The games treats you like an idiot with giving you forced hints while you're doing the (easy) puzzles. Thankfully, the survival instints feature (Which highlights the stuff where you're supposed to go) is optional. Didn't play much of the multiplayer so can't say much about it but who plays a Tomb Raider game for the multiplayer anyway?Overall, the Tomb Raider reboot is a decent TPS but not a good Tomb Raider game at all. The game would be a lot better if had more exploration, a bigger focus on tombs, little to no QTEs and scripted mumbo jumbo and less hand-holding. Even with all the flaws in the game, I still enjoyed playing it."

It's hard to believe that this game is just nearing its six-year anniversary, mostly because it still looks incredibly stunning and it's still one of the freshest action games that you can play. It's a reboot that not only revamped the Tomb Raider series in its entirety, but it also set the bar for what an action game should be.Of course, the name Lara Croft is known far and wide; from her triangle-boobed early PlayStation days through to her more recent top-down style adventures. This simply named Tomb Raider reboot puts an entirely new spin on a character that most of us have known our entire lives, by shedding new light on her personality and background. Accompanied by her close friends, a mentor, and a ""celebrity"" archaeologist, Lara's first expedition begins on Yamatai; a fictional lost island in the Dragon's Triangle off the coast of Japan, where she is in search of an ancient lost kingdom. However, her ship, The Endurance, soon gets struck by a violent storm and sinks, leaving the group stranded on the hostile and uninviting island with no means of escape. Even worse, a mysterious curse seems to thwart any and all attempts to leave. It's up to Lara and her crew to figure out exactly what is preventing them from leaving Yamatai.The story marks the turning point of Lara going from being a normal archeology major to a hardened badace survivor. The gameplay in this release is more linear in comparison to Rise or Shadow of the Tomb Raider, but that's not to say that there isn't a lot to do. There are tombs to explore, artifacts to collect, challenges to complete, journals to read, and many collectibles to find. You can also upgrade Lara's equipment by finding upgrade components and salvage. She ends up getting decked out with quite a few weapons, a pistol, rifle, shotgun, and her bow, although later games see many variations of the weapons that can be used. There are also three different skill trees to max out, all which provide Lara with powerful benefits to make her feel just that much more like the hardened survivor that she eventually becomes.As it has been said many times over, this reboot of Tomb Raider is exceedingly dark and gritty; there are even moments where you'll find Lara covered head-to-toe in blood. The graphics still hold up exceedingly well for a game that's six years old. More importantly, the gameplay still feels fresh even after over half a decade; this is thanks to the many twists and turns that the plot takes, players never know exactly what they're in for just around the next corner. It's also thanks to the many unique action sequences and interactive scenes.So, is the reboot Tomb Raider worth playing even still in 2019? Absolutely, it's quite possibly one of the best games that you could play in your lifetime. Even if you're not a fan of any of the previous incarnations of Lara Croft or the gameplay style of the original Tomb Raider releases, this total retcon of the series is sure to win you over. If you've already played this reboot and you want to breathe some fresh life into it, it's worth picking it up again on PlayStation 4; the system uses the speaker on its controller to add an entirely new level of depth to the experience. It's a hell of a steal on sale for $3.74 CAD on Steam, but despite how good it is you should be hard-pressed to pay full price since the multiplayer portion has long-since died.The Horror Network  |  Click for Gore"

Single-player has only a few weapons but it's no big problem because most often you will use a bow, Lara's favourite weapon. The game offer weapon upgrading. You will start with old weapons and latter you can find components for an automatic rifle with a grenade launcher so don't forget to open all boxes and explore all hidden tombs. Exploring tombs is fun and they are not same, each offers different puzzles and interesting places. I don't prefer games where you need to jump a lot, but in this game I really enjoyed it. The story is not long. You can finish it in around 8 hours, but I played 15 hours because I explored all hidden tombs and collect all collectables and read it all texts. Multiplayer has only PvP modes. The game could have PvE too. There is no co-op mode, but I think this is mainly single-player game and multiplayer is here only like little addition."

Unfortunately, this is my first Tomb Raider game, so these aren’t the thoughts of a diehard fan. Therefore, I can’t tell you whether the franchise took a step in the right direction or not. I was personally anticipating Tomb Raider to be a copy of an Uncharted game, and I don’t think that my inaccuracy has ever brought me this much happiness. In fact, comparing this with Uncharted is rather silly, because the similarities between the two games end rather quickly. Tomb Raider is its own game with its own unique features. The gameplay is everything I could’ve asked for, and more. You gain XP and purchase skills that are divided into three different branches, or “skill trees”. There are many different ways to gather resources, which allow you to upgrade the 4 weapons Lara finds throughout her journey, each of which have unique advantages in combat. In addition, challenges and collectables are introduced with rewarding incentives, which will encourage you to dive into these fun optional features. While the characters may not have these remarkably appealing personalities, Crystal Dynamics gave us an incredibly strong protagonist. Lara Croft is a clever and tough woman who plays the “hero role” perfectly. Character detail and animations are nearly lifelike and the cut-scenes are cinematically brilliant. Buy this game, you will not regret it.The Good+The new Lara Croft+The captivating setting+The island is the star of the show+Lara's world feels brutal, dangerous and frightening+More depth than you expectThe Bad-Cliched characters, flat dialogue-The slow start"

But this one made me consider, why I actually like them. Unfortunately what I found out is that the parts that made other TR games fun, were changed, or lost in this one. First of all, the fundation of any Tomb Raider - platforming and puzzles. For me, that part of the game was usually the most fun - figuring out where to go, how to get there, and what to do after that. And in this game, it's just not well done. You just follow the white line, and go along. I did not even used the yellow marker (pointing you to destination) and still I was never lost, or forced to stop and think for a secound. And puzzles - the so called ""tombs"", they are a joke. Let's not kid ourselfes a kid from kindergarten will figure them out in like a minute. Another thing is combat. While in the other TR games, you run around and use the mobilty of Lara to evade enemy atacks, while you pepper them with your dual guns (which btw became Lara's trademark, changed in this game to a bow :/) in this game combat is a cover based shooter. Your character doesn't jump, and roll and shoot, rather she just moves from cover to cover. It makes fighing boring. Also it's worth to mention here, that you don't have a lifebar. Instead you just heal all dmage by not taking damge for couple seconds. That also means no more healing kits to find around the maps. And the last thing I'll point out is exploring. In older games exploring was fun, because it rewarded you with ammo, better weapons, healing kits - items that had much impact on your gameplay. Here you get scrap, artifacts and stories. And as much as I enjoy the lore aspect of this game, I can't agree with the scrap mechanics. You get all weapons from story, so there is no way to find a better weapon before you're supposed to, Instead you can upgrade them, yet the upgrades are limited by gun parts you find (meaning if you like some weapoin in particular you can't just pour all your scrap in it, because the part you need to upgrade it is only attainable in the place thats way further up the storyline). The effect of these mechanics is that you don't really feel the need to explore maps, nor you get enjoment from finding hidden stuff. Unless of course you enjoy finding pointless items scattered on the map just to see that you have 100% the map. So to finish this review up I say this: from all the Tomb Raider games I've played this one is the best to look at, and the worst to play, It just does not feel like a Tomb Raider game. If that is the way they want this reboot to go, I don't think I'll enjoy the new Tomb Raider games half as much as the old ones."

At the time, it was 75% off, so I picked up a normally $60 game for  $12.49. At the time of writing, it is yet again on sale for 75% off. Is it worth it? My answer is that for this price, it's a steal.I hadn't played a Tomb Raider game in a while, it must have been a few years ago since I played one, so the chance to explore a reboot of the series excited me, especially at this price. At the start, I had a few problems - the game would crash at the introductory cutscene, and since lore is one of my favorite things in games, I restarted the game and hoped it wouldn't happen again. Unfortunately that wasn't the case, and I wasted more time. I ended up skipping the intro and going to YouTube, but this was a prevalent problem. It does crash at some points, save points are usually not that far behind but the long loading screen just made it an annoying inconvenience. But if you're willing to look past a few lost immersion points, then you're in for a hell of a game.To start off with, the game looks fantastic. I had my graphics on low because of my sub-par computer, and it still looks amazing. Putting them on ultra would be fantastic. The scenery, and sounds, and little touches make this incredibly immersive if not for the third person perspective. The people move fluidly and realistically as well, I'm not exactly sure but I'm betting they used real life actors to animate the scenes.Want to continue reading for a more in depth review?

From the revolutionary first game, through its progressively mediocre sequels, eventual revival with Legend and then repeated downward spiral, it’s not always been the most successful of franchises but nonetheless is one of the most enduring throughout its failures. With Tomb Raider 2013 (hence force just “Tomb Raider” or “TR”) Crystal Dynamics has done away with many of the hallmarks of the series, leaving something behind that some may argue bares little resemblance to its predecessors but in my eyes is the exact incarnation of what Tomb Raider needed to become relevant again.Gone are the lengthy, puzzle riddled tombs, the emphasis on absurd level designs, lackluster combat, and an enormous set of breasts standing in for a protagonist. In their place we find a tightly knit, extremely cinematic, blockbuster action game that completely overhauls what we consider TR to be and turns it into something far more compelling and polished than the series has ever been.As an origin story, TR is as much the story of Lara Croft’s ascension from curious but naive archaeologist to the incredibly self sufficient treasure hunter we know her best as, as it is the harrowing account of an expedition gone south as Lara and co become stranded on an island populated by what could most easily be described as the criminally insane. It’s a darker narrative than we’ve ever seen with Lara, with moments that made me legitimately cringe and could very nearly be categorized as horror, but it’s also the deepest and most personal.Lara is a fragile and vulnerable character, but not a helpless one, and in watching her grow and overcome so many trials she becomes an immensely relatable and empathetic character. She keeps your attention from cheap sex appeal, but for the fact she’s a believable and well acted character; flawed and broken by the events around her, but never beaten by them. It’s a shame the others characters didn’t receive nearly the same level of development, though for what they are they provide enough of a narrative hook to be memorable. If I had any issue with the story, it’s that it disappointingly falls back on the series trademark supernatural elements in the latter half, which came off as almost silly in such a realistic and brutal world. But even then, the plot moves at such a quick pace and so much velocity that it remains almost absurdly compelling the entire way through, making it easy to gloss over an occasional lack of exposition to just enjoy the ride.Where TR has seen the most growth over past games though, is in the refinement and broadening of its mechanics. Combat is no longer a tedious lock on affair, but made up of brutal, intense encounters that are consistently evolving and requiring you to constantly think on your feet as enemies react and attempt to flank you from all sides. For this the auto cover system works shockingly well, causing you to crouch behind objects when enemies are nearby and easily pop in and out as you pop enemies off. It’s fast and feels incredibly fluid, never once breaking on me as similar systems have in the past, but instead given me one less thing to worry about so I can focus my attention elsewhere.This would mean little if the gunplay wasn’t excellent, but to Crystal Dynamics credit they’ve crafted some of the most satisfying third person shooting of any game I’ve played in recent memory. Your arsenal is limited, but it’s composed solely of the weapons you will actually need, chief among them an amazing bow which works brilliantly as both a stealth weapon and a powerful killing machine if you’re spotted. It defines the combat in TR and gives it its own identity that I’ve yet to tire from.The other most prominent part of the experience is the Uncharted-esq platforming (I tad ironic considering where that game got most of its roots), which if anything is scaled back from what it used to be but is made up for with how intuitive and fast movement has become. There is no extraneous platforming to be found here, but a focused and dynamic moveset that works with the environment to direct you where to go and gives you no trouble getting there. It really cannot be overstated how much of an improvement this is over the often confusing, terribly imprecise level traversal of even Crystal Dynamics’s prior TR game, Underworld. I never once had to fuss with the camera or controls, which is more than I can say of even most of TR’s contemporaries.Wrapping this altogether is an open world that finds the sweet spot between so large it becomes overwhelming to navigate, and too small you lose all sense of scale. It’s distinct and enjoyable to explore, packed with secrets that actually mean something and are used to flesh out the world past the core plot.And less you somehow forget, this is an absolutely astonishing looking game, with a recognizable art style and some incredible environmental effects. Watching a building be torn apart by violent winds, or fire engulf a ship is jawdropping, even more so when it’s viewed through a wonderfully cinematic camera that escalates even simple scenes into something you can’t look away from. It’s simply gorgeous, and has been scarily well optimized so much so that my mid-range PC barely flinched as I began turning settings up well past what I expected I could.Tomb Raider might not be what you expect, but it’s a game that deserves all the praise and recognition it has received. Crystal Dynamics has managed to once again salvage a series and brought it to a height I didn’t think was possible. It’s a stunning adrenaline rush, that does as much for Lara’s character as it does for rejuvenating the franchise, which by the end had left me with a lack of words past a barely audible “wow”."

Well, I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say it's one of the best games of this generation.You start off as Lara Croft, in which you experience many  endeavors that unfold while playing as her. She specializes in whatever you want her to be, whether its using a bow and arrow, weapons like a pistol and shotgun, or just to boost up your survival skills.While you are Lara, you can do many things, such as climbing on reachable rocks, jump from one place to another, and of course hunting down everyone trying to kill you.The graphics are fantastic. It's not much of an open world, but seeing all these tombs and ancient temples give the game a great and immersive experience. It also makes the game ooze with atmosphere without any technical hiccups or frame rate drops, which sometimes ruin the experience. You don't need an amazing graphicss card to play this. I have a GTX 660 TI with a Core i5 2500k @ 3.3ghz and it runs very smooth.The enemy variety is smart and will hunt you down. Unless you're not spotted, you can use your special bow and arrow and attack enemies from a distance without any guards alerting one another. It is quite fun, and gives the game a great sense of pace.I like the game because it never tries to hold your hand, and it makes you want to figure out everything on your own. The game can get pretty intense with cutscenes and the (""run for your life"") quick-time events. There's just enough of everything to keep this game interesting for the player.The game also has multiplayer, but not many have been playing it.

When we talk of reboots in general, we get mixed feelings since nostalgia plays an important role. Not to mention that most video game reboots lack in both quality and scope. Not the case with this game. It captures the essence of Lara Croft and delivers a compelling origin story to one of gaming's strongest female characters.

On one side, it's an amazing game, no doubt about that. It's an action adventure game, with platforming and puzzles, similar to the Uncharted series. And you can see it almost as a competitor. The story tells the origin of Lara Croft as a tomb raider, through survival. The game has a decent story, characters and music, good graphics and fluid gameplay. What i really liked were the unique sequences that this game has, which are plenty and intense. If you only play it for the story, it feels more like a movie, which isn't that bad here. If you try to do 100%, the extra exploration needed will make it feel more like a game. The game quality is consistent, being great from beginning to end. Now for the other side of the coin. To put it simply: this isn't a Tomb Raider game. The main series games are also similar, but they put a lot of attention in it's puzzles. I'm not gonna criticize the straight platforming of this reboot, but the lack of challenging puzzles really hurts this game. You'll solve most of them in a few minutes, and many are optional. Really? Even the hardest ones won't take more than 10 minutes to solve (there were 2 or 3 of these). And to make things easier, the game has an in-game hint system, showing where you need to go, which objects you can interact with, and more, effectively guiding you through the whole game if you like. There should at least be a mode in which this system was permanently disabled for purists. Basically, the main challenge of the previous titles are gone, creating an identity crisis. So, should you play this game? Absolutely. It's an amazing title, gripping you the entire journey. But don't think of it as a ""true"" Tomb Raider game, otherwise you'll be disappointed."

The Island is beautiful, featuring a variety of different areas to explore along with tons of hidden unlockables. Tomb Raider feels like a lot of other games combined, mainly Resident Evil 4 mixed with a bit of Uncharted and maybe some Assassin’s Creed style platforming. This meshes together very well into a lengthy and enjoyable action/adventure game. The story is somewhat forgettable but the gameplay is solid (although it’s fairly easy). The multiplayer isn't worth mentioning, it's decent but not anything special.

It has semi open-world, decent stealth mechanic, fast and fluid combat, simple story with great graphics and voice acting.Keep in mind, I don't review the multiplayer aspect, this review only covers single player.The first thing that appeal to me is the graphic. It's excellently designed and implemented. While some don't make sense like Lara's TressFX hair (right, her stylish and silky smooth hair after she jumps into the mess anyone?), the scenery and environment are indeed breathtaking. If you can max out your in-game settings without any FPS drop, do it, you'll be amazed. The cutscenes / movies are also excellent looking and pretty realistic.Oh, you can test your rig in-game, it has its own internal test to see how good your rig to play the game and adjust the setting accordingly.If you have good speakers, plug it in, the combat feels very realistic with surround sound. But most of the time, though, you won't pay any attention because Lara's pretty weak and goes down after few shots, and it's better to run away when you enter the combat and fight from afar or even better kill one by one by stealth from the beginning. I have to give a prop for the voice actors, without them the game would be less than complete - a good VOs is always welcome for any kind of game for me.Gameplay has similarities with Batman Arkham Asylum. While the combat is extremely on a different side, the stealth mechanic has emphasis here, playing with many gadgets (Hook Claw vs Hook Arrow) and the limited scope of open world remains the same (Asylum is locked to a prison, here you're in an island of nowhere). Tomb Raider has fast travel feature in form of camps, though, it is handy to access all side-quests that require backtracking if you're too far ahead. There's essentially a mirror of Batman's Riddler Quest here in form of collectibles. You'll have no shortage hidden objects to collect to complete your collections and achievements. And yes, some are really well hidden making it harder, probably you might want to see Youtube videos for guide or something. I've given up collecting everything though, lack of dedication of my part. :)Every game has its flaws, and Tomb Raider is no different. A few notable downsides are, for example: boring, repeated QTEs where some require you to trial and error and so when you die in that particular QTE you're forced to watch the previous cutscene. Yeah, damned QTEs, and even Resident Evil 6's doesn't do it this way.Another one is the hunting mechanic, it doesn't really add much value to the main game. So you hunt the wild animals and loot some resources, then what? Nothing more. It feels pretty detached in my opinion, it's only there for the sake of it.Lara is also even better than Batman. There's no way a girl like her would be able to run overnight without fatigue, fight many strong armed men simultaneously, and after receiving open wounds she can still fight like monster. Not to mention Lara's shotgun is still fully functional even after submerged in many of her QTEs in the river/water. While it's a downside definitely, it's a side effect of the game being linear and thus no realism. On PC, the game's still better played with Keyboard + Mouse. I've tried using Controller for several hours and the results are miserable. The game requires your aim skill when you fight, controller can't do that, there's no auto aim here. If you insist though, you can plug your Xinput capable controller and set it up in-game menu. Dinput doesn't fare well and even requires some specific hack to make it work properly, so not recommended.For side perks, it has achievements if you're into it and cloud save which is a must for all games nowadays and it has saved me several times from losing my progress. You can also jump into the multiplayer if you like, though I never touch it since Tomb Raider is only all about single player for me.Overall, this is a proper AAA, something that I can really recommend despite some flaws. Most of the times the game would be on heavy sale, so get it if you like the genre.8,5/10"

The graphics are stunning from the diverse environments to the character models.  The game does a great job at showcasing your beautiful surroundings.  Tomb Raider has an excellent story that marks the transformation of Lara Croft the young expeditionist into Lara Croft the deadly tomb raider.  You really get a sense of the internal struggle Lara faces having to transfrom into a killing machine.  The cut scenes are emotionally intense and well acted.  The game is very cinematic and sometimes you feel like your watching a movie.  The gameplay is addrenaline packed and the third person perspective suits the action well.  Climbing and traversing the terrain never felt so fun and dangerous.  Melee combat is smooth and brutal.  Your trusty pickaxe used for climbing makes a nasty weapon.  Although there are not a ton of different guns to use, each has its purpose.  They do a good job of making Lara feel powerful and a destructive force.  Especially when you utilize the bow and arrow effectively you feel like your Legolas from LOTR.  There are alot of unique caves, tombs, and other locations to explore.  There is the odd puzzle that is never too difficult but adds a nice element to the game.  There are tons of collectibles and lore to unearth. The multiplayer though non active is entertaining if you can find some people to play.  All in all this is a must play for any gamer and a truly enjoyable and memorable ride."

The plot is pretty good, and I'd say it shows Lara's evolution from a sort of bookworm archaeologist to the badass we all know and love; of course, she still isn't all badass by the end of the game, but she's now ready to actually take on some big adventure.So, to actually talk something about the story, it begins with Lara and friends getting stranded in an island somewhere in the Pacific during a huge storm. While at first it seems to be a pretty normal island, with a few ruins and such, soon she encounters some of its inhabitants, who seem to be cultists of some sort, and strange things begin to happen whenever Lara and her friends try to leave the island. I won't go into much detail here, but I'd say the story is very good.The gameplay seems to be more action oriented rather than being about platforming puzzles and such, but I'd say that's better, considering the game's plot. There's a few different weapons you'll find along the way, which you can upgrade in different ways, along with several tools to help you navigate the different environments. Even then, there's also a bit of platforming here and there, and there's plenty of collectibles to find, some of which give a lot of background to the game's plot, although they aren't necessary to understand the story.When it comes to level design, I'd say they did a great job when making the island. There's many different areas you can explore along the way, from jungles to old WWII bunkers, and even ancient Japanese castles. You can also return to some of these areas later on, when you've found new tools, in order to discover new secrets.The game also has a multiplayer component, but that's something I don't really recommend. I don't see why some developers and/or publishers feel the need to add a multiplayer mode to games that don't really need it, but it's there, and I played it, so I'll give my opinion. Pretty much: it's a buggy piece of crap. Now, I'd say it could be somewhat decent if they had supported it after release, but after all this time, there's still plenty of bugs, pretty much nobody plays it, not to mention that it has that stupid levelling system where you unlock better weapons the more you play, meaning that new players have a hard time when matched against those in higher levels, which will happen a lot when only a handful of people play the MP. Personally, I think the resources spent in developing the MP would have been better spent in improving the SP, which is still good, but could have been better.Well, I think that's a wrap for my Tomb Raider review. I recommend the SP portion, the MP portion is crap."

I have never played the original Tomb raider games and this is my first Tomb Raider game.Tomb Raider is an exhilarating action adventure as a terrific origin story for Lara Croft.It's story arch is very tempting and beautifully written and the graphic for it's time is amazing.The gameplay is awesome. The scenery in which the missions take place are very unique and the progression of the single player missions are intriguing. The shooting mechanics are nice too and the arsenal you get, you can change how you want to approach some enemies.It's mostly a pseudo open world game with many collectibles, tombs and challenges that are somewhat enticing to complete and to solve. The game has full of informative historical artifacts which all tells stories.The multiplayer section is like an abandon city. :P Nobody plays it. So if you are an achievement Hunter like me, then make some friends to get some of the MP achievements. But you will surely enjoy the Single player part.Overall, it is a very good game and I will highly recommend buying this game. On sale is the best time to buy the game."

We've seen them quite a lot from the time the first game of this franchise was released, and ""re-boot"" of the year 2013 was not the first one. However, it is still a 3rd-person view action/adventure game with the female heroine, who knows her ways around archeology and survival in the ""Indiana Jones-style"". And, it is a good game, even if flawed a little, but quite decent overall.The pattern has changed seriously this time. Now it is much less a puzzle with ""how to get there"" problem, but quite an ample action with ""shoot often, kill many, remorse nothing"". It is not bad, but looking too much Uncharted. Which is somehow amusing, as it was Naughty Dog who looked at TR games as an example. But let's not trouble ourselves with the quiz ""who's copycat whom better"". Much less climbing and jumping and much more shooting for one, damned quick-time events on every corner for two, and not bad, but quite dead multiplayer for three (with many achievements for MP which you'll probably never unlock fairly). Sounds almost enough to nail the coffin, right? But I called TR'13 the good game, despite all those things. Why? 'Cause it's still a fine adventure! And if you're not troubling yourself too much with 100% achievements in every game, I really recommend you to try out this re-rolled Crofty, as there are not so many comparable titles anyway (and Uncharted stays with Sony, without any chance to climb on the PC mountain so far).The setout of the Tomb Raider'13 sounds very similar to the one of Far Cry 3 (which was released just a few months earlier to the TR game). Lara and her team crushed occasionally on the distinct island filled with unfriendlies, and need to find a way out. You'll find a bow and will be hunting animals for resources. And, by all means, you'll get guns - and quite enough mean and ugly targets to unload them. Ah, and don't forget the semi-open world, where you can search for numerous ""artifacts"" and other collectibles, as well as some small tombs to scavenge... on your way to saving your team and yourself.Let's talk about strong and weak points.The engine and visuals - are really good. Especially I enjoyed the visualization of fire and wind - they are, like, alive - which is good for atmosphere in the game - and for dynamic puzzles, which are (lucky we) not just ""push the button, turn the lever"". I enjoyed the sightseeing, the climbing and hiking were quite rewarding... if they were not haywire by the not-so-great controls and framerate drops, which happened too many times, especially when I played the game for the first time, right after release. Now the framerate seems fixed (or at least, much more stable), and I'm getting used for controls, more or less. Still, the count of my deaths out of flawed controls (during some tricky jumps usually) and for low framerate during damned QTE (like with AlphaWolf) - really freaked me out so many times.The story and characters - another strong point. It's like the ""Lost"" serial - only with a bunch of sane and (pro)active people. Even your enemies are good and solid - in their way. They are not just respawning mobs without any logic or reason. On the contrary, they're all well-placed. I've seen better scenarios, sure, but only in gems like Bioshock or Witcher - which are sure of a rare breed.Battle system - not exactly vivid, but good enough. You sneak, you hide behind the obstacles, you perform silent attacks with bow/pistol, then enemies discover your location, hell breaks loose, you see the rain of lead, you've got molotovs flying right on your head, your cover breaks after some shots... Yeah, it CAN be fun. I especially liked the bow - it performed much better than in Far Cry 3 or Assassin's Creed 3... or even Skyrim. Much more arcade than in the Mount'n'Blade, of course, but still quite fun. And yeah, brings associations with the Hunger Games Katniss tool for some, sure. Never liked that franchise... but I do like bows and prefer them to crossbows (and occasionally to rifles) even in real life.As of semi-open world (I call it so for the TR still a narrative-driven game, even if it allows you to return to previous points to collect miscellaneous stuff you've might miss earlier)... The tombs are quite optional, and, as much as I've enjoyed puzzles in there, the sequence when Lara completes the challenge in the tomb... is really out of order, with that big chest, wow-hush on the first occasional trinket - and that's all! Take your bonus to supplies and return on your quest! Not really rewarding, if you ask me. On the contrary, the more basic artifacts Lara discovers on her way feels much more suiting her Archeological agenda, as well as adding more colours to the world around. That's great, if only transiently. Yet, overall trinket searches not really providing additional fun, being somewhere on the level with feathers from Assassin's Creed franchise... unless you're really looking for more lore on the Lara Croft's universe, and really reading diary pages - a thing so rare now, when those pages scattered among all games and so little people actually pay any interest to them anywhere...As we're talking pro/contra, I'll repeat about two downsides: the quite-dead multiplayer, with something about 15 out of 50 achievements related to it - which means no fair complete. And bugs, mostly based on the not-so-good optimisation. Some of them were fixed... like the occasional drops of framerate. But in that process of updating, I've got my savefile broken - with the 18th level MP charachter, and 100%-completed story... So I had to repeat all the process, without ""Newgame+"" and with MP character zeroed...With all said, my mark of the game is 7.2/10. It's a neat dramatical adventure, worthy re-work of the title. Yet some of the gamedesign decisions (like the emphasis on QTE or Lara's quick transformation from bookworm to mass-murdering angel of death) - and bugs problems, along with stupid ""one slot saves everything"" policy, which isn't good even on consoles - all this holding me praising the game higher. Still, a good pick, if discounted, no doubts there."

The game offers an immensely immersive gaming experience as it throws you into a game world with an array of visually impressive environments, many cinematic camera angles and an exceptional score composed by Jason Graves. The single player campaign offers a captivating plot  with friendly and appealing characters, enthralling combat and gameplay alongside collectibles and a point + reward system for Lara’s abilities and salvage to upgrade the weapons she uses.The game visually is a treat for the eyes, well optimized and it certainly helps to have a decent enough rig to play it at the settings that allow you to experience the graphical fidelity that this game has to offer . Crystal Dynamics know how to immerse a player  as Yamatai’s environments had such a fine level of detail I found myself in awe as I ventured into the island. The game constantly has that atmospheric vibe, giving you that sense of adventure wherever you go, whether it be a forest populated with wildlife and foliage or tombs with skulls strewn across the ground, it is somehow always present. The gameplay and combat are enjoyable for the most part, you do realize it becomes somewhat linear halfway into the game but it does not hinder the experience in any way. I especially appreciated the creativity and thought that was put into Lara’s combat, stumbling and then flinging dirt into your enemies eyes to immobilise them for just the right amount of time to give them that final blow, or evading an enemy’s melee attack at just the right time to then go on to stab them in the knee with your arrows, allowing you to kill them right then and there if you have the correct abilities unlocked, or giving them a blow to the head with an arrow or bullet. Quick Time Events or QTE’s are present in this game and being honest I am not one for QTE’s especially if they are game breaking or not done right. But luckily for us players, Crystal Dynamics did a good job at including them. You don’t and won’t find yourself doing a QTE at every possible moment in the game, instead, they seem to be wisely placed into parts of the game  and add to the overall immersion and feel that the game manages to radiate. Stealth, unfortunately, is not seen in Tomb Raider  at all, it is possible to take out enemies silently with the bow,  however you’ll most likely be able to take out 2-3 enemies before one of the other NPC's will spot you, which some if not most of the time is absurd as to how they even know where you are when you could be in a tall tree or in really good cover.                                                                                                   Also, the game mostly puts you in situations where you always find yourself guns blazing, killing a whole brigade of enemies, and I won’t lie it will make you feel like a bad a*s.I spent most of my time in this game looting bodies and looking for salvage or collectibles which I greatly enjoyed, particularly because it gave me a reason to venture out into the game world and bathe myself in the beauty of Yamatai for a while longer. I found collecting and finding the relics  somewhat pleasurable, especially due to the fact of being able to listen to Lara’s presumptions as to what age/period that said relic may be from and what it might have been used for, it just lets you know that Lara knows her sh*t as an archaeologist.Finding collectibles also gives you survivor points which can then be spent on unlocking dozens of abilities for Lara, from 3 different classes/categories. Other ways to earn survivor points can be from Eliminating enemies, Completing received tasks, Finding secrets or Exploring tombs, which I greatly enjoyed as exploring each tomb you will find out that each is unique, and each has a puzzle for you to figure out in order to gain that much-wanted loot. There were few tombs in this game so it left me feeling lost after completing them all. Finding salvage on the other can be used to upgrade your weapons, from giving your bow an explosive kick, to silencing your rifle, buffing up your shotgun or making your pistol more efficient. Each weapon has 3 modifications that you will gradually find throughout the campaign leaving you with quite the arsenal.Crystal Dynamics have created some sort of treasure that I feel honored to have played, seeing our new Lara Croft  grow from a frightened and vulnerable survivor to the Tomb Raider we know and love, is profoundly compelling. The game has such a full-hearted and ardent score that compliments the game so very well. It was so awesome to watch the final clip of the game as ‘The Tomb Raider’ played in the background as Lara says “I’m not going home”, after that I just must hand it to Jason Graves for composing music that was such a pleasure to listen to during my time with the game. Overall Tomb Raider  is  and , with a Lara Croft that I did not just care for, but love. The game after completion has left me feeling empty, so I just hope that Rise of The Tomb Raider coming out later this year manages to be the righteous successor this game deserves."

She starts out gearless, and terrified of shadows, and gradually becomes the stunningly badass Tomb Raider, while remaining incredibly human along the way. I did not expect this game to be nearly as memorable as it was.Cons:-Fewer QuickTime events, however, would have been nice; none would have been perfection.-The multiplayer was... well, the game would have been better served by the effort involved there being put into something more useful, like a DLC that turned all the deer into a slightly different species of deer.Pros:-Everything.

I did complete this game in no small part because the combat is actually very good, but I found myself laughing out loud at how ridiculous and over the top the set pieces were in this game. Every single structure on the entire island on is built out of matchsticks and will probably collapse, explode, combust, get blown down, etc. if you so much as look at it. Enemies will routinely appear out of thin air in order to make cutscenes more interesting. Characters who have spoken like two lines all game will routinely get these contrived and preventable hero's deaths and you care deeply for like three seconds and then get back to brutally murdering people in cold blood. I could go on, but you get the idea.Another annoying part of this game is the skill point and upgrade system. In most games with even primitive skill trees you'll have a variety of compelling skills that you can master to specialize a bit and turn yourself into a badass. In this game, the overwhelming majority of the skills are either entirely useless, uninteresting, or downgrades over the default. For example, you need to use four separate skill points just to make the reticle glow red when you're aiming at an enemy's head with each of your weapons. You can use another skill point to stealth kill with your ice pick instead of your bow, despite that there's little to no functional difference between the two. You can use like five skill points so you can melee counter all enemies after dodging attacks, despite that this takes more time than just shooting the enemies in the face and makes no sense tactically in a cover-based shooter. Other skill points destroy the exploration side of the game by making items and areas you're looking for glow through walls or show up on your map. Another couple of skill points give you more salvage while looting, and grabbing those skill points early, as I did, means that you're probably going to have enough salvage to buy every single weapon upgrade as soon as it becomes available and you’ll no longer need to actually make decisions about what's best for your character. You can just get a 100% larger magazine, double damage, massively increased reload speed, and an undermounted grenade launcher all at once! Hooray!Except, not hooray. This game is the first game I've played in a while that didn't offer a challenge even on the hardest difficulty setting. They eventually add a couple of different enemies, like armored enemies who take two headshots to kill instead of one, but it’s not nearly enough. The challenge went away fast and without a really compelling story to fall back on, the game just got more and more boring as time went on. It seriously feels like it was balanced around base-game Lara and they made zero effort to keep it balanced as time went on. It just gets worse and worse the more upgrades you buy.Sometimes this game would impress me with its attention to detail, such as the animation for Lara dropping her torch to open a door and her actually picking up the torch again once she finishes, or the fact that you see Lara make a flicking motion with her left thumb to light the tip when switching to flaming arrows. Other times, though, there are glaring visual issues that drive me nuts. For example, she's given one ice pick to climb with, not two, and magically uses that single pick to Spiderman up massive ice walls and rock faces alike. Would it have been too hard to at least give her a second ice pick so her climbing could make a tiny bit more sense? As is they may as well have let her use her bare hands since she’s glued to the wall anyway. Another part they probably never bothered to test PC was the quicktime sequences. Rather than putting the button you need to press in the center of the quick time element, they would *sometimes* put the button in small font at the bottom of the screen and sometimes not show the button you’re supposed to press at all, leaving you to guess whether you should be hitting E, F, space bar, M1, or something else entirely. Usually the price for messing this up is watching Lara die horribly, which made this even more annoying. There were several sequences in the game where I’d have to watch Lara get impaled through the throat or pincushioned with arrows as I got increasingly frustrated trying to figure out what the freaking game wanted me to press.A final gripe is that they halfheartedly tried to make Lara be the stereotypical sensitive girl at random times throughout the game despite that she clearly gives no ♥♥♥♥♥ for the other 99% of the game. You'll have just finished calmly and quietly wading through a river of blood amidst heaping piles of severed human limbs and shooting dozens of Russian commandos in the face with a bow and arrow before pillaging their corpses, and then next thing you know it you'll be on the radio with Roth sniffling about how you don't know what's going on and oh please, Roth, help me, I want to go home and I can't possibly fend for myself. Like c'mon now, if you're going to be this unabashedly over-the-top action game and ask again and again for us to suspend disbelief, just let your protagonist be a natural badass who don’t need no man.All in all, Tomb Raider was visually gorgeous for a 2013 game and the combat was tight, but in its quest to be a third-person shooter, a platformer, an RPG, a cinematic adventure, a stealth game, an exploration-focused open world game, and like seventeen other trendy things all at once, it feels like it misses the mark on most of these. I picked it up for free, and if they ever give it away again, sure, it might be worth a shot. Maybe you’ll get more out of it than I did. Otherwise, there are much, much better ways to spend 12 hours."

Loved every single moment of the campaign mode as it just reminds me of how much of a wimp I am compared to Lara.Graphics wise it is beautiful. The range of landscapes you are exposed to (Eg: mountain-tops, caves, plane crashes) always set the scene (not always stuck in a cave or a building). Gameplay wise there are not many flaws at all. And if there are, they are probably either miniscule or hilarious enough for me to laugh off.The weapons are such fun to use, especially when the enemies don't know how to wear helmets and a single shot of anything in the head pretty much kills.Wolves are scary :CI've only had a few hours on campaign mode at this point in time, but I definitely do recommend this game to literally anyone. I've had a blast staying up way past my bed-time in the dark killing off mercs and watching Lara completely destroy 20 men in a single room with a bow and arrows vs. assault rifles in less than a minute.

Expedition quickly turns into a nightmare as unexperienced Lara will have to save her friends and discover islands secrets to survive and escape.Tomb Raider combines action-adventure, exploration and survival mechanics in one gritty package. If you have played Uncharted series, take that action-adventure gameplay from it and mix it with semi-open world design.You will make your way through an island while completing simple objectives to push the story and unlock more of the island. Most of the locations are connected to each other, allowing you to go back and explore them fully later on. From forests and beaches to temples and world war 2 facilities, Yamatai is filled with secrets and mysteries waiting for you to discover them. Majority of locations is small to medium sized so you don't have to worry about getting lost. To travel between areas you can use camps spread across the island.Game puts a big emphasis on survival, as young Lara is not experienced with challenges ahead of her and lack of tools doesn't help. Main progression system tied to storyline features Lara gathering, or rather salvaging more equipment and weapons to make her situation easier and allowing her to explore more. So if you come across a location you can't access yet, don't worry! Throughout the game you will additionally search for supplies used to your weapons, to improve them and add accessories. Once in a while you will even find weapon parts, which completly modify your weapon if you will find enough of them.Yamatai is a place filled with history, so on your adventure you will find plenty of relics and elements from the past! You can collect and examine them to discover additional information and gain experience. Plus knowledge! Or I think so. I mean, some of those historic elements are definetly based on real history...right?Additionally there is plenty of other documents, notes, and Lara's personal thoughts you can gather throughout Tomb Raider. Besides collecting you can beat challenge tombs and challenges featured in almost every location. Amount side content will keep you busy for a while yet it won't feel like a chore.And if you have a hard time with exploration or puzzles, game features Survival Instinct, ability that highlights key elements or enemies.Almost all actions in the game linked to hunting, collecting or combat give you experience points. Earning enough of them will give you a skill point available to spend at the camp in 3 different categories.Speaking of killing, unlike previous titles where combat was mainly focused on animals and mythical creatures, here it has a major focus on fighting other unfortunate human survivors who are stuck on an island, while wildlife and mythical enemies are a secondary enemy.Enemies are either melee opponents, using agility to quickly get to you, or ranged enemies with bows and firearms. Once in a while you will get tougher opponents. This time you won't be jumping around, performing all sorts of acrobatics while wielding dual pistols. Combat is similar to Uncharted. It features cover mechanics as Lara is smart enough to know arrows and bullets are bad for you, destructive enviroment giving opportunities to both sides of the conflict, ability to free aim and engage in close quarter combat to stun or execute enemies. Regenerative health system is implemented here- if you are hurt you need to find a safe space and wait few seconds to heal.Sometimes you will get a chance to eliminate your opponents stealthy, here a bow and patience will help you gain upper hand.In her arsenal Lara has 4 weapons, with her main weapon being a bow-stealthy and deadly long ranged weapon with multiple accessories, perfect for hunting. But if you prefer a pistol, shotgun or an assault rifle, lucky you. As mentioned before, first weapons you salvage are relics from the past, so be on a lookout for supplies to improve them as in their original, outdated state using them will be rough. Good kind of rough, gunplay is damn satisfying in TR. And at the end, there are platformic elements, because what Lara Croft game it would be without them! Those are...pretty much the same thing as before. Climb, jump, use ledges, ziplines, different platforms to make your way through the locations.The only thing that one can nitpick from entire gameplay is amount of Quick Time Events. Especially in first half of the game there is more of them than I thought, and I know not everyone likes them. Outside of gameplay, characters could be a bit more...original. Cast of secondary characters is cliched, so you can figure them out in first few cutscenes. Lara herself and her entire ""Survival"" development arc is good, though it suffers from narrative conflict. Story Lara is an inexperienced and vulnerable person that doesn't like and doesn't want to kill people, learning to become a person who we all know.Gameplay Lara straight up takes a rock or alpenstock to smash enemies face with it while gunning down others. For some reason game encourages you to play in a very agressive and brutal way which doesn't fit entire narrative, especially in first part of the game. That is why I was surprised game features only...one forced stealth section? Maybe two? After you are done with Single Player you can step into Multiplayer for the first time in main series! It's a basic ""Good guys v bad guys"", featuring 5 maps and 4 different gamemodes, with aability to play ""casually"" or ""competitive"" but competitive is totally dead. First uou unlock new weapons, upgrades to them, and characters by gathering experience and leveling up, then you buy them using supplies you get from games and lootable boxes on the maps. Unfortunately, Multiplayer lacks players. You either enocunter veteran players or cheaters, making it hard to have enjoyable or even a balanced game. However if you will find a game where teams are balanced and on equal skill level, you should have fun. Should. Performance was great, pretty much had no issues with...well, anything. Unfortunately my game wasn't in English when it comes to sound design so I can't say if voice acting is good or not. The rest-enviroment, weapons, and ingame soundtrack was great. A reboot done right, Tomb Raider with fantastic gameplay and level design, yet few issues in writing and semi-open world might make this gritty origin story of famous archeologist not for everyone. 8/10!

The way it plays, the way it looks, the environments, the story, just everything about it works amazingly well. If this sets the standard of the survivor trilogy my brain oozes with excitement for the other two. This is the most fun I have had with modern gaming in a long long time.With that said, I will not be going for a full achievement set as a large portion of them are locked behind multiplayer which is long dead for this game (be warned achievement hunters). But as it stands this game is a easy 9/10 and a fantastic origin story for one of gaming's most important character."

Tomb Raider was different. This campaign is one of the most exciting campaigns I have played in years, and that puts this game on my all time favorites list with great games like Star Wars: Battlefront (2004), and Halo Reach. I could not put this game down. Around every corner there is something to fine. Unfortunately, I grinded the games story and managed to complete the story with an overall game completion of 68%, but there is no doubt in my mind that I will not play this game again soon. I played the game on the hardest dificulty, and although I died a couple times - seven times to be exact - The game was so much fun that I didn't care about me dying when I got rushed by 20 autoaiming enemies. Overall, I love this game. I found everything about it great: the story, the graphics, and gameplay. It isn't often that I find a game like this where I want to come back and keep playing day after day, and not put it down at all. This game is amazing."

The opening gameplay is packed with action and done really well, the game grabs hold of the player and shows all it has to offer in the first twenty minutes, leaving me wanting more. It wasn't just the gameplay which had me hooked. I wanted to know about the mysterious island Lara had become stranded on, I wanted to know more about the dangerous people on this island and why they were so hostile. The story goes along at a steady pace, leaving it quite easy to be pieced together by an attentive player. Sometimes I felt Lara was a little slow coming to a conclusion I has reached hours ago.The gameplay introduces new elements at good times, allowing Lara to become more powerful, or speeding up her adventuring across the island. I felt after around 16 hours of gameplay a slight lull, I wa ready for the story to be wrapped up, and started to be bored by the repetativeness of the combat and exploration. This only lasted a couple of hours, until I felt happy that the game had been stretched as I wanted to play more again.I finished the game with a 90% overall completion score. I missed picking up a few GPS caches and many of the optional challenges in each zone. I picked up most of the documents and relics as I played the game, going back to pick up the few I had missed before I completed the story. I clocked over 25 hours in completing the game in this way, which is fairly admirable by todays standards, and acceptable for such a game.I was fortunate enough to be able to run the game as the highest of settings, which was truly a beautiful experience. The island feels very real, and really helped me feel the immersion that I did.Most of my time playing Tomb Raider was extremely enjoyable, I look forward to the inevitable sequel. I would recommend this game, especially at the low price it can now often be found for."

Crystal Dynamics/Square Enix has done a great job in giving the series a new lease of life. Sure, the puzzles will never have you scratching your head for hours like the classics, but the visuals, atmosphere and effects more than make up for it, giving Lara her first real Hollywood-esque adventure, something that she more than deserves. The story sees a young inexperienced Lara thrown into a scary and unforgiving world, as she battles the harsh conditions and even harsher bad guys after she becomes shipwrecked on an Island. The adventure takes her on a brutal journey that will see her flourish into the skilled Tomb Raider that we all think of when we hear the name, Lara Croft.The game is very well polished and you can appreciate the minor details because of it. Little things like Lara brushing her hands across walls in tight areas as well as the effortless nature of the climbing and jumping mechanics. The game is honestly one of my favourite third person adventure games to play. It just feels so good to control Lara, even with a K+M. The way she traverses the world, jumps, turns, it all feels amazingly solid and responsive. The sound and voice acting is also of a particular high standard, giving that high budget, Hollywood feel. There are certain elements that some users may not appreciate, scripted QTE's and shaky action camera angles can frustrate and disorientate, but for the most part, any action adventure fan who appreciates an epic Indiana Jones style experience will be right at home. There is a nice, although basic, upgrade system where investing the salvage you collect from the island gives you better weapon damage, or upgraded bow, which help reinforce the feel that you are growing and getting more confident as time goes on, much like Lara herself. There is also some basic hunting where you can gain XP, but it's simple, nothing on the level of a Far Cry 4 for example.Multiplayer is there, although not very active now. It was a fun experience back in 2013 when the community was active; it was certainly up there with Uncharted MP and superior to Metal Gear Online 3. Personally I wouldn't even consider this game if you are thinking about it from a MP perspective. If you are playing for the first time in preparation for Rise of the Tomb Raider, it is definitely worth a go. It will help you understand Lara’s character and backstory, and tie in nicely to the sequel."

Like many young gamers I too had a  really hard spot on my crotch for this game. Her grunts, screams and moans definitely awakened something in me.Tomb Raider 2013 feels like AAA polished perfection IMO. There's zero fat on the game. Nothing feels extra, tedious or out of place. Incredible visuals for the day and they hold up just fine. The high resolution textures, shadows, tessellation and hair physics? Icing on the cake.The reason I liked this game way more than the sequels is that it's the story of how Lara becomes a badass. It was the speed of her transition from ingénue to stone-cold killer that really got me! It's been a while since I played it, but I'm sure I remember a scene towards the beginning where she really gingerly and uncomfortably picks up a gun that someone dropped, and then a few scenes later she's John Wick, leaving piles of bodies everywhere she goes.Additionally one of my favorite things about the game was the metroidvania nature to it, and  how you slowly developed your arsenal and used it to complete the myriad of challenges tucked away.That said, the scale of mass murder, the lack of tombs, the amount of times she falls and the way she falls (honestly it’s almost injury porn), do drag the experience down a little. I mean, do we really need to see Lara with a large spike through her head, futilely trying to unimpale herself only to finally give in to death? Yeah, no thanks. Finally, I really liked the way the game actually progressed through a bunch of genres, taking bits and pieces from each but never over staying its welcome.  Too many games are afraid to try anything different.Honestly now that I’m 49, I really just like linear games at this point. I’ve long since ODed on Ubisoft worlds, so a game like this continues to feel like a breath of fresh air.10/10"

Championed first by Core Designs, then shipped off to Crystal Dynamics, she’s undergone rewrites, retcons and ever-changing personal tragedies. Her history has been altered often enough, and her relatives resurrected and then killed off under wildly different circumstances enough to make her twisted canon a nightmare to follow. Her mother died at birth, then she died on a ship instead, then she’s alive, except she’s not. Lara’s even been killed off herself once; that lasted all of a year. It’s somewhat ironic, then, that in her ever-shifting landscape of dead ends and unresolved cliff-hangers that it’s in going right back to the beginning that she changes the most.Tomb Raider is one of these series reboots you see everywhere you look, and, as such, Lara’s no longer the ice queen she’s often portrayed as (aside from that awful period they tried to rewrite her as a flirty archaeology floozy we all seem to pretend never happened). She’s younger, fresher, no longer has twin guns glued to her hands, no longer wears the khaki equivalent of hot pants and her head is actually bigger than her bust. These are noteworthy changes, but should never be the focus. In this outing, Lara is raw, inexperienced and naïve, shipwrecked on an island filled with hostiles who want her and the people she cares about dead. It’s a situation that forces her to do the unthinkable constantly to survive, and the incidents that play out are unapologetically gritty; should rapid currents get the better of her, Lara will be fatally flung into protruding debris that will spear through her throat, leaving her a scant few seconds of life to pointlessly grasp at the protrusion before falling limp. If she’s overcome by wolves, she doesn’t just die; she’s mauled. If she doesn’t manage to fit though an ever decreasing gap during a rock slide, she’s crushed. It’s not a graphic death, but the screen is filled with unforgiving stone and glimpses of a small section of the heroine’s lifeless face. It’s uncomfortable viewing.The new take on the franchise is a million miles apart from the Lara of old, but that’s the point. Tomb Raider tries very hard to tell a story that explains how she turned out the way we know her, and does a brilliant job of painting her afraid and vulnerable. She starts the game being abducted by an unknown force, and from there she’s left hanging from the roof of a cave to die. She’ll have to scramble past the corpses of former colleagues in order to survive. In these panic-filled moments, she sobs and cries. Squeezing herself through a flooded, rock-lined corridor that only affords her a scant few inches of breathing space leads to gulped yelps of distress in between nervous stumbles that see her vanish underwater for uncomfortable periods of time. Should she manage to survive the ordeal, she sets up a shelter from the raging storm that serves as a light at the end of a tunnel, huddling under a rocky outcrop, shivering violently from the wet and the cold.Tomb Raider really is a distressing stumble from one personal apocalypse to another. Finding the remnants of your crew leads you into a burning village. You’re captured again, your hands are bound, and you’re forced to sneak through the burning ribcages of huts while madmen with guns seek you out. Lara’s captured; she’s beaten, and the seeds of imminent sexual abuse are planted. She fights back, and, in her struggle, a sizable section of her abductor’s face is blown off. It’s gory, uncompromising. You’re forced to observe the light leave the man’s eyes, to listen to his death rattle, to watch Lara fail to hold back her disgust and sorrow. It’s worth pointing out that a similar ‘first kill’ moment was used in Tomb Raider: Anniversary (a game that had you only kill three human adversaries right at the end), but the gravity and emotional kickback it’s afforded here is shocking. Seconds later, Lara’s worked her way through the rest of the enemy platoon, and a concerned ally asks how she’s coping with the sudden blood on her hands. It’s with a sense of guilt and fright that she admits how easy it’s become.Throughout the tale, Lara is forced to slowly harden to the situations that assail her. When a friend tries to take on the island on his own, she mentally lambastes him, only half out of worry, for having to undertake the same soul-wrenching decisions she was forced into. She becomes uncompromising and bitter, but still retains a lingering sense of regret for the things she’d had to do, and for the parts of herself that she’s lost forever. Sneaking through forests, silently putting arrows into the back of a guard’s head, or holding point at the mouth of a shanty town against waves of armed foes may invite criticism that focus is put too much on battle at points, something Tomb Raider has never been about. It would be a fair point, but I see there being more of a case that it’s something Tomb Raider has never done right, instead. Until now."

Experience Lara Croft progressing from just your average girl to ultimate badass, and take a truck load of punishment in the process.Action sequences & storytelling are exceptional & all blend perfectly with the gameplay. This kept pace pretty much for my entire 20hr playthrough, switching from more puzzle & exploration locations to all out  action sets. The puzzles aren't particularly difficult compared to previous  games.There are some very clever game design direction too, like subtle commentary to give you guidance, use of selective camera angles & forgiving map design & controls  minimising those frustrating moments. There are some light RPG elements in skill & weapon upgrades allow you to set Lara up to suit your playstyle. I don't think this RPG element was really needed, but it doesn't hurt the game design.Visual style is rich, highly detailed & immersive.Lara's overall persona & attitude through her character animations & audio commentary change over the course of her adventure, giving a good depth of emotion & shows a lot of personality. This along with the good story results in you ending up caring for Lara trying to survive the danger strickened island. This improved emphasis on character & story really sets the bar higher for the series & sets it apart from many others in genre.If I was picky, more variety in the baddies  so they don't feel like an 80s B-grade action movie re-run, & bit less  levels & more puzzles would have been perfect. Turning  into a 3rd person shooter is just not what these games are about to me. Also to this point, they could have given multiplayer a miss IMHO as it really doesn't fit .Other than these minor points,  was an awesomely enjoyable experience, both suited to the fans of the series as well as new comers."

Indeed, even if the controls are really good, you may find strange that you can't actually sprint or crouch when you want. Moreover, whe you finished the game to the 100% and you went absolutely everywhere, there's no more animals, ennemies and teammates. The game seems empty in that case. I have to add that you will have to show a lots of patience when you're in some enigmas like the secret tomb. The difficulty is balanced but the QTE (Quick time events) are somewhat annoying the first time you have to do them. Two thirds of the achievements are based on the solo mod and one third is based on the multiplayer.I can't give information about multiplayer considering I didn't play it.

But still, it is interesting to replay this old game and see how much they have improved, changed and added in it's sequels.Apart from less bugs and improved combat the sequels also take longer to finish with much more fun and challenging tombs and DLCs."

I completed it within 15 hours, with 92% completion. The story is fantastic and engaging, if a little far-fetched, but with the Lara Croft franchise this is kind of to be expected. The mechanics and movement and exploration of the overworld is incredibly intuitive and fun and easy, with very very few ""environment screwed me over"" moments. It's incredibly well designed.I didn't touch the multiplayer, as I'm not interested in it, so I wont comment on that. I will say, however, that I am looking forward to any upcoming DLC which is released, as it'd be interesting to see where they take this already great story.As a downnote, however, the game is a little too ""easy"", in particular ammo seems to be everywhere. I played the game on ""Hard"" from the very start (hardest difficulty) and found only three 5 minute encounters which made me die and re-do the encounter. It seemed to me the difficulty affected only the enemy AI and the amounts of enemies, which is a bit of a shame.Otherwise though, a fantastic game which I'd recommend thoroughly.Nilesy"

I expected a lame rehash from a stale franchise. Instead, I’m happy to announce that Tomb Raider is an incredibly fun and intense experience that has resurrected Lara Croft. I played the original years ago and while it was fun at the time the formula got old quickly and I could not get interested in the sequels. It was roughly 90% intricate, drawn-out puzzles & platforming with 10% miserable combat sprinkled in. What they’ve done is rebalance the game mechanics so it focuses much more on combat (which is oh-so-fluid) and the puzzles & platforming are more of a side dish. I think this works because it keeps the game moving along. For example, there are optional tombs you can raid, but they are very small areas with only one puzzle that won’t take you more than 10 minutes to solve. This is a little disappointing, I’ll admit. I would like to have a little more meat to the puzzles, but I will take the short ones over getting bogged down in a 45-minute labyrinth. RPG elements have been introduced, as well. There is a lot of optional stuff you can do in this game which will yield experience to make Lara stronger through special skills as well as finding “salvage” which is used to improve your weapons in certain ways (more damage, less recoil, etc). Special journals can be found, too, which help to unravel the mystery of the island you’re on. Another brilliant touch is how they’ve tweaked exploration. Each area has several sets of secrets to uncover but you don’t have to find them all before you move on (some will require items you don’t have yet, anyway). You discover campsites as you play and can fast travel between them. This lets you focus on having fun instead of feeling obligated to gut an area’s secrets right away to avoid a lengthy backtrack to an earlier area. It makes things so nice. The game is gorgeous, too. Environments are beautiful & smartly designed so they feel very open with lots of nooks & crannies to peek in and usually multiple paths to traverse around obstacles. As I mentioned earlier, combat is fluid and thrilling, the exact opposite of how it was in the original game. Head shots with fire arrows never get old, and the AI is smart. Ranged opponents will throw fire bombs to flush you out of cover or shoot guns at you while melee opponents will zip line in to close on you. And there are so many gratifying ways to kill them. Stick an arrow shaft through their neck with your hand at close range, dig your climbing axe into their back for a stealth kill, hit a guy right as he’s about to throw dynamite resulting in a friendly fire explosion, etc. The story is very good, too. Games rarely make me want to play to find out what happens next anymore. Usually the story is something bland & serviceable to keep me level grinding. I really like the narrative in TR, though. Quite unrealistic, of course, but still enjoyable. And if you’re concerned, keyboard & mouse controls work just fine. This is not one of those sloppy console ports that is unplayable w/out a gamepad. The only knock I have against this game is the use of quick time events. QTEs are something I want to see go away and never come back. I am tired of the “press E to awesome” gameplay mechanic. However, Tomb Raider doesn’t rely too heavily on them and they are at least presented in a very dramatic way, so don’t listen to any commenters saying the game is nothing but cutscenes & QTEs. The beginning is admittedly slow and has a lot of them, but that’s because you haven’t gotten your weapons yet. Once you get armed, you encounter them a lot less. The QTEs don’t ruin the game and only end up being a very minor annoyance. There is also the obligatory multiplayer mode that all video games are apparently required by law now to include. I don’t know anything about it and I will probably never play it. It’s an extra thing if you want it, but know that the single player campaign is not lacking at all. If you like action games, you should definitely pick this one up. Tomb Raider had lost several steps over the years but is now running like a more polished version of Playstation’s Uncharted series, with better combat & storytelling. A very nice surprise that is worth your attention."

The single player is more of a story/survival oriented part of the game. Youre following Lara through her battle for life and and attempt to save her ""friends"" . The story itself is unique but some of the characters may seem a little bit cliche. 2. Multiplayer- the multiplayer is fun,the content is great considering the fact that this was originally a exclusively single player game. The characters are ok,the combat is fine. The biggest downfall to it would be the connection which is peer2peer so there might be some occasional lag and the unbalance between player levels and teams.. 10/10"

A much needed one if I do say so myself. To be honest its a pretty “standard” game meaning it's got platforming, shooting with soem light stealth mechanics, leveling Lara's abilities through weapons and tools. I'd elaborate but it's truly in almost every game. People expect it now and tend to be surprised when it's absent. The game is quite grueling in that while dying is a normal part of games, it's a bit harder to look at it with a spear jammed through your skull. The death animations are really something to behold. The game is actually fairly linear in nature; however there are multiple optional Tombs serving as puzzles to solve for new items and XP. There is also fast travel between camp fires but in all honestly this is just a way for you to go back and get to a new tomb or area after acquiring a new ability or tool and serves no real purpose into the narrative and honestly takes away from it slightly as the pacing of it doesn't really make sense. The story is decent, it's quite riveting the first time, though I wouldn't be as engaged on a second playthrough. Personally, I find the ending ludicrous. It takes away from real, actual relatable situations that arise from being trapped on an island full of cultists. Then, without spoiling anything specific, they basically throw it all away for something ridiculously out of place. But other than that it's excellent story telling."

This one got PVP multiplayer, you can play deathmatches online, something ROTR Lacks, I personally adore the Online Multiplayer, It is not perfect, But it is a unique experience, Especially for Linux gamers, It is fun and competitive, And it keeps being fun.There are a few Online game modes, Deathmatch, Free for All, Capture the flag and some sort of domination. Pretty basic, But the maps are very nice, weapons are tough to handle and people like to dodge and use ziplines a lot which makes it extra challenging. You also unlcok perks which let you have special abilities, Like extra supplies, not tripping traps, extra damage, etc. Many hard choices which balances out the game in a good manner.The game runs very smooth, even on Ultimate Settings while recording. I get a 120FPS low, Feral done a very good job on the port. It is a great game, and i have nothing to complain about, I still play it on a regular basis. The Benchmark is also a great tool to see improvements month by month in the Linux kernel, Nvidia Drivers and all the other packages that boost the performance.Next to a great story the gameplay is very smooth, Who doesn't like hunting bad guys with a bow? The controls are spot on, And the AI is challenging at times, but good strategy gets you through any situation. Especially on the higher difficulities it starts to get a challenge to see how to complete certain partsThe multiplayer is pretty dead on Linux, You can play with Mac people, But Windows people are seperated. There are several groups that still play this game online on Mac and Linux, You can also hit me up, I am always in for some Tomb Raider.I would recommend this game to anyone, Especially if you enjoy Online PVP with friends, If you dont enjoy PVP the Single Player experience is great, and worth a few replays, This game is a solid 10 in my bookFollow my Curator Page:"

There's one scene especially where you sneak around a temple full of Samurai's its very raiders of the lost arc, I smiled through the entire thing, very cool.Cons - Lara gets the absolute crap kicked out of her, to the point it completely ruins any immersion, she falls from ridiculous heights, gets her face smashed in, stabbed a few times, shot, burnt, you actually start laughing out loud, it's like an over the top female John Wayne impersonation, I'd say at least 50% of cut scenes she almost dies. Storyline, it's almost cool, you get a very nice ""lost"" the TV show feeling, in fact, the entire thing is loosely based around it. Sadly her comrades are very bland and instantly forgetful, the ""northern"" accent of Roth is just horrific, it sounded like a Scottish guy attempting to be a Yorkshireman, it was almost as bad as Russell Crowes RobinHood massacre. The game play, it's hard, because a lot of it is very good, but it just almost immediately becomes repetitive and boring, I started the game quite looking forward to 100%'ing it, collecting all the cool hidden secrets, well, 2 hours in and I just wanted to push through the game, something I DESPISE doing, I feel like it's an insult to developers, but my god I got so damn bored of shooting these generic morons hiding behind things, the fighting is just abysmal, no challenge at all, nothing remotely cool, which is weird as they insist on having an absolutely identical fight segments in every single building you happen to enter, and I mean IDENTICAL, your heart just sinks when you walk in to a really really cool building and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shouts ""SHE'S HERE""... Sigh.This game, seems to of gotten endless positive reviews, and I totally understand why, I think the biggest reason it failed for me, is it could of been a brilliant brilliant game, and instead I just wanted it to end. If I had any say in this game, I'd remove 90% of the fighting, in fact I'd make sure she never kills anyone, other then the samurai zombies, so we could in some way connect with her, it makes no sense at all, I'd say she piles up a body count of over 200 people? All to save Sam? I'm just not sure she's really the good guy in this game. I'd give Lara more of a free role, to make her own way from one side of the island to the other, not have EVERYTHING mapped out for you, every single step you take there's a virtual sign post saying ""GO THIS WAY!"". I'd make the puzzles require more then an IQ of 10 to complete, as they are sooo unsatisfying.All in all, this is a beautiful game, but the irregularities in the storyline, poor generic sign posted climbing and dreadful fighting make for a rather lack luster experience."

The game was released on 5 March 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and got an OS X Linux version in 2014 and 2016. The game, according to Crystal Dynamics, was in development since 2008. And, oh boy, it's hard to imagine how worth the waiting actually was.Set on a mysterious island (which is populated by mysterious inhabitants), the game sees Lara find herself in a cave after a shipwreck. In the beginning, sadly, all you can actually notice (beside pressing the keys on your keyboard 20 times in a few seconds for the sake of Lara's survival who is running away from chasers or falling rocks) is Lara's scream which can become annoying from time to time. The developers seem to make us want to know that she is a young scared girl who needs to get used to all this, but I am sure there are better ways to show that. Though, Camilla Luddington's voice performance overall is really good and is definitely worth a mention. The first hour or two are more-less sequences that help build the protagonist. Once you passed that, the game becomes a wonderful thing to play and will make you loose on the island many times. When you eventually move your head away from the monitor, you'll notice how time flies away really fast. Lara's character is built very carefully throughout the whole story which you can't, sadly, say about the supporting characters. They often feel pretty shallow, if you could say so.A lot of times you'll have the feel of being an actual movie where a lot of the stuff that happens (which will either help or hinder you) is happening just in the moment you'd expect it to happen. While I wasn't a very big fan of that, I can't deny the fact that it really helped me solve some of the puzzles at times.The first kill in the game is pretty dramatic and might have an emotional impact on some players. However, the transition from that over to a survivor who will happily kill enemies is almost instant and I didn't like that. Basically, you gotta get used to killing in an instant just like Lara herself.The combat in Tomb Raider games, if memory serves me right, had never been really beautiful. However, things really do change. Very often, you get the chance to feel like a hidden assassin and I can't explain how much I love that. The game approaches the combat in a very satisfying way. Cheers to Crystal Dynamics for that.All the weapons are the way they should be. The star of the whole game is definitely Lara's Bow. All the main battles are challenging and require mostly patience. The enemies will be more than happy to take you out of your shelter. The game's polished almost as much as it can be. The controls are pretty good - it's as simple as it goes. All the movement animations are very natural and as dangerous as you'd expect them to be. As you're building the skills, at the same time you get the chance to explore secret tombs that give you the feel of an actual explorer while at the same time not damaging the main story.A lot of the puzzles are easier when compared to those from previous games. This may disappoint some older fans. With Tomb Raider being a modern adventure game, quick time events are there. Luckily, they aren't around as often as many were feared they would be and they're not very hard after all. There's a particular one that really annoyed me. It's set in cave where you get attacked by a wolf and I eventually completed it after retrying it around 20 times and that was the most annoying part of the game.The whole presentation of this game looks and sounds just beautiful. The best experience will obviously have those guys with the strongest PCs and I would like to mention an option which enables more-less (for the period it was created in) realistic hair named TressFX which makes the end result even more beautiful.Some tricks with slow motion as well as motion blur combined with great voice performances help create a real movie experience. The sounds are top-notch and perfectly follow the game throughout all its gameplay and cutscenes.Some fans will not like the idea of the series getting a reboot after all these years, but this reboot, whether you like the idea or not, is really good and absolutely worth a try. Lara's transformation from a scared young girl to a survivor is a bit weird and kind of fast, but all the great aspects of this game (multiplayer excluded) make it hard to notice. This is an exciting and  beautiful-looking game. The single-player is very well-written and there are a lot of secret tombs for you to find and explore if you'd like to take a break from shooting all the enemies. Overall, the game is filled with action most of the time and action fans like myself will love that. If you got some spare time and would like to try an action filled game, this is the right thing to go for."

Doesn't have much sense of exploring, adventure and survival, just slaughtering hordes of enemies. ""Hidden"" tombs are pretty fun though, they contain different puzzles that make me wish there were more. Sadly, these are really not hidden. There's a notification on your screen for ""HIDDEN TOMB NEARBY!"" And there's also clear markings on the wall around the cave, sometimes even an arrow. So you can't really miss those. That takes away the satisfaction of finding these yourself. There's leveling system to gain different skills and you can gather materials for different weapon upgrades. Using the bow is quite satisfying. The game tries to show Lara bit weaker, vulnerable and less confident than what we are used to and during the game she gradually becomes the legendary tomb raider. But the point is lost when the game celebrates with notification to extra xp for headshot you just made and have already killed 50 guys in an hour  with those same headshots. Decent Tomb Raider reboot, with wasted potential. [Score: 80]"

The supporting cast is a bit weak at times and there are a few too many quicktime events, but, overall, the game is definitely memorable and, more importantly, fun. Plus, Lara herself kicks so much ass that it's, like, totally inspirational to anybody who's ever had a hardship that's made them feel alienated and weak - males, females, etc. all alike. I suppose in that aspect, solipsism is what, ironically, binds us together, regardless of our differences, and this game totally, like, isn't afraid to push that theme at all. Such a nice game; I can't recommend it enough, really.Pros: - Immersive environment, music, graphics, and animations- Inspiring protagonist- Fun combat system- Challenging puzzles - Many rewarding collectiblesCons:- Relatively weak supporting cast- Weak antagonist - Too many ""frustratingly cheap"" quicktime events- Not enough puzzles"

206,21,Abolish the Penny,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/,165,1,1,19.6,"Posted: March 11, 2014","4,011",10,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/efddceddecef335d50e558942003752ef29b6f4d.jpg,"I 100% completed Tomb Raider (2013) today. I'm pretty torn about the game, because there's a great deal of things I liked a lot, and a great deal of things I really hated simultaneously. That's a pretty unusual reaction for me with a game.Things I liked a lot:- Game feel: Movement feels great, shooting enemies with the bow is incredibly satisfying, jumping and climbing is really smooth, the sort of half-sticky half-cover system is really flexible and felt excellent. I can't stress enough how great it is just running around in the game. This has some of the best auto-platforming I've ever played in a game.- Visuals: The game is really, really gorgeous. Weather effects are great. Environments are mostly excellent and there's quite a bit of variety given that it takes place on a single island. Lara's model keeps changing throughout the game as she suffers more and more abuse--and they very creatively have plot reasons to clean her up every once in a while only to make her bloody and dirty again.- Enemy AI: I generally liked the enemy AI. There are only a few regular enemy types, but they combine them interestingly. I generally felt like I had to move around a bit to avoid getting pincered or my cover shot out or blown up. It felt frenetic and engaging generally.- Bar filling: This game is more stuffed full of bars to fill than any game series other than Assassin's Creed. You are collecting scrap. You are collecting experience. You're using experience to upgrade skills and scrap to upgrade weapons. You're collecting weapon parts. You're collecting GPS pickups and relics (like in Uncharted, they have a little 3D Model) + most relics have a hidden thing for you to find if you rotate the model. Every area has something to shoot or burn or find as a per-level sort of thing. There are like 999 combat bonuses for extra experience. For a mostly fairly linear kind of action-shooter, I felt constantly stimulated with tons of stuff to do.- Ziplines: I don't think people in the real world use ziplines but I love them in video games.- The Puzzle Tombs: The game has optional tomb areas which are basically little mini-puzzle areas. This is good because the main game doesn't have many puzzles. These work great, they're very unique and interesting. Totally totally enjoyed these, wish the game had three times as many.- Tension and Release: The game does a great job alternating between high excitement and low excitement periods.- Long, substantial: This is a 15+ hour game easily. I took 19 to 100%, but that's including maybe 3 hours of replay because of lost save progress.Things I didn't like:- Game feel: All of the guns sucked in comparison to the bow, the grenade launcher is incredibly weak.- ""Big"" enemies: Every single shooting game that features a 10 foot tall enemy that wears tons of armour and takes 999999 bullets and then you have to QTE to kill it and the enemy has lines like ""YOUR PUNY WEAPONS WON'T HURT ME"" is stupid. There are no 10 foot tall human beings. This is not enjoyable. No one likes this. Tomb Raider has this multiple times, including two separate boss fights.- End-game combat: About three quarters of the way through the game, all the enemies start having armour and machine guns and combat takes a nosedive. It's much more frustrating without being more skillful. Bullet sponge crap. The last boss fight is like four QTEs.- Setpieces: The game has an enormous number of setpieces where you're in a collapsing building, running from explosions, parachuting through trees, tumbling down a muddy slide, being pushed down rapids, falling large distances and hitting the ground, etc. These suck. They suck in every game that does them. It's not good gameplay, because it's basically an extended low-control QTE. But the worst part is that after the first time, the spectacle wears off. It's just boring and blasé. You see a bridge and you say 'gee whiz, I wonder if the bridge will collapse as I'm walking on it"" and then it does.Things I hated:- The intro: The single worst part of the game is the introduction section. How the hell does this happen in so many games? It has forced slow-walking.- Lara getting the crap kicked out of her: Lara gets shot, burned, inappropriately touched, beaten, falls, stabbed and impaled, hung upsidedown multiple times, etc. If you lose a QTE, you are going to get brutally dismembered by an enemy or environmental obstacle. The Conan Clueless Gamer review that emphasizes this is right to. The sounds here are really disgusting too. This is the definition of pornographic. The scenes aren't done to provoke any response other than titillation. It's just stupid.- Genocide: Lara kills maybe 1000-1200 people during the run of the game. Lara kills more people than Kane and Lynch did combined. This is ridiculous. You can't have a moment in the introduction where the game is like ""omg big emotional moment lara has to use violence to defend herself killing people is such a big moral responsibility"" and then have her headshot 15 people in a row five minutes later. Either learn to make games with less combat, or stop trying to make it a major plot/character theme. Oh and by the way, the first time you kill someone it's in the context of a group of people burning down a village and killing dozens of innocent civilians and trying to kill you after groping you--there is absolutely, positively no shade of grey here. There's no moral dilemma.- The characters, the writing: The characters are awful. You have a team full of awful sidekicks. There's ""Grumpy Old Crazy Man"", ""Wise and Caring Father Figure"", ""Best Friend"", ""Big Dumb Muscle Gronk"", ""Socially Awkward Nerd"" (this guy actually wears a t-shirt with an Esc key, it's just a total joke), ""Oily Used Car Salesman Jerkoff Who Is Obviously Being Set Up For a Heel Turn Later"", ""Sassy Black Woman"". It's pitiful. They're all terrible. The only character who gets any writing behind him at all is the father figure guy, who keeps telling Lara he believes in her, she can do it, etc etc etc. Which is why it's obvious that he's going to die, but not before he gets to have a dying breath monologue where he tells Lara to be strong. It's all so flat and telegraphed. It's so phoned in. And half the dialogue is cliche stuff. Even the ambient enemy dialogue sucks--the last enemy in the game fired a random audio cue where he said ""Hey guys, she's got a gun!"" No duh moron, I just laid waste to an entire civilization. I was really tempted to skip most of the cutscenes.- The story: Hey, you know the supernatural stuff in every Tomb Raider game? And every Uncharted game? Well, it's here and it's just as stupid here.That's a lot of words to say I'd play another one. It's a big dumb mega-budget AAA game. I think in a lot of ways it's one of the better examples of what it's trying to do this generation. Fire the writer for the next one."

Probably not, but I figured I would at least write a little something, as I did enjoy this game. The new Tomb Raider is a reboot of the series for modern consoles and PC. You play as a young and inexperienced Lara Croft, before she becomes a badass adventurer - a new origin story, basically. This is one of the game's strengths. Since it's not really beholden to anything that came before (except really basic stuff such as Lara's name and archaeology background), the writers were free to build the character from the ground up, and they did it fairly well. The game takes place on a seemingly-inescapable island full of all sorts of mysteries. Sound familiar? If you said ""hey, that's the plot of LOST"", then you win the Captain Obvious prize. The whole setup and plot, in fact, feels like a direct love-letter to LOST, as they share many similarities. So that's a plus if you are also a fan of that series. Gameplay is third-person action/adventure, very similar to the Uncharted series (with some hints of Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia thrown in). There is nothing particularly ground-breaking about any of it, but it's well made and is pretty fun. Your signature weapon is a bow, but you can also obtain a few others, such as a pistol, shotgun and more. Along the way, you'll also experience a fair amount of ""set piece"" moments and platforming sections. Overall, it's a good balance between exploration, combat, and action sequences. Combat itself is extremely easy (at least, it is with mouse aiming - more on that later). So this isn't a game you should play for a hard core challenge. Play it to experience the story and just have some good clean fun shooting dudes in the head with flaming arrows. There is also a multiplayer mode as well, but I don't really care about multiplayer in these types of games, so I didn't try it and can't really comment on that portion at all.I did encounter a couple of small issues with the game, though. The main problem I had was with the controls for gamepads. I started playing with an Xbox 360 controller, since most console ports tend to be designed for controllers and generally play better that way. However, this is not one of those games - that is, not unless you are a whiz with using the right-stick for aiming. Maybe it's just me (being a longtime PC gamer), but I just find controller aiming schemes to be terrible. For this game, it was too hard to aim with pinpoint precision under circumstances that required quick responses. Additionally, I had major problems with the camera control using the controller. I like to invert my X-axis for camera on the right-stick in 3rd person games, but for some reason, in this game, it just refused to work properly. It will work correctly once, and then not even 2 seconds later, the opposite effect happens, even though you are doing the same exact thing as you did a second ago - it's pretty much completely broken. So I switched to keyboard and mouse, and never looked back. I recommend you do the same. With a mouse, you can headshot pretty much every enemy in the game before they even have a chance to shoot at you. In retrospect, it's obvious that the AI was dumbed down for console players, who have to use the crappy right-stick aiming control method. Another issue I had with the game is its use of quicktime events (QTEs). These might have been novel when Resident Evil 4 came out, but that was nearly a decade ago now. Games have evolved since then, and these unholy abominations should have been banned from modern game design by now... *steps off soapbox*... Anyways, thankfully, there are only a few sections that have QTEs, but the ones that are there are still annoying as hell - you barely get any warning, so if you're not prepared and don't mash the right keys in time, you have to replay a section over and over again. It's really annoying, and takes you out of the game.Those small complaints aside, I enjoyed the game a lot. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece or anything, but it's definitely well above average and provides a good, fun time (an interactive popcorn flick, basically). The gameplay, graphics, and setting are all pretty solid as well, and the story is a nice new start to a franchise that was on its last legs. I would estimate the main campaign lasts somewhere between 12-18 hours, depending on whether you just run through it or if you are a completionist - and there's also the aforementioned multiplayer, if you're into that sort of thing. So it's definitely worth the money, if you are into these sorts of action/adventure games (and definitely pick it up if you enjoyed the Uncharted series, in particular)."

Love how its just challenging enough to keep you on your toes with the use of survival tactics and guerrilla warfare. No other game really even comes close to this but there have been cheap imitations which won't be named. Now I despise Square Enix getting in bed with the Communist Chinese AKA Epic Games.

The new Lara Croft is the most amazing thing that has happened to the series in 18 years (1996-2014). The graphics (characters, landscapes and the animation) are reminding me of the Last Of Us (awesome PS3 exclusive and my favourite game, all in all), which is a good thing, obviously. Soundtrack, voices and ambient sounds are decent as well -- game does a very good job immerging the player into it's universe. Level design and the game progression are just flawless -- you'll want to search every piece of every level in order to find all the secrets and get all the achievements (which isn't pretty hard, if you ask me).After all, the only weak spot of the game is it's multiplayer -- it's pretty boring and kind of imbalanced.I'd rate this game 9.0 out of 10.0, and I'm anxiously waiting for the Rise Of The Tomb Raider, which is going to be released next year, Q4 2015."

Admittedly, I did not play multiplayer much, so this review will focus on the single player campaign.- Looks good and controls feel responsive. - You get to watch amateur Lara develop into a hardened survivor. My favourite rendition of Lara Croft so far. - Exciting cut scenes and quick time events.- Plenty of collectables and some hidden tombs. You can unlock a skill later in the game that marks where the collectables are on your map (in case you’re a completionist). - Although the story is quite linear, you’re allowed to backtrack and revisit different locations (again, helps with 100% completion). - Good balance between stealth and aggressive gameplay. The skill trees help you customize Lara to fit your preferred style. - Puzzles felt too simplistic. I felt like the tombs should have been more challenging. - I would have liked more tombs. Lara is known as the tomb raider after all. Tomb Raider has been a celebrated franchise for years. Considering the large fan base, the expectations for this game were sky high. I was not disappointed. Square Enix and the developers did an excellent job with Tomb Raider (2013). I thoroughly enjoyed playing the campaign and am excited to play the sequel: ."

The game is a reboot of the popular series and it offers a fresh take on the character.One of the things I loved about this game is the level design. Each level feels unique and offers a lot of exploration opportunities. The environments are beautifully rendered and the attention to detail is impressive. The game also features a variety of puzzles that are challenging but not impossible to solve.The combat system is also well-done. Lara has a variety of weapons and abilities at her disposal, and the game gives players the freedom to approach combat situations in different ways. The stealth mechanics are particularly well-done, allowing players to take a more stealthy approach if they so choose.The story is also engaging, and it keeps you hooked from start to finish. It offers a lot of twists and turns, and it explores Lara's personal growth as a character. The voice acting and motion capture are excellent, making the characters feel alive and relatable.Overall, I would highly recommend Tomb Raider to fans of the series and newcomers alike. It's a fantastic game that offers a lot of variety in gameplay, beautiful environments, and an engaging story. It's a game that kept me hooked from start to finish, and it's one that I will definitely replay in the future."

227,23,Modranto,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971628333/,19,4,1,27.6,"Posted: June 2, 2016",284,0,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/141dbb18da000ab68d40b8a24f5e3eceb181cae6.jpg,"Let me begin with a warning: this game is brutally graphic. Sometime when you screw up you're subjected to a short, gruesome death scene. Even when you succeed you might find yourself stumbling through caverns strewn with corpses and pools of blood on the floor. Yet if you can stomach it, it ends up adding to the grisly, extraordinary struggle for survival that tries and tempers a young Lara over the course of this game.This iteration of Lara is a compelling one. Since this is an origin story, at the beginning we see her unsure of herself at and terrified when things start going all kinds of wrong. At times her compatriots need to encourage her, other times she is driven to fight for their wellbeing and still other times they butt heads with her. Gradually, as she overcomes the challenges she faces, we see her grow in ability and confidence. The actress and writers did a great job of making her feel like a real person. She's more than just a standard action hero killing machine given a female facade.Voice acting for video games in today's age of mo-cap has become much more of an involved process. Yet Tomb Raider proves that the talent in this industry is greater than ever and up to the challenge. Camilla Luddington as Croft is the obvious star and shows a broad range of believable emotions. Robin Atkin Downes' depiction of the character Conrad Roth exudes a fatherly, gentle confidence that steadies Lara early in her journey. Another highlight for me was the palpable desperation of the ship's mechanic, Reyes (portrayed by Tanya Alexander), to survive and get back home to her daughter. The main acting I didn't care for was for the character Samantha (Sam), who oddly has two actresses credited to the character without distinction for who is responsible for what. She came off as a little flat to me. There's also a point where she voices a letter written by one of Sam's ancestors, yet she hardly alters her voice at all. To a lesser degree I also wasn't too enthused with the writing and acting of the character Doctor Whitman. Neither Sam nor Whitman are distractingly bad, they simply fall short of the excellence of the rest of the cast.Crystal Dynamics has made a game that is visually stunning, living up to its AAA status. One memorable instance was looking out at a deep blue smoke signal rising in the distance that contrasted wonderfully with the tattered reddish-orange banners intermittently placed along my path. All this taking place on craggy, windswept rocks and ruins overlooking a hazy blue-gray sea and sky. Awe inspiring set pieces and soaring vistas abound amidst this chaotic journey.The character design is on par with the environments, including Lara who is just a beautiful as ever and with more realistic proportions and clothing to boot. It's worth noting that the graphics option ""TressFX""  gives Lara's hair its own exaggerated physics processing, but it is very taxing on computers. The only time my frame rate stuttered was during close-ups of Lara's face during cutscenes, presumably because of TressFX. You may get better mileage by turning it off and increasing several other settings instead.This game's third person shooter, cover based combat isn't particularly original but it's polished and largely satisfying. I appreciate that in most cases (but not all), the enemies seem like they plausibly could have been stationed where you encounter them, rather than being spawned in purely for the sake of throwing combatants at you. Melee attacks are limited to single strikes and dodge counters, indicating that you are expected to mostly rely on your weaponry. You are able to upgrade those weapons by scavenging scrap, encouraging you to keep an eye out for collectables as you explore. Lara also gains skill points used to unlock new abilities, which combined with the gear upgrades lends a nice sense of progression to the game. Many of the hidden collectibles have a historical significance that makes this island feel truly inhabited. As you seek them out you'll uncover pieces of this island's wondrous past. There are also numerous, optional, puzzle centric tombs to delve into. On the exploration side of the game, I could have done without the ""mash E"" type quick time events that are used for turning cranks and prying open doors and chests. The QTEs tied to the action do a good job of keeping you engaged during the more scripted parts.Speaking broadly about the story, I liked that it kept me guessing on what was real on this island and what was myth. While it is a little predictable in other ways, it was more than adequate to keep things moving and allow the other aspects of this game to shine. The pacing is excellent, never letting you get tired of one aspect of the game. You'll be driven from one fantastical event and locale to another, with time for cutscenes, character building, exploration and shootouts along the way. My first playthrough, which was about a year and a half ago, took 18 hours and included getting all collectibles and achievements. My recent replay lasted about 9 hours while getting roughly 75% of the collectibles. For this genre I would consider this a pleasantly lengthy game.9/10"

They take too long to make a new serie and history for Tomb Raider lovers but i'm not disapointed about it, because they made a really good work on this one.When you start, show Lara Croft find at her dad who goes an expedition to find more about a queen from Japan named Himiko, who according to legend was blessed with shamanistic powers that enabled her to control the weather. She also goes to an expedition to find more about this Queen, but close to this isle everything start goes really wrong and this is where history starts.In that serie, you can travel every camp you discovery to explore things you haven't explored to complete the history, upgrade your gear wear clothes with some improve habilites and learn skills for better playing.This scenario is huge and very detailed and rich with an beautiful environment. Design weapons very detailed, animals manufactures, mountains and other things. You can adjust your graphics inside game of before start the game. For 100% enjoyable game is better you have at leave a medium PC, don't need too much for run this game but at least a medim PC you need have if you want have full experience.In the middle of the history you have some challenges who make you stay more time between maps and discovery new ways to raid a tomb.You can play multiplayer games too and have fun with other people likeable thing they made for this game.I can say more and more tips but i'll expoil more the game and make less enjoyable playin but, yes i do recommend and have fun like i did playin."

But in the end, I just can't. Thing is, this would be an excellent game -- if the developers would LET YOU PLAY IT.But they just  It may not literally be every thirty seconds, but it really begins to feel like it, that the game either takes control away from you entirely so you can watch some animation, or drops limits on the camera or the character's movement, or shifts from regular play into some variety of quicktime event, or very often, stutters back and forth between a few beats of no-control animation, then a moment where you've got to ""Press X To Not Die"", then more animation, then another couple milliseconds of gameplay, then almost half a minute where it looks like you're free to, y'know, actually  again, but then you make some story progress and it's back to the on-and-off tango.Much of this is regular videogame material that I'd hardly notice otherwise -- such as Lara doing the Batman thing where she can't talk on the radio without walking really slowly with her hand on her ear, or animations taking over and the camera restricting when she crawls through tunnels and/or wades through water -- but these interruptions large and small , one after another, until the cumulative effect is like trying to drive with someone else's foot on the brake pedal. Someone nervous, twitchy, and convinced that you're a toddler who doesn't know what roads or solid objects are.What really starts to push this into the red is the heavy degree to which the animations you can't control are failures -- not just moments of scripted misfortune, but scenes of the character flat-out failing at the things you can totally do when the game actually lets you use your buttons. After successfully evading a bunch of barriers on your own accord, you have to watch Lara auto-fail and fall a great height. After a long string of hard battles in which you've killed about a hundred guys armed with machine guns and dynamite, you're forced to watch her get beat down by a couple of randoms who don't look any tougher than the rest. After making a long series of leaps from ledge to ledge, the next roof gives way and, once again, she tumbles, out of your control.Lara falling great distances is a dominant theme of the game.Despite all this, I kept on for, well, apparently about sixteen hours, because the scenery is gorgeous, the gameplay when you're allowed to engage in it is fun, and this version of Lara is an engaging and sympathetic protagonist.The last straw for me, though, was coming across the Big Bad (a cult leader with a southern accent, HOW ORIGINAL) and about fifteen or twenty mooks in a cave. Okay, I'm thinking, tough fight, but not impossible. Obviously the game won't let me punk the Big Bad, but I can probably get a couple headshots before any of these guys get into melee range. Just let me sneak up and...... Annnnnd then it goes completely non-interactive. Just a movie. I'm sitting there watching, entirely uninvolved, while Lara wastes the element of surprise getting a headshot on the nameless nobody standing  the actual major enemy, and then the aforementioned beating by two randoms occurs,At least this time, the person she's come to rescue doesn't die the second she gets there, but instead, is saved by literal  while Lara can do nothing but apologize for failing, and I can do nothing but wonder whether the game plans to invite me to participate again, or is just going to carry on being a movie for a few more hours before ending.A short while later, while I, supposedly the player here, am still stuck just watching, Lara beats up a couple guys who may well be the same two from a minute ago. I think this might be the first time in the whole game when I've had control taken out of my hands so that Lara can positively accomplish something rather than screw up.But it's too little too late. I'm done, I quit; I just don't care anymore what might happen with the rest of this movie, because I'm pretty sure it's going to go like this: a bunch of objectives will be presented to me; when I get there, either events beyond my control will render the objective and all the work reaching it entirely pointless, narratively empty time wasting, or Lara will fall from a great height, or both; at the end, the Big Bad will be killed by the island goddess while Lara and I sit back eating popcorn, just in time for rescue to arrive through no action of ours, because until the very last scene of the game, anything we do to seek help will bring only wreckage and corpses, because that's how to write video games, because of how Atlas's submarine exploded.(Okay, so in addition to the constantly-take-away-my-control thing, I'm also  that well over half the game thus far has been devoted to summoning a plane, which explodes on arrival, then going to ""rescue"" the two survivors, who both die when I get there -- making it all a waste of time: nothing has changed, no new characters have been introduced, none of the existing characters' motivations or knowledge have changed, nothing that happens afterward would be any different if Lara had spent the same  time sitting by the campfire talking to good ol' Roth except that the plane's crew and Grim might still be alive, and also Roth might not think that Lara is kind of an idiot. .)Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not interested enough to find out. Roth has been written so positively thus far that he has to die, or turn traitor and then die; Amy is a nonentity even as damsels in distress go; Father Mathias somehow manages to be even less interesting than Deacon Blackfire; Lara is protected by franchise armor, and my input is clearly neither needed nor wanted here. There's just nothing left to care about, except the gameplay, when it's available... and as far as that goes, I can get pretty much exactly the same degree and type of entertainment, without the constant interruptions, from (I'm sorry, really, it feels like I should censor the following term but I just have to say it) .The disease of Game Wants To Be Movie has critically weakened many games.  This, despite the initial robust strength of the patient, is a terminal case."

The gameplay in the beginning is a bit bland but afterwards you are let loose on the island and go to advance the story. Even tho there are a couple of the loved and sought after QTE's the story and locations advance fluidly and slowly but surely we see the birth of the survivor.The graphics are quite astounding to the point that it gives the island a beauty of nature with the combination of the sound which is also quite well incorporated. As for dialog in the game its quite linear but you are able to talk with the other survivors (also and achieve for it) to get to know them better and learn about them. The voice actors in the game are superb.The game offers some DLC but it is mostly maps, weapons and playable multiplayer characters. It's filled with variations of match types and progression systems that you'll see in Call of Duty, Battlefield 3 and other shooter-centric playgrounds. Just so you know, the multiplayer is almost dead. theres a group called Tomb Raider Multiplayer Madness that focuses on the multiplayer and sets dates to play with others. The Lara Croft character is very well laid out, the graphics are great, pacing is pulsating (perhaps the best thing about the game) and gameplay is smooth. This is a great prequel, an intense and gritty story of the origins of Lara Croft.9/10 for this gem of a game."

The PC version runs really well and it's very friendly to multi-monitor setups. I don't recommend the hard difficulty as you'll get into some fights that seem difficult for the sake of difficulty.   This game resembles a cinematic story because you don't have real choices for your actions and path, puzzles are not that hard, and there are a lot of (cool) Quick Time Events and cinematics. The action high points are often QTE or QTE-like, which on one hand it's a good thing because in this case they are done pretty well, on the other you could say that they subtract from the gameplay. Pros: good story. Cons: not sure if the stealth game is bad or I am (maybe both). Rating: all the QTEs!!! Recommendation: if you think you might like it, then you probably will."

The expedition ventures into the Dragon's Triangle, east of Japan. The ship is struck by a violent storm and shipwrecked, leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. A bloodthirsty, strange cult shows up to the shipwreck and tries to capture and kill the 'outsiders.' Lara soon discovers that the cult is led by a man named Mathias. Lara narrowly escapes capture at the hands of Mathias's men and must track down her friends and escape the island.The gameplay is where the game shines. Throughout the course of the game, Lara comes across a bow, and finds a handgun, machine gun, and shotgun. The weapons can be upgraded with the use of salvage, which you can find in crates, lockers, enemy corpses and animal corpses. You can also upgrade your skills with XP which you gain through story progression, killing enemies and animals, finding collectibles and solving puzzles. The weapons and skills can be upgraded at Campfires, which also allow the player to fast travel back to areas which you have visited before. You have to solve Mini-puzzles to open up a new path. Fire, wind, gravity, and rope arrows are just a few elements that are used throughout the game. Lara can climb rock walls and use valves with the help of a climbing axe, shoot rope arrows to create ziplines and much more.The Enemy AI is smart and will use cover and fire to their advantage. Quicktime events are often used in cases where Lara is captured or attacked by a wolf and they are pretty intuitive. Tombs are also in the game, but they are optional to get XP and salvage bonuses. There is also a multiplayer part. It consists of 4 game modes, Rescue, Team Death Match, Cry for Help and Free For All. Basically in all competitive modes the survivors will fight against the scavengers. The graphics are gorgeous. There is nothing to complain about.The ambient sound is well done. The voice acting is extremely professional.Overall, Tomb Raider is a spectacular game and I can highly recommend it for fans of the old Tomb Raider games and also for any other type of player.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:Also feel free to check out my YouTube Channel:"

As a game it's perfectly solid with nothing to really make it stand apart or fall to pieces. Mechanically it's all there – upgradable gear, skill points you spend on abilities, enjoyable combat and exploration – but I found it never reaches any heights where it should have. Lara Croft's origin story has so little story in it and development that was present I could never buy into due to conflicting narratives, character portrayal and being a reboot that honestly focused on the wrong things. Tombs, as such, being merely optional “dungeon delves” in a game titled Tomb Raider sounds wrong just typing it out like this, and with stronger presence would've been that something to make the game stand out more. Competent or uninspired, you decideLooking back at history of Tomb Raider I am brought to realization just how many games in the series I've missed out on. Not the earliest PS1 titles with those, let's call them charming, controls, but rather installments that followed on the next generation of consoles. PC as well, of course. This puts me at odds and essentially drawing from memory as to what the series originally was. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily. One should keep in mind my modern experience when it comes to “gun-totting action platformer” had been tempered already by Uncharted, though. This game strikes a resoundingly familiar tune in comparison.Story concerns exploring this lost island called Yamatai, but it takes a while for our cast to really get into things. Understandable when you take into account their ship wrecked and things start going awry almost immediately. Even if you ignore the fact they're largely regular people, aside from Roth who happens to be ex-Royal Marine and badass to the bone, there's bad blood on the island since it turns Lara and her crew are hardly first to get stranded there. Why and how would be spoiling, but considering this is Tomb Raider and they're looking for “mythical civilization lead by the Sun Queen” I'll let you piece it together on your own. Speaking of Endurance's crew and related characters we have our own Lara Croft alongside Sam who's family is actually funding this whole expedition as kind of archaeological research. These three figures are the most important ones and game really never makes much of an effort to characterize everyone else past the intro itself and brief radio communications. You have your grumpy mechanic, fellow naive student, professor so drunk on his ego you can see disaster waiting to happen, etc. They're archetypes for the most part and if there are twists to be had you can probably how they'll unfold. Story is not really the focus of Tomb Raider as it focuses more on Lara's own journey of survival and saving others as she gets entangled with things way beyond her ability to deal with at first glance. As game likes to remind you, she's a Croft and it's in her blood, though.Lara herself is one I have even more problems with. I remember it was all the rage back when this was a new release to toss around “ludonarrative dissonance” in order to sound smart and yet these people were not entirely wrong. What does that term mean? Put simply it's when story and gameplay narratives are at odds with one another... which happens to be absolutely true in Tomb Raider. Vulnerable girl persona they have going for Lara takes forever to wash away considering that in gameplay department you're wasting crazy cultists and wild life out to get you about ten minutes in. It's a permanent obstacle if you want to take Lara's character development seriously and I never could. To be fair there are moments later on when she's in full hardcore mode taunting enemies and they genuinely fear whoever is thinning their ranks, but such moments are far too rare and her character is not significantly altered. This one is a personal pet peeve, though – I could not stand Lara's voice. Yeah, posh Brit was always her thing, but if there's an English valley girl equivalent stereotype this is probably what it would sound like. Fact half her script seems to be grunting in pain and game mostly serves to be a sort of origin story for her character doesn't exactly help.With all that out of the way we can finally get to gameplay and other bitsAs I hinted above this was instantly familiar to me, although that could be simply because similar games have codified particular aspects like control schemes, character progression, and others over the years. If you've played one modern third-person action game you could make an argument you've played them all. In that case it's a good thing Tomb Raider is still built on very solid foundation. Yeah, Uncharted with female lead vibe is very strong, but I really liked how tight the game felt and in terms of shooting specifically I think it gave you more freedom as opposed to sticking to cover and taking potshots. In that regard maneuvering through combat zones takes a significant step forward in opposition to more static yet similar games of its time.If I had to divide it very roughly I'd say game has in equal measure platforming, combat and collecting various trinkets, but how they're distributed is not necessarily balanced out perfectly. What I mean by that is there are segments where you're on rails as setpiece after setpiece is, sometimes quite literally, firing around you and you're either doing your best to parkour your way to the objective OR shooting through waves of enemies to stay alive. For a good chunk of Tomb Raider you'll be putting combat aside and exploring zones to get all the sweet experience and collectibles. I come back to it again, but it's the latter that will actually stand in for largely absent story as you discover more about how previous shipwrecked individuals coped with their situations, find relics Lara will expand upon for some ancient Asian history, etc.That “fully realized game” feeling is probably what I liked the most. Yes, you're unlocking weapons as Lara goes through the story and you're using scraps you collect from crates you seemingly find everywhere, even in ruins untouched by mortal hands, but it's how these weapons are incorporated into the world is what really makes them more than merely how quickly they can kill things. Shotgun can be used to clear barricades, bow used to connect two points and create a rope to traverse over, etc. Fact you can upgrade all available weapons and will keep doing so until the very end of the game means you'll have something to do. One issue that kept rearing its ugly head is lack of any real stealth for a game where you're a single person going an entire garrison and your name isn't Rambo. You can creep on enemies and even stealth execute them if you get close with your mountaineering axe, but when you take into account you have three silent weapons (bow and upgraded pistol/rifle) you really have to wonder why that's the case in the first place. As you can probably predict game dispenses with any of that and likes to throw you into gauntlets as enemies surge in waves. I did appreciate the change of pace towards the end when new enemies appear even with staying up to date with upgrades meant I was never really out of ammo. Weapons having multiple uses also means you'll be using them to gain access to more than you initially could in the world aka going back to re-visit with fast travel to collect what you missed on your first pass.Much to my own enjoyment I was pleasantly surprised by how Tomb Raider kept up visually. Most of its failings in that department really come from intentional choices. Be they from the setting game went with (jungles and caves, until the last quarter or so when you see more variety) or simply due to trends in the industry at the time still going strong. It's a game that really wants you to mash those buttons for QTE as interaction and core part of combat itself."

However, the only issue I have with the game is the fact that, unlike what the name suggests, there are not that many “tombs” in the game and the ones you get are usually pretty small and not very engaging. In addition, it goes without saying that the multiplayer is long gone, so don’t expect much in that area. All in all, Tomb Raider is a solid experience and is definitely recommended.

This game is basically about her slowly becoming a badass, having her trapped in an island full of crazy people is the perfect setting to tell that kind of story.If you're like me and had this game sitting in your library for years I urge you to give it a chance, it really made me excited to play the other games in the trilogy."

She doesn’t appear to be sexualized like she was in previous iterations and looks like a woman who is about survival and gets tougher as the narrative progresses. This is the first time I had ever thought that Lara could be raped by a man who was coming on to her.The plot begins with Lara and her companions being shipwrecked on an island known as Yamatai. You will discover that Yamatai is an island with many perils, including dangerous cultists plenty of wildlife. The game begins with many QTEs (Quick Time Events) that introduce you to the basic gameplay of Tomb Raider. After learning the QTEs, the game opens up and allows you to explore. This game is not as linear as previous Tomb Raider games and this is a great thing. You can explore as much as you want while being mindful of the strict nature of the narrative. Lara looks convincingly vulnerable, but she is very resourceful in trying to survive.Once you have freedom to explore you will notice that Lara needs to eat by hunting wild animals such as deer and birds. She seems to feel bad about killing wildlife in order to survive but she needs to survive. As the plot advances Lara gets used to killing enemies she only gets tougher from killing enemies. The enemies include cultists known as Solarii soldiers and Oni. Solarii and Oni vary in terms of armor, weapons, difficulty.Weapons are a very interesting part of Tomb Raider’s gameplay. You begin with a basic bow and arrow that is upgradeable as you find more gear and salvage. The bow can eventually be used to create ropes in order to zipline from one area to another. As the bow continues to be upgraded, you will be able to attach the arrow to ropes in order to break open barriers. The bow is the best weapon that demonstrates Lara’s resourcefulness. Other well-known weapons such as the pistol, shotgun, and assault rifle can be upgraded also. This is where salvage is significant in the game. Salvage can be found on bodies of dead wildlife, Solarii and Oni and needs to be spent on upgrading weapons. Salvage is a pleasant addition to this game. There are also skill points that you earn from killing enemies, skinning animals, and progressing through the story. Skill points give Tomb Raider an RPG feel, although the game overall still feels like an adventure. Salvage and skill points can be spent at the various camps scattered throughout the game. The camps also serve as save points for Lara.The exploration gives the game a non-linear feel, as you find many collectibles such as relics, GPS cache, treasure maps, and tombs for raiding. Most of the collectibles don’t give much XP, but the tombs increase your XP so much that you would feel very encouraged to find/raid all the tombs. All the tombs require some puzzle solving, but the puzzles are not overly difficult to understand and solve. Raiding these tombs is plenty of fun and makes it fall in line with the title of the game Tomb Raider.Stealth is one of the new features added to this reboot. Lara can sneak up from behind and strangle an unsuspecting soldier to death. The bow can also be used in silent kills by hitting someone in the head with a well-placed arrow. There is a greater reward for headshots with any weapon which is greater XP.The locales around the island really serve as playgrounds not only because of their design, but because of the openness of the gameplay. Previous Tomb Raider games would require you to follow a strict, linear path to reach your objectives. While the storyline itself is linear and predictable, the exploration shows Lara’s interest in archaeology and ancient civilizations. Lara’s companions help flesh out the story. These characters are mixed with people who support Lara and one who’s not so sure about Lara’s ways to get them to survive their unfortunate circumstances on the island.The controls of this game are absolutely accurate, from the platform jumping to pressing the right buttons in QTEs. There is a Q button for those who play with the mouse and keyboard for survival instincts. Pressing the button for survival instincts turns the screen gray and highlights the important objects that you may need to solve puzzles. There is a well-detailed map that makes the game reasonable enough for advancing.I think that the Tomb Raider 2013 reboot is the best of the Tomb Raider franchise. It’s probably best not to sexualize Lara Croft and portray her as a tough, courageous survivor. Also, previous Tomb Raiders didn’t provide so many clues to advance and had frustrated many gamers. This Tomb Raider does not frustrate in the gameplay context. I highly recommend this Tomb Raider reboot to anyone."

I had a lot of fun playing it from start to finish (minus the multiplayer) due to the breathtaking level design, good voice acting (Camilla Luddington), and overall high-intensity throughout the game.This is an example of a game that you can't play half-awake.It took me about 25 hours to complete the SP campaign (35+ if you count the MP). One major thing that I feel they did right in this game are the collectibles. It's interesting because they're not hard to find due to skill upgrades and treasure maps but they are actually fun to 'try and get' because of all the platforming involved. It's not enough to know which direction to go. Reaching the collectibles requires an understanding of the map's layout. It's actually very easy to get lost within the beautiful island if you are just prancing around without direction.As far as the combat goes, I am split 50-50. The game gives you enough freedom with how you can kill your enemies and that allows for some good times. On the other hand, it seems that enemy detection is a bit screwy. As an example, there's an enemy mounted on a turret gun that can see you through walls and will follow you wherever you go even if you are hidden from sight.I feel that this 2013 version of Tomb Raider is my favorite one so far. Even for an origin story, this Lara Croft is quite different from her predecessor even when you try and imagine how one can become the other. I think that this game should be a starting point for a new series of Tomb Raider games. I do recommend this game to fans of the old games but even more so to those who have yet to play anything from the collection."

I loved it, I sucked at it, but i loved it. That first game made me a forever fan. Tomb Raider 2013 tho? A whole 'nother monster.I dont know why i havent written a review for this yet, I first played it back when it released on the xbox 360 back in 2013, and i eventually bought it on pc when i upgraded my potatoe to a genuine PC gaming machine. I have beaten this game countless times. I have this game memorized through and through. It is a masterpiece. The new standard for a franchise that would change it forever. This game is a must play, and it only gets better from here. Crystal dynamics took what core design created and took it beyond what i thought possible as a 7 year old. THIS is a tomb raider game, and im happy to be a fan. I am a lara stan, and 2013 was the year we got a new and perfected lara croft adventure. Crystal dynamics sold to a new pub this year, and i hope that means less crappy avengers games and more Tomb Raider."

Rather then play as Lara Croft on another adventure to discover lost tombs and treasure, you play as Lara when she was in her younger years (early to mid twenty's I think) and she was not the adventurer type as we know her to be back then.The game starts off with the you surviving a ship wreck and having to find your crew mates. Along the way you discover hidden tombs random box's containing salvage material and random items throughout the game to collect.Crystal Dynamics did yet another amazing job creating another Tomb Raider game. The visuals and graphics alone make this game truly amazing looking. Tomb Raider is an adventure game and that offers weapon upgrades as well as skill upgrades.The game plays smoothly with the Xbox 360 controller and the default button setup is well placed for play. Although you can't save the game when ever you like there are camp sites that when you rest the game saves.When you pass by an area with placed you could not get into you will eventually make your way back so that you can access those areas with your upgraded weapon and/or new weapon abilities. The camp sites also let you fast travel from camp site to camp site.The map screen when you access it will show locations of the hidden items to find in a given area once you locate the treasure map or enough GPS devises for them to show up.My first few hours of play of Tomb Raider I have to say have been really good. There are events in the game that require button mashing to be done in order to succeed and although this makes the game more dynamic I don't like it because it distracts me from watching the event by making me focus on what button is about to be reveled that I need to press with in a second.Right now the Game of The Year edition is $39.99 Canadian and I would wait for a sale when it $12.49 or so before picking it up because the single player is where the game is really enjoyable. Although the price of $39.99 is a steal there isn't much to offer for multiplayer as there isn't many people playing the multiplay side of the game, plus the single player story is what Tomb Raider is really about.ːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː"

This game is so overflowing with adventuring in its truest sense and bombastic action, that it won't bore you for a second. Lara Croft's origin story couldn't have gone better. This is how it's done. Crystal Dynamics changed the heavy focus on linear levels full of platforming and puzzle solving to a more dynamic mix of action, exploration and truly physical storytelling. Don't worry as there are still many many puzzles to solve, relics to collect and tombs to be raided. The levels are abundant with content, there is always something to do, solve, collect or read and it will shed some light on the history of the island you shipwrecked on. You get XP for your activities and gain levels to improve your combat and exploration skills. This reminded me of the Batman series as it has a very similar structure. If you are attentive to your surroundings, you will get 90% of the content the game has to offer naturally. The open levels are very well intertwined with action sequences and the combat itself is quite challenging on Hard difficulty. What I meant by physical storytelling is that the plot is revolving around Lara's survival ability and learning how to function on this hostile island. She slowly uncovers a sinister plot with a supernatural twist as it wouldn't be a Tomb Raider without some spooky stuff. The ending was very emotional for me. The audiovisual presentation is simply breathtaking as well as optimised. I loved every bit of this game and I cannot think of a more serious negative aspect. 9/10+ true action adventure, exploration of the mysterious island, the birth of a survivor, graphics and optimisation- the puzzles might be considered easy"

I saw this title, enjoyed the trailers, and decided to give the series another shot.  To be frank, I was blown away.  This game pulls you in from the moment it begins, with an engaging storyline, beautiful graphics, and compelling voice acting.  The gameplay is solid and offers enough exciting combat and immersive exploration to satisfy any fan of the adventure genre.Tomb Raider 2013's story reveals Lara Croft's origins and is based on one of her earliest adventures on a mysterious island.  The player is taken on a thrilling journey that uncovers Lara's true potential and destiny to become the Tomb Raider.  Her evolution from the inexperienced young student to the courageous, gritty survivor/explorer is brilliant.   As the game progresses, there are so many details- from gradual changes in Lara's facial expression to the tone of her voice and behavior- that reveal her gradual transformation.  In the beginning of the game, one can sense her fear and uncertainty, but by the end, a budding confidence and resolve.The gameplay is rock solid.  Combat is fun and exciting, and the player is rewarded for skillfully dispatching enemies with bonus experience.  The weapon upgrades are awesome and fun to use (my favorite was the grenade launcher and fire arrows).  Exploration is a blast, thanks to the fluid and natural way the player navigates the treacherous terrain, be it rock climbing with the ice axe or daring leaps across bottomless chasms.  There is a decent amount of side questing involved for the completionists out there as well, usually involving finding hidden historic artifacts or notes/memoirs.  There are sporadic button prompt mini-games but they don't feel tacky and aren't overly difficult.  My only complaint really is the simplicity of the optional tombs and the trivial rewards at the end of each one.  The devs could have put a little more effort into making these spelunking experiences feel more ""epic"" and rewarding, rather than just a means to find some treasure maps and weapon upgrades.Controls are great.  I played this using a keyboard/mouse and had a very enjoyable experience.  The controls are, by default, very intuitive so I didn't even have to change anything, just played the game.Graphics are amazing, especially for a game from 2013.  Excellent graphical options as well, and the performance is great, no issues for me and my system is a bit outdated.Sound is excellent, but music was mediocre.I spent a good 15 hours to complete roughly 80% of the game, including the main story, all the optional tombs, and a good chunk of the side quests.  If I were a true completionist, I can see this game lasting maybe 18-20 hours or so.In short, Tomb Raider 2013 is one of the most immersive and enjoyable adventure games I've played in recent memory, a classic in my book.  Grab this game NOW if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did!  Solid 9/10 game."

I have not tested multiplayer features at all. I will keep this review relatively short and to the point. I will do some minor comparison to older Tomb Raider games (1-5) as it can't be helped being a huge fan of the series.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Tomb Raider (2013) is a brand new beginning and a resurrection for the well known franchise. It took a completely new direction making the main character Lara Croft more human, easier to relate to and less of that sex symbol as Lara has been in the past. The change is fresh, well needed and makes the whole thing more serious. I really like this new look for both Lara and the Tomb Raider franchise.The visuals of the game are fantastic and the cutscenes are both beautiful and well placed between the gameplay. I personally liked the camera angle very much and it didn't suffer from any issues. He whole experience felt really fluid and enjoyable. The soundtrack of the game however wasn't above the average. It did it's job but there were no moments when I'd stop to listen the beautiful melody on the background as in the past. I couldn't find anything I'd find myself listening outside of the game.As with so many other newer generation of games, I can't see myself playing this game again after fully (100%) completing it one time. In comparison I have replayed the old Tomb Raider games many times over and still they keep making me want to complete them yet again. I don't know where the problem lies, I just didn't get a feeling that I'd want to play this game a second time.Overally the game wasn't much of a challenge outside the few moments when I had to stop and think for the solution. Getting all the loot and treasure didn't give me other satisfaction than the ending screen's ""100% complete"" text. It wasn't difficult, rather time consuming since the game could have been completed in half of the total time if I only went for the story. The game had plenty of ammunition for your weapons and I never felt like I'd have to preserve it. The combat was rather easy and the AI wasn't that sharp all of the time. This could be seen as enemies thinking as if they were behind a cover when they actually weren't. I think the amout of combat was overally well balanced however and there wasn't too little or too much of it.You don't have to be a Tomb Raider fan to enjoy this game. It's a fresh start with a fresh story and it's made for both newcomers and old veterans of the series. Xbox controller is supported and the gameplay with it is easy, had no issues at all. I highly suggest to only get the base game unless you absolutely want the GOTY edition for whatever reason. The additional content consists of totally unimaginative skins for Lara (I ended up not liking any over the default skin), some multiplayer maps and weapon skins (for multiplayer) and one extra (bugged!) tomb to explore. A new area that adds 5-10 minutes more gameplay should have just been included in the base game. Charging 2,50€ for it can be seen both as greedy and as a total lack of imagination for deluxe edition content. The whole variety of DLC is more or less a money grab in my eyes and leaves a bad taste to my mouth. Other than that the actual game is well worth the money.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *21:9 Gameplay Review:I played this game using a monitor with 21:9 aspect ratio, a resolution of 3440x1440 and a refresh rate of 100hz. I'm sharing my experience with those who might be interested in how this game works on ultrawides.This game supports 21:9 aspect ratio out of the box and you won't be needing any additional fixes. Some HUD elements didn't expand beyond 16:9 but that was a rather minor issue and didn't bother me personally. During the end credits the screen did some flashing outside the 16:9 area which was a bit annoying. Cutscenes were apparently cropped to fill the screen but I didn't really put too much attention to this (other than a few times when Lara's head wasn't shown completely) and I personally prefer filling the screen completely (without stretching) than having black bars on the sides. Refresh rate was sadly limited to 60 as far as I'm concerned (couldn't change that from in-game options) so I couldn't utilize my 100hz monitor's full potential. Overally very happy with my ultrawide experience on Tomb Raider and as always, getting more horizontal view gives so much better immersion.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *TL;DR & Ending words:Overally a very nice game with beautiful visuals and a fresh look. Musical score was sadly average and the 100% completion could have been made a bit more satisfying experience. Supports 21:9 aspect ratio and the Xbox controller for PC out of the box. A game worth buying for everyone. The DLC content however hardly gives any additional value and is not worth it in my opinion."

Lets dig in.Tomb Raider is a 2013 reboot/relaunch of a very famous franchise that had lost its way over the years.  It is a third person, action/adventure/exploration game starring Lara Croft, a young archeologist.  On its face, Tomb Raider has everything you would want from a AAA single player game.  Stunning graphics, smooth action with great feel, excellent platforming, tons of secrets to explore and a big map.  The devil, as they say, is in the details.  In Tomb Raider you and your teams boat crashes onto an unpopulated island that is hidden in the ocean and difficult for people to reach.  At the start of the game, you have been separated from your group and you are injured.  You have to pull yourself together, find a camp, and our adventure then begins.  At first it seems like Tomb Raider is going to be some kind of survival game.  You are injured, and need to find a camp, and supplies.  The jungle is intimidating and beautiful.  Very quickly though, the game forgets about your injuries, and becomes a pretty straightforward action/adventure/exploration game.  In Tomb Raider, you are constantly being reminded that you are playing a game.  This is by far my biggest gripe with it.  Over the course of the game, I estimate you kill somewhere around 750+ people.  When this is contrasted with Lara’s arc, and her reactions, it makes NO sense.  It is constantly hitting you in the face during story/dialog sequences, that don’t really make sense after you just killed 15 people in cold blood seconds earlier.  Making it worse, is that it doesn’t make any sense for that many people to even be on the island in the first place.  Additionally, you are able to fast travel between camps.  Considering what a physical ordeal it would be to travel between them, it again, pulls you right out of game and makes sure you are very aware it is a game that you are playing.  This would not be criminal in certain games, but in a narrative based game like this, where they are clearly trying to get you to suspend disbelief and get emotionally invested, it works against what they are trying to accomplish.  I feel the same way I did about Alan Wake.  Tomb Raider would have been a better game if design was more “top down”.  If the developers came up with the gameplay systems based on the story they were trying to tell (trapped on an island with a cult of people who are also trapped on the island), instead of feeling they *needed* certain types of gameplay, and systems, and game length, if they were going to charge $60 for the game at the time of release, and then trying to shoehorn a narrative around those systems.My issues with it aside, Tomb Raider does a fantastic job returning Tomb Raider to its rightful place as franchise with big time, cutting edge, releases that you should be excited for.  I’m looking forward to playing through the sequel and seeing where they took the franchise next.8/10(Edited to correct year the game released)"

You are in for one thrilling survival origin story. Lara Croft has never looked better than she does now. Some key points that this game offers:1.	Origin Story: Experience Lara’s transformation from a young woman to the Legend we all know her to be.2.	Survival, Scavenge, hunt and loot to survive.3.	Breath-taking visuals.4.	Multiplayer.Gameplay & Controls:The game handles super well, on keyboard and controller. It comes down to your preference on which you enjoy to play more, console owners are limited to controllers only but on the PC, you have a choice.Lara’s movement in the game is stunningly done; she handles well, moves smoothly and just looks stunning. Whether you are up high or crouching down for stealth attacks, the game handles everything beautifully and you can get into it swiftly. To better explain this would be to say, the moment you spot enemies and approach a wall or other object that you can prone against Lara will automatically prone to hide for said enemies. We also have the means to aim both left handed and right-handed, thus giving us a tactical advantage when shooting from cover.We have a mostly open world environment that we get to explore as we unlock the means to do so; the said means would be the equipment and gear you obtain on the island as you progress in the story. The world is full of wood crates that can be broken to obtain salvage, salvage being the currency on this island that you use to upgrade your gear.You have several unique weapons that start out looking old and very broken down, but as you scavenge parts for them you upgrade them with a variety of options such as less recoil and being able to do more damage. The further along these upgrades get the better and more modern they start looking.The game features a form of levelling as you gain XP; once you fill up the XP bar you are rewarded with a skill point that can be invested into one of three categories to unlock new abilities like finisher moves or passives that allow you to carry more ammo.  Animals can be hunted for XP and each area has a challenge that can be completed for XP and you can forage certain plants for additional XP.You get the full spelunking experience along with so much more. Tomb Raider’s Reboot truly offers a new and much warranted outlook. Lara is downright better than ever before.Graphics:Saying that the visuals are breath-taking does not do them justice. This game is jaw droppingly gorgeous. Every aspect of this game has been carefully created to deliver a visual masterpiece. Everything looks so real, so lifelike, from the climbable terrains such as the mountains and buildings throughout the islands to the scenic paths; they all look so beautiful. The way the sun hits the mountains when it rises or sets, it truly makes everything so much better.Character details are of the same quality, there are a variety of enemy types, all looking absolutely stunning. The facial features are so beautifully done that it gives these characters a new realistic look. The way the graphics engine generates and creates the shadows fall and rise is impeccable.The game has all of this and so much more; it truly is a visual masterpiece. Under the hood there is a great variety of settings to fully customize how the game runs on your machine.Sounds:Just as beautiful... The in game sounds bring life to the island in a new thrilling and very surreal way. You can hear the wind howl, and the way the game generates it, it almost feels like you yourself can feel it. This is just one of many minor elements that comes together to create this masterful game. As you journey through the island regions the entire atmosphere changes, the sounds, the music, it all changes and that real lifelike quality stays in place. The game has a marvelous soundtrack that sets the tone for the game. It adds to the thrill and mystery of the island.Character voice acting has been done brilliantly. The voice acting in itself adds the last extra bit to truly making everything you feel, see and experience on this island so much more lifelike. The drama through conversations builds and adds the atmosphere and mystery immensely and the climax is well worth it in every way whatsoever.Replayability:The game has various regions you travel through as you progress in the story, some new and some previous areas that you could not reach yet. The Island is scattered with a variety of collectible items you can collect, along with numerous challenges that can be completed. This and the pure beauty of the game will keep you busy for hours, then there are the achievements/ trophies that have somewhat of a grind to obtain.Once you are fully done with Single Player you can take things online with some mates and others in a game of Multiplayer, furthering your Tomb Raider experience.MGR Gaming’s Conclusions:Spoilers ahead:When it comes down to it all, this game is absolutely marvelous. They have done this reboot amazingly. The story of how Lara has to fight and kill to survive, how she is forced to see the supernatural play out in front of her eyes, which goes against her very beliefs. You see and experience how a young woman is thrust into an unexplainable situation, forced to do things she never even considered just to survive.She is forced to fight and kill the crazed islanders in a desperate attempt to stay alive whilst trying to reunite with her friends. Everything is against her, even the island itself.You get to experience first-hand just how Lara Croft became the Legend we all grew up admiring and cherishing. She is one of the oldest gaming icons and seeing her reboot, paving the way forward for new and old gamers is a wonderful experience.A must have for every Tomb Raider fan, and that is not all if you try this game you will love it.

Guess that's good if you like moving forward and shooting guys as the main aspect of the gameplay, but as a fan of the classic Tomb Raider games I loved the platformer elements, the inspired level design, the diversity of locations, the puzzles and the challenge in those games. And I didn't find any of that here. This is like a typical adventure shooter with an odd fetish with showing Lara's pain and suffering. Lack of interesting locations and enemy variety (virtually you only fight human enemies); and guess what, you barely do any tomb raiding here because the ""tombs"" are just a bunch of small caves scattered around the game and are completely optional.As a game on its own, it's not terrible, but not great either, it's simply an average game with not much really interesting to offer. However as a Tomb Raider, this reboot made me lost interest in the franchise. I don't know if it gets any better in the sequels (Rise and Shadow) but I'm certainly not going to bother giving those games a try to find out.Giving it a negative is probably a bit unfair, but so are those hilarious 9+ scores from the ""specialized"" press. It's an ok casual action TPS at best, yet forgettable and apparently heavily overrated, with barely anything of what made Tomb Raider unique and great left."

This has been one of the most fun gaming experiences I have had in a long time! The graphics seemed to be great for a 5/6-year-old game and not at all dated. The game is very beautiful with stunning backdrops that are a sight to behold when played on full settings at 1440p. The gameplay was extremely fluid and intuitive, and the camera was always great, and I never had an issue with it. The gunplay is fantastic; having headshots is incredibly satisfying, as is blowing anyone away with a shotgun at point blank range. The melee fighting seemed to be more based on defensive play, such as dodging a strike and then shooting the enemy when they were exposed, which felt extremely rewarding. The overall movement, as well as the climbing mechanics, were extremely fluid and smooth with no problems, making the experience an utter delight. I was so immersed in the plot that I became heavily invested in the main character, which is something I don't normally do in games these days. I intended to play this in short bursts, but I couldn't stop myself from wanting to know what would happen next, and it never let me down. It had some unexpected scary and horror-like elements, which was unexpected but highly enjoyable."

This game is an action packed thriller with explosive set-pieces and a storyline to root for.The Lara Croft we know is absent. Long gone the duel wield weaponry and the unbeatable killer machine of a women we love, instead we get a timid and frightened young lady who is stranded in a japan-ish bermuda triangle.Hunting for her life are the fanatics led by an intriguing character named Mathias who wants to resurrect the fabled Sun Queen who used to rule the world ages ago. However, Lara is not alone in her journey, she has her mentor & friend along with her best friend Sam and a group of rag tag explorers. The atmosphere is beautiful and horrific at the same time. Equally, gorgeous is the lead heroine Lara, who instead of over-sexualized in previous games, is depicted as an average explorer who when faced with the mortal dangers quickly sprangs into action. Camilla Ludington the voice of Lara has done an amazing job!The puzzles are few but very intelligent and realistic, Lara dont have to push a button to solve everything like in past, here she has to manipulate surroundings in order to solve the puzzles.This game is amazing, I have already played in 4 times and yet havent explored everything. After playing its sequel (Rise of Tomb Raider) and the series finale (Shadow of Tomb Raider) I conclude that this one is by far the most superior of the trilogy.For Lara worshipper like me it was a mandatory game to play, however I would encourage every action/adventure lover out there to try this amazing masterpiece."

The original Tomb Raider may look like Minecraft now but the sets themselves were puzzles that you needed to solve in order to traverse.  This reboot has a button to highlight all areas of interest and removes that in favour of the more impatient action gamers who are just running to the next shootout.I still recommend this because its a good game and you get to feel like a badass despite being put through the wringer a dozen times."

But apparently this is different - and better - than the past games. I really have no comparison on that point. It reminded me of a cross between Batman Arkham Asylum/City and Assassin's Creed: lots of running around in a big map, getting into a bunch of fights that often require precise timing (QTE's), some platforming/puzzle stuff, and collectibles. Yey. The gameplay is good at what it does, and I managed to keep playing it despite my distaste for QTE's and platforming (the former because its boring, the latter because I am bad at it. XD). Story-wise, it is fine, if somewhat predictable (took me about 12 hours to finish the main story). Sadly, some of the characters I like die horribly and the characters I really don't like die horribly to something other than me, so that was a bit of a shame. But aside from that it is a fun little adventure where you go to alot of freaky looking places, fall onto hard surfaces alot, and eventually make it out by doing a crazy run away from danger only to end up in a place similar to where you just left. Pretty sure Lara would have died half a hundred times during the course of this game if it was reality and not a game. But anyone who has played a fair amount of games is probably used to that by now. XDOverall I thought it was a good game, even if I could do without the QTE's and the sequences where I have to run or slide down a dangerous area dodging and jumping over stuff. Everything aside from that was fine and mostly enjoyable. So if what I have described here sounds like a game that you would enjoy, then go ahead and pick this up. If not, then I guess don't. Enjoy a crazy adventure on a strange island filled with freaky people for you to shoot at! :o"

All the environments, animals, characters etc. look good.The sounds are also very good - especially the environmental sounds, like waterfalls, rain, storms, wind and such sound great and they create immersion well. The voice actors are very good and their voices fit their characters well.The music.. well. Honestly I can't remember much of it - so it's not memorable at all. But I suppose it just blends in so well that you don't even notice it.. lol.Can't say it's bad cause it doesn't annoy me, but can't say it's good either, because it's not memorable in anyway.============The story is interesting - it does have some fantasy elements that might not work for everyone, but for me it did the trick just fine - I really liked the story of the game.The character difference between games is notable - the old Lara was an ample bosomed she-terminator that just shot everything on the run - the new Lara is a whimpering little girl that eventually evolves into a female Rambo - she's even armed with explosive arrows.She's no longer a superhero, and her bust size is normal too. I really like the changes - it makes the character more believable and realistic.============The game and its areas are very linear - but it works in this game very well. I think its better this way than forcing an open world design on it.You just unlock gear that allows you to move forward - and sometimes you gain access to collectibles in old areas with new gear, it's pretty straightforward.The puzzles of the game might be too easy for most people - I'm not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed and I found them all pretty easy.But maybe it's better that they're easy - at least they won't stop you from progressing in the game.(Well, most of the puzzles are optional anyway..) ============Well.. anything bad?It has some technical problems, but they are rare. Once when I went into a tomb, I could see through the floor, whirling water beneath the cave. And I actually could die from this glitch too - the floor wasn't merely lacking textures, it was really bugged. After dying everything worked normally.I also got a fatal error once when moving in the Endurance (Ship).Other than that, I can't find much bad to say about the game - other than some optional stuff.Collecting mushrooms and eggs and stuff is just.. meh. It's artificially made filler content that doesn't make any sense. It shouldn't be in the game at all.Like okay, I understand that you collect relics and historical documents and stuff - Lara's an archaeologist and interested in things like that. But why would she gather Red Cap mushrooms or steal bird eggs? Just.. lolSo basically I could give it a full five star rating, if I had ignored the stupid filler content.. but no, I had to play the game to 100% completion.It's not that time consuming to play to 100% anyway - but those things just didn't make sense to me.============But yeah, I think the game is about perfect in length (if you ignore them mushrooms), it can be completed in about 10 hours if you just play the game and don't mind the extra stuff.Even if you search for every collectible in the game, upgrade all weapons and get all skills for Lara, it takes around 20 hours which is completely fine in my opinion.The game isn't too short and its not too long - the length is just right.Overall, the 2013 Tomb Raider Reboot is an excellent game - easily worth those four stars, maybe even five if you can forgive the things I mentioned above.You probably can grab it from a sale for really cheap, I got mine for a few euros and honestly if I knew it was this good, I could've paid more.It's definitely worth playing, especially if you get it cheap - I highly recommend it for anyone.============Summary:The Good 👍+ Still very good looking+ Immersive sounds+ Interesting story+ Character design+ Perfect length (for me)The Bad  👎- Too easy puzzles- Artificial filler content"

This game being the first in the trilogy leaves some thing unpolished which gets more attention in future games, but still holds it's own to this day gameplay and graphics wise. The only downsides in my opinion are the following:After beating the game, any enemy-killing based achievements will be nearly impossible since all enemy spawns are rapidly decreased or just completely gone, so get those done as you go.You cant acquire every achievement in this game without putting a long time into the multiplayer gamemode. The issue with that is that getting a multiplayer game in 2020 is nearly impossible. You can load into a game with friends so if you have like 4 friends with this game you can get 100% of the games achievements with ease.TL;DR: Buy this game if you want a phenomenal singleplayer experience, but don't expect to do every achievement since some require you to play a dead multiplayer gamemode you need multiple friends to even access."

I played few hours of either TR2 or TR3 on Sony PlayStation. I cannot make comparisons to previous games in the series for this reason alone. Tomb Raider (2013) caught my eye because of the high praise and low price. In short the game is 3rd person shooter with climbing, light puzzles and strong story. If you don't like these features, don't buy it, otherwise it's worth the money.First of all I must praise the game for being very well done. The graphics are great and the game works like a charm. I encountered total of one (1) minor glitch during my gameplay that lasted 19 hours. The gameplay is solid although it becomes a somewhat boring in the end. Sounds of the environment, characters, guns are all on par with the rest of the product. Music I can describe as lacking, since I cannot remember a single moment from any of the songs played in game, not even the main menu theme if there was one. These things in mind  we can move to the reason why I wanted to write my own review. Tomb Raider tells us a story about female tomb robber Lara Croft who gets stranded on an island with some of his friends and co-workers. She gets lost from her friends and they all soon meet other shipwrecked people who attack and capture them. Croft must then begin the long journey to free her friends and eventually try to escape the island that holds a dark secret.Essentially the story is about her growing up to be like her father. What I understood from the game, her father was some sort of an adventurer or a tomb raider alike. Though Lara in the early part of the game seems like your average city girl, she quickly learns to survive in the hostile environment of the island and tackle with its inhabitants. The game begins with a chapter where she learns to hunt, make fire and avoid enemies. A couple of chapters later she's shooting mercenaries left and right and suddenly doesn't have to care about hunger, cold or anything she just learned to avoid. She then starts immediately adopting new guns and gadgets with no trouble.The major problem with the story is that the gameplay itself doesn't seem to relate to it. The conversations with other characters, Lara's monologues and some cutscenes portraits her slowly growing up to become an survivor, yet the actual gameplay throws show much against her in the first few hours that there isn't much to improve later on. About midway through the game she has escaped from atleast three exploding/burning buildings, killed about a hundred mercenaries and climbed to the highest point of the island. After that she just survives those things again and again. And the game does exactly that, more enemies, more exploding buildings and more climbing. There's just too much of it and because of this the game loses its novelty already in the midway of the game. Thanks to varied level design, the game manages to stay mostly refreshing right until the last chapters. The story also manages to stay within its darker shades and there's no comic relief characters or over-the-top sidemissions to alter the atmosphere.Lastly I must mention that this game constantly reminded me of Far Cry 3. And because of comparison that I would consider the problem mentioned above only a minor flaw. While the games have quite many similarities in their setting, gameplay and story, Tomb Raider does it all a lot better. Tomb Raiders story is the center of the game and while the gameplay diverges a bit from it, the game in its entirety manages to stay credible compared to other video games. It could be a bit better but it could be a whole lot worse. Like exploding monkeys and killing alligators to make bigger wallet kind of worse."

The intro has Lara getting captured and using fire to escape from her bonds only to be impaled. Then you use a QTE to rip out the debris from her wound and then as the screen fades you have to search frantically for bandages to heal her up. Then as you escape the caves you are handed a bow, a bow that you need to hunt the animals in order to... level up? Well that’s strange, but at least you have to make choices when you craft it... or not really because there are no consequences when you upgrade, so you just grab everything. At least they don't just magically transform your weapon out of nowhere or have characters just hand you a military grade arsenal, thus taking away the weight of all the work you went through upgrading to this point before being handed said arsenal. Actually they do exactly that.Well at least they are taking narrative seriously because Lara cries her eyes out as she murders her first attacker... but then the next second she starts building up her resume to be in the next Hotline Miami as she brutally kills everyone without a second thought and there is pretty much a whole tree dedicated to killing things brutally to get bonus experience so that you can unlock more brutal ills to get more experience, and that's just a lazy reward system.So for all the grit, realism and seriousness the game seems to put out, Tomb Raider is an average action game at its core. All of the world building the game attempts to set up is taken away quickly as the game rushes to reassure players that they are dealing with familiar mechanics: kill whatever and you make yourself and weapons better. The game also failed to mention that Lara Croft was actually an escaped Weapon X subject, because her super-human healing factor is obviously more important than giving the game some stakes, consequence, or consistency. The game's crafting system is less of a survival element and more of a light RPG element. The salvage you find from bodies and boxes just allow you to easily upgrade your weapons in all number of ways (rather than needing specific material) without any choice or drawback, and she goes from vulnerable, survivor to Rambo faster than she probably snaps a neck.The setting of Tomb Raider houses very little tombs, but a lot shoddy craftsman ship and decent staged events. The game looks open world, but really it drags you around from one set piece to another, often closing off paths, and then allows you to go back to certain sections to hunt down collectibles that don’t really add much unless you are into antiquing or mildly interested in history with a distaste for film, books, research,  or museums. It’s a formula that works, that people love: climb a thing that’s falling apart, dangle around stuff precariously, escape explosions/debris/fire/all manner of things by an inch because the script says so and now maybe rolling through rapid water can be added to the mix. It’s alright, it’s not broken, but after a few generations of video games, you think we could come up with a way to really up the spectacle or, better yet, let the players keep more agency as they are caught in these crazy situations. Tomb Raider really has a “been there done that” feeling.The storytelling of the game is basic. Lara's character is really just summed up by everyone reminding her she is a Croft and super cool. It also seems like there was some sort of board meeting where they decided to make 90% of Lara’s emotional expressions tears. It’s supposed to be a shortcut for us to care about her, but a genuine connection would have been far more rewarding. Instead of showing Lara cry all the time over people we don’t care about, or situations we can’t relate to, why not create an interesting protagonist? Yes, she is going through lots of stress and loss, but I can hardly feel that for her because I am not connected to her or the rest of the cast. Most of the motivations and traits of the characters are told rather than shown (“I secretly love you” “I am your best friend” “I don’t trust you”), which is lazy, but it is enough to make people that this is groundbreaking. I won't spoil the main plot but it goes from some serious murderer/kidnapping stuff to something rather silly. Mostly the story just dragged about and I forgot who I was trying to kill or save pretty early in the game. No one was really memorable, except Lara Croft, because you can’t wade through the corpses of your enemies for more than 10 minutes before someone reminds you about being a Croft. So after all of this, why is it recommended? Well first of all the credits assure me that the developers were sincere in making the best game they could, and I both appreciate and believe that: people need to eat, and they could have done a worse job. Also, Steam only has two categories of reviews, and I don't think too many people are as critical as I am about video games. There is an over-reliance on quick time events, gratuitous violence that totally contradicts prior character traits (which are in short supply already), most of the gameplay is a string of set pieces with many movements being small scenes that take away player control, and there is a significant lack of tombs to raid, but it’s not boring. It’s a great looking game with lots of explosions and crumbling sets, and it’s easy to pick up and play. If you can just accept that the game is shallow, it's fun enough so you will probably finish it before you realize it was nothing new or fantastic. The afterthought-level multiplayer is really just shoehorned in though, like they were forced to put it in at the last minute."

Spent most of it in a deep state of anxiety over Lara's safety - holy hell she really goes through the meat grinder in this one to the point of making me physically wince a bunch of times.It's a little strange really, tonally the game goes from her being an unstoppable mass murdering psychopath to you just really wanting to give her some hot cocoa and biscuits, but that doesn't really matter at all because I was invested and totally along for the ride anyway.The combat is fantastic, and the exploration is a lot of fun. Levels like the shanty town and shipwreck beach remain legit breathtaking even almost 10 years on from release, a true testament to the games overall visual direction.I just wish it had more environmental puzzles, but I guess they've decided to lean more towards the action side.

Both problems were fixed by reloading the checkpoint.The graphics were nice, being good even though the game came out in 2013. The soundtrack was great and fit into the game world well.The story was interesting and unique leaving me hungry for the sequel. The game progresses as fast as you do and no matter where you are in the story you can fast travel at the base camps, except whenand.This is the first Tomb Raider game I have ever played and I love it.

Crystal Dynamics decided to take that route with their version of Tomb Raider. It is a great third-person shooter, which contains climbing and puzzle solving as main gameplay elements, just like in Uncharted. Naughty Dog tried to make Uncharted like Tomb Raider, and now Crystal Dynamics tried to make Tomb Raider like Uncharted. Quite ironic. And it works, in many ways better than Uncharted.The game has a fairly large ""open-world"" (if you can say that) with tons of collectables and side-tombs that you can raid (no pun intended), whereas Uncharted was a very linear game. Tomb Raider also has skill system and crafting, but there's only a few weapons available in the game. The lack of weapons works with the survival aspect of the game, but the overload of ammo doesn't. There's ammo around every corner more than you can carry. It takes away from the experience, and even in harder difficulties this major problem isn't fixed. Another thing I found quite irritating were the quicktime events, which takes away from the immersion of the game. Every time you find a collectable you are forced to punch a button repeatedly. I didn't mind it too much however. The overload of enemies is also pretty damn stupid, but it makes for good gameplay, and the AI isn't very smart either. Anyways, the game is superb, and with the cheap price of the -75% sale makes it well worth your time and dosh.8/10"

I have too many great memories of wonderful moments of gaming thanks to this series, and those moments definitely allow me to forgive the varying issues one comes across when trekking through Lara's back catalogue.However, 2013's Tomb Raider reboot takes the series to places that even I, as a rabid Lara fan, could never have imagined.Quite simply this is a game that will provide you with an experience you won't soon forget. Not only is it technically masterful and gorgeous to view, but the 'new Lara' is someone you will quickly form a deep and lasting affinity with.No punches are pulled here; she is treated brutally and without sanction. The environment alone pushes her thresholds of tolerance to the very limit, let alone the foes she will ultimately face.There are a few QuickTime events that may make you think it's one of 'those' games, but have faith that the few games of Simon Says that do occur are are small and are a worthy price to pay for the emotional adventure ride you will be pulled through.Whether on sale or no, this game is worth the price of admission, and is an experience that all gaming affectionados should list on their gamer cards by default.Recommended without any doubt."

If you want a more immersive and polished experience then you need to know these main faults:Nothing is realistic. Flammable objects burn down in seconds, animals have terrible AI, and the landscapes all have the same obvious signposting for jumping, climbing and grappling. This isolated island is absolutely filled with skeletons, still-lit lamps, and wreckage. Many of the baddies have bows, for some bizarre reason, and ammunition litters the map in a quite preposterous abundance. Curious string bags can be found regularly and they must be set on fire in order to get the ‘salvage’ from within. Why these bags couldn’t just be opened with our Lara-hands is beyond me.‘Salvage’ is a form of currency used to, somehow, upgrade your weaponry and it can also be found in random crates and, um, in animals. Yes folks, that means you can innocent deer and use the body parts to make a better receiver for your automatic rifle. How? Don’t know.The game is over engineered in many parts. The shaky camerawork is unrelentingly present, even in cut-scenes and there is simply too much freaking weather on some maps. The camp menu, which you’ll be using a lot, throws pointlessly exaggerated animations and sound effects at you every time you navigate through it, and I hated it. This menu is where you spend your experience to choose new skills and where you spend your salvage to upgrade your weaponry, and there aren’t many options in it but every damn one of them requires several grades of navigation. Please just show me all the skills on one page and all the weapon upgrades on another without the special effects and flashes and booms and swooshes and beeps—it’s like Michael Bay directed the flipping thing.Strangely, I have seen other reviewers praise the characterisation and the story but I warn against believing them: Lara has no arc at all, starting out as a tough cookie who says she hasn’t a clue but then adventures away with ease; and ending as a tough cookie who, well, adventured away with ease. It’s all tell with opposite show. The story, too, is pretty silly (the big, bad cult leader wants a woman to sacrifice in order to revive a goddess, the protagonist fights through endless lesser baddies to save the woman who we barely know) and it is entirely superfluous with minor, pointless exposition happening through books you can find on the map. None of this really matters, none of it affects the gameplay, and we don’t care enough about the lesser characters to feel any bond to them. Lara could have shot the antagonist many times but the game decided, for no reason, that his death must be saved for the final (disappointingly easy) showdown. Only someone that thinks action flicks are deep or who skips the cut-scenes in RDR2 or The Last of Us could admire the writing in Tomb Raider.But there are positives: it is a decent game with graphics that still look good in 2022 and the weaponry is fun to use. One thing that I really appreciated was Lara Croft’s appearance. While she is still an attractive representation of the traditionally female form, she is no longer overtly sexually portrayed and there are menu options to have her clothed in more practical attire than the skimpy vest she begins with. She is well acted too, with some genuinely memorable lines.If you want some mindless fun then get the game; if you want a cerebral or powerful gaming experience then look elsewhere."

After seeing this during the Autumn Sale, I decided that I would pick this game up to pass the time until the next (and hopefully better) sale. However, I was blown away that I regret not buying this earlier.The graphics impressed me for nearly the whole game. I have exactly 100 screenshots in 12 hours of gameplay. Almost everything to it looks beautiful. However, at times, I feel like the characters (or more specifically Lara Croft) looked lazily done and the textures looked awful. But, like I said, 100 screenshots in 12 hours. Can't remember when I last took 100 with a game like this. The environments looked beautiful the whole way through, regardless of how bad Lara looked at times. Actually, this game was a nominee for the ""Best Graphics"" award for my blog, but it didn't win. The gameplay is very smooth and the difficulty is relatively fair. The switch between stealth and shooter gameplay mixes well and switching from one to the other is a smooth, flawless transition. The game is somewhat open world, but you won't do much post-game unless you're a completionist. The bow was my personal favorite weapon and using it was a blast. All the weapons share a purpose so you'll use them all in different situations. But, as much as I enjoy the gameplay, I did find a few flaws. One thing is that if you want to buy this game for multiplayer, don't. It's dead. Another issue I had is that hunting is pointless in the game, all it really does is give you some XP to level up. The third flaw I had wih the game was that the QTEs are really unfair. Sometimes, no matter how much you mash that button, the game says you failed the QTE. This is especially annoying with the water scenes, where you're sliding down a waterfall and you have to shoot barricades and use the slow controls to dodge all the spikes so you don't get impaled. Other times, when you have to hit a certain button, they don't reveal that button until the very last second, and by the time you realize it, you're dead. They really need to be fixed. But other than those issues, I was very impressed with the gameplay.Lara Croft's origin story is pretty intense the whole way through. After the ship she was on crashed on an island, she tried to look for a way out and also had to rescue her friend Sam. Although the whole ""save your friend/family/etc"" thing is very cliché, Tomb Raider does this right. The whole journey keeps you hooked, until the rescue mission finally comes. After that, then you'll learn that the game is ""just getting started,"" and from that point on, the last few parts of the game really drag on. First you waste your time killing some members of a cult, then you go find a samurai and the antagonist's real plan, then you have to go rescue Sam again. Instead of this part of the story being thrilling, I nearly fell asleep. However, the ""final boss""  was a pretty crazy fight. Other than the really draggy final part of the game, I'm happy with the dark, gritty origin tale of a legendary video game character.I did some research, and realized the composer of Tomb Raider's soundtrack is Jason Graves, who is known for composing the Dead Space series' soundtrack. That being said, you can expect that the songs sound more creepy than intense. Because of this, the themes had trouble matching and so I wasn't very happy with the soundtrack. But, the voice acting was amazing, especially Lara Croft and Roth (Camilla Luddington and Robin Atkin Downes respectively) who really give the characters personality. Overall, the music needs work but I enjoy the voice acting.The game lacks replayability mostly, and at least 14-15 hours is needed to 100% the game. Plus, the multiplayer is dead. Don't get this game if you want a game to waste your life with.Tomb Raider has a lot of flaws, that's for sure. However, the experience was still intense, thrilling, and interesting almost the whole way through. If you loved the older Tomb Raiders or just adventure games in general, this game's a definite must-buy.Graphics- 9.0/10Gameplay- 7.5/10Story- 8.5/10Audio- 7.0/10Replayability- 4.0/10+Intense, gritty origin story+Beautiful environments+Amazing voice acting+Cool ""final boss""+Great graphics-Dead multiplayer-Music doesn't match-Unfair QTEs-Textures look messy at times"

I generally avoided any game that had heavy reliance on platforming and asked players to pay close attention to environments for hints, well because based on my experience I'm pretty terrible at both, but thanks to the dumbed-down mechanics from the reboot, which were significantly easier to manage than my previous TR game experiences I was able to adapat and actually enjoy the game.Rating(s):Visuals & Graphics: 10/10Amazing. The game is the eye candy and so is the main character. I prefer this new rendition of Lara over the ones in the old games. Cleaner look, doesn't look like a ♥♥♥-dump. Some times looking simple just makes things more beautiful. The environment looks amazing as well. You need to be running the game with a high-spec rig to fully appreciate how the game looks.Music and Sound: 7/10It's not bad... per se, but not exactly great either. It's forgettable at best, but in no way bad.Plot/Story/Characters: 9/10+ Plot is strong and solid. Premises are acceptable (minus the over the top supernatural stuff) everything else is realistic and believable. Characters actually die. :D+ The game does well introducing the character to players. As an origin story, it fulfills its purpose well+ Lara is lovable :D- Cheesy lines that make you wanna punch the characters at times. Gameplay and Mechanics: 8/10I have mentioned on numerous occassions in my other reviews that I  it when corporate decide to dumb-down the mechanics of their games to make it less grindy/less difficult/more casual feel so that they can attract more players. This is probably one of the few instances that I will contradict myself and say: ""I'm happy that they did."" Tomb Raider games unlike most Open World RPGs give heavy emphasis on platforming and paying close attention to your environments. It usually didn't have quest markers to guide you to the right path, unlike the usual go to point B from point A to update your quest progress or kill this certain monster. Tomb Raider 2013 implements this new instinct mechanic that auto guides you and serves as your quest/mission marker. So you don't waste your time finding your way to your next progress point. I would actually play more games from this genre if I wasn't so damned lost all the damned time... but Tomb Raider '13 was very helpful enough to guide newbie players like me into the fray. It really made me appreciate this game a whole lot better."

Did not play multiplayer since everyone says that it sucks.While the game isn't that bad and i did enjoy the story - there are some questionable design choices that i didn't like. First of all the game is too easy - AI is dumb beyond any words and Lara is simply too much of a bullet sponge even on a hard difficulty. Then there are puzzles which are way too oversimplified so if you ever thought that Guardian of Light or Temple of Osiris are easy - this one doesn't require any effort or thought at all and the hardest puzzles usually involve a bit of timing and just one or two tries.Secondly i disliked how Lara's character was treated - it wasn't necessary to beat her, shoot her, stab her several times, almost rape her, beat her again, burn her, drag her through poop and then blood, drop her from heights over and over again, and again beat her. The whole thing just felt over the top, and at some point - laughably unrealistic. There's so much punishment a person can take and it went over that limit at least 10 times. It's also weird how her friends keep dying light fruit flies while she keeps moping around one moment and the next one she takes out 30 armed thugs with a bow and a grenade launcher. How about some consistency for a change?Also - what was the point of including other characters anyway? Just so the can die over the course of the game? Do i even know those people? Despite collecting their letters - i've no idea who they are and why should i care about them or why they sacrificed themselves like muppets over and over again.Lastly i am tired of how all ""action-adventure"" games have lately been focusing on climbing, using ropes, towers and collecting crap. You can be excused for confusing this game with Far Cry 3 since they share so much similarities - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ island, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ islanders, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ animals, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ collectibles, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ climbing. Im just so... soooooo over those mechanics. Please for the love of god - someone think of something else already! Not to mention that the whole hunting aspect felt completely unnecessary and arbitrary - you kill an animal once to feed Lara during story and... that's it - you don't get anything out of animals besides scrap and there's no point of wasting your time on ""hunting"" since you can get more than enough scrap from crates, collectibles and enemies anyway.Overall i had issues associating this game with Tomb Raider and it felt more like a generic shooter with climbing and collectibles than a new game or a reboot of the series. It almost felts like the developers had to cut corners with hunting, collecting and character development which felt really subpar while focusing on graphics, scenery and story which seemed really nice. Perhaps they should not have wasted the time on useless multiplayer and polished everything else instead?In the end i was about 50/50 split on voting it down or up, but despite the fact that this is a barely Tomb Raider game - i've decided to follow with nostalgia and recommend it. At the very least you get 15-20 hours of a decent story for a low price (if you get it on sale) and there are much worse games out there for that amount of money."

I restarted my system and it worked fine.There is more dialogue than previous titles. It still has a lot of the Tomb Raider spirit. There are puzzles. You do find secret tombs. It has the spooky feeling. The historical aspect is there, with just the right amount of other worldly shenanigans going on. In this game there is a level up progression system. I found it satisfying. I invested in the Bow/Pistol mostly, but by the end of the game I was able to fully invest in Melee comabat and the rifle as well. I prefer being able to invest in different skill trees. It allowed the game to remain fresh by experimenting with different styles of combat. You can hunt as well to get experience.

There are still quick-time events throughout the game, but they never really feel out of place and allow you to feel somewhat like you're taking part in an action movie. There's still plenty of climbing to do as with the older TR games, but now there's also a focus on using equipment to gain access to certain areas, which can be rather frustrating if you don't know that certain equipment exists and will be obtained later. The only other gripe I had with this game was that you get about the island searching for relics which you keep (that makes sense, just like the old TR games), but then there are other things you search for like religious artifacts that you are supposed to destroy. If Indiana Jones said ""It belongs in a museum!"" to Lara Croft, she would answer ""No, it belongs in a fire!"" - which reminds me, be prepared to solve many puzzles by setting fire to EVERYTHING. It may sound as though I'm completely rubbishing this game, but in spite of all the above comments TR is immeasurably fun to play and well worth buying. It doesn't feel as punishing as the older TR games as you don't have to worry about your health so much (it has that Portal style health bar where things go red and it's bad, but you get to safety and the redness goes away. Phew!), which means you don't have to worry too much about taking a little fall damage but there are still plenty of chances to die and be impaled on a giant tree branch or something. Anyway, 9 out of 10, would raid."

There's always the sense that it should be a bit more open, and that you should be freely roaming around the map. While it is somewhat the case that it is open world, don't mistake this for being that 100%. Throughout the campaign there are numerous quick time events that have you mashing one key or another in order to do an action. This is somewhat disappointing, though I personally do not believe that it completely destroys the experience. The gameplay is rather fun, and the controls work well using keyboard and mouse. A controller is not necessary unless you prefer that input method. I personally prefered keyboard and mouse because it allowed me to have better aim. Once again though, this is a completely personally choice. The game works well regardless. Visually the game is gorgeous. The character models are well-designed, and the island vistas are a sight to behold. From the shores of the beach to the ruined temples, every part of the game is attractive to the eye(well, except the parts that are supposed to be grotesque). There are not any game-breaking or glaring flaws in the game graphically that I can see. As far as the story goes, I won't spoil anything, but it is rather entertaining. It's a solidly written story that has some nice emotional moments and well-witten characters. I personally found nothing to be wrong with the way the story was written, and I can't see anyone else having any major complaints.Despite the fact that the game does not feel as open world as one would think it would be, I still had a lot of fun playing thorugh Tomb Raider. It's the first Tomb Raider game I have ever played, and I am not looking forward to playing the others."

In comparison to all of those, boy, did this game feel different! I would consider myself a passing fan of Tomb Raider as a series, and to be honest, I groaned inwardly when the “gritty reboot” was announced. I never intended to play it at all, but ended up impulse buying it over this past summer sale  -- and I’m so glad I did.I found the technicals of this game to be amazing. It’s incredibly well-built, and the actual gameplay (in terms of how the character controls) seems nearly flawless. I liked all the weapons, but the bow is especially versatile and fun to bring into battle. The enemy AI often leaves a lot to be desired - the enemies are mostly just really stupid - but I don’t think I could claim to have played any games that do it better. Maybe I’m just sheltered. In any case, I was never bored or disappointed by the frequent gunfights, although they weren’t always appropriately challenging. I liked going for the stealth approach, too - it was surprising how well stealth worked at times, though at other times, frustrating how easy it was to remain undetected (again, lame AI).The environment design and exploration aspects are really great as well. Exploring and collecting rarely felt like a chore, which was a little surprising considering just how much there is to collect. (I did end up getting the last Previous Inhabitants flag and the last Sun Killer ornament only after looking up their locations in a guide. The flag, in particular, felt really cheaply hidden compared to all of the other challenges in the game.)From an artistic standpoint, the environments are immersive and believable. Beautiful graphics and excellent sound design abound in this game. Quite early on, Lara was standing in a rainstorm with lightning flashes and thunder (I had headphones on), and I was just blown away by the distinct feeling of actually  in that virtual world. The darkness and detail in the various tombs made me feel legitimately eerie and claustrophobic in quite a few instances. The action-oriented set pieces, while silly in terms of gameplay, were appropriately impressive. I particularly liked the escape from the  after rescuing .Looking back over last year’s Tomb Raider OT, I’ve read complaints about the lack of tombs/puzzles, the cliche characters, and the flat story. I’ll address those objections below:First, I understand the issues with the tombs. Each one (of maybe 7 optional tombs, and 2-3 required ones) is basically a single-room puzzle that I was able to solve as easily as if I were playing with a baby’s shape sorter. At the same time, I believe that a high quantity of challenging (or time-consuming) puzzles really tends to kill the replay value of a game, because who wants to go through the motions of redoing puzzles that they’ve already solved in a previous run? Boring. So I’m of two opinions about the whole thing, but sort of favoring the way this reboot treats its tombs - short and simple. I do wish there had been more of them, in any case. My favorite tomb in the game? That would have to be the Flooded Vault.Second, yeah - when viewed objectively, the story wasn’t exceptional, and the characters were mostly nothing more than stereotypical devices to deliver predictable plot points. But in the context of being the Tomb Raider origin story, I think it served its purpose just fine, with no bigger problems than any other video game story. That’s not to say it gets a total pass, just that the criticisms were way overblown. One endgame event that I found pretty unbelievable was Whitman’s . I mean, I know the guy was , but do you really expect me to believe that he spent all that time  (his words) and never once overheard those thugs talking about how ? They wouldn’t shut up about it whenever Lara was sneaking around, I know.Anyway, the one major disappointment with Tomb Raider in my mind ended up being . All the same, I consider that a small objection in the grand scheme of the game as a whole, and I did appreciate the  at the end there.My ultimate conclusion? If this reboot is going to be the new standard for Tomb Raider games, I don’t need the old standard anymore. I’m sure the classics will still be fun and all, but the notion of a Tomb Raider whose content is predominantly puzzle-oriented is an idea that’s ready for retirement. I’ve also decided that Attitude Lara was a fine enough concept back in the ‘90s, when every new mascot was an attitude mascot, but Survivor Lara is a lot more believable as a character - and quite honestly, much easier to build a story around, if we’re still going for stories in games these days (I don’t consider them necessary, but whatever).Greatly looking forward to the sequel."

But as the game progressed it became clear that Tomb Raider was not a mere carbon copy offering a more linear story, a much more subtle RPG framework, and trademark gameplay elements from the early Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia games.The evolutionary story of Lara Croft is without a doubt the highlight of the game and is superbly presented, however it's hard not to give praise to the amazing graphics as well showcasing some incredible shadows, lighting, and fire effects. I seriously could not stop playing this game once I started, taking only 2 days to complete my 15 hour campaign--it was just that good.Some of the less stellar aspects of the game include the RPG skills. While they were helpful in moving the evolution of Lara Croft along, they really didn't feel all that unique or useful and in many cases I was forced to spend points on useless skills simply to unlock the next tier. The weapons, other than the bow, were lackluster and the upgrades just felt common. I also don't like interactive cutscenes in video games, and while this latest Tomb Raider hasn't changed my position, this is the best implementation I have seen so far.Overall, Tomb Raider turned out to be a highly enjoyable adventure giving a much need reboot to this franchise. Although if you're looking for that dual wielding Barbie badass, keep on looking."

Her colleagues are probably all dead, Lara is injured and alone on this island. In the middle of nowhere…Unlike usual with Tomb Raider, exploring burial chambers or caves is not quite as important in the reboot, even if you can still climb around and discover secrets outside of the action levels in extensive areas. But if you keep your eyes open as usual, you can find USB sticks, various artefacts and maps that show hidden extras, treasure chests or flotsam.Tomb Raider now offers a talent system and weapon upgrades, and all you need is enough debris, experience points, and as so often, a campfire.As soon as you sit down at one of these campfires, the upgrade menu opens where you can exchange the points you have earned so far for new skills or health improvements and also buy weapon upgrades. It is also possible to fast travel to areas you have already visited from here. This saves you a lot of time if you have missed something, such as a burial chamber.However, the hidden burial chambers cannot always be explored immediately, as often a piece of equipment is missing that is only obtained in the course of the game. But even if you can open a burial chamber, the secret inside is not always that easy to reveal. You often have to find the right switch combinations, cleverly climb to other levels or balance platforms in order to uncover well-kept secrets.At the start of the game, the still quite “whining brat” who often complains about how bad everything is right now, quickly mutates into a killer bride who does more than just skilfully. Lara automatically seeks cover as soon as she can and shoots at the unclever AI from behind cover. Unfortunately, this means that Lara's transformation is somewhat lost in the actual story in combat and explosion overkill. As the saying goes, ""and that's where the dog is buried"". Action is by no means bad, absolutely not, especially not in such a spectacularly staged cover shooter. However, without all these explorations through dark caves in an atmospheric world, a Tomb Raider is somehow still not a Tomb Raider as you know it.However, the strengths and weaknesses are more or less balanced and if you don't really like tomb robber activities and can do without other things like challenging jump passages, you will definitely be rewarded with a pretty good action spectacle. This is probably mainly due to the last third of the game, in which the demands, the puzzles and the tension increase noticeably and Lara just seems a bit more authentic as an archaeologist. Nevertheless, I would have wished for more exploration, less collecting mania and more survival.✅ living jungle✅ great optics and light effects✅ smooth animation✅ good mix of action, puzzles and exploration✅ Different levels of difficulty✅ Outfit and weapon optimization✅ Side missions✅ fantastic sound✅ New Game+❌Tutorial overlays cannot be switched off❌Flashlight cannot be used manually❌Backtracking for collectors❌too few survival aspects❌weak AI❌too much killer bride❌redundant skill system"

I played 1,2 and 3 and found them fairly mediocre to be honest. I then paid no attention to the series at all until 2013 when the commercial's for the reboot started hitting tv. The commercial was enough to peak my interest as it look alot more realistic and dark. I decided to take the plunge when it came out and I was not dissapointed. I am looking forward to ROTT very much.The story and characters are very good. Starts of very realistic and gritty, almost like a survival/thriller start. The story does develop more into fantasty and mystacism but its done in such a way that its enjoyable and is done right. The gunplay is fun and the ability to upgrade weapons and craft things is a really nice touch. The puzzles in tomb's and amount of collectables is great fun if you like me love collecting and 100% things.The Multiplayer is an odd one. I'm sure some people will absolutley love it but to me it seems unnecessary, the same way that other great single player games recieved what seems like a ""forced"" multiplayer mode for the sake of it being there. Games like Batman Arkham Origins and to an extent Max Payne 3. The MP can provide some fun, for me it was about an hour then I realised it was more of a chore than fun. So I grinded out the MP achievments and never went back.A truly fantastic title with a meh MP (Hence why it didnt make it back to ROTT), I am glad I overcame my doubt and went for it. This is one of the best reboots I have seen in a long time and would recommend it to anyone."

Will you want to play this or go back to the originals ?Tomb Raider follows on Lara Croft as she is on an expedition to find an Island called Yamatai which was once ruled by queen Himiko. The ship crashes on the island which is populated by crazy survivors who want the entire crew dead. So it's up to you to find a way of the island. To begin this review I want to express something about this game. When it was first announced, I wasn't a major fan of the gritty and violent tone of the game. I felt that taking it too far would take away the charm the original game had. But after I had the chance to sit down and play it, I feel mixed on the game.Now I'm not calling the game bad, I quite enjoyed it and found myself on the edge of my seat in some moments. But this game suffers from major problems which I hope will be fixed in the upcoming title Rise of the Tomb Raider. The story is this games weakest point. You're supposed to root for the characters to get of the island and you want them all to stay alive. But apart from Lara i didn't care for anyone. All characters felt one dimensional and it was really hard to actually like any of them. You have stereotypical characters like the nerd, the tough old guy, the mentor and stuff like that. Not to mention the entire plot is incredibly predictable and you can see who dies from a mile away.The gameplay is fun, but it feels more like a cover shooter than a mixture of both Adventure and Shooter game which the original game was. I felt the game focused way too much on the combat and not so much on puzzles. The game does have optional tombs that have puzzles in them so you can get the treasure, but it's incredibly easy to miss these tombs. The game is also riddled with bugs and glitches. One time the game crashed because of an explosion I caused. Enemies phase through walls and you can glitch through walls too. Graphics and the environments look absolutely beautiful and it's one of the best looking games I have ever played.  Maxed out it's one pretty looking game.The optional tombs are probably the best thing about this game. I loved the puzzles and the whole figuring out stuff even though it was incredibly easy. Boss fights are another problem with this game. Most boss fights consist on how many shotgun shells can you blast in the shotgun face. Apart from one cool boss which took place up on a lift that's falling apart there's not much variety.The entire game took me 10 hours to finish everything expect find all the collectibles. The game is overall pretty easy so you shouldn't have much trouble finishing it. In the end this game tries too hard to be Uncharted with it's over the top action sequences. The game is still a really fun game and I would say it's worth buying just to play through it once. But expect more of an third person shooter and not a Puzzle driven adventure game with shooting involved. Final Rating:7/10 - Worth Checking out  If you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page  - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

This game does not deserve the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" Score it gets and it baffles me that it somehow tricked anyone into believing it was good. The writing in this game is absolutely mediocre, it fails to make you care about any single character death, justifies poorly every single scene, and completely wastes all the effort that was put into making this game as cinematic as possible. And this effort into making the game cinematic then DETRACTS from the game when you're playing it, because late game really wants to be a blockbuster action movie, so it forces waves of the same goons you've been fighting throughout the game on you, no longer giving you the stealth option that was actually the fun part in the early game, because stealth FELT like Lara was a person that could die, and not a supersoldier on meth gunning throughout Generic Game Setting Far Cry Did Better, Japan. Also, Boss Battles Bad, because cinematics get in the way of gameplay, and then go away at the moments that should make the fight satisfying. I have so much more to complain about, but there is one thing that rings true on all the positive reviews this game had:  “A master class in AAA game development.”– CraveOnlineThis game has every sin in the book for AAA game development, it may trick you into thinking it's good because it's pretty, but it's devoid of a soul and you can spend your money elsewhere for a better use of your time."

Well in comparison to the over-produced Angelina Jolie debacles, any competently produced movie offering would look favorable but what I'm trying to say is that Tomb Raider is one of those AAA games that are incredibly well-made but without any hooks that would constitute a must-buy. As gripping as Story Mode gets, from a game design standpoint you're on a linear path with QTE challenges, scripted non-repeatable enemy encounters and a few puzzles so easily solved they're barely worth mentioning. It's an interactive movie where you are the hero.You are Lara Croft and you are fighting for your survival. You can't actually starve to death or catch your death in cold and you regenerate from bullet wounds after a short period of time so in this case ""survival"" means tons of enemies out to get you and all you have are a bow and arrow. And a pistol. And an axe, a combat shotgun and a machine gun. Kinda undermines the whole point, really. Combat is actually the bees-knees with flawless controls in a cover-and-shoot environment against determined foes out to plant a machete into your skull. Your melee options are rather lacking, leading to tense gameplay where one fights desperately for every inch of personal space against maniacs with firebombs trying to flush you out from cover.I guess the ""hook"" of this game is that it's a Tomb Raider game. Tomb Raider fans will buy this product sight unseen and call it a shining beacon in the franchise. That's fair, but what about the rest of us? Well if you're like me and you barely touched the series, Tomb Raider is certainly more accessible than any of the previous Playstation installments. It's downright easy, even. The reboot mixes realism and fantasy in equal measures so as to build genuine dread at your desperate plight while still being respectful to the setting established throughout previous Tomb Raider titles.Needless to say, Tomb Raider multiplayer is dead in 2016. I tried it, had a nice 15 minute conversation in the lobby then wrote that part of the game off. I cannot recommend this game at full price but I couldn't endorse simply watching a Let's Play either. And because story is such a central part of the product, every scene that you witness prior to play takes away some of the value from your purchase. Price it as you would a blockbuster, with popcorn. I'd like to thank Tonton Mori for the giveaway as I finished this during a long three day weekend and I cannot say that I regret the experience.Finally, a word needs to be said about the gruesome death scenes. Those squeamish over violence against women should probably give this title a pass.  is required viewing for anyone thinking about purchasing this game."

I've not played the previous games but I absolutely loved all the characters and the story arch. The Stormguard were cool as hell, Lara gets a really cool start to her character arch and development and it's a reasonable one too. I mean it implies that she's a college student by the time this journey starts so it makes sense that this is shown to be a traumatic experience in Rise of the Tomb Raider. And her distress over this game, all the way til Shadow of the Tomb Raider, was really well handled.The character gets cooler, and even scarier over the course of the events of all the games and it's so interesting and genuinely fun to watch it happen. I love being part of that. TL;DR if you wanna make yourself enjoy something just for the hell of it I recommend it, and I genuinely believe they did a good job and the story was well done."

She is isolated from her crew and faces off against hundreds of foes wishing her harm. Players are tasked to shoot, scale, and zipline their way off the island. Story/CharactersSo an ancient city, long since lost, is the goal of the expedition. Others have shipwrecked on the same island and become part of a cult that doesn't take kindly to those that oppose them. That's pretty much it for the story. Croft is on her first big expedition and wasn't expecting to take on hordes of enemies in bloody gun battles. The game does try to establish that the mass amounts of killing are not to lara's tastes, but a line about not liking how easy it is to kill someone doesn't stack up well against the pile of bodies in her wake. This is particularly noticeable with brutal finishes (though Lara can receive these gruesome deaths as well). She gets seperated from her crew mates at the start and spends much of the game on her own. This is a bit of an issue in that the player never really learns much about her friends and colleagues so it's tough to really care about any of them. GameplayThe game has a heavy dose of 3rd person shooting with some parkour and zip lines to get about. Lara starts off with a bow, but picks up a handful of other weapons along the way. Killing enemies and completing challenges gives experience towards skill points to upgrade lara while salvaged parts from looting can buy upgrades for weapons. While the game hints at a stealth approach (having a bow, and guards calling in reinforcements) because killing enemies grants experience, it compels the player to be loud. There is also a dodge mechanic were lara shuffles on the ground, though back to back activates cause her to roll. It feels pretty clunky and isn't always effective at reducing enemy accuracy. I didn't find the combat overly difficult (though the AI is often aggressive and wall hacks) so players won't get frustrated getting stuck in the same combat repeatedly, but those looking for a more challenging game should look elsewhere. When not in combat, Lara can zipline and scale about the various regions. These skills are also used for optional crypts that require some puzzle solving. There are fires that allow quick traveling, sometimes. It's actually odd that all the fires don't allow fast travel. Players only backtrack to find collectables, and since lara can't run, it becomes a chore trying to make one way through the same zipline fields or scaling walls to complete collections. Lara also has detective (i guess, archeologist) vision that causes intractable elements to flash gold.Misc.The various areas of the map are pretty well designed. It's easy to know where the game wants the player to go, but it disguises the pathway to make it not feel like walking down a long corridor. I didn't find the music noticeable (maybe had volume to low) but it also wasn't annoying. I didn't experience any crashes and only a few minor bugs.OverallTomb Raider is a competently made game. There aren't really any highs, but it doesn't have a lot of lows either. I don't think players miss anything special if they don't play this game, but it won't make you rage or hate yourself for playing it."

Story is focused on how Lara Croft became the tomb raider she is so famous about in the previous games of the series.The story focuses on Lara Croft in her young days on an expedition by ship to the ""Dragon's Triangle"", which the island Yamatai is located. The Triangle in the Pacific Ocean, south of Japan, known for its violent storms and countless missing ships in the area. As you imagined, Lara and her crew on the ship Endurance, find themselves becoming yet another victim to the Triangle's storm mayhem and strand on the island. But it's quickly discovered that not everything is what it seems, and the island is inhabited by hostile shipwreck survivors, aswell as supernatural weather phenomenon's. The story centers around these events from the very start, to the very end, and it is done pretty well. The story is also one of the first used in a game that I am aware of. The story does at times seem obvious, but overall it is quite good.The gameplay is rather easy to get into, and feels smooth, with only minor character turning problems, especially in close quarter area's. When walking over an edge, most times, Lara will grab onto it rather than fall down. This is a 75% case though, I have tried a few times where she simply fell to her doom.You always play in thirdperson.When jumping over a free-fall spot and aiming towards a walkable log or plank, you can clearly feel the game force Lara somehow faster towards the thin walkable object, when clearly you could see you wouldn't have made the jump in time. This seems to happen no matter how hard you try to jump to the side of the object and forcefully try to suicide. The game simply forces you onto the object for Lara to stand in a balancing stance.When climbing ropes or walls with your axe, it is done very quickly, making you wonder where Lara gets all the energy from. Sure, she is fit, but there's no way she can climb or move that fast. Obviously this is done for the player's benefit, and not sitting for a minute of rope climbing.Lara can do a low dodge, followed by a second one in the form of a roll, avoiding all current sword swings etc, this doesn't count for bullets though. Instead you are forced to find cover and wait for the blackened screen to turn into a normally coloured one again, indicating your health is low. There are no health pickups. When gaining a skill, you can dodge and attack enemies, either killing them or stabbing them in the knee region with an arrow. This is done by a quick played scene and animation of Lara and the hostile, in which you must then be quick to press a key, which is mainly E or F.Other scene's Lara is controlled by the computer as you must press certain keys to avoid being killed, examples being rockslides, losing grip after a jump, close fights or other various scenario's with nature or objects.If you wish to be in full control of your character at all times, this isn't the game for you.The aiming system is decent, and you're given a focus system to highlight certain objects or waypoints to further the game. This can be everything from lootable crates, to challenge items/things, climable walls, ropes you can use and waypoints. Later on in the game a skill will provide better focus for you to find items easier.You're given a melee weapon in the form of a mountain climbing axe, the striking animations perhaps abit quick in my opinion, but overall showcase Lara as desperate when fighting close quarter against hostiles.Throughtout the game you unlock access to more weapons over time, though they aren't many.Overall they are mainly four range weapons, the fifth being the melee axe.They are as followed: Pistol, shotgun, smg/assault rifle and bow with arrows.All of these, even the axe, can be upgraded throughout the game by visiting campsites that you discover and using scrap metal parts that you loot from crates, enemies and animals (with a skill, bones).As stated, the smg can be upgraded to give you an assault rifle (ak-47) instead, which seems abit unrealistic.There are plenty of upgrades to be unlocked, and most of them change the appearance of your weapon.When aiming with either of the weapons, you are zoomed in over Lara's shoulder.Throughout the game you pass several optional tombs that can be explored. Most of them when entering, you are forced to go slowly with Lara, while having a lit torch, even being forced to light the torch at the start. Sometimes this is a dragging experience and isn't for the action-craving players. You will never encounter enemies in optional tombs, instead you will encounter puzzles.Puzzles aren't difficult to figure out, even Portal puzzles are harder, but should you be confused what to do, open steam browser and look up video's on youtube. Same goes for challenges and relics, all can be found by the help of youtube video guides.The puzzles range from bringing an object to a place at the right moment to get to the end of the tomb, to throwing objects up onto an makeshift elevator to opening up window shutters that keep howling storm wind at bay, and using it at a correct timing to reach the tomb end.Each tomb has a campsite that you can use for upgrades and skills, but you can't oddly enough fast travel, forced to go out the slow process that you came in with from the start of the tomb.When reaching the end, you are rewarded with gear parts, sometimes relics, or a map that will reveal all the collectibles in a zone that the tomb is located in. They also reward EXP.Most zones have challenges, mainly destroyable things. They range from banners you must burn, to forest mushroom caps that you can (presumably) eat and destroyable tribal fetishes among others.All of these contribute towards the game's progression procent aswell as achievements, and award EXP too.Relics can be found in each zone, having atleast 3-5 in each one. They are almost always different, having a zone theme going along them, or a set. For an instance, a village might have old handmade fans, or theater masks as a set. Other relic theme's are WWII-era items, like dogtags. All of these relics are always in chests, when opened, appear close up with Lara saying something about their history, some of them being able to be examined closer and more information will be revealed by Lara. You can never use these items ingame and serve only as items to be found. There are even modern day familiy ""heirlooms"" among the relic theme's and sets.You can gain EXP from killing any type of animals and enemies, completing challenges and finding relics aswell as tombs.Full EXP levels gain you a point to use in skills, which you can access when sitting at a campsite. There are three different categories of skills, some unlockable only after progressing in the game.All affect gameplay in some way, including better hunting wildlife abilities, to attacking hostiles and performing finishers on them and last but not least, your inventory, upgrading yourself to carry more ammo etc.As Lara, you interact alot through cutscene's with other survivors aswell as enemies, and minimal interaction in playmode with friendly characters. This serves as a stand-next-to and press a key to interact with them.There aren't alot of outstanding or noticeable characters, they are more down on earth and the game maintains this well thoughout the story progression.The characters are quite detailed, just as the gameworld. Nicely rendered, and looking realistic. If you are a sucker for character details, this game is a must."

The developers basically took the gameplay of Uncharted and slammed it into a gameworld designed like Arkham Asylum's. I felt the game had a nice feel and weight to both the platforming and the combat, and the automatic cover-system actually made the game feel pretty smooth. The story of the game is pretty blah and the absurdly brutal QTE deaths in the game are kind of gross and didn't really do anything to enhance the game.My other main complaint is that this game focuses too much on the combat. While the combat felt good, I would have preferred more platforming and some puzzles in, you know, actual tombs. The game does have some single-room secret tombs in the game, but they all feel kind of hollow because the game telegraphs these ""secret"" areas mega-hard and it kind of ruins any sense of discovery you could get from finding them yourself. Damn you, modern gaming!!Overall, though, the game is decent and lasts around 11 - 14 hours. I'd say it's worth it when it's on sale."

Very nice animations overall, and the gunplay is very satisfying for such a genre. Kudos to the devs!I discovered the game only now (2021) but considering that it's actually from 2013, I must say I am impressed. The engine performs very well, and deliver some very nice environments and effects. Lighting, FX, textures are all excellent for me. And it scales quite well to 4K.I actually appreciated the fact that the reboot tried to move away from the bimbo akimbo style, and actually tries to shape the story of how Lara became who she is. You will actually see her grow through the events and challenges, and the overall story is very well delivered with little to no down-time. Bravo!For the hunters out there, this one will be troublesome due to the online ones. Very hard to get people online unless you get a group of hunters. And 2 will require hours of grinding. The solo part is well designed and integrated within the campaign progression."

Indeed it is not in the spirit of classic TR games.However, the story protrayed in the game is quite rich and enthralling. Sure many of the situations are ""very unlikely"" and unblievable, but so were the classic games. At any rate, there is really good writing in the form of the journals and the artifacts you can collect. While it is indeed not the most polished in this regard (Naughty dog has done a superb job with the Uncharted series), it is indeed very intersting.To some the combat aspect of the game puts them off, and I can relate to that, however given the setting of this particular game it makes sense, and it also offers plenty of huge areas to explore and much platforming. While clearing areas indeed feels like a chore, it indeed is. But it is supposed to be that way, is part of how the game ""forces you"" to explore if you want to get all tid bits of information and artifacts, but that is not required to advance the game. These parts are suposed to be that way, and exploring tombs reveal the bulk of the map elements, though not all.In regards to the implementation, since I have only played the native Linux version of the game, it does have its flaws, especially in large areas, where the performance tanks regardless of the machine you have, as long as it is above the requirementes, you will see low performance in some areas. Not a killer as such, especially since high framerates are not required to actually enjoy the game, it does incur in visual inconsistency of very fluid gameplay to a stutter fest, especially when looking at wide areas in the game (Mountain Village, Shanty Town, etc). Personally it is not such a big deal for the enjoyment of the game, but I know to some FPS freaks is reason enough to put down the game.All in all, I like it for what it is, a Tomb Raider adventure, I do not like much that there are not many tombs in the game, though, but subjectively speaking is a good game."

Tomb Raider is a reboot of the classic series  that started in the 90s. This one, thought, is fairly different than what you'd experience in the original one. Tomb Raider (2013) has you fighting for your life as you search for a way off a baddy-filled island. On your adventure, you'll have to find and even rescue some of your buddies. The overall story leaves coming back for more and never really being bored with its twists and turns. The survival aspect is a little different from what we get from other Tomb Raider games, but it definitely is refreshing and well done. The characters in the game thought are a little flat and cliche. One problem with the characters is that Lara is such a great and well developed character that the others fall flat and aren't super memorable. Lara does go through a journey that changes her and makes for a really great story though, which makes up for it. Remember when I said that this was a baddy filled island? Well, I wasn't lying, nothing there really wants you there. There are an army of soldiers that are also on that island, and they're not a fan of Lara. There are different enemy types, some are heavy brutes that can take their share of bullets and arrows, there are also your standard assualt rifle dudes, shotgun punks, some machine gun nerds, some explosive throwing jerks (They've got molotovs too), and some pretty cool bowmen.  Along with those dudes, you'll also find some wolves on the island from time to time, which of course want you there as much as the soldiers do.The gunplay isn't something super new, but it is still satisfying and fairly easy. You eventually gather a fair arsenal of weapons, which you can upgrade by salvaging stuff and upgrading them at campfires. There's an assualt rifle, a bow, a pistol, and a shotgun. The bow, in my personal opinion, is the most fun weapon in the game. Throughout the game, you'll stumble upon weapons parts that allow you to build better versions of the weapon you have, once you have all of the pieces. The upgrades availible to you for weapons are pretty useful and some add some fun features. As well as the ablilty to upgrade weapons, you have the ability to up Lara's skills (such as combat, salvaging, etc). The game also gives you a climbing tool, which comes in handy for climbing cliffs and stuff of that nature. The game also has ziplines that are pretty awesome to ride. Being that this is Tomb Raider, there are also some tombs to explore and they are worth the trip. Also there are, of course, puzzles. None of the puzzles are that hard to solve, but they do provide for some fun gameplay. Overall, this game is fairly easy on normal difficulty, even the boss is easy. This can be a good thing though, if you're worried about getting stuck on a difficult moment. The game also has a solution for getting stuck and not knowing where to go. It has a sort of 'detective vision' that shows you where to go. The graphics in this game are easily some of the best to come out of 2013. There is some really beautiful scenery in this game! The player model and npcs look great as well, you can tell that they weren't messing around when they made this. One thing that I really liked is that they de-objectified Lara in this game. Lara is a bad*** character and definitely doesn't need to be objectified. In all, this game is a fantastic edition to the Tomb Raider franchise. The story has some intense moments where you'll be on the edge of your seat, it's got great voice acting, a pretty kickin' story, amazing set pieces, great combat, and more! Also, if you're looking for a game with an Uncharted feel, this is definitely what you're looking for. In the end, this game is definitely worth giving a shot, even at full retail price!"

To give some back story, I grew up on the old Tomb Raiders, followed through Underworld, and adored them all.  When I heard the series was being rebooted, and we'd be visiting Lara Croft's origins, I immediately dismissed it.  And I won't lie, when I heard negative things about the game, I was happy to hear that my choice was ""on the right.""  Fast forward to five days ago when I stumbled upon a video including this game, and my interest was piqued.  Now at the wonderful price of $20, and on a recommendation of a friend, I decided to give this ""terrible game"" (words I had previously used) a shot.  I was horribly, horribly wrong; and ignorance is no excuse.  The game is incredible, the setting, the atmosphere, the entire plot.  ""Reboot"" typically involves negative connotations, the largest of which typically means sucking out the soul of what had made the original series great; because in order to get to the point of rebooting, the developers typically have to have lost their way.  But, this is not the case here.  Though modernized, and starting with a new story, this game sticks with great platforming, amazing set pieces, collectibles, and a wonderful historical/supernatural story.  All the elements that had made the original great.  All that has been changed here is how it is presented.  With a modern open world island, that has details that are off the charts.  I've finished the story now, but I can tell you I will be diving back in promptly to find all the collectibles and details I missed.  I was wrong:  A reboot can be for the better, and have a positive effect.  I hope any others who thought as I once did listen, and give this game a proper chance.  I don't regret it in the slightest, and hopefully neither will you.  And now, after having despised this game when it came out, I look forward to it's sequel with bated breath.  Because if they can put as much effort into the next one, this series has got a hell of a future."

Players take control of the series lead character Lara Croft. The game uses an interconnected hub-and-spoke model that combines action-adventure, exploration, and survival mechanics. Players can traverse between the camps and across the island using footpaths, improvised or already-available ziplines and climbable tracks. Many of the players moves are carried over from the previous games created by Crystal Dynamics, with some tweaks added.players having the ability to free-aim Lara's bow and the guns she salvages, engage in close-quarter combat and perform stealth kills. Players can also use Survival Instinct, an ability in which enemies, collectables and objects pivotal to environmental puzzles will be highlighted for players.Players progress through the game, they earn experience points from performing certain actions and completing in-game challenges linked with hunting, exploring and combat: this enables players' skills and abilities to be upgraded in specific ways, such as giving her more storage capacity for arrows and ammunition. Players can also upgrade and customize weapons using salvage collected across the island. There is also a character progression mechanic in the game: better items, weapons and equipment are gained as players progress, though the appearance of most of these items is closely linked to events in the story. In addition to the main story, players can complete multiple side quests, explore the island, revisit locations, and search for challenge tombs.What a mindblowing journey! This is the best TR game i've played so far! The developers have really outdone themselves with how well this game is displayed, all the way to the littlest detail. I've tried to find a fault in this game but nothing jumped out at me which is exactly what I was hoping for. Tomb Raider really takes you on a adventure and i'm so glad that there's another two to play! If you can get this on sale then I wouldn't hesitate on getting this, even on full sale I would buy this. A truely amazing masterpiece.Side note: The muliplayer is dead but that's to be expected for a 2013 game.No one leaves the Dragon's Triangle.■■■■■■■■■■ 10 / 10Review to Rise of The Tomb Raider: Review to Shadow of the Tomb Raider:"

I hoped beyond hope that they didn't ruin it with mushy nonsense that tried to mesh with the ""kiddy Lara"" bits of Chronicles, which were fun at the time, but if treated seriously nowadays would have been a bit tripe.Well, my fears were for nothing.  This game is brilliant.  Although it takes a few subtly liberties with Lara's origins, given the stuff in the aforementioned TR:Chronicles, this game is very very well executed.  It tells the tale of graduate student Lara, possibly doing a post-doctoral thesis which involves researching an ancient lost Japanese culture somewhere in an area which is the pacific analogue of the Bermuda Triangle.  The obvious happens, and Lara and the crew are trapped on the island.  Unfortunately the inhabitants have gone mad because they can't escape the island, and have turned to worshipping a long-dead Sun Goddess who allegedly had mastery over the weather.  The only problem is that something is still screwy with the weather today.. Did the sun goddess just milk the inhabitants' superstitions, did she have something that helped her control the weather, or was she magical in some way?  Given that she's holed up in some ancient tombs, there's only one way to find out... RAID THOSE TOMBS!!!!!!The graphics in the game are excellent given the game's age.  Textures are bright and sharp, water is slick, mist and fog has a real depth to it, and the changes in the weather are just amazingly well handled.  As you progress through the island, you go from tropical paradise to icy windy peaks, and all the way, the soundscape and graphics really portray the environment.  Standing in the bogs, listening to the insects and frogs croaking around you in surround sound is just amazing.  As soon as you get to the first windy area, surround sound makes you extremely nervous, coupled with the camera shake... Everything feels like you're going to blow away...The music, sounds and voice acting are all top notch.   The characters all portray their feelings very well, and the body animation is also extremely good.  Interacting with the NPCs feels natural and solid, although there were a few times I'd have chosen a different thing to say, making the conversation feel like it avoids addressing an important point...    Lara's animation as she runs, jumps, dives and fights are all excellent.  In one area I strayed too close to a wall and as Lara was running she held her hand out to stroke the wall in a very lifelike way.  That small piece of detail was really impressive.The loading times are very short compared to some other games.    Despite the areas feeling open and large, the game loads each area surprisingly quickly, so you're not staring at a progress bar or the tedious loading screen hints for too long.The choice of weapons is VERY pleasing. Keeping it to a core four weapons, with upgrade options makes for more fluid gameplay, and you can switch out the weapons to suit your situation very easily.    The upgrades all materially improve the combat too, and by the end you're switching weps, battling like a real brawler with almost no effort.The only thing I didn't like were the QTEs, especially the special 'F' attacks when a scripted enemy goes into slowmo.     You're in the heat of battle, pressing keys, switching weps, ducking, feinting, shooting when all of a sudden.. myoww, the game goes slowmo and ""PRESS F!"" appears.. You press F, but instantly die....   The game wants you to wait for some reason for a circle to get to just the right size to press the F. Too late or too soon, and you die.  It's REALLY annoying, and there's no need for it, really.   Why devs persist in putting QTEs in is utterly beyond me.  Someone in a meeting must say ""Hey, just when the player's frantically fighting, less flash up keys for them to press, then suddenly change it so that if they actually DO press the key, they die! haha! That'll be exciting for them!"".. No. No it isn't.  Please stop!Other than that, the whole game is great.  100%ing it is tricky because some of the collectibles and challenges require scouring really large areas for something that's hidden behind a tree, or down a hole.  It's possible, but once you've finished, just go for a walkthrough guide if you want to 100% it.Excellent game, well recommended!"

Without spoiling anything there is a reason you learn later on in the game why the environments are so dreary in parts.I've always been a fan of the series, but there is always one part in every one of the games that a timed sequence has driven me nuts.  Luckily there are some challenging timed sequences in this, however they pretty much perfected the checkpoint saves at all the right intervals! In other words if you die, you don't have to repeat a whole bunch of stuff all over again.. it's just a tiny bit.  Which is great for short of patience type people like myself, you won't lose your mind.There are some stuff I did have to look up since I wasn't sure how to get where, thanks to Stella's walkthrough site she saves the day!A really great thing is the inventory, menu system.  Spending skill pts is a breeze, and earning them as well.  The map tracking is so helpful!!! I'm so glad they have this map tracking, because without spoiling it too much.. if you are looking for a specific collectable you can track it in blue, then use this special vision mode that makes it light up like a beacon.  This feature saves you from a massive headache of wandering aimlessly around trying to get all the collectibles!Say you forgot some collectibles in one camp.. NO problem they have a real handy fast tracking back and forth between camps.  Say you finish the whole game and still didn't find all the collectibles... NO problem at the end of the game you are given the choice to continue if you want to find them all, or just wander around and explore.I think the Devs really put a lot of thought and care into this game.  I really enjoyed it.**The only negatives that I remember are:  Sometimes the voice actors would call her Laura one minute then Lara the next... first time I heard this error in this entire series.One other thing the camera angles in 1 or 2 of the timed sequence was a bit off which usually got me killed, however thankfully the improved checkpoint save intervals it wasn't that big of a deal to repeat.The game didn't like it too much if I was alt tabbing to much.  I could get away with a couple of times but I'd eventually crash it. Most games are like this though..."

Most of the FPS today feature a lot jumps but in this one feature a lot falls. It's great to see Lara getting out of all that.Once again it's recommended to all to play this game. BTW.. I read the concept for multiplayer achievements and its seems to be a lot work.. I will pass on multiplayer for this game.

Usually I split review into good an bad, but almost everything in this game has good and bad points. For context I played bits of Tomb Raider on PS1 a long time ago but can't really remember much of it. - It's like this game doesn't know what it wants to be. At the beginning it plays like a TellTale game but without the choices, then they have a tutorial on hunting animals and it seems like maybe it's a bit of a survival game... except then you never have to hunt an animal or worry about food again ever for the rest of the game. Then it becomes clear it's really a standard shooter with puzzles in between fights- They appear to offer you the option of stealth for  parts of the game, but  so it's very hard to do successfully and you'd just keep restarting and frustrating yourself if you insisted on stealth. The only times the stealth was easy, involved merely waiting for NPCs to finish their conversation and walk away.- The combat is surprisingly decent, but again there's no cover button, it relies on the game automatically detecting you being near cover and making Lara duck, which is inconsistent- The weapon customisation system is reasonable, but it's the type where by the end of the game you have almost all possible options, rather than making you pick and choose- It's nice that there's puzzles, but most of the time the puzzles just didn't excite me or make me feel cool for figuring them out; it's no Portal. The difficulty of them is pretty good, not easy but I only needed to look up a walkthrough for one in the entire game.- Graphics are all fine and good- Lara's accent is not good, particularly when she says """", which she says a lot.- They have all this optional collectables stuff but I just had zero interest in it. Same with the 'tombs', I did two optional ones but... eh.- Not a huge fan of the story, mainly that it relies entirely on the supernatural and doesn't have some secret 'logical' reason for everything.- After the first hour I guess I just felt like the next 10 hours didn't offer anything new, mainly just the same stuff but with better guns/tools. Only new thing was the boss fights but they weren't particularly great.- Obviously the multiplayer is completely dead, but you would've suspected thatSo yeah, it's not that it's a poorly crafted game or ugly, or too clunky... there just wasn't enough variety for me, the limited stealth they offered was too hard to do, story was mediocre, and the puzzles weren't that fun (and there were a lot of them). But I was still fine to play the game 'til the end of the story."

Puzzles are braindead. Scenes with limited control state, and forced camera angles are countless. CoD slow motion is here. It has a skill tree that doesn’t offer any replay value, regenerating health system replaces health packs, pseudo open world that you travel in straight line with fast travel, you level up and craft by resting at camp fires.Doesn’t it all scream Tomb Raider to you?And this survivor premise that has been repeated endlessly. Yeah, Lara is cold and hungry once in a cutscene. You’ll need to kill a deer once, and waves of men after. Enemies drop loads of ammo, and levels are littered with pickups. You get experience points for shooting as many men as possible; extra points for bombastic fatalities. There is no way to avoid conflict, our “survivor” refuses to use her traversal abilities, until every last enemy is dead.Odd choices when it attempts to stitch together a survival story about evil men against our precious girl.Lara is bland, generic, safe, fragile, moaning, and is out of breath for the whole game. Gone is the hot badass. Her quote „I hate tombs” – summarises perfectly what people who wrote this think about the series. This game ♥♥♥♥♥ on everything the Tomb Raider series was about, but keeps protagonists name.This “Uncharted” copy would have been OK under a different title, but to call this travesty a “Tomb Raider”, is like calling a city builder “Surviving Mars”, “Doom” because few names are the same.The departure from TR Underworld is just sad, but this one made a lot of money so it’s grand, I guess."

The island is a beautiful island to play in and Lara Croft moves fluidly through the environments making it look good when she performs her acrobatic moves.

The exploring part is mostly exploring for collectibles, the rest is pretty linear like a natural floral hallway directing you to the next scene.I understand why others wouldn't like this sense of clostrophobic environment for a Tomb Raider game, but it allows for a smooth flowing story with very scriped scenes that make for a smooth flowing game of story/action/etc...

So  I decided to review TR's Multiplayer instead.Let's start with matchmaking itself... To say the truth, I've seen way better. Although there are several matches running, the game sometimes seems to be unable to find any matches, but when you try to join a session your friend is in, there's no problem to join. When you finaly start joining a game, it MAY happen to you, that nothing will happen... I mean literally nothing. You see just loading screen with beginner tips'n'tricks for hours if you don't quit your game (Via ctrl+alt+del,.... or sometimes helps if you try to join your friends game through steam library)Well, take in mind that above described things just might happen, it does not happen every time :)So now you are in game, what od you have there? MapsThere are five basic (and 7 DLC) maps, which are all very beautiful with many great details... Still after 250 hours in-game I sometimes discover some things i had no idea there were. Each of the basic maps has a small special feature, like sand-storm revealing your enemies' positions, submarine's auto-destruct system, which sets remaining time to two minutes and starts destruction of the entire map granting kills to whoever triggered it,... There are also many sweet traps you can prepare for your enemies, starting with snare trap and ending with making a barbecue of them. The maximum number of players per match is 8, that is also the ideal number of players for map, because the maps were made for 8 players. However quite often you end up in a game with 4 players and it takes forever to find somone. Characters:Let's get through this quickly. There are two teams: The Solari and Survivors, both with about 4 starting charcters for you to select and many others that unlock as you level up. There are also 4 DLC characters. Then there are ""Zac"" and ""Scavenger Archer"" characters which are xbox exclusive, however sometimes you discover someone playing with them on PC.Now, let's shoot some guns.Like I mentioned that characters are divided to Solari and Survivors, the same goes for guns. Both groups have unique weaponry. For your characters you create loadouts which consist of primary weapon, secondary weapon, special weapon, survival skill and offensive skill. Weapons, skills and more loadouts unlock as you level up.In primary weapons you can find bows, which serve as sniper rifles in this game, assault rifles and shotguns. In secondary weapons are hanguns, submachine gun (yep,.... just one) and a neat sawed-off shotgun. In specials you can find stuff like grenades, flashbangs, napalm, land mines,... Survival skills allow you to take less damage from a certain weapon type. Offensive skill on the other side should help you stalk others.All primary and secondary weapons can be uprgaded in a certain way. Eg. greater clip size for 1911 or shorter draw time for your bow. There are also 6 DLC weapons.  Well, now... What's the worst about multiplayer? The community!When I started with this game, there were many players... Now there are just very few left. And why is that? Again the community! New players simply stop playng this game because of the old ones. More and more I just find matches with a team of maxed out players camping in front of the enemy spawn, while in the other team there are new players (max lvl 20) who get slaughtered whenever they try to leave. C'mon! If this happend to me when I tried MP for the first time I would probably just give up any atempts of trying it ever again. So. match is over, new players surprisingly still here, game forms new teams, Fair teams. What do maxed out players do? They form the same team they had in the last match! Why? Really?! What's so funny about standing on one place waiting for a head to appear? These players sometimes even complain that you are camping on your spawn! No. This is just nonsence. They kill you whenever you leave it and than are surprised you don't want to leave... Best thing about that is that usually one uf them uses a bow for instant kills, another has a grenade launcher in case you decided to move WHOLE 5 M away from the spawn, third one has the overpowerd Silverballer with rapid fire and the last one picked up a Super Weapon (yeah, there are super weapons- Competition bow and minigun), and not to forget mines at every single exit.Well, let's end this. The Multiplayer has great maps, many great characters, even more awesome weapons and... players.In the end, my review must be positive, because creators of this game are not responsible for its players. If you are new to this game, I definitely recommend starting with singleplayer and when you decide to test multiplayer, don't get discouraged by the behaviour of some players, there are still some players with sence of fair play. Well, good luck, Tomb Raiders!"

There are many moments where her surrounding is falling apart while you are traversing it and this provides many tense moments in the game. Since this game is a reboot of the franchise, Lara Croft is reimagined as a young adventurer who gets trapped in an island full of dangerous cultists and throughout her journey she evolved from an innocent girl to a full fledged survivor who has no qualms about killing others for the sake of surviving and protecting her friends. This game does include a cast of likeable and interesting side characters to compliment Lara Croft in this game. From the main antagonist who is willing to do anything to escape from the island to Lara Croft best friend Samantha who has a link to the island they are trapped in. Throughout Lara's journey you can see her changed visually as well, since her character model would looked more damaged as the game progresses such as her clothes slowly ripping off and the increasing number of injuries on her. The weapons in this game does evolved visually and stats wise as every upgrade you add into your weapons does reflect on the weapons itself. I have to complement them for these great attention to details!For those who like collecting things, this game does have various collectables such as relics, gps caches and notes hidden throughout various levels. These collectables does give the player insights about the background and history of the island which is interesting and make the collection more worth the effort.There is also multiplayer in this game, where you can play as a cast of different characters from the story. There are also different weapons and gadgets that you can use for this mode. However, there are barely anybody playing multiplayer at the time of this review. So the multiplayer in this game is pretty much dead. However the main catch of this game is in it's story mode which I found to be fantastic! I give this game a 9/10 and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a great action adventure game and it is good to have more female protagonist in the male dominated protagonist scene."

It was Square Enix response to Uncharted as a way to try and generate revenue through their newly acquired Western studios such as Crystal Dynamics. The product was one of the most expensive games ever made. While the reimagined Tombraider trilogy never met Square Enix financial expectations, it was enough for them to continue making titles. Tombraider plays similarly to Uncharted but with more content. There is a multiplayer mode that was pretty much dead on arrival so do not bother trying to play it. Unlike Uncharted their are optional ""Tombs"" to raid that offer a puzzle for Lara to solve for extra XP and salvage, they are a relatively fun distraction with nice set pieces. The shooting gameplay is pretty much your standard fair third person shooter but with the ability to upgrade your weapons as well as having more options to traverse the environment vertically than others. Unlike other games, Tomb Raider decided to go with a sticky cover mechanic instead of toggle, it is not janky like some other attempts at it and never got in the way or led to frustrating deaths or inability to traverse the environment. One thing to not in the game is that Lara goes through absolute hell in the game with extremely brutal death scenes and set pieces where she is thrown around like a rag doll while screaming. It is pretty gratuitous and took me out of the moment especially because it happens so frequently. It is like they played through Uncharted and saw the crazy set pieces that Drake went through and decided to make Lara go through even worse as a quantity over quality approach. The games story is alright with an interesting setting of Yamatai and Queen Himiko that does not really have a presence in Western media. It felt a little derivative at times but it was still enjoyable all the way through outside of Lara getting so many innocent people killed and not really feeling that bad about it. TLDR, Tomb Raider is a great reboot to the franchise and its gameplay stands out enough from Uncharted to become its own thing with its optional tomb puzzles, collectibles, and skill/weapon upgrade mechanics to be a fun time sink."

And There are a lot of differences. But does that mean it got worse with the reboot? Well, since you see one big blue thumbs up of course not, but let's analyze everything pretty shortly.Il you have never played a TR game and you mostly care about the plot, this is not the game for you. For what I see, TR doesen't have much of a stronger plot, but it's all mostly about the gameplay. Still, it's very nice to see how they mix some archeology with paranormal myths.You'll be Lara, a teenager girl that just finished her studies, looking for a new adventure and tombs to explore. Even though she doesen't seems to be mich happy to go in a new adventure. She will be accompanied by some kind of ""father figure"", her college friend, Sam (no, she's a girl, glad they didn't add some random love stories), some fat version of Vaas from Far Cry 3, Uncle Scrooge, a black always-angry woman, a nerd guy and some scientist that wanna be a superstar. But we'll talk about the characters later on.After a huge storm hits the boat they were on, they crashed into this misterious island, full of weird people that want them all dead and expecially, wants Sam for some kind of ritual.We can split the game in 3 parts. Don't worry, I won't spoil you anything.In the first part of the game, you see how much SquareEnix must hate Lara Croft. They hurt her in the most possible way possible, probably to punish her and the old dev for the bad titles like the 6th one. Also, this part shows how she's new to all this. Before playing, I've heard that she looks like a whining small girl for the very first hours of the game. Fortunatly, is not like that. Yes, she have a lot of ""hysterical"" moments, but most of them are pretty justified. I whould call this part of the game ""You can do it"". Cause it's what everyone keep telling her. A lot.The second part of the game is still good as the first one, there is not much to say. You can clerly see here that Lara has changed. Not very well done, but I'll save it for later.The third part is all what I was afraid of: this game turning into a generic third person shooter. Yes, the exploration kinda dies after a while, and the hord of enemies impossible to stealth get most of the game. Fortunatly it get better with the ending.The gameplay itself got way better since TR:Legend. The controls works  fine, climbing is finally responding and more improved then the older games (maybe a little too easy sometimes?). One thing is for sure: they finally fixed the camera. If first was focused on Lara's bums, leaving 2 choises, try some ""leaps of faith"" or stop and enjoy the view, now actually works perfectly. And the introduction of the bow, shotgun and machine gun works good, even though the old games usually left you with a double pistol with infinite ammos.But here's the best part of this game that I really enjoyed a lot:  What may look like some dumb collectibles, actually will help you understand more about the plot, and expecially, give you exp points to use to acquire more skills.The graphic is fantastic, it seriously fools you in the way to make you think that Lara must stink like a piece of poo after all she's been going through. Seriously tho', it's pretty fantastic, and I was just playing on medium/high settings.The music is pretty generic, nothing really memorable, but still fitting. Can't complain.But here's probably the main problem of the game: the characterization of the characters, expecially Lara. They probably wanted her to have some changing, like Jason Brody from Far Cry 3, but here doesen't work good as that guy, expecially 'cause she have a breakdown the first time she kills a man, and a second later she's spilling blood everywhere.They didn't really much tried to make the secondary characters look less generic that they already appear. You don't really much care if someone could die. At least, that's what I felt like. They all looks so much cliche' and generic that they could be here just to fill some spaces into the plot.Final score: 7+/10It last for about 10 hours if you don't care about exploring, around 15 if you wanna unlock evething. If you want it now, 20€ is a fair price, but if you can wait for a sale, you can easly get it for 5€ (7€ with all the dlc).Not a Masterpiece, sure, but a great game."

But in some respects even below mediocre. If steam reviews had something in the middle between ""like"" and ""dislike"" it would be it.When you first start to play this game you immediately notice how it forces the camera movement in every single scene possible. It really makes you dizzy very quickly. And you can't turn it off completely. The whole game is a big, messy, jiggy camera wobbling thing. WHY DO U DO THIS?I really dislike quick events in games and this game has a considerable amount of those. There are some really bad Russian voice overs. Either do something correctly or don't do it at all. It should be a motto for every game.Alt+Tab sometimes crashes the game. But since the game saves the progress very frequently - it's not a big issue, just an annoyance.Lara Croft is more durable than the Terminator. Schwarzenegger would be proud.Funny thing: when you shoot a barrel with a normal arrow - it still explodes!70% of gameplay consist of Lara's constant groaning or heavy breathing.All puzzles are very simple. I don't say it's a bad thing, but more complexity wouldn't have hurt.The story itself is pretty good and interesting, but the dialogues are very generic and full of clichés. Some characters sacrifice themselves in the most stupid ways possible. Lara can kill 20 angry men in one go, but can't rescue a friend when 3 enemies are attacking. So inconsistent.Lara never gets cold in the snowy/breezy areas, even though she walks in her t-shirt. She is still as agile as in normal weather.At first I disliked Lara's voice, but after a while I started to love it. I think it really suits her. Apart from all these little and big annoyances, I still find this game enjoyable and fun to play. It's a good adventure game in a slightly-open-but-linear world."

The exploration and survival elements are minimalistic but functional to the game; it is the descent into the dark mystery enclosing this remote island that is so beautifully paced, and as gripping as the best Indiana Jones movies. The characters are a little cliché, but your attention will be focused on Lara anyway. She is such a beautiful positive presence, moving the story forward with her desperate will to survive and her sweet british accent.Maybe it is simpler than the ""true"" TR, cause it targets a broad audience, but nevertheless it is a beautifully crafted game in every respect and I had a blast playing."

Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.OverviewThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.Level Design/GraphicsSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.GameplayLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.ConclusionShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience."

Long gone the duel wield weaponry and the unbeatable killer machine of a women we love, instead we get a timid and frightened young lady who is stranded in a japan-ish bermuda triangle.Hunting for her life are the fanatics led by an intriguing character named Mathias who wants to resurrect the fabled Sun Queen who used to rule the world ages ago. However, Lara is not alone in her journey, she has her mentor & friend along with her best friend Sam and a group of rag tag explorers. The atmosphere is beautiful and horrific at the same time. Equally, gorgeous is the lead heroine Lara, who instead of over-sexualized in previous games, is depicted as an average explorer who when faced with the mortal dangers quickly sprangs into action. Camilla Ludington the voice of Lara has done an amazing job!The puzzles are few but very intelligent and realistic, Lara dont have to push a button to solve everything like in past, here she has to manipulate surroundings in order to solve the puzzles.This game is amazing, I have already played in 4 times and yet havent explored everything. After playing its sequel (Rise of Tomb Raider) and the series finale (Shadow of Tomb Raider) I conclude that this one is by far the most superior of the trilogy.For Lara worshipper like me it was a mandatory game to play, however I would encourage every action/adventure lover out there to try this amazing masterpiece."

It's a rather linear Action-Adventure game with some degree of freedom of exploration. It shows us Lara's very first expedition, which is to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai. Stranded and trapped on an island entombed in storms, Lara has to find the way to save her friends and escape, while solving the mysteries of the Queen Himiko and the aggressive tribe led by a madman Matthias who took control of an island. I must say the very beginning of the game really threw me off. Immediately you're being forced into a Quick-time event galore, which means for the first 10-ish minutes it's mostly running and mashing some random keys on the keyboard to progress through the story. Fortunately, the game gets much better afterwards, although I'd say it's still a bit oversaturated with QTE.Most of the time we spend climbing, jumping and traversing ropes to get from one point to another, often under pressure of time and by time I mean while trying to escape crumbling buildings, bridges and ladders. The movement is smooth enough most of the time, however, from time to time, especially when climbing I've managed to repeatedly jump into abyss in the same place, just because Lara was still stuck in the horizontal movement while I pressed jump to actually get higher. The game also doesn't have an option to sprint, which might feel a bit weird as it's usually a crucial element in all of the modern games, but it didn't bother me much in the end.There are some puzzles to solve in order to reach the 'treasury' of each tomb. They are not too hard, but also not completely trivial, I found them to be enough to make me stop and think for a second, but not something that completely stops the player in his tracks. Precise timing is often required and I can gladly say the movement and controls responsiveness are good enough to never be the blocking factor in solving the puzzles.With stunts and puzzles being one of the two most important elements of the game, the skirmishes and gunplay (and sometimes stealth) is certainly the other one. There isn't much choice when it comes to firepower in Tomb Raider, there's five weapons available, but they do get upgrades and alternative fire modes as the game progresses. They all have their pros and cons, like bow being best for long range stealth kills or rifle being great for mowing down the hordes of enemies. Which leads me to the next point...The enemies in Tomb Raider are no brainiacs, on normal difficulty they'll happily stand in front of you and unload a whole magazine in the air around you or hide behind obstacles that don't cover even half of their bodies exposing themselves for easy pickings with a bow. They usually employ a Zerg tactics where most of them die before they can even get close. You can find yourself in real danger only if you let yourself get surrounded, especially if the enemy group consists of a few big shield guys, who are pretty much unkillable without going melee and dodging.This means that most of the game Lara is basically Rambo and to be honest, it's pretty cool. Sometimes you just want to slaughter hundreds of enemies while scrambling from cover to cover to avoid molotovs and machine gun fire. It does however mean that stealth is very optional and barring one mission where you are disarmed I just went guns blazing most of the time.In the end, the game keeps you fighting and running under pressure most of the time and it's just fun. Action-packed, high-voltage fun.I've got to say, Tomb Raider aged gracefully when it comes to how it looks, especially Lara's model, which is seriously well done. Apart from that the game has some nice, majestic views from the mountain tops and murky tombs with beautiful statues. But I think the best area in terms of visual design is the Shipwreck Beach. The combination of wrecks of modern ships, galleons, tanks and planes is simply amazing. My favourite area by far.Sound-wise the game is okay. The soundtrack is not memorable, but it does a good job in building the atmosphere. Music is pretty important in making you think that something is waiting just around the corner, therefore building up the pressure and Tomb Raider's music does that well.One funny thing though is the two sounds which Lara make when opening the treasure chests in tombs. They are always the same and I couldn't help myself but mock her every time she opened the chest (Oooh? Aaah...)Definitely the weakest part of the game. I mean, the setup is pretty okay, some imaginary, forgotten kingdom with a supernatural queen, okay I can buy that, it's just how the story is unfolding that gives it horribly unrealistic and just straight up silly feeling. The greatest mystery of the game is not the secret of the storms or what are Solari, or Oni, but what the hell is Lara made of? After playing Tomb Raider, I'm pretty sure that if you tore Lara in half, both halves would regenerate into a full Lara or crawl and merge back together or something. She can be impaled, beaten up to pulp, she can fall from HUGE heights, hell at one points she , yet there she is ready to run and kick ass in minutes. This unfortunately is a trait of Lara and Lara only. All other characters injure as easily as a normal person and get killed even easier than one. And what the hell is wrong with all the buildings on the island. Like yes, I get it, they're mostly old, but apparently there's a basically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ army living there and everything is fine, yet, as soon as Lara sets her foot on literally anything, it all starts crumbling to pieces. Lara looks pretty petite although considering she's an unkillable behemoth maybe she is indeed made of steel and incredibly heavy. I mean, one thing is sure, Lara is pretty thick, she finds all those notes and ritualistic imagery, but it takes her almost the whole game to figure out why Matthias has kidnapped Sam. She says it out loud and I'm just sitting there like 'duh?', not like it was HEAVILY implied throughout most of the game...One last thing that grinds my gears is the Oni. On the bright side, collecting diary entries is pretty interesting as it presents some history of the island. I actually made an effort to collect all of them, because I got hooked up on the stories they tell.Tomb Raider is a good game, it aged gracefully and it still is very much playable in 2019. It offers 10-15 hours of solid, action-packed fun. The story is a bit of a hindrance to the game as a whole, but it's digestible when you not take it too seriously. All in all a great reboot and great buy for a few bucks!"

I'm not just talking about the original playstation games, even the most recent releases. The Game is heavily story driven. You get a large cut scene, followed by some QTE, explore the area, collect items, kill a few enemies, repeat, but the game does it well. The shooting and combat is very solid. It's weird that a Tomb Raider game has Multiplayer, but it's a decent addition. It's not very populated, but It can be entertaining for a while. After a handful of hours, it kind of gets stale. If you like to collect achievements, most are fun to get. The lvl 60 and buy all the characters and upgrades achievements starts to feel like a grind fest once you hit lvl 35-40."

It was also my first game of this type and I found it rather enjoyable from my usual list of games taht are mostly co-op experiences. While I will not go into details I will give you general summarised verzion of it widout major spoilers. Lara and her friends end up on a abandoned island in middle of nowhere. As they are stuck on it they realised that the island is not abandoned and there is bunch of crazy cultists taht are tryign to kill you and your friends becasue reasons (they are later expalined in game) so Lara has to rescue them and fight off the cultists in order to survive.That is really the best, spoiler free summary I can give and I will tell that story is... certainlly not the best since there are quiet of few instances that will make you go what. Luckly, the missions, combat sections, world exploration etc. make up for the decent (not subpar but just not great) story.The gameplay consist of variety of combat, stelth, quick time events, puzzles and exploration of the island in search for resources taht you use for crafting. What this game does right is that it combines well those aspects to not make them a chore and make them interesting trough whole playtrough. Gameplay mostly consist of exploring the Island for resources and collectables. You will also hunt animals to get materials for upgrades and xp. Probably my favourite parts of game was exploring the hiden tombs to find hidden treasure which reward you with weapon upgrades that you can now craft and xp. Combat and stelth sections were also interestign and majority was well designed and you knew where you needed to go, altought I will admiit some of those sections are very linear. The combat and exploring has dedicated skills which you can unlock by leveling and spending them at camps which make gameplay more diverse, in additiion you will unlcok new tools while you progress trought the game. My biggest issue with gameplay would be how upgrades for weapons all cost is too high (I was pretty much looting everything and I did not manage to get enough salvage for all upgrades), how for upgrades you only need salvages and no any other material. Anothere annoying thing is there are are essencially no any enemies left once you beat the game to fight in free roam. In adddition the enemy AI is kinda predictable and not the best. And sadly, the endgame or reason to replay a game does not really exist (except for missable achievement).Good thing about this game is that it tries to make each area stand out as different from the previous ones you encountered, tho I will admit it does not always succeed. The visuals are nice (for 2013) and game runs smooth (at least it was for me unlike Rise of Tomb Raider) so game can feel immersive most of the times. And now lets talk about how this game likes to make Lara survive over the top situations that will make you go  and trust me when I say taht there is A LOT of these quick time events and cutscenes where Lara is getting hurt. But it sure is entertaing someitems to see that or Lara die after you fail in unique way.If there is soemthign bad I can say bout this game taht is trully awful it sure is its Multipalyer gamemodes (that are dead). I will not even bother to say why multipalyer is bad in details but I will give one example. In multipallyer you can choose between 2 team: Cultists and Survivors. Cultists  and Survivors do not have access to same weapons. Cultists have 1 pistol that 1 taps you on headshot and 2 taps you on body. Survivors dont have any weapon that has weapon taht can do taht that fast on any range. I really did enjoy overall my time with this game despite me not usually playing games of this type. As I said before, the best part of the game for me was exploring and doing Tombs becasue they felt unique and different from rest of the game. I very much recommend people to try this game and if they like it to then try the next instalment in the franchise."

This game is like an action-packed blockbuster with more than ever realistic violence (that death sequences!). Lara Croft from the frightened girl quickly becomes a deadly predator who kills dozens of enemies with her machine gun (however, that transformation is too drastic in my opinion). Action sequences quickly become pretty absurd, but all of that provides so much fun! The game is less linear than the previous parts. It offers an open world divided into smaller locations, which are unlocked during the plot's progress. Also, learning new skills by Lara creates a good reason for revisiting previous locations with new abilities available. Each location provides some optional tombs with nice platform puzzles. The plot is pretty solid, but to fully appreciate it, it's worth finding all of the recordings/journals. The graphics look good even today. The music, apart from the main theme, is quite generic and not memorable.All in all, one of the better and funniest games I have played recently. I recommend."

Which I'm pretty sure are exactly the kind of reviews it got back in 2013. Playing it for the first time now, it's tempting to say that Tomb Raider has aged beautifully. It feels like a modern game. And *it is* pretty much - because third-person action games haven't progressed far, if at all, since this game showed up on store shelves. You have your semi-open world that you can fast travel through, your optional side content, your pseudo-RPG progression, your weapon crafting and upgrades, your notebooks that double as audio logs to flesh out the story, your uninteresting side-characters, and so on. And, cranked up to ""Ultra,"" it still looks pretty great on the graphics-side of things, too, in that early 2010s kind of way. If there are any flaws, Tomb Raider leans far too heavily on being a female-pain-simulator in it's first act - Lara spends most of the opening hours wheeze-crying and nearly getting brutalized to the point where it's more unsettling torture voyeurism than a compelling survival story. Additionally, the combat is a bit dull, with enemies being able to laser-focus on Lara from across the map and behind walls after you get your first borderline-scripted stealth kill of the encounter - you never really feel like the predator the game's tool-set implies you could be. It boils down to wait and shoot, over and over. Maybe it's because I played it on hard. And the artificial game-lengthening mechanics - oh man, get ready for some thrilling X-mashing. Mash X to open a door to mash X to open a chest to mash X to open a locker to mash X to pull a rope to mash X to ascend faster - but, I can forgive this simply because of Tomb Raider's age (we probably weren't as tired of this mechanic then as we are today). That all said, it's worth playing now simply because it's nearly as good as everything else on the market for a fraction of the price. But, it begs the question: in seven years, why haven't we gotten past all the trappings of this genre? Where's the next big leap in third-person action games? It seems like the industry is just spinning its wheels. Maybe there's nowhere to go. All in all, 8.5 out of 10, Tomb Raider's strong female lead doesn't do anything new, but what she does, she does well."

The game looks great (even against other titles of the era like The Last of Us), it runs exceptionally smoothly on modern hardware, and the gameplay lives up to the promise of what is best described as a casual, 3rd person, action/adventure shooter.Scouring the corners of every room and tomb for ammo, supplies and relics is the hallmark of many games in the series, and this one exceeds expectations in that regard. I love the new-ish mechanic of readying weapons with one trigger, before firing with the other. Admittedly, compared to other shooters, it seemed cumbersome at first, but the fluidity of the animation, combined with the responsive firing dynamics, ultimately makes for a great pew pew experience.Another masterfully done aspect of the title is the platforming. The animation timing and transitions create a believable leap, grasp, climb and repeat experience, even up against the tech in the newer Assassin's Creed games. Though it doesn't seem to be a massive part of the game, in part because it is done so artfully, the platforming integrates as a natural, and welcome, addition to the gameplay. Even if you're not a fan of platforming in a 3rd person shooter, you'd be hard pressed to fault it here.THE BAD-This is a tough one. Every game has faults, but in some they are hard to find. In others, it's nearly impossible. Splitting hairs, one could argue that the collectibles in sidequests are too hard to find. Spending extra hours carefully combing the same cliffs, buildings and crevasses can become quite tedious.Another minor irritant was the daylight and weather systems. While I absolutely adored the contrasting feels of day, night, rain and snow, that beastly overcast mode was most obnoxious. It removed all the shadows, making it practically impossible to judge depth and distance, which is a mite important when flinging Lara off one cliff for another. There is a rudimentary attempt at alleviating this with SSAO, but it's no VXGI solution. Again, I'm really reaching here.THE VERDICT-Upon playing the first level, I was worried the game would be hardly more than a series of QTEs, something that I got from the first gameplay trailers. I was never happier than to be so wrong! It is very much a playable game, through and through.If you are a fan of the franchise, or of any combination of the genres (action, adventure, platformer, shooter), and you (somehow) haven't yet gotten around to playing it, do so. You won't regret it."

Is. An. EPIC. Game.Say what you like about games that have been out for a while, but there is always someone experiencing something for the first time, and to them I say, if you enjoy high-class action-adventure video games, you can't go wrong with this one. Big thanks to Feral Interactive for providing Linux support, without which I likely would not have played the game at all.Visuals, of course, are absolutely stunning. If your machine can handle better graphical settings, crank them up! The game is perfectly playable on lower settings, but it is noticeably more enjoyable with higher settings.Gameplay mechanics are solid but not overly complicated, with good on-screen cues for the most part - timed counterattacks are tricky to learn but easy to accomplish once you know how the prompt works. Most other cues are reasonably intuitive to gamers both old and new. And Lara Croft is impressively capable! The insane jumps and combos, going from zipline riding straight into axe climbing, and generally getting into places nobody would expect her to be able to reach play a major role in the overall enjoyability of the game.I have been experiencing a very annoying bug in which I cannot look to the right beyond a certain distance while looking left is unrestricted. I have a multi-monitor setup but haven't tested turning off my secondary monitor. This bug does make gameplay awkward at times as I have to turn left 270 degrees, but I did finish the game so it's not a complete deal-breaker.Cutscenes are well-presented, apparently being fully rendered for best immersion, though sometimes I lose my bearings after a cutscene, especially if said cutscene includes a change of scene. Contrasted with classic games like Half-Life, this does somewhat impact the immersion but if effectively keeps the plot ""fresh"".A word of warning to parents: apart from the violence and destruction in the game (which you should be fully expecting), there is more than occasional swearing by many characters, though in my opinion it is not gratuitous or overdone.The music is amazingly well-written, especially for plot-significant sections. Those feelings when you defeat a boss or escape by the skin of your teeth or get a great powerup are in no small part due to the music. It is also highly effective at tear-jerking, at appropriate moments.All of which leads to the most important factor of the game - the story. I have not at this time played any other Tomb Raider games, before or after (though I hope to play Rise Of and any sequels in future), but this story stands alone quite well. The progression with the gradual exposition of background plot is directed very well. Lara starts out inexperienced and weak, just trying to survive and get back to her crew members, then transitions to doing what she must to get home, and finally becomes a warrior, a champion, coping with loss all around her yet determined to never give up. When she calls to her enemies in defiance, you know she is not to be trifled with.If you haven't played this game, honestly you should give it a go. It is a very gripping game that, like a good book, you won't want to put down."

It's been 2 times now that I thought it's over and that's the final part, but surprise there's more and that's a positive. I also caught 2 rabbits sexing, check the screenshot on my profile."

If there is anything that i should nitpick on it's the fact that (believe it or not) this game has a Multiplayer mode, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that that multiplayer never really took off, much like attempts at multiplayer in games like Bioshock 2. Still, that doesn't mean that it ruins the Single Player experience, which delivers lots of exploration, weapon customizations, interesting story and interesting maps that are sure to get any history interested people curious to investigate the fine wreck filled scenery."

Extremely well done reboot of the franchise. The story is enticing enough on its own that I kept going just to find out what happens next. Mixed in with some satisfyhing tomb raiding and weapons/upgrade system, I enjoyed every minute that I've played. The attention to detail was very noticable. Loved all the little nuiances (pics in the credits, nice touch!), that when put together such as this really sets it apart. Graphics look amazing, When does the sequel come out? I'm buying it."

It is restart for the story and it takes different route. I liked it tho. I am sure that you will like it as well. Anyway the story was built up pretty darn good. She started as a weakling and built up to a badass b*tch. Which was quite interesting and logical. Could play the story in one go. Not too long and it kept interest up.There is also a skillsystem. Which lets you choose what you want to get better at first (can farm all of them ""exp, lvling system""). Can learn relic hunt, just animal hunt, different killing methots and much more. Pretty cool.Puzzles were not too difficult. But I loved the exploring and challenges the game offered. After finishing the story you can go back to old places and look for relics, documents and do challenges to finish game 100% and earn achievement. Graphics  were beautiful. Couldn't go all maxed tho, since my baby is not so powerful. *cries in the corner* Game has lot of possible death scenes, some were quite scary but it made the game more interesting for some might be disturbing.Character movement was on spot as well, did not have any problems with it. Had nice animations. + wall climbing.Combat system was perfect. Bow, rifle, pistol and shotgun. In game you earn some salvage and with it you can upgrade your weapons to give them better stats. Game gave a chance either play in stealth or jump into gun fire and take it like a boss, which was nice. There is also Multiplayer, which is sadly pretty dead. To earn all the achievements you do need to do lot of farming which is possible to solo and for some you need help from others, because some modes are not played in regular basis, which can headache with earning them. Anyway I strongly recommend the game. I enjoyed my time with it.Reviewed by xTzharkz."

Some of the views thanks to some amazing graphics are completely mind blowing, and the character creation was, in my opinion, not the worst. Problems I have is how Lara Croft is nothing like what you expect. For example, the first time she kills something, she completely regrets it, theres a 2 minute scene (hyperbole) of her 'opening' a deer, then 3 seconds later, she is capable of doing it in like 1 second. I will admit, I have not finished this game, but I feel that the story so far is superb. The main problem that people have with this game is that it isnt traditional to the collection. Tomb Raider used to be all about platforming, not cover shooting and quick time events. The only puzzle elements in this game are in tombs, which are all optional... The game... Is called... Tomb Raider... And they made the tombs optional... Even then the puzzles are so simple they dont feel awarding at the end, especially when all you get is a tiny amount of scrap and 1/3 of a weapon upgrade (sometimes). Furthermore, the dlc... I haven't bought any of it because im not a fan of the online side to this game, but you can but things that can be unlocked by playing the game. I have never approved to this for it completely ruins the game... Furthermore, there is one singleplayer dlc, other than outfits and the upgrades, which is another tomb... I must point out that all of these tombs have no enemies inside them, not even animals, even though their entrances are so obvious, and are indicated everywhere with white paint. I completely understand why people hate this new style of Tomb Raider... But i quite like the combat side of things. The AI isn't as bad as you may think and the upgrade system is great. I for one am a fan of this change, but I completely understand if you hate it. I bought this for £3, though I would have paid alot more, but if your reading this review and the game is cheap, grab it now. If it isn't, go and watch some gameplay and see if you like it. This game is all a matter of personal opinion...Finished the game now and I feel pretty dissapointed with the amount of tombs. Without even realising, I had completed all of them just by exploring mission locations... I feel tempted to buy the DLC but I feel that it would be a waste. The game still lets you view the missions last area so that you can get all the collectibles you miss. Enemies are still around so things like scrap can be still used to upgrade as well as earning xp easily. I must say, the final missions were absolutely great, all of them looked amazing... The side stuff was just a massive let down. Still worth a play, but maybe worth checking for a low price on ♥♥♥."

She is very tough indeed, when most people would've given up, she presses on, gets hurt, endures...The game takes you into a harsh environment on an island where it seems there is no escape, an ancient mystical force prevents you from leaving or being rescued... as Lara, you play the game in a 3rd-person view, just behind her... when aiming your weapons, you have the option to switch which shoulder you want to look over as she aims, left or right... you have a powerful bow which can be upgraded with various arrows, from normal ones to fire arrows, explosive arrows, rope-lines, etc... you also gain a pistol, a shotgun, and a rifle along the way, all of which can also be upgradedThe environments, the atmosphere, the visuals are absolutely stunning... looking off into the distance, seeing the sky, the clouds, the sun, the stars, mountains, trees, rivers, it's all quite breathtaking... it almost makes you forget how hard it is to survive at times when taking in the views, very immersive... the locations vary from mountains, to forests, to the beach and ocean, caves, ancient temples, dirty bloody pits and prison, etc...The story was not incredibly deep or thought-provoking, but it was entertaining, somewhat predictable, a member of your castaway group is not a very good person, and it's obvious, and most of the time you know what's going on before Lara even says anything about it, but again, it's quite entertaining regardlessThere are plenty of collectables and challenges to complete, if that's your thing... myself, personally, I'm an explorer, a scavenger, I like to find every item I can, and I enjoy achievements... I found every collectable and completed every challenge, and have 100% achievements, it's not a super long game, but I spent about 26 hours on it, and enjoyed every second... 9.5/10"

Considering this game was released in 2013, the game itself overall is AMAZING. Fascinating story mode. It's immersive, very straightforward and practically no distractions. Animation and graphics are amazing and notably well-synchronized (considered the technology level in 2013) Story theme based on the legend of Himiko, Yamatai (Ancient Japan) Simple and intuitive playstyle. Story itself is relatively short, roughly ~20 hours depends on how fast you rush the story. Literally no side missions that is relatable to story mode which is the main reason caused the game so short. Less challenging, super easy ancient tomb puzzle compared to its sequel ROTTR.I like both Tomb Raider and ROTTR many ways in a nutshell even the 2018 movie. I indeed enjoyed the game very much, playing it slowly and immersive. I spent a lot of time with this game during offline mode too (that's why I have a relatively short gameplay hours record). Definitely worth its full price for what it is (you may wait for it on sales if you don't want to pay full-price for a 6-year-old game)."

Well, I don't think so. Every tomb is optional and very straight forward, every puzzle is a lot easier than the previous game, I personaly like this way as well because this improves the pacing of the story which is (combined with the awesome gameplay) the main focus. The game, like the first three games features great visuals. Great voices action specialy from Lara Croft (Camilla Luddington) and Roth (Robin Atkin Downes). This is the kind of reboot that any game would want to be. Not to be forgotten that this game has a competitive multiplayer component and it's not that bad.Score: 9/10."

This game is amazing, starting out with the graphics and the world itself. Both are just perfect, the number of detail put into Tomb Raider is great and the graphics look absolutely gorgeous with some beautiful locations! Right from the start the game grabs you and makes you want to explore the world to find out what happened! One thing you encounter alot in the story are cutscenes/ scripted parts where you'll ask yourself, will i survive this? And unlike alot of other games this just works. Something else done right is seeing Lara grow, from an insecure little girl to a monster killing everybody on her path. Even though they could've done this alot better, it's nice to see your character grow instead of him/her beeing a hero right from the start. This way you kinda build a relation with Lara. The story can be predictable at times but overall is fun and immersive with a satisfying ending.Tomb Raider has some fun mechanics like distracting enemy's to lure them away from certain locations, climbing walls, pulling objects with your rope and much more! Upgrading your weapons is fun and addicting as well! Throughout the world you find weapon parts and salvage to upgrade your gear and unlock skills.I highly recommend Tomb Raider to anyone who likes action games with a taste of exploration and RPG-like elements."

She is faced with challenges along the way as she discovers the secrets of the island....The story of the game is just splendid ^_^ It's  well written and easy to follow, with lots of twists and turns that will keep you on edge.... I can't spoil it so you'll just have to find out for yourself. The character development is also very well executed and so is the superb voice acting.The visuals are beautiful. I can't get enough of how rich the environments are. Every place feels different from the last one and it doesn't feel repetetive. Partner that with the amazing musical score of Jason Graves and you've got a Masterpiece....On towards the gameplay..... smooth movements, no camera issues, auto-crouching when enemies are nearby, aiming is easy and well done and it's so satisfying to perform headshots on enemies :D You also have survival instincts which points out enemies, animals (for hunting), artifacts, and crucial items you need to progress... Difficulty is just about right. On easy, Lara is pretty much indestructible :/ so you need not worry about dying all the time XD although you need to be fast during the QTE or she will die a very gruesome death -_-Overall Experience: Wow....

But this doesn't change the fact that not only is this a great and entertaining game, it is also the first Tomb Raider that made me see Lara as more than a pair of polygonal boobs doing stuff. For the first time I actually felt that she was a full-fledged character, not a mere game-mechanism or worse still a caricature. Fans of the original game's sense of exploration shouldn't be disappointed either. The game may take place in just one island but the areas you will find yourself in are nothing short of stunning. If there is one thing to complain about, it is the dissonance between the player's actions and Lara's feelings. Lara is portrayed as green, struggling to place her life above those of her assailants and visibly tormented the first time she has to kill a person. At the same time, the player is encouraged to employ increasingly ruthless tactics and kill with abandon. It just doesn't sit right. Also I suppose the multiplayer experience is, I guess, a bit underwhelming. If it matters to you, its another thing to consider. Personally I'm not interested in multiplayer, so for me this doesn't change all that much.All in all, this is a great game. And it's highly recommended."

With multiple artifacts and GPS tags scattered across the world there is always something to find. The story is well paced and stays interesting, graphically the game holds up very well with a plethora of visual options to keep it relevant many years after release. The game runs well on modest hardware provided you don't enable tressfx, which in my opinion is buggy anyways (Much better implemented in the sequel both visually and functionally). Never cared to try the multiplayer but on a sale this game is a steal and well worth it for the single player experience alone. The game takes anywhere from 10-15 hours to complete and is well worth your time."

This is thus my first foray into this type of game, and I wouldn’t have likely started with these titles if Tomb Raider hadn’t been available for the low price of $0.00 on Steam a while back. So how does this 2013 title hold up in 2020?For a 2013 title, Tomb Raider doesn’t look bad, though I would hold it is also far from being a visual leader for its time. 2013 also saw the release of visually impressive titles like Metro: Last Light, Crysis 3, and Battlefield 4, all of which  edge out Tomb Raider in visual fidelity. That being said, Tomb Raider was a high-budget production at the time, and it is visually consistent and decent looking in the typical AAA-game fashion, even if its gritty, realistic style prevents it from standing the test of time as well as more visually stylised titles can. Tomb Raider does seem to take issue with modern hardware, however, as water surfaces seem to consistently bug out on an RTX GPU. Beyond that, there are no other visual artifacts or issues to deal with, so Tomb Raider offers up a sort of middling AAA-tier performance in the visual department.Audio design in Tomb Raider is generally acceptable. Voice acting is done well enough, even if the characters themselves leave something to be desired, and said actors deliver their given lines respectably. Combat sounds were far from memorable, but were not bad, and ambient sounds also did the job. Music was also present but forgettable, ambient in the vein of the 2016 DOOM reboot but nowhere near as distinct. Still, I should at least commend the weapon sounds, as many other third-person shooters wind up with distressingly weak weapon sound design, a fault which Tomb Raider mostly avoids.I found performance to be generally good, with Tomb Raider running at an uncapped framerate easily and with no crashes at any point. I did encounter a single bug that necessitated reloading from a checkpoint, but this set me back barely 30 seconds, and I had no other issues throughout apart from the aforementioned visual artifacts with water surfaces.Unfortunately, Tomb Raider likely won’t keep you captivated with its gameplay. The shooting mechanics are tolerable if unimpressive, and the climbing system is similarly decent, but they are rarely employed in particularly interesting ways. There is a hilarious and disorienting amount of camera shake while running, and strafe-running also forces the camera to pan in the direction you are moving (both needless issues that were fixed in the sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider). Still, the weapons are serviceable at first and later become somewhat entertaining, as your shotgun gains the ability to fire incendiary rounds and your pistol receives a suppressor. These mechanics are fairly run-of-the-mill, and they are not entirely good or bad in their own right - it lies in how the game employs these mechanics that the gameplay becomes either good or bad, as I will explain further below.Critics have lauded Tomb Raider for its story. Imagine my disappointment, then, to discover that Tomb Raider’s plot falls completely flat, suffering from glaring pacing issues, an overabundance of cutscenes for sections that ought to have been implemented as actual gameplay, and a protagonist that has supposedly been humanized compared to past incarnations but who instead comes off as a dual-personality, military-trained killer, acting like a wet noodle in cutscenes and gunning down and  droves of enemies during actual gameplay. The game opts in many sequences to force the player into quick-time events, pyrotechnics-filled linear pathways, and mandatory slow-walking and/or crawling hallways, not to mention shooting galleries full of cultists. Those cultists serve as an utterly irredeemable antagonist faction, unlimited in number and both comically evil and ineffectual, all in a supposedly gritty and cinematic game.Between gameplay sections, linear or otherwise, Tomb Raider overwhelms the player with cutscenes, wherein Lara continually fails to learn from virtually anything that has occurred throughout the plot. The game seems to relish in injuring and punishing Lara, leaving us with a whimpering, bleeding protagonist seemingly constantly on the cusp of death if not for their Wolverine-like constitution. These injuries and this constant disempowerment of Lara seem to be for shock value more than anything else, and they nearly feel like playing out someone’s sadomasochistic fetish in a video game, seriously contributing to the game’s sense of ludonarrative dissonance - the gap between narrative and mechanics.While the gameplay in those less linear sections is bearable, the enemies you fight become more aggravating as the plot progresses, with the island’s improbable hordes of lemming-like cultists donning metal plating for armor, turning themselves into veritable bullet-sponges. Thus, the singleplayer component of Tomb Raider - the only reason to play it - fails to leverage its mechanics in an interesting or enjoyable way, fails to craft a compelling narrative, and fails to provide the player with any reason to suspend their disbelief and actually take the game seriously. I pushed through and completed the campaign, and even the supposedly better latter third of the game was eminently frustrating.There isn’t much to speak of with regards to multiplayer content. Tomb Raider did include a multiplayer component, but it is less than stellar, and virtually dead as a result. There are several game modes, including more typical deathmatch variants and objective-based modes more relevant to the Tomb Raider theme. Still, I would compare this to Far Cry 3, which had a multiplayer community for a while, but which has basically fallen off since then. It was arguably a mistake to devote development time to a multiplayer mode like this, as Crystal Dynamics has clearly not found a hit comparable to those of EA or Activision.Tomb Raider features no support for community content, and this is much to my chagrin as one of the only user-created ""patches"" for the game is no longer maintained and does not work with the latest version of Tomb Raider. At least a few of my gripes with the game - such as enemy armor and camera controls - might have been fixed through community content, but Crystal Dynamics has not deigned to throw us a bone here, and Tomb Raider’s engine is fairly uncooperative for community content when compared to others. The lack of support for community content here isn’t quite as insulting as it was in DOOM 2016, but it still stings a little when there are easy fixes that could be implemented by the community.I’m still trying to figure out who Tomb Raider was made for. The ludonarrative dissonance in this title is overwhelming, and while the game seems to want the player to take its plot seriously, that plot is so contrived that I often couldn’t help but roll my eyes and wait for the cutscenes to end. There are inklings of something good in Tomb Raider, but they are often overshadowed by the game’s aggravating linear sections and absurd pyrotechnics. Thus, the overwhelming praise this title has heretofore received is curious to me, when it seems to be more in the vein of Mirror’s Edge - a flawed title that had some good ideas, but which is still deserving of criticism as a result of its flaws. The difference is that Mirror’s Edge is short, while Tomb Raider overstays its welcome. I paid zero dollars for Tomb Raider - and I’m content with that price tag, because I wouldn’t consider it for more than $5 USD as a result of its faults."

Single Player is lengthy (13 hours i got trying to get as many collectibles and tombs done) and i mostly like the gameplay. Some puzzles here and there but not too hard. Lara Croft was a great character, but the others were lacking.Keybindings was bad. When i just started the game it showed me a hand symbol (no idea why they can't just show me what key i had to press) when struggling against an attacker. Had no clue what was the corresponding key. Took sometime to find it in button mapping and a couple frustrating deaths. This game has too many QTE events unfortunately. Now the multiplayer is garbage. You find hardly any matches and often it's against prestiged players who often are also hackers. I was once shooting a guy, he quickly disappeared in solid rock, then when i passed by he shot me in back.So play this only for Single Player and make sure you know all the keybindings before you get to your first QTE.

Tomb Raider was developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. The game is set in an island within the Dragon's Triangle, which is south of Japan. Tomb Raider is an excellent and extremely entertaining game for any gamer that enjoys adventure games combined within a beautiful and tight environment. You, the player, play as Lara Croft, who is an archaeologist that travels to the Dragon's Triangle on an expedition with several other individuals. This review will cover the campaign, which includes missions, characters and voice acting and the story, features and gameplay, the graphics, sound and performence, and the issues within each category.Campaign: The campaign is excellent. The campaign is intense and has high-action scenes in a tight environment. A tight environment is essentially a very small environment instead of a wide open space. This fits in with the overall setting and story, as the game is set on an island, so other than the beach there is very minimal open landscapes. So, while travelling to Dragon's Triangle, you end up stranded on the island with Lara having to uncover why and how to overcome it to get off the island. The campaign has plentiful variety in its missions, as each mission is different and accomplishes something different. However, the game is linear with its missions. Despite being linear, the route to complete each objective has alternative routes that take you to places to collect relics, treasuries and learn more about the backstory of the island. Speaking of backstory, the game's side-quests, for instance, collecting journals, add to the story because they provide new insightful information within the island, meaning the side-quests are not filler. These side-quests, which are also in the main missions, have puzzles, which are challenging and fun. I played this game on normal difficulty, which is the middle in easy, normal, and hard. I found it to be relatively decent in difficulty, with it progressively becoming harder. I completed this game in around 9.5 hours.The characters are extremely well-done. The characterisation of many characters fit in with the overall stranded on an island storyline. For instance, from the start of the game and progressing through the game one of the members in your crew starts to get crazy and very on edge. Likewise, the characterisation of Lara showcases her toughness and courage. All main characters within the game have a strong sense of purpose and throughout the game add personality elements, which make it easy to invest into their characters - especially the antagonist, Mathias. These characters and their personalities are also accompanied by the brilliant disparate voice acting of all characters. The voice acting fits in perfectly with the variety of atmospheres. For instance, if it is raining and Lara has to yell out to another character you can tell in her higher voice tone, likewise, if she is in extreme pain, you can notice it when she talks. Gameplay/Features:This game utilises a character progression system. You can upgrade your skills and can upgrade your weapons, which prove beneficial. There is three sections in the player upgrade system, which is survivor, hunter, and brawler skills. The hunter and brawler skills prove the most useful and the survivor tree has some nice skills, but mostly is pointless. The survivor tree is not useful because the game is linear, so while you encounter animals, you do not encounter them enough to warrant upgrading those particular skills. The game has plentiful supply of ammo. The climbing is solid. The game is relatively unrealistic in parts. There were cutscenes in which Lara severely hurts herself, but the next day she is miraculously healed. It is somewhat minor, but annoying. The game, as mentioned, has a tight atmosphere, which means the movement can get clunky, slightly disturbing the experience.Graphics, Sound and Performence:I played this game on max settings and what a refreshing experience. The graphics are extremely beautiful. The environment and atmosphere within the game's various weathers are excellent. The game has strong destruction elements that align with the action-packed game. The camera angles within the game are superb. I love the different angles that the game portrays the cutscenes from, which allows for a higher quality gameplay experience. The graphics incorporate very neat and deep touches into the characters. For instance, if Lara falls and slides across rocks, there is grazes and dirt on her body, in amazing detail. Performence is very optimised and I love the fluidity of the game with a constant framerate. I hit a constant 30-45FPS, which had no noticeable performence drops, FPS drops, and the typical stutters when there is a drop in FPS. The sound is beautiful. The light sounds of the wind contrasts the heavy action and it allows for a nice balance.Overall, this game is superb. I really enjoyed this game and the story within. There were several positives such as the campaign, the content, the graphics, the sound and mostly the gameplay. I did not notice many issues within the game other than what was noted in the gameplay section. This game has a nice length and packs in explosive action. This game is $19.99 and I highly recommend it at full price.Campaign/Characters: 9.5/10Gameplay/Features: 8.5/10Graphics, Sound and Performence: 9.75/10Overall: 9.25/10Thanks for reading my review!

Even though the cutscenes tried to be as dramatic as possible, the voice acting was just okay to me.Besides that the graphics looked fine and the controls were simple to play. Whether I played on a keyboard and mouse or a controller, I was suprised how smooth the controls were. The gunfights were good and the map was quite big to explore different areas on it. By collecting different sorts of tools, you are able to upgrade your weapons and become more resistant towards your enemies and learn more about the cult. I had a lot of fun exploring the different areas and solve puzzles, too. The puzzles were not always simple, but fun to play and every fan of the Tomb Raider franchise will definitely like it.Unfortunately the multiplayer mode of this game is barely played by anyone nowadays. Even though the multiplayer was quite fun, I still wish more players would be playing it.Overall the game created a good combination of gunfights and exploring/ solving puzzles for me. The balance between these two aspects was done really well, so I do recommend playing this game. If you are a fan of Tomb Raider, then this will be a different side to Lara that you might not have witnessed before and experience her own progress during the game."

A Lara Croft original era viciada em adrenalina e sarcástica, essa ousadia rara era exatamente o que a tornava tão carismática que até a minha avó a conhecia. O reboot não é mais realista, além de ter mapa e visão de raio-X que arruínam o propósito de exploração, apresenta uma morena aleatória de camisa azul sem carisma que nunca esteve em perigo de repente sabendo fazer gambiarra em armas e matando 500+ homens treinados.

I always had a special fondness for the gameplay - mixing puzzles, platforming, and action adventure.  Just that it had gotten rather stale over the years.  I cannot express my gratitude enough in bringing this newest Tomb Raider to the world.  Excellent gameplay mixed with a very entertaining story honestly makes this shine.  It could have gone bad in so many ways, but it manages to mix the old style of play with a new take without becoming a grind or cheesy.  YES, there are scenes that are super-Rambo inspired, but it's a video game after all.  We all need that bit of escape.  Well acted, well directed, executed flawlessly, and really very accessible compared to previous games.  Lots of achievements and hidden items to find too.  Love the map!  Normal difficulty might be too easy for battle hardened gamers.  There were not many spots to get stuck on and I'm terrible at shooters.  I love the action button for basic melee combat and it was hard not to use the arrows for everything as it's much better than guns.Never had so much fun before jumping through the action sequences.  Flaming buildings, exploding bridges, and hordes of undead soldiers, yay!  She's a survivor in more ways than one.  Glad this ""reboot"" will  change the franchise in it's new direction. A fine adventure and can't wait for the next.  Will have to go back and finish my old Tomb Raider games now to get my TR fix until the next is available on steam."

They try to make it into a movie, which is nice and all. But most of the time you feel less like the director, but more like the guy who presses the play button - and that makes the game very boring.You have very little freedom or even challenges. I found this game to be very simple to complete.I guess the ""fun"" is supposed to be in completing all the objects and collecting all the relics. But this seems only to appeal to people with compulsive disorder a la ""I need to have them all"", but there is no fun in that. It seems more like work to me.If at least the story would pull you in a bit more. Relatable characters or maybe a love affair to spice it up. But none of that. it's simply a linear movie where you push the play button and try to get high on collecting items.Big PLUS for supporting Linux. I really appreciate that, but in the end this is a game review and not a laudation for supporting alternative, free and open operating systems.Thus I can NOT recommend this game."

I have to say, for a game that came out 6 years ago the graphics are absolutely gorgeous. I'm a sucker for hair fx when they're put in games and it's crazy how insanely realistic everything in this game looks regardless. But, then again I did play this originally on console so it's absolute eye candy to me even if I put all my settings on low lol. Anyway, the story is just as great as I remember. You'll find yourself lost in it pretty quickly to the point where you binge. If you're anything like me you'll end up saying things like ""well let me just do ____ real quick before I get off."" Then next thing you know, you end up playing for another hour of more. I think Square Enix really did this rebooted Tomb Raider franchise the justice it deserved.

Indeed this game does look rather impressive.For me it was the gameplay. It was just a very linear story. You will move from A to B to C. Somewhere in between those you might be able to collect a few Easter eggs--literally, there are eggs you can collect--but they don't serve any purpose. There was vague story but it just be seemed to bloated with fetch quests. You had only one thing to do, and only one way to do it.To clarify a bit: when I say linear, compare this to two other games that take place on island environments: Just Cause 2 and Far Cry 3. In both of those games the Island is yours to explore and do what you want with. In this game you don't have that option. Often the puzzle you just solved will block the way you came leaving you with one way forward.This is where I wish Steam offered an ""It's alright"" option.

Gameplay works just as the developers intended.   Lots of collectibles that reward you with lore, gallery images, models and pretty much everything is rewarding enough.   Took me 20 hours to see and collect just about everything the game has to offer. It would probably take half that time to complete it without being as thorough as I've been, and the game lets you free roam after the story is done.   Couldn't ask for anything more but I could have asked for something less. DLCs.   The Tombs were a bit disappointing. They are not as challenging or as long as I would have hoped. The Tomb of the Lost Adventurer DLC took me less than 5 minutes to complete and that says it all.Still, I recommend this title without any reservations and even if the DLCs are sort of bad, for a AAA title that offers so much and got -80% offers you should really get the GOTY edition. No reason not to."

Yeah, 2013 game, finnished in 22.07.2015, oh well. You don't need a lot of time to finnish it, tho'. Approximative 8-9 hours of storytime (without many checkpoint restarts), but without all the collectables available on the map (although, 72% completion from the first try).Anyway, I don't even know from where to start this review. This is the best action game I had played so far. Just go on and make your bags, you'll go on a feels trip more or less, as soon as you start the game. My review doesn't contain any spoiler, so it's safe to read.This game has it all: action, stealth, killing enemies in full Lara Croft style (with your bow), EPIC AND TOUCHY STORYLINE (although it's on the SF side, it's awesome, touchy and emotional), graphics and Lara Croft in HD :D.- Going over the storyline, there isn't many things I could say without spoiling stuff. It's well made, although it's linear, meaning you can't make any decisions, you just go as it was developed. Environment and map movement is nearly the same, you can't really make any mistakes missing the main quest or getting lost around. It has many emotional moments, cutscenes and brings up in first place, beside the main reason of the storyline, Lara's transformation (play the game and you'll see :P).- Mechanics are well made, and beside two times when I pressed 'W' to jump up on a ledge, and Lara decided it might be a better idea to jump towards the right, right off the mountain and die, there's nothing more to say. There are hardly any bugs around, and it's all well made. You can either be one with the shadows, and stealthy go and kill people with your bow, or just go full rambo. You choose.- Graphics are nice and detailed, played it maxed out on 1080p, on my GTX760. That TressFX hair effect makes Lara Croft look even more real than it already is. Overall, Tomb Raider 2013, is an amazing experience, and it sure is a great revival of the series (which to be honest, I didn't played, only watched on YouTube). So, you can say it was my first Tomb Raider experience, and sure felt in love with this game. Best ~9hours I spent in singleplayer gaming so far.And let's face it. Why don't you want to play this game, when you are playing as the lovely Lara Croft?  :D10/10"

When the game allows you to take part in the action, it plays like a poorly made third-person shooter with rudimentary mechanics, and firearms that operate like nerf guns. The games set pieces are gorgeous, if only to provide a backdrop to the repetitive climbing segments. The last 3 hours I spent in game, I was looking out the window and playing with one hand. On a keyboard. Its that mind numbingly simple.I had such high hopes for the product, with nothing but 9/10 reviews. I can't even bring myself finish it.

Our main character is a young woman, just beginning her work as a researcher, who decided to go on an expedition in the team of a well-known archaeologist. However, the ship that our heroine is sailing is sinking and we find ourselves on an island that will not let us leave at any cost.What is important is that the game allows us to explore the open world and I admit that it worked out very well for the creators, because the locations are interesting, dark and looking for various secrets is really interesting. And of course the open world, which looks beautiful. All locations complement each other and fit together.The game offers us an arsenal of weapons, although the main weapon of our heroine is definitely a bow, which serves us throughout the game. In addition, we have a wait, thanks to which we can climb the walls. We also have firearms, like pistol, shotgun and rifle, but nothing gives us such satisfaction as shooting from a bow. A bow can also be used to confuse your opponents.The graphics in the game are made carefully. Noteworthy are the cutscenes, which are made very well.  The creators have also made a lot of effort in terms of detail. Sometimes, if something doesn't go our way and Lara gets hurt, the developers didn't let us not see it. And the views are very pretty.It is also worth noting how good a soundtrack is in the game. Pleasant songs are interestingly composed with the sounds of the island. We also have the opportunity to listen to the dialogues of the opponents, which are usually related to the current situation.One of the worse things in the game is multiplayer mode, which is not very interesting.However, this is not the most important element of the gameTomb Raider is a very good game. The 18 hours I've spent in the game I consider well used. Interesting storyline, nice graphics and nice soundtrack are some of the biggest advantages of this game. In addition, the open world and exploration, which add variety to the gameplay."

Some times your enemy asked you to forgive him and keep him alive so that was supreme.Perfect voice acting,as same as real life character making noise in hard works.I don't know how to explain gun fires and nature noises like wind,just can say it was awesome.There wasn't any problem like low frame rate while playing game and I reck on old PC can play it with out problems.As I alude to short story you can finish game in a week but you can have one of your best adventure.It's worthy and you won't regret ,so add it to your cart now.Its bundle is worthy too you can have all of Tomb raiders with all DLCsI definitely recommend buying this game.Total Score: 8Thank you for reading my review."

With a more modern, down to earth but still adventurous look and a smaller breast size this Lara would complement her adventures instead of taking away from them due to her sexualized appearance. She’s still incredibly sexy, mind you, but she fits the tone the game is aiming for and blends in nicely with the scenery.Since this is a reboot we get to see Lara anew: she’s a little different than before, but deep down still the same Lara we always knew. She just has to learn the ropes again. She doesn’t have that killer attitude like she had in the first series of games. In fact, Lara hasn’t killed before the start of this game so it’s a real reboot indeed.We’ll see Lara grow into a full blown gritty survivor and archeologist during this game’s journey. And it’s the reason the game begins rather slowly and linear. It’s all about the character’s development. And it works: being stranded on a mysterious island will change Lara in many ways during the course of the game. She’ll has to survive by killing animals and, eventually, humans. Her first human kill naturally has an emotional and devastating impact on her. However, and this is unfortunate in my opinion, not much later she’ll be viciously slaughtering tens of enemies, which gives off somewhat of a mixed feeling. From that point onwards the character development seems to shift to story development. But in the end it’s all for the sake of survival, naturally.This new Tomb Raider fittingly plays out in a Metroidvania type of manner. In hindsight you’re wondering why they didn’t come up with this before as it feels like such a natural fit for the series. Like a true Metroidvania you start with some basic weapons and tools and continually you’ll acquire more with which you can access new or previously inaccessible areas, treasures and more.You will quickly acquire an climbing axe and a handmade bow, a valuable tool and weapon. Later on you’ll also be able get an assault rifle or a shotgun, for example. The guns feel good to use, but I myself preferred the bow because it allows for stealthy kills, and I am generally more a fan of using stealth. But if you’re the type that usually goes in guns blazing there’s also the possibility to do that. These choices, although simple, give the game a fresh and, unknowingly, much needed element. Enemies and objects can also be highlighted by the press of a button, as we’ve seen in many other games before.Almost everything you do will earn you experience which you can use to level up. Together with the materials you find you’ll also be able to craft and upgrade weapons and tools. All of this is done at the many different bonfires you can lit across the island.Speaking of the island; it’s a big open island where you can go into multiple directions. It looks amazing with a ton of setpieces for the story itself and some breathtaking scenery for when you get to take a breather (or when you have finished the game, since you can then continue and look for missed treasure). And since it’s a Metroidvania the world is also connected in an amazing, logical, but still natural way.New to this Tomb Raider are the tombs. And in similar fashion to the older games the island also houses quite a few environmental puzzles. But let’s get back to the tombs for a minute. These are self-contained, sometimes devious, puzzles that can be solved in a few to 15 minutes and will earn you treasure for your already growing collection. These are fun to do, but I wish there were more *and* that they were bigger.The game lasts about 20-25 hours if you want to do everything.I can’t really think of any cons for this game, except for maybe the fact that it sometimes overuses the quick-time events (QTE). And obviously the tombs that would’ve been much better or at least fun if they were only a few sizes bigger. Thankfully, the sequels fix this issue.Other than that, I found this game to be pretty much perfect fun, 100%ing it entirely (and later its sequel: Rise Of The Tomb Raider).As far as the graphics are concerned Tomb Raider still impresses with excellent lighting and physics. Lara looks realistic and moves with grace, as you would expect, and the details on her clothes and body (especially when in and out of the water) will almost make you think she’s real. Almost.Camilla Luddington does an amazing job at portraying a grounded Lara. She reacts like one would expect. The other voice actors do an equally good job, but Camilla stands out without a doubt.This Tomb Raider reboot exceeded all of my expectations and then some. It’s just a game that is such a joy to play. The new Lara Croft is grounded and realistic and the Metroidvania-like gameplay fits the series like a glove. Unfortunately, the newer titles aren’t build the same way – they’re great games in their own way, however – but that makes this one even more special I think. Highly recommended!"

That's not necessarily a bad thing, but if you're looking for some challenging puzzles you won't find them here.The story is not that great. You can guess the ending very early on. The game is filled with cutscenes that are usually longer than they should and at times it feels more like you're watching a movie than playing a game. Probably the worst part of the story is the number of times Lara gets hurt, stabbed, falls, etc... and how she's still able to run, jump, climb, shoot bad guys, etc... as if nothing had happened.The game feels more frustrating than fun."

Had the presets set to ultimate so seeing each strand of Lara's hair moving about her head was mesmerizing. Game play was fun. Between combat and puzzles it kept the flow of the game interesting. The melee was a little funky to work out but once you knew how to time the hits it worked out fine. Zip lines, mountain climbing, gun play, it all felt natural. Story line was decent. There were a few times I had to question the plot choices but there wasn't anything I'd consider terrible. Dialog is funny, especially listening to enemies talk to one another.I took a little over 17 hours to play the campaign, max out all of the skills and guns, find all of the maps, gps caches, documents, and relics.

Music and design remind me in a way of Uncharted more than Tomb Raider which was more reminiscent of the Prince of Persia series. Also, the system of upgrades suits the game perfectly, combat feels more dynamic and it is enjoyable to find stealth options for solving various situations.What is more, the locations of this part bring a unique feeling of discovery and enjoyment of beating, which somehow brings me back to the feelings when I experienced for the first time Resident Evil 4 (2005).Music and atmosphere have also changed from the old parts, for sure it works as a better experience which holds you to the end of the game. For sure I cannot say that story is the strongest aspect of the game, but cutscenes, monologues of the protagonist and progression of character development through experience are visible.Without a doubt, I recommend this part of Tomb Raider simply because it is a great adventure bringing you to the Indiana Jones experience, yet when you are in his role, and playing as a pretty lady.reVote 9/10"

I can't imagine a more ludonarratively dissonant experience.""Crystal Dynamics: ""Hold my beer.""Part of me wants to recommend this game as it genuinely made me laugh out loud, due to how bizarrely the story it wants to tell clashes with the actual things it asks you to do. The speed with which Lara goes from her very human, anguished reaction at her first kill, to mowing down scores of enemies with nary a hint of remorse (while dispensing the odd ""BURN IN HELL!"" towards the corpses of her victims for good measure) has to be seen to be believed. But I just can't do it.The most obvious comparison I can make with this game is, as alluded to above, the Uncharted series. Like those games, this is a heavily narrative-driven experience which makes liberal use of cutscenes, QTE's and the odd bit of borderline cheating game design (for example, you do not have to be at all precise with your jumping in platforming sequences - the game will correct for you if you're veering off-course) to ensure an experience which is as cinematic as possible. The casualty of this design philosophy is the actual experience of play - it's hard to feel the thrill of overcoming a tough and exciting challenge when the ""dramatic building collapse"" sequence you've just played through could have been beaten playing one-handed.In its defence, this is better and more interesting as a game than the Uncharted series. Combat is actually pretty good and does not feature the awful bullet-sponge enemies that plague all of Naughty Dog's games. The puzzles are a bit more interesting than the braindead ""look at your notebook for the answer"" ones Nathan Drake is presented with. And there are customisation options and optional extra sections I don't recall being a feature of any Uncharted game.On the flipside, I don't think this is the kind of game you'd pick up if you were looking for say a rich, mechanically-sound and deep ARPG. This is a story game first and foremost, and it's on these terms, its own terms, that it's only right to offer a final evaluation. The Last Of Us kept me playing to the end, despite being a far worse experience than this, a straight-up turgid abdominal distension of a game, because I genuinely liked the characters and wanted to know what would happen to them. By contrast, the only character in this whose name I could remember was Lara, and the main emotion that had been stirred up in me by the time I decided to call it quits with this game was revulsion at the horrifically gruesome torture porn treatment of the protagonist in cutscenes and quick time events.I'm not opposed to linear story-driven experiences in general, I just think this is an example of the wrong way to go about making them. As an alternative to this I would strongly recommend Batman: Arkham Asylum."

It baffles me why it's regarded as a great one, why there are so many fans and so on.It's simplistic and shallow, it borrows elements of Arkham and Uncharted series, but (beside being unoriginal and stepping away from the genre Core created with the Tomb Raider) it never even achieves their level.Some scenes are cool (like that puzzle in a wooden temple of storm or something), but it by far never achieves superb level of the Underworld. Crystal Dinamics and Square Enix weren't even aiming at that. It's just safe and marketable third person shooter, fine in that regard, full of overused hollywood movies and TV shows cliches. Overall plot is stupid, the lore and its use are laughable, exploration is non-existant.Well, visuals are good and it's polished, it's fine while it lasts. Good product in that regard, I guess. But then there is the sequel, and then there is the franchise sprawing endless horde of sequels based around good old formula ""more of the same"". And that's not even something that really saddens me. What saddens me is the fact, that the genre I loved is dead and this Tomb Raider reboot was the last nail in its coffin. It's success marked the path for its sequels and bland copycats. Wasn't it Tomb Raider, it would've been something else, I guess.

I am a  for horror so I really enjoyed the gore and the mature storyline but I feel like it falls flat on it's face towards the end. The game also had a strong human factor to it as well; displaying her killing animals first then humans in order to survive.. :c sad but necessary. It's definitely a great reboot and I was genuinely terrified for Lara my first playthrough.

Lara is an innocent, smart, resourceful, determined, faithful, confident, and doubtful character. She’s not perfect. She makes mistakes. She experiences setbacks and she doesn’t always succeed. Lara is not a Mary Sue; she has flaws; she’s doubted and challenged by the Endurance crew members; she’s not loved and respected by everyone; she’s a fully realized and interesting character. Through the game, Lara faces challenges that make her stronger and more capable to handle what the island throws at her, and the island throws a metric ton of stuff at her.The story is engaging and the island is packed with interesting details that encourage exploration. The more you explore the grester your desire to understand the island's lore, history, and inhabitants. Everything about this game hits on the things I love most; action, adventure, atmosphere, mystery, discovery, ancient cultures, tomb raiding, shipwrecks, history, and a female protagonist that you don’t roll your eyes at every moment in game.I completely recommend this game for the single player story. For the multiplayer piece of the game… it is as dead in 2021 as it was in 2013 when I first completed the game. Getting friends to be able to join your game is difficult and consider yourself lucky if all players are able join your lobby while you grind through multiplayer achievements. Thankfully, the Tomb Raider community is very willing to help those wanting to complete the multiplayer achievements. The last few were brutal as the multiplayer XP grind is a slow and boring slog of private Rescue matches. By the time I hit rank 60, I had forgotten all about how much I enjoyed the single player story. At the end, I felt only disdain for the multiplayer game."
625,63,Mama Bugg,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heatbugg/,5,,1,44.4,"Posted: January 4, 2014",816,4,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/527680b059b3637302f733039f8c4cd44fca5e6c.jpg,"I've been playing Tomb Raider games since I was a child. At first, I thought they were too scary and I watched as my Dad played the first, second, and third games on his brand new Playstation. I was moral/puzzle support mostly. I'd help him find guides on the internet (no easy task with dial-up!) and we'd have a great time.Since then, Tomb Raider has grown up a bit and so have I. The last generation of games (Legend ,Anniversary, and Underworld) were a great step in a new direction. They sometimes faltered in terms of mechanics, but in overall feel, I still felt the old Tomb Raider vibe I once did with the original style of the game.Now, with this latest reimagining, I've come to find that Lara has taken a lot of influence from Nathan Drake. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING. I once scoffed in this game's direction once I saw what kind of of ideas Crystal Dynamics and SquareEnix  were looking to implement. I am so happy I was wrong.From the very start, there is a real sense that this game was built from the ground up by a team who loves the series as much as I do, as much as any veteran of Tomb Raider does. At times it does go over-the-top with gore and viscera, but it's all there to set a tone that doesn't falter throughout the experience. Yes, that is a lofty word, I know. However, giving this game a chance to entertain you and engulf your senses will give you the best understanding of what it has to offer. There are wildlife that roam many areas, intense weather of all kinds that beat Lara to a pulp, and some of the most incredible mood lighting I can say I've ever seen.Normally, I am not impressed with graphics alone as a measure of a game. Here, I will make an exception. Even on my modest PC, the details of the open-world of this island in the fabled Dragon's Triangle were enough to make me gasp and awe more often than I ever imagined. The scale of the world is something to behold, and once traversed is worth a revisit.When it comes to combat, the series has always been known for a certain ""run and gun"" style. For a long time, that worked well. Now, in the post-Gears of War age, cover shooting has become the new normal. Tomb Raider does adopt this combat style, but with a few caveats. Much of the cover you take is destructible in real time. No more waiting behind walls while your health recovers (at least, not for long). Instead, you have to be fast, accurate, and have a decent idea of what you plan to do to the next enemy who comes your way. Further, the combat has not lost that old TR intensity or dread. On the hard difficulty, combat is frantic. I played the vast majority of the game using only Lara's new signature archery set. Once I got closer to the endgame, I couldn't really hold that together much. I found I began to rely heavily on the assault rifle with the bow on back-up for a bit of fun with the lesser enemies. There are types that go from weak to strong, unarmored to full riot gear (including shields), and they all pose a major threat in one way or another. Many times, it's from one of their well placed fire arrows or sticks of dynamite.Finally, you have a choice to make. Often times, you must face enemies head on in a seemingly insurmountable wave. Other times, you can practice stealth. When given the choice, always go stealth. You can distract guards Metal Gear style by shooting arrows near them so they will investigate. You can also shoot out any nearby light source. At first, you'll have to take them down strictly with arrows. Later, you do get special stealth kills that make this more fun and far less daunting.Moving on to mechanics, Lara's new style of environment traversal varies so much throughout the game, it is a staggering feat that I could even keep up. Mechanics are constantly introduced, and with such frequency, that I never felt as though jumping, climbing, or sliding ever become routine or mundane. From shear face rock climbing to transporting up a zipline, this game has a great sense of keeping the player involved in the movement forward.The upgrade system doesn't feel as rough or tacked on as I thought. It even makes sense within the context of the story. Since Lara is freshly graduated from university and off on her first trip, she knows nothing of survival. With time, she becomes a force to be reckoned with. The cost of such strength, you ask? That would be salvage, the game's currency. You can gather it from caches strewn through the environment and from felled enemies. Depending on what skills you have obtained, you'll get a bit more, especially for special kills. I was sure to spend it all as frequently as I could, and I would recommend the same to anyone. Touching again on the story, this game does a very good job of showing the progression of Lara as a character who truly grows due to her experience on the island. At first, she's as green as she could possibly be. But near the end she's calculated, aware, and daring. The other characters serve to drive her towards greatness. A few feel a little flat. However, I will admit to choking back some tears and feeling some chills once or twice. Yes, it may evoke emotions in you, too.Now for the bad news. In what I feel is a major oversight, the devs decided to go with regenerative health for Lara. Yes, I can understand that health packs are a bit outdated for the newest generation. However, there's no real reason they couldn't have implemented some kind of self-care system ala Snake Eater. Since salvage is currency, finding bandages, salves, or other medical supplies on your kills could have worked great! It also would have added a lot more tension to combat. Conversly, I can undertand why they didn't do this. Stoping the frantic pace of the action so Lara can heal herself is unrealistic in a more visceral way than Wolverine powers. It was in Snake Eater as well. I only think it would have made a great story device.Next, upgrading the weaponry seems a little forced, but it's not tacky. I just don't understand how someone like Lara, with no combat experience, could figure out how to fashion a better grip for her pistol or a more efficient slide for her rifle. It is a matter of video game logic, but it's not totally glaring.What is very in-your-face, however, is Lara's sometimes inconsistent behavior. This is especially true during cutscenes. Yes, we've all heard of this issue in other games (Uncharted) and it remains true here. After already being a total bad-ass via my control in gameplay, Lara (late in the game mind you) gets squemish and shy to the point where it causes an unnecessary character death. A bit of refinement or better reasoning would have helped in these situations.Overall, Tomb Raider is a fine addition to the Library of anyone who loves strong character action games. It is fun, gorgeous, and worth the time it takes to complete, which I'd estimate is ~15 hours if you don't search for many extras. Pick it up when you can, and watch as a new kind of Lara is born."

Sounds promising, huh? In large part, this anticipation turns out to be true.When reading this review, note I didn't play any other Tomb Raider games before this one. I might now though, inspired by this prelude.Game begins with the very green heroine Lara Croft shipwrecking on a mysterious island with her friends. At first she's helpless, with no weapons nor other equipment to get by. Combined with the circumstance that almost everyone is out to get her, this brings about a unique feeling of vulnerability that diminishes as she grows to become an effortless killing machine.First thing that I noticed was the near-photorealistic graphics. Awe-inspiring, I spent some moments just looking at the scenery and studying the nature and architecture, though this was hard because I was also constantly distracted by feeling danger all around myself. The atmosphere was very well done. You could even experience it in 3D with the right hardware, but unfortunately I don't possess that and couldn't try it.By gameplay, Tomb Raider is a combination of third-person shooter and 3D platformer with minor RPG elements. Then again you can take most enemies out by sneak attacks if you prefer that. You have to deal with different quick-time events from time to time both in-combat and in the more traditional way during scripted events within story. That's actually one of my few complaints: it's sometimes difficult to deduce which keys you are supposed to press during these events, as apparently the key tip disappears under the screen. Fortunately this matters less later when you learn to identify between the events.Edit: Oh, I totally forgot. One thing that bugged me for the whole game. There are ammo literally everywhere! You have to actually be shooting like crazy to run out of ammo.Another minor inconvenience is that one of Lara's many skills is climbing. This is cool. However, she can be stiff and stubborn at times and decide to jump into the direction she was going before instead of jumping up during climb unless you take a moment to calm her down for the maneuver. This led me to many an untimely awkward death, though number of which reduced when I got used to the controls.Single player story is engaging. You get to meet Lara's friends, read (there are notebooks scattered around) about their dreams and doubts and then hope to save them all to get safely back home. Story can be ruthless and sad at times. Along with the story, Lara gets to exercise her archeologist training to study the various artefacts and scriptures found around the island (each provided with an insight from Lara). For the completionist, there are also a number of challenges (basically ""find hidden stuff"" missions) and puzzle-like optional tombs to complete. These are also useful sources of experience points and salvage (used to upgrade weapons).Unfortunately, for the said completionist, about half the Steam achievements are granted by multiplayer. MP is, at the time of writing, quite dead, i.e. there are no active, permanent lists of servers. However, you can find a player community at  who regularly play (as of 18th Aug 2014) or asking on the forum.While I've heard MP is awesome, I've not actually tried it yet. However, I can recommend Tomb Raider for its single player story alone. On Hard difficulty (that I found to be okay if not challenging) it took me over 20 hours to complete 100%. The present price of 20 € is about half the original price and it's good, but you could probably get it for 10 € or less during sales if you wanted to and the lack of MP kind of justifies that too."

I started the  series with  I loved it so much that I saw one of my friends get this one last week, and while it was still on sale, I caved in, and got it yesterday.Not surprisingly, it capitivated me just as fast as RotTR did. The graphics, music score, and story are all well done. The music score is really something else worth additional mentioning. It's almost like watching a scary movie, and by that I mean, the music grips you subtly, and then something jumps out at you, as the music turns from subtle to a skin jumping leap of fear that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. I fell for this each time so far, and will probably continue to do so.Lara Croft, is an easy character to feel for. You can't help but to make sure nothing bad happens to her. More so than any other character I've ever played in a RPG. I could go on, and on about this game, but I don't want to get too long winded.Currently the game is on sale for 75% off, so if you've never played any of the series, then start with this one.

Crystal Dynamics did a stellar job in creating Tomb Raider's atmosphere, a cinematic beauty that actually manages to transfer the excitement of discovering a lost civilization into the hearts of the player. The puzzles are fun, some aspects of combat entertaining, and the collectibles are one of the few that I actually bothered to gather.That being said, the game does come with it's flaws. Overabusing quick-time events is, without a doubt, the largest problem as it constantly snatches control away to create something more similar to a movie than a game. There is too much emphasis on combat, whereas the puzzles, which ought to be the focus, are more or less shoved to the corner as optional tasks (Its called ""TOMB"" Raider for god's sake). Character development isn't that great. While most characters get at least one scene in the spotlight, they never get enough screen time for the player to fully understand them (Ahem* Sam). Finally the game is short, with a storyline that lasts around 15 to 16 hours. Nevertheless, a solid game that should definitely be considered for purchase.  8/10"

You hold forward and do nothing else for a good chunk of the game, as it's basically a movie that you're prodding along.  There are no real Tomb Raider puzzles that existed in previous games.  The whole game and its sequels are focused on a story that makes absolutely no sense, and arcs that take away from the appeal of the game in the first place.  If you like action games with lots of whiny characters, this game is for you.  It's also strange when the story is telling you one thing and the game is telling another story.  Serious dissonance in this game.  Nonetheless I've played it through a few times and there's something fun about the energy of it.  Still wouldn't recommend it unless it's on a discount deal."

The gameplay is unappealing, littered with quick time events that tear any weight from every situation. Lara is constantly falling down cliffs where you have to press a button or the correct direction or something. The combat is boring and uninspired, taking the worst from Uncharted and Gears of War. There is a skill tree, but the skills hardly feel like upgrades and dont change the flow of gameplay at all.I also have some personal nitpicks, starting with the loading zone caves. When transitioning to a new area, Lara's already slow walk speed is reduced in order to load in the new area, as you squeeze through some dark cave or crevice to let the new area load. I would rather have a loading screen than watch Lara whine and struggle slowly to walk through a hallway. Another nitpick, they MISPRONOUNCE HIMIKO THE ENTIRE GAME EXCEPT FOR ONE GUY. The main antagonists name is mispronounced with the exception of the Japanese speakers and the white dude with brown hair. The only fun parts of the game for me were unintentional. The way Lara ragdolls after death creates some funny moments, the fastest way to move is to roll everywhere, in the caves that I mentioned you can spam shift and she will do a sort of dance, if you spam roll during any interaction Lara will say ""I cant do that now"" in a monotone voice, and many other small thingsTLDR: Knowing nothing about Tomb Raider I expected this game to be good but was very disappointed.PS:I would hate to be the unlucky guy that is forced to use the machetes and run up to get slaughtered"

Does it make Lara more than just a triangular bosomed sex object for slightly pale bedroom lurkers? Has Square Enix made another excellent PC port? Well lets traverse the conveniently sized blocks and handily placed ammo packs for the start of a new era in archeology.What's the premise?The origin story of Ms Croft taking you through her first adventure. Shipwrecked on a mysterious island with no supplies or experience, Lara must learn to survive by any means and rescue her fellow crewmates from the stir-crazy inhabitants who, for some reason... cannot leave.Is It a good Port?The first thing I did when loading up Tomb Raider was to peer into the normally depressing graphical setup menu. Depressing, as games released on both Console and PC usually neglect the needs of the modern PC enthusiast in favor of the easier to please and more numerous console gamers with their aging hardware. This usually stops the game from fulfilling its technical potential. Upon entry, I breath a sigh of relief. ‘Options, Thousands of them!’ I yell in my head in a really convincing Michael Caine voice. There is more choice here then I know what to do with. Tessellation, Aspect ratios SSAO, Motion Blur, V-Sync Exclusive Full screen Mode to avoid immersion spoiling Steam popups. Options galore. Square Enix are the forerunners in making excellent PC ports such as with Sleeping Dogs, and I think this is the best thus far. No restart needed to change anything making it very easy to optimise the settings for your rig. The newest feature is something called ‘TressFX’ A realistic hair option which makes Lara’s hair move naturally. Also worth mentioning the Key Mapping area. Not something I'll use but giving the players the option of using a keyboard is welcome. The only thing that pops out as missing for me, is the lack of a FoV slider. Not a huge issue in a Third Person game, but I'd still like to have that option.Tomb Raider been ported over with more than due consideration to the PC platform.How does it look?Upon starting a new game I am immediately stunned by the quality of the visuals. This is a very, very pretty game. Lighting is excellent as the random flashes of thunder and torch sequences will testify. Everything you expect to have a shadow does and reacts to multiple light sources.  Character models are well animated and Lara herself has some excellent animations in particular which are worthy of mention. She reacts to fire and wind by raising her hands and shielding her eyes. A simple yet, very welcome consideration which does well for immersion. Lara also reacts to unstable terrain by leaning on walls where possible. The cutscenes are rendered in the actual game engine for quick transition which is a good thing as this game is cutscene happy. More on that later. Some issues with slowdown in high clutter areas when using  the torch as the game struggles to show multiple shadows on multiple objects from multiple light sources but runs very smooth at a high resolution for the vast majority of the game. Textures are well done and the landscape design is really convincing. In the open world areas, nothing seems to have the straight lines of the old Tomb Raider and helps the immersion a great deal.The game is very pretty. Animations are excellent and Lighting is near perfect.How does it play?The first hour of the game finds you playing nothing more than an interactive movie. Your led from point A to point B with ease and the monotony of pressing forward is only broken by quick time events which lead directly into cutscenes. And their are hundreds of them. Cutscenes which explain something which could not possibly be done in the game are great but, this game seems only too happy throw cutscene after cutscene at you and that actually affected the pace of the game and ultimately, my enjoyment. The QTE’s are just as prevalent as the cutscenes but they have an interesting twist. If you fail a QTE, Lara usually dies but how she dies is usually brutal and genuinely shocking. So much so, you start to fail them on purpose to see what gruesome end Lara meets. But its ok, after failing a QTE, you're transported back to the start of it. So not much time lost.Outside the Cutscenes and QTE’s you do have an ‘open world’ to explore. Now, thats in brackets as its not a true open world. This is by no means a Far Cry open world. You're given the illusion of freedom like lots of games and this game hides the fact its not a true open world very well. Giving you long sprawling scenery to look at is great, just don't try and go to it. Invisible walls are usually well hidden. But you generally find that their is only one way to reach your destination and thats the way the developers want it. I don't like the hand holding.While exploring your ‘open world’ you are introduced to filler. This usually takes the form of collectables and hidden places in open world games and this is no exception. Collectables include scrap which you can use to upgrade your weapons. Experience and unlock system to provide boosts to certain abilities. Books and diaries which do a real good job of enhancing the major characters’ stories. Achievements in the form of ‘set fire to X amount X in this area.’ And my favorite. Discovering the locations of Tombs. (Think Assassins Creed)‘Survival instinct’ is a spammable ability which, like a sonar, pings the area around Lara and highlights anything of interest. And I mean ANYTHING. Scrap, chests, enemies, food, ammo all made very clear to you upon the press of a button.... where is the adventure in a system like that? Granted, some of the times its a very useful feature. identifying enemy locations for example, But being able to use it at anytime, any place is really upsetting to me. Surely, part of a Tomb Raider should be to find things via exploration?So far, you may have realised that the game is not the Tomb Raider of old in a new suit. It is like a lot of other modern games with an established franchise thrown in. But here, inside this QTE/cutscene fest of linear, plot driven action you find a nod to the great Tomb Raider of old. In this Tomb Raider, raiding tombs is optional. You can choose to revisit the puzzles of old and traverse the tight ledges and activate the pulley systems in search of collectables or new items. These puzzles are generally quite tricky and easily the most difficult part of the game but most will be solved with a simple trial and error approach. A very satisfying inclusion.Also worth mentioning is the A.I. The enemies react well and even call for help before approaching you. The game has an auto cover system which, when you approach a low wall for example, Lara will automatically use it. Great. The AI also try to burn you out of cover using Petrol Bombs. Great too. A stealth system also makes an appearance, but for me the third person camera is too close to get accurate feedback on the surroundings. There is also no in game minimap making it a bit more difficult to make a decision and any correct decision making in stealth just feels like luck.There is a near infinite amount of ammo. You're almost tripping over the stuff. For a mysterious island in a game billed as a survival/action, there's far too many arrows and bullets just lying about. Another example of hand holding.What's the writing like?Lara’s development from scared little girl to master tomb raider is the best part of the game for me. It happens a little fast, however the way the storey, voice acting and animations have been designed is to make you realise, Lara is desperate. She isn't ready for this. You empathise with her character and situation to a very highlevel making you genuinely care for her safety. Its a level of writing rare in RPG games, let alone an action game. For the way they portrayed Lara, I commend the writers. TLDR: Thumbs Up!"

Furthermore, the story in this game seemed to be very interesting and kept you in game. I personally could not stop playing it until I completed the singleplayer. Lastly, the only thing i'm not particulary happy with is the multiplayer mode, as for a while now the square enix server for Tomb Rider have been offline. What really is a shame as I enoyed the online mode as much as story. Hope you find this review helpful and convincing about the game. Now the servers are back online and you can enjoy the very successful multiplayer mode that is really well designed and might have links to many other games like The Last Of Us  with the scavenging and simple Team deathwatch modes that are in most other multiplayer games."

Both graphically, and in style, the game is very, very pretty. Particle effects are everywhere, water looks like its really flowing, and the long draw distances create landscapes so beautiful that you will consider just stopping and staring at it for awhile. This game will definitely be a definitive graphical benchmark for the next year or two.The gameplay is familiar enough; a traditional third person cover shooter. You eventually develop a standard arsenal of firearms, any of which you can pull out of your ass at any time.  Occasionally you will run into a physics puzzle, but these are rarer than I would've liked. Most of them are genuinely interesting and clever, and the game doesn't seem to be aware of that. The shooting is good enough, but this is not the draw of the game.Firefights only make up a small portion of the approximately 20 hours playtime of Tomb Raider's single player. Most of the time is spent traversing  Crystal Dynamics' well-designed environments. There are plenty of secret tomb areas (they serve as some kind of collectible) that a player could completely bypass, and discovering all of these areas significantly extends playtime. Lara acquires skills over the course of the game, allowing her to climb cliffsides, jump up walls, and slide down ziplines to access new areas. In addition to skills, Lara also upgrades her weapons and tools throughout the game through the use of scrap metal that she finds across the game world.If none of this sounds especially new or original, that's because it's not. But everything is Tomb Raider is so polished that it stands above all the other games it borrows mechanics from (including its predecessors).My only big problem with Tomb Raider is its convoluted story. Lara's journey starts out simple enough; an archeaology expedition finds themselves in the middle of a storm and is washed ashore a mysterious island. Lara wakes up captured by...someone...and escapes to save her friends and get off the island. Some mysterious forces prevent her from doing so, and then the story takes some weird directions. No spoilers, but I don't think the story really goes anywhere meaningful, even though its main story points could've been put together into an epic tale. It instead comes off as kind of all over the place. The whole game has a very self serious tone, but the story gets so ridiculous that nothing really fits together. The voice acting and dialogue is passable, but nothing noteworthy.I didn't touch the multiplayer modes. I didn't hear very good things and the one time I tried them the servers were abandoned. Tomb Raider took me around 20 hours to beat, and for a $20 AAA title that is routinely on sale for <$10, I highly recommend it.There is no need to purchase the GOTY version or any of the DLC, as it is all multiplayer skins/weapons that cannot be used in single player."

Starts of very realistic and gritty, almost like a survival/thriller start. The story does develop more into fantasty and mystacism but its done in such a way that its enjoyable and is done right. The gunplay is fun and the ability to upgrade weapons and craft things is a really nice touch. The puzzles in tomb's and amount of collectables is great fun if you like me love collecting and 100% things.Lara Croft, is an easy character to feel for. You can't help but to make sure nothing bad happens to her. More so than any other character I've ever played in a RPG.

This Tomb Raider delivers exactly what I've wanted since the first playable demo of Tomb Raider back in 1996. In fact, I actually kind of got the idea that this is kind of like a third person shooter in the Metroidvania genre. I like that.The story is downright silly, it kind of has to be, given the gameplay requirements.

I'm not going to be comparing it to the old Tomb Raider games because: a) I feel I'm not at liberty to do so having never played them, and b) I believe that a reboot should stand on its own, seeing as how the goal of a reboot is to forge a new path. With that said...Essentially I was drawn to it simply because of the premise: adventurer archaelogist girl crash-lands on an old mystical island and has to find a way to survive the experience, and get off the island.The premise is indeed here, but it's sort of lost in the over indulgence of gore and survivor-torture. There were many points in the game where I was like, ""Okay, I get it, she's a tough survivor but holy crap! That fall really should have killed her, honestly!"" And you'll have a lot of those moments, moments of ""oh...okay, not dead yet."" Now, the incredibly intense cinematics within this trope the game follows are honestly super impressive and one of my favorite aspects of the game. You'll have to run for your life to escape from a crumbling, burning building, dodge huge chunks of falling debris while hanging off the side of a mountain with only a pickaxe for stability, push a wolf off your leg before he gnaws it off - and the list goes on and on and on. While self-indulgent, these are the moments where Tomb Raider shines, where you don't quite realize how fast your heart was pounding until you get out of the treacherous situation in question. Where else does Tomb Raider shine? As a game from 2013 and what can truly be considered the first ""current-gen"" Tomb Raider, the island environments and gorgeous vistas they provide are really stunning. I experienced the game at highest graphical settings, and there were really some moments, staring off into the distance, that really took my breath away. The lighting is rich and varied, the weather systems are, for the most part, fairly dynamic. Environmental effects, such as fire, frost, and thunder, could be maybe just a little more intricate to match the incredible island areas as a whole, but that said, they do hold up nicely. The rain effects really should be commended, as there's already a lot going on, and even when there is, the rain still feels - and hinders your sight and abilities - as rain should. A lot of games around this iteration's conception have kind of missed the mark there, so... well done! Also commendable is Camilla Luddington's voice acting work, which was rich, varied, and nuanced. She does a great job at making you really feel like you're in Lara's shoes as she goes from scared, timid archaeologist to hardened survivor. Which brings me to the areas where Tomb Raider, unfortunately, does not shine. While Luddington's voice acting is nearly impeccable, the voice acting where other characters are concerned just really doesn't feel up to par. Maybe that's why Lara was the only character I felt truly invested in. The game clearly tries to show you which characters you should care most about, and does a lot to try and make you care for them, but in actuality, it just falls short. In the game's most pivotal moments, when my friends' lives hung in the balance, I found myself more excited about getting past this new development so I could get back to camp and upgrade my weapons, than I cared about my friend being in mortal danger. And this is where the cracks in Tomb Raider start to show. You don't really play it for the story, and I wouldn't dare tell someone to pick it up for that; you play it for the incredibly gorgeous views, the environments, the gripping interactive cinematics...As I've seen other reviewers note, the story is indeed lacking. I do think Tomb Raider got a little ahead of itself and tried to be an FPS, slightly open-world, action-adventure-exploration epic all at once, throwing in exploration itself as a last-minute thought, and the nuances got lost there. Exploration and upgrading is pretty standard for those familiar with upgrades in any other linear FPS game. Collect resources, upgrade your weapons, rinse and repeat. I did appreciate that there are a lot of choices presented in how exactly to take down your enemies as you approach late-game arsenal. In this way, having to take down hordes of enemies never really gets boring. Climbing and related activities actually work really well, even though I thought it'd be awkward trying to do so in third person, it's actually...not. Just... get ready for button mashing. And I mean button mashing.Playthrough (not going for 100% area completion, but taking time to see the sights, so to speak) took me a little over 19 hours. Overall, I think Tomb Raider can be recommended even though my review probably makes it sound like a mixed bag. I think you just have to remember that you came for the environment and cinematic moments, rather than the storytelling and oversaturated character development. So long as you remember that, you should enjoy your stay on Yamatai just fine. Well...maybe enjoy isn't the right word considering you'll be trying to survive... heh.Definitely worth a pick up if on sale, and maybe also even if not, if you're a Tomb Raider fan looking for a new take on the series with a good dose of an adrenaline rush."

A good story with great voice acting, good graphics and decent mechanics. There is little replay value, and multiplayer is dead. You can .This is meant to reboot the Lara Croft franchise. Lara's a young lady here, and the theme of this game - “how to survive” - sees her transition from a timid archaeologist to someone with confidence in what she knows. The transition is completely convincing, and makes the story ultimately compelling. Which is good, because a number of other factors don't work quite so well. Lara has a near-breakdown after killing her first human, but then proceeds to kill dozens of soldiers without a second thought (more stealth levels would have been great, but stealth only works in a few areas). Tumbling into a dusty vault and finding a body, she at one point declares, “I hate tombs!” (lol wut?!) The ending monologue has her say, “My father was right about so many things,” when her father is barely mentioned in the story.And don't think, because the game is called Tomb Raider, that there is actually relevant loot in the tombs. There isn't. The tombs themselves are a massive disappointment, being platform challenges for no obvious reward. All end with Lara heaving a chest or container open, giving a little gasp of surprise, and putting something in her pocket. We never get to see what. You do get a Salvage reward, but that's it.If you were looking for a fresh take on the older Tomb Raider games, well, you won't find it here. Lara only wields her dual .45s for a total of ten seconds. If you can accept Tomb Raider as reboot prequel of a bigger (and hopefully better) game to come, it's a fun shooter. But that's pretty much all it is.On DLC:The amount of DLC for this game is frankly ridiculous. $0.99 for the pistol silencer? How about another $0.99 for a burst-round mode? At least there's a GOTY edition that includes everything."

The game seems like it's forcing you in a certain direction (the end of the game, of course) but you entirely have the option to go back to past camp sites and explore secret tombs as much as you want (until the last camp site). I haven't played a Tomb Raider game in a while but I was really excited to see how they incorporated Fast Travel, and it is awesome.The upgrade system was perfect for this game, collecting all of the weapon parts and salvage to fully upgrade your weapons for maximum damage and effectiveness was impressively fun. Especially getting the upgrades that allow you to find more salvage! I still don't think I've found all the secret stashes. They come in a few different varieties and are in some pretty imaginative places!The combat system was spectacular, not only shooting enemies but using the environment. Pulling down cover, knocking over towers, and blowing up barrels! I didn't end up doing a lot of melee fighting, I only used the special melee attacks a few times against regular enemies, mostly against the heavier targets.  The bow and really any of the weapons in their final forms are just awe-inspiring. The death scenes are pretty realistic and on the more graphic side, or at least I didn't die until I was going through the river rapids and a tree limb went through my brain.The climbing system was perfect for this style game, nothing had to be 100% accurate, as long as you hit the wall you were jumping to you would usually grab it unless you needed the pickaxe. I really enjoyed the game and got almost 80% completion on my first play-through. The camera and the gameplay work perfectly with a keyboard and mouse, I'll be trying it with the 360 controller on my second playthrough.I really had a great time playing this game and it was one of the few games that hooked me to the point where I had finished it within a matter of days and was ready to keep on surviving!"

I love traveling with the 'new' Lara and exploring a diverse and detailed world. I set the difficulty level to 'Easy' and managed to find collectibles, progress, and survive up to the ending 'big boss' (who I have yet to kill). The platforming does not require perfect precision and I found the controller configuration easy to work with and intuitive. For major battles, I resorted to my keyboard/mouse which gives me better aim.This is a great game for adventurers who want to try their hand at stealth and combat. There is a story, likable characters,  collectibles, and an occasional ambush.  Survival is based on taking cover and keeping your adrenaline in check.  For those new to the franchise, there is an invaluable set of guides on ""Stella's Tomb Raider Site"" that provide tips/techniques and survival strategies. Achievements include multi-player challenges so 100% was not on the table for me. This freed me to enjoy the experience without being concerned with perfection!"

The pieces that are fun (murder) don't sit well with the story, and what should be the defining parts (puzzles and tomb exploration) are barely present. The parts where you shoot guys are reasonably fun.  You've got the usual sort of tools you'd expect in a murder game. Pistol, shotgun, rifle, and a bow that acts like a silenced sniper rifle. There are plenty of people to murder in lovingly rendered ways.  (Honestly, there are so many healthy, gun-toting men on the game's island it stretches credibility.)The parts where you explore the environment aren't very fun. There also aren't very many of them. There are very few parts where you need to puzzle out how to climb up someplace, or how to get past a trap.  Most of the things you can climb or interact with are clearly marked in white, and the routes you're expected to take are pretty straight forward.  When the game asks you to get to the top of a building, it's not very satisfying when the wall you can climb is highlighted for you. I don't feel like I solved anything.The story isn't particularly great. The plot isn't especially bad, but the execution is pretty deeply flawed. The biggest problem is the gap between Cut Scene Lara and Gameplay Lara.  Cut Scene Lara cries when she has to shoot a cartoonishly evil villain (They wanted to make sure you really got he was a bad guy, so they added some unwanted sexual advances. Subtle!).   Gameplay Lara gets bonus points for headshots and ""brutal executions.""   The touching scene where she cries over what she has done is comically undermined by this contradiction.  It is literally minutes between crying and cold blooded headshots.  Setting people on fire so they die screaming does not make her flinch.  This really, really undermines the character they tried to sell in the cutscenes.The game really does want you to murder people, too.  If you kill people, you get experience points, upgrade materials, and more ammo.  If you sneak past them, you get nothing.  There aren't really any non-violent or non-lethal options, either.  Conveniently, Lara is an expert with all the weapons she finds.  I don't think this was explained in-game, but she is capable of flawlessly reloading every weapon she finds even while under heavy fire.  She can aim perfectly.   I think she's supposed to be an archaelogist, not a special ops soldier.  This makes the shooty bits more fun, but it's also lazy and kind of stupid. Oh, and Lara is pretty much immortal as well.  It uses the same kind of health system as Portal.  There's no health UI, and you're good-as-new if you stop getting hit for a few seconds.  Considering how often people are shooting at you, that's probably the better option. I kind of hate backtracking for supplies in games anyway.   Still, it makes the combat pretty easy and that makes it a little unsatisfying. Lara is capable of some impressive gymnastics, of course. They do make a token effort at the start to show that it's scary for her, but that quickly goes away. I get that it's for gameplay purposes, but it isn't very good storytelling. There are also quick time events.  They are bad.  They are introduced poorly, too. I died a few times during the intro because I couldn't read the on screen prompt fast enough, and then because I misunderstood what it wanted me to do.  When you fail one, it's usually game over and a reload.  Not enjoyable.  Some of them also result in the graphic death of Lara, and that is not fun to watch.Sometimes the story forces you to do stupid things. There's a part that made me roll my eyes and walk away from the computer. It was a bad decision Lara made that was also unecessary, and the game didn't even pretend to it was a player choice.  Sometimes the game wants to be a movie, I guess.That's all the complaints I have about it for right now.  It's a murder sim with some very light jumping action, and a story that doesn't match the gameplay.   The shooty parts are kind of fun, I guess, but overall the game is unsatisfying.  I keep thinking about what else it could have been."

So thought I would go a little retro having played the original tomb raider games many many years ago. This reboot is simply brilliant. Ignore any reviews that say otherwise. Bought recently, played it using keyboard/mouse and loved every second. One of the best games I have ever played bar none. At £2.24!!!!!!! What are you waiting for."

The throne is yours once again!!OK, I admit, this was nasty.Seriously speaking, this new Tomb Raider reboot shows off in a perfect way, what nowadays cinematic AAA Action Adventures can pull off. It is a great experience, moving at exhilerating speed from set-piece to set-piece. But it*s not just that, no. After those great moments the player ends up in so called Hub-World areas, where one can explore freely and search for hidden collectibles (XP) and Salvage.It is those moments combined with some neat references to classic Tomb Raider elements in the later parts of the game that make this one a great ride and great experience."

I have played several games from Lara Croft in the past, compared to them this one is more centered in the story and action, for me pretty good decision being more for general players. The combat reminds me of Last of Us wich I played a little ago, but wiht a lot less stealth (at least in Normal difficulty) and exploring is really interesting. So a con for this game may be that if you are looking for puzzles like before games you will be a little disapointed, there are some, in form of optional locations, but are pretty easy.Good things:- Beautiful environment, graphics, art, etc, you can see it.- An interesting story, with cutscenes, talking.- Is an open-world, you get experience, weapons, skills as you progress to not be repetitive. A lot of collectives to explore and a good movement system.- Good action, with melee combat, stealth and tricks.- There are QTE events BUT they are not random buttons, they are predefined so they have more sense. They are cool and actually loosing them for seeing the death animation is pretty impresive.Bad things:- I would like real challenge puzzles but well it has been really fun.P.D.

The story (if you try to find all the little hidden items) fleshes out nicely and sets a good mood for Lara's evolution from a more recognizably ""normal"" young woman into the nascent Tomb Raider we expect.    Gameplay mechanics are introduced in a reasonable fashion, tutorials are pretty obvious but do their job of guiding you given this was a reboot and a fresh interface.    The tombs that are there are atmospheric.The bad:   Quick Time Events. Expect to see Lara die horribly a few times because you don't have your controller layout memorized or just weren't expecting a QTE at that moment.   Not enough / not complex enough puzzles. For a puzzle-based franchise at its heart, making this much more of a shooter is disappointing. (The next game Rise tried to bring in more puzzles and did a little better, imho Shadow slid back a bit -- but none of the new trilogy is really puzzle / exploring centric to me).Overall, I enjoyed the game back in the day and on a few replays. Same with Rise - and while I never finished all the DLC on Shadow it was fine.So why the ""Not recommended?"".... well, there's now The Ugly:    Multiplayer in the whole trilogy (including this game where MP was really never a focus) has been converted over to a framework using Epic Games. You'll be encouraged to link your Steam account to a EGS account.That's not inherently bad, and I'm sure there are reasons for it (supposedly more cross platform, etc.) -- except that you can't start the game in any fashion that doesn't talk to the EGS servers (Offline mode, using hosts files to redirect the IPs to localhost, etc.) Which means that this game I've had for years and only care about Single Player... now would always ping EGS if I want to play it. And doubtless passes basic system information / identifiers to check in. And who knows what else, as EGS doesn't have the best reputation when it comes to data integrity.Also concerning is that post-EGS patch, the game now consumes 100% of a single core (where it did not before). Which strongly implies either it is really persistently checking MP / network state or otherwise phoning home a *lot* or doing some data mining or whatnot... either bad programming or bad ethics. Don't really need to know which one.Given The Ugly - I'm afraid I can't recommend the game, and have uninstalled the trilogy. I can't support such a radical change in behavior and functionality forced onto existing customers. Yes, EULAs and the whole ""you only own the copy you have to make transfering from your drive to RAM!"" scheme makes it legal, but frankly I find it unethical to change such things. As such, Square Enix has now joined my personal list of publishers I won't be considering in the future."

The resulting game feels like 'Uncharted' by way of 'Lost', marooning Lara on a mysterious island covered in the wreckage of dozens of other wrecks from ancient wooden boats to giant metal tankers. Separated from the other survivors, Lara attempts to reconvene with them and come up with a plan to escape, whilst uncovering the truth about the island.The story is fairly simple and a little predictable, but moment-to-moment it is interesting and engaging. The environments, whilst not particularly varied, feel interesting to explore and there are many hidden secrets that can be found with a little investigation and lateral thinking. Whilst the game itself is notable in the lack of tombs to raid, there are several tombs dotted about as bonus secret areas that you can uncover and complete, and whilst these are small, they each have an interesting puzzle inside that needs solving to get the loot.As a character, Lara is a little more real here than in any previous game, more grounded, more relatable. This means that the struggle to survive, to uncover the mystery of the island and escape feels more engaging and a little more personal. There are a few moments where the game stumbles from this grounded reality and falls into action movie / game trope territory, but it generally recovers and leaves you invested in Lara's struggle to survive.Tomb Raider feels like the relevant reboot the franchise needed, a welcome change to what came before, and has the potential to become a new classic series in its own right."

(Both Lara Croft and Nathan Drake are grandchildren of Indiana Jones, who is himself a grandchild of the pulp heroes of the 30s, so it's all good.) There are a few issues. The story, with Lara getting shipwrecked on an island and BECOMING A SURVIVOR (!!!) starts off interesting but becomes very predictable, and Lara's crewmates kinda made me think of the Scooby Doo gang after a while, which probably isn't a compliment. The Quicktime events can be tiresome, and Lara takes so much punishment over the course of the game as a means of making the player care about her that it starts to become ridiculous, especially when she shrugs off falling down a river and getting every bone in her body bruised like it's nothing. In general, though, the Japanese island environment is interesting and combat is great, which I think is a first for a Tomb Raider game. Crystal Dynamics also worked very hard at moving Lara beyond her old characterization, which was essentially little more than ""hot British woman who's badass in a 90s comic book kind of way."" Sometimes they don't quite succeed - Lara occasionally feels like the typical female protagonist in a horror game/film now, which is also a trope. Overall, though, she's much more relatable than she was before, and a scene near the end where she gets a certain weapon and begins mowing fools down is very empowering. Also, she has her own equivalent of Detective Vision, which made me lol. Games in the 2010s!"

The game pushes you along at a great pace, when it wants you to feel safe it'll let you explore and can fill you with a sense of dread and need to move forward with a sense of urgency when needed. The enemies even on hard mode are very dull, and don't pose much of a challenge but there's a lot of ways alloted to the player to progress through the story, be it stealth or charging through the front with an asortment of weaponry. A majority of the game involves some sort of parkour element attached to it which can be fun to explore with. As you progress in the game you can salvage resources and gain exp which are used to upgrade equipment and skills. Like most exploration games, you can expect a lot of side missions and collectables in which the game can be expanded for a few more hours. This is almost essential being a Tomb Raider franchise, it'd be inherently nonsensical to not have collectibles littered everywhere, but the game does a great job of letting you use your survival skills and map presence to be able to locate and find them without feeling like a giant backtracking sidequest. Achievements and collectibles let you go back to them later on in the game, so you won't feel like you're missing out.Honestly I really didn't pay much attention to the music. The voice acting on the other hand was amazing. The voice actors really made the game. They brought a sense of depth and life to the characteres that made them feel real.Now here's where the game really shines. Gorgeous graphics, even on the little tiny details placed throughout the world, from incidental carvings thrown away in a fleetin gmoment as you run past, to the way Lara interacts with the environment, how she shivers from the cold and crosses her arms or the way she shakes from exertion. The environment is riddled with beautiful movie-esque quality shots everywhere, giving you a plethora of opportunities to turn regular screen shots basically anywhere in the game to background wallpapers. Characters are well fleshed out, yet none more specifically than Lara, who's modelled after the real life hottie Megan Farquhar.

Infuriating at times, but still fun. First the positives. The game is gorgeous. The island is wonderful to explore and the environments are very distinct. It is obvious a lot of love went into creating this island world. While the opening cinematic is a tease, since the rest of the game isn't nearly as photo-realistic, it's enough to hook you into the adventure. Another huge positive is the amount of shinies! There are relics and documents everywhere to flesh out the history of the island. Honestly. I think they could do a DLC off the strength of one of the documented stories. The controls for the most part are very smooth and it is easy to manage Laura over the rough terrain she faces. I loved the blend of adventure and action. You get to solve puzzles and shoot stuff and look for shinies! Something for everybody!      Now the negatives. While I did love this game, I don't have a blinding love to all things Lara Croft. My first problem: the title. Lara is no tomb raider in this game. She is a young woman trying to survive a shipwreck and save her fellow shipmates from a cursed island. Yes, she does visit tombs, but they are optional tombs, and they are not nearly as elaborate as the tombs from past TR games. More on that later. The emphasis in this game is ""you are a Croft, Lara."" If anything, this game should have been called ""Croft: The Makings of a Tomb Raider"" or something like that. This a personal gripe, but I feel that the title does not show the true emphasis of the game. A mixed positive and negative is the almost superhuman pain threshold Lara has. Its truly amazing what she lives through, and she's only wearing a tank top and cargo pants! On the other hand, she is very human. SHe is sometimes daunted by the trials she faces. She even states at one point, ""I hate tombs."" When she jumps, she doesn't always land perfectly. So, in some ways she is very human. The next moment, I am wondering why she hasn't had gangrene or hypothermia set in. Now the tombs. They are pathetic. As if running across tribal markings wasn't enough, the game feels the need to tell you that a tomb is nearby. All but one of the tombs are optional, and they are small, and usually have only one puzzle to solve it. when Lara opens the treasure chest in the tomb, I get the feeling of Link opening a large chest from Ocarina of Time. It's the same vibe. A game called Tomb Raider should have tombs that aren't optional. So there are my negatives: Lara can't decide if she should be a super hero, the tombs are laughable, and the title does not fit the emphasis of the game.     A long review for me, but I could talk more about it, but thats what discussions are for. The story is a bit cliche'd in places, but it is so fun to play that it really doesn't matter. As I said, the negatives are really personal. If you don't have a problem with them, then this game is pretty near perfect. It's a lot of fun and I'm glad this is the first TR game I have played and beaten. I would say this is a good intro for those interested in the world of Lara Croft."

Lara's origin story is dark and gritty yet fun at the same time. The character development shown throughout is believable. + Gameplay - Controls are fine, Great Auto-Cover system, Exploring the island for Tombs & Rewards is satisfying which acts as the catalyst for the well thought out Progression system, Enemy AI is good, basically just traversing the area with custom ziplines and killing bad guys with Lara's trademark Bow is fun! - - - :- Multiplayer - Pretty generic with Few maps and modes.

It's not too short or too long to make you desperate. It has cool gameplay mechanics, and the updates you pick up on the go makes you feel stronger, and with the new acquired tools, you are able to backtrack and unlock certain areas to 100% them. Puzzles are rather easy, but i do get it, since this is an action-adventure game.I totally recommend it, especially how cheap it is nowadays (on sale ofc)...BUT, I don't suggest you to pick up the GOTY edition, since most of it are multiplayer-only and just one single tomb, not worth the extra money IMHO."

(GTX970, FX-8370)+Amazing atmosphere /w prerendered and ingame cutszenes+Gripping story and vivid characters+Leveling system and weaponmodding+Open world+Great level design makes for a very fluid gameplay+Intuitive controls+Different climbing techniques/equipment+Playing with mouse/keyboard works fine+Additional side-dungeonsCons:-Very low difficulty. I played the game on hard (highest dif.) and enemy combat strength also on hard but aside from 2-3 instances I never felt the need to switch from pistol and bow to a more powerful weapon. Even when using just the pistol you won't even come close to running out of ammo.-This also makes leveling system and weaponmodding almost a non-factor.-Even though the game is technically an open world game, gameplay is very linear. There are no sidequest or different story paths so the only reason to go back would be to 100% the game by getting all collectables.-Occasional low res textures in the open world-Directed camera while climbing will cost you a few lives in some situations-Few puzzles compared to older titles of the franchiseConclusion:While not being challenging the Tomb Raider reboot is a fun game to play nonetheless. The marvelaous graphics, story and setting make for a gripping experience almost like playing a movie.PS: Multiplayer in a game like this is irrelevant to me which makes most of the DLCs in the season pass irrelevant as well. I bought the game as GOTY for 10€ during Steam Sale. Had I payed 60€ + 25€ my conclusion would probably be different."

However, this game is totally different from what I played from Tomb Raider series and I loved it.So, instead of a mature hot looking woman, we see basically a student girl which accidentally must grow up and survive on an island full of monsters. But the thing is that these monsters are not cliché monsters – like in previous games, instead – they are human beings. That reminds me of an idea from Scooby Doo that “the real monster are humans”. The game has elements of a shooter with few tombs full of blood and skeletons. What I also liked about the game is that we can explore background of Lara’s crewmates, how the cultists from the island became who are they now and historical relics.  However, sometimes the amount of shooting and killing overtakes all the satisfaction from tombs and relics exploration. The screenplay of the game was a little predictable, but very enjoyable and emotional. The adventures of Lara Croft no longer look easy-going like Indiana Jones style, but instead became dark and serious. For those (like me) who aren’t fans of shooter games and especially who expected typical Lara Croft games, the process of acceptance and understanding of the interpretation of Lara Croft character will take some time. What I can tell for sure, is that the creators perfectly could show all the despair and hopelessness of Lara: whether it is her first kill of a deer or literally all the skulls which she needed to step on the way to salvation.If you are fine with blood and brutal elements in games and ready to discover for yourself a new redefining of Lara Croft character – this game is for you."

I was rather interested into playing it since I played a lot of the original Tomb Raider 2 when I was a kid and others, but just remember that this is a way different experience with all the cutscenes, map markers, highlighted items, tutorials, experience system, cinematic and all of those, that modern games have."

This game doesn't deliver on a sense of adventure or on tomb raiding at all. In fact, the tombs were optional. OPTIONAL!!! Not to mentions they were single rooms with one dinky puzzle that a chimpanzee could solve blindfolded. Are you kidding me??No, this game is pure shooter. Murder, murder, murder. Granted, Uncharted has a lot of this, but it's balanced with interesting puzzles, unique environments, great characters and compelling stories. Guess which one of these elements Tomb Raider is missing? ALL OF THEM. This game has NOTHING going for it, unless you're in it for the violence. The worst part: the violence. Now, I love gratuitous violence in the right context (Mortal Combat? Dead Space? Resident Evil 4? Grand Theft Auto?) but in the wrong context, it can feel exploitative. In this case, it feels like torture porn. It made me physically uncomfortable. No, not just because I'm a woman and Lara is a woman, although she DOES get sexually assaulted in the beginning of the game (I'm sorry, WHAT? I came here to raid tombs FFS). Not to mention the cheap/tacky/lazy trope of a woman being sexually assaulted as part of her progression to being a badass fighter, like just stop. Who is letting men write characters like this?? The death scenes are too much. They are rendered in so much detail, and some of them are very lengthy. All of these terrible things happen to Lara throughout the entire game, it's nonstop, neverending, the time spent animating these things. The expressions on Lara's face during some of these scenes, and the voice acting... it often doesn't read as pain, and reads more as sexual. It feels like someone's sick fantasy. Keep it in your fanfiction, thanks in advance.It doesn't help that the director said, ""When people play Lara, they don't really project themselves into the character. They're more like 'I want to protect her.' You start to root for her in a way that you might not root for a male character."" Gross, man. I certainly don't feel that way. I don't see Lara getting impaled in the neck a tree branch, seeing the life drain out of her body, and feel the need to ""protect."" I feel my skin crawl. As a woman, I wouldn't look at Nathan Drake being impaled on a spike after missing a jump and say ""these horrible death scenes inspire me to protect him."" Sexist trash. Besides, no one needs a ""reason"" to prevent a character from dying in a videogame, because screwing up and dying means you don't progress. Literally the entire MO of most videogames.I'm not saying a person can't (or shouldn't) enjoy this game, but I sure couldn't."

Unlike any previous installment, the reboot is something of a departure from the classic ones putting more emphasis on the survival genre than the exploration-puzzle specialty Tomb Raider was known for.This is Lara Croft's origin story presenting her starting career in the arts of exploration. Lara's first journey leads her to an island called Yamatai in the Land of the Rising Sun, Japan, where her objective is to save her friends and escape from the island while being hunted down by a malevolent cult known as the Solarii Brotherhood, worshipers of Queen Himiko, former ruler of Yamatai.Gameplay wise, Tomb Raider presents elements of platforming, puzzle, shooting, quick-time events and one of my favorites, stealth. While you can play most of the game stealthy, there are moments where the game forces you to take the pew pew path.  For the old fans of the franchise one of the biggest disappointments were the puzzles and the challenge tombs that felt like some cheap upgrade collecting hubs. You won't go in this reboot expecting to find the same challenging puzzles that the previous installments offered. The game also incorporates rpg elements,  this enables players' skills and abilities to be upgraded in specific ways. Besides the main story the game includes exploration of the island, revisiting certain locations and collectibles.Putting aside the game graphics which are really stunningly beautiful, the small attention to details made me fall in love with this game. For instance, Lara being covered in dirt then walking in a pool, you'll find a lot of the dirt has suddenly been washed off or being wounded at the start of the game, holding one of her hands on the wound and the other one using it to support herself on the walls of the environment, that made the game feel more alive and responsive to your actions.In summary, Crystal Dynamics created one of the most enjoyable and gorgeous games in the action-adventure genre, that appealed to veterans of the franchise and the new fans, a true masterpiece, presenting the evolution of one of the most loved characters from the gaming world, Lara Croft."

Also we get to explore many tombs(oviously) and many areas which have collectables and some small side missions that i found very nice.The game is a great reboot at the franchise and i find it  as a Tomb Raider that everyone wanted to play but never released .Also the game has a multiplayer  that will keep you playing this great AAA game."

I love almost every part of it. Its a third-person shooter, which involves combat with numerous enemies, but includes stealth and climbing. The game plays a lot like Uncharted, and I think that it is just as good, if not better. You play through a surprisingly lengthy story mode, where you are stranded on island, attempting to escape the dangers that lurk there. You shoot and climb your way though the beatiful landscape, enhaced by astounding graphical performance. Along the way, you can upgrade your weapons and abilities, helping you overcome some of the tougher enemies in the game. The need to upgrade your equipment forces you to explore the vast island. And even though the island is filled with hidden tombs and areas, the story is still pretty linear. You can choose wether you would like to challenge yourself with the difficult puzzles of the hidden tombs, or you can simply play through the main game. Either way you play, your bound to be satisfied. I played through the main campaign, exploring two or three of the tombs, and searching for a a few artifacts here and there. I was able to finish all of this in about 11 hours, and I had a blast."

Not that it was a bad thing for either your heart is pumping or you mind is racing, but I suppose that would be my one criticizing of the game; so much happens that makes it hard to believe Laura should be walking up-right, let alone shooting dudes with one hand while zip-lining with the other, while carrying one of her companions on her back, while making archeological remarks about a shiny penny she found on the ground, while falling head first into a ravine (and coming out unscathed), etc. It IS a game, and a fictitious one at that, so it isn’t a big problem but I’m just addressing an aftertaste I had after reaching the end credits.Overall it was an exhilarating experience with a tinge of sci-fi that can quench any gamers desire for being a badass archeologist who would burn down an entire island to the ground before seeing her useless-in-combat but emotional-baggage friends die at the hands of macho thugs who believe in wind fairies. Typical Laura stuff.Oh, and there’s samurais."

It is important to say this at the very beginning as those expecting the same Tomb Raider are in for a not very nice surprise. I guess approaching it from the ""origin story"" perspective makes more sense than saying this is a reboot. Why? Because when the word reboot is articulated people start believing this is exactly the same TR game they played 15 years ago - a game with a lot of running, climbing and puzzle sequences. This ""reboot"" put a lot of emphasis on telling us how Lara became the fierce explorer, the femme fatale we got to know years ago. But all this is told via an action-packed story. So, most of what you'd expect from this game are there: next-gen graphics and voice acting, unnecessary and mediocre multiplayer mode, collectibles, dozens of achievements and oh, next gen graphics. Really some of the scenes look stunning and the pictures posted on the store page are not taken from rendered cutscenes if you believe that.You still climb a lot. And run and jump. And there's also ziplining. Still, combat is also there and some people may hate the Quick Time Events that nowadays more and more games use. We do not, however, have many tombs to raid. There are artifacts we can find there but really we only have half of dozen such places to explore. The rest, well, they are varied and you will later on return to gather some extra collectibles with the new abilities you have obtained. There are some minor RPG elements here as you receive XP and level up and you can also ""salvage"" which acts as the ingame currency. You can also hunt some animals.I liked Tomb Raider. I realised 15 years had passed and did not, therefore, expected the same experience but with next-gen graphics. Also, I believe the trailers speak for themselves. You may not like the new TR if you are the fan of the franchise due to its puzzles. If you can accept a more action-oriented version of Lara Croft I'm sure you will not be disappointed, though."

This game is much less about raiding actual tombs and more a cover-based shooter built around exploring a mysterious and dangerous island. Lara isn't the wisecracking badass she is in other games here, instead she starts off as a newly-minted Ph.D on an expedition that goes terribly wrong. The game makes her transformation into a hardened warrior very convincing and for me, a compelling experience.There are downsides - I was annoyed by periodic quicktime events that seemed ill-suited for mouse and keyboard (the game was definitely designed with a controller in mind). While you can fast travel between areas you've discovered already, the game is fairly linear, and the few tombs you actually raid are brief and not particularly challenging. Certain boss-type enemies required silly ""read-the-onscreen-prompt-and-mash-the-matching-button"" sequences. And for a Tomb Raider game, you do spend a lot of time shooting bad guys.But all that aside, this prequel/reboot to the Tomb Raider franchise is a lot of fun. The scenery and spectacle are frequently amazing, it looks very good and performed admirably on my mid-range laptop, and it kept me engaged through to the end despite occasional and minor annoyances. If you're new to the franchise, I'd say this would be a good time to jump in."

And being very much like a movie, it is perfectly paced so that you seldom get bored and you never feel it becoming repetitive. It's also very brutal, so if you don't like the idea of seeing Lara die from getting an arrow through her neck or impaled on wooden pikes.... Play it anyway, and man up!The game is a visual treat from start to finish. The scenery is lush and detailed, the character models and animations are superb and everything about it is just wonderful to look at.

The graphics are beautiful for a 2013 game and the game machanics are simple and easy to pick up. Some problems I have(maybe because I play alot of games) is the game itself is to easy. I didn't feel like I was being challenged hard enough by puzzles and or enemys. It all just came across as simple and mindless to play. There are alot of points in the game you literally just spam out a button at the right time. The other problem I had was it felt short and the beginning felt much more dense then the end. I just felt like it was more of a story experience then actual challenging game. The written story was good and the characters actually fit in well with their roles, it just didn't create that feeling of accomplishment when I finished it.Online Multiplayer:Horrible don't even think about buying any of the dlc for online, if you do find players they are usually online because they want to try it out for the first time and leave or play for achievements. There was literally no point of putting this rip off search and destroy/team deathmatch COD rip off in the game. The maps were literal scratch from the game and it was an excuse to make extra money. The devs made another big mistake with the multiplayer by making 15 of the obtainable achievements only accessible in multiplayer. Since the tiny playerbase only is on for like 4 hours every day you have to find friends in the community to help gain achievements.....And they added a ranked mode which has literally no rank just a identical copy of the casual mode called ranked. I had a painful time playing in private lobby for hours upon hours just to get all 50 achievements, just make sure you go into this game with knowledge of the garbage multiplayer because this game was meant to be single player.Final Score: 7/10 Not the best"

The visuals are gorgeous even though I have to tone down the graphics settings a fair bit due to having a potato laptop. It's fairly linear and I agree with reviews that say it plays a bit like a movie as there is a fair bit of scripted sequences. I probably spent 3x the amount of time completing the optional objectives compared to the main story. The optional tombs are kind of easy, except for one where it took me some time to figure out where to jump. Solve one puzzle and you're done, so it feels a bit underwhelming. A feature I appreciate is that you are allowed to backtrack to complete accomplishments that you weren't able to complete in earlier parts. That said, some of the things are really hard to spot even if you use survival instincts. In general, the puzzles are quite easy which I suppose makes the game accessible to newcomers to the franchise like me.I find the QTE parts quite challenging, probably the toughest part of the game. For most of them I usually end up dying once or more times since you are given such a short time to react. There were also some parts where it wasn't clear where to go and I have to fall to my death several times before I figured it out.I'm a bit surprised at some of the encounters where you face waves of enemies. Sometimes it feels more like a mass-killing machine type shooter game (don't know what the correct term for that type of game) rather than a survival action. I like the variety of weapons, alternate firing modes, and the finishing moves. I like that the enemies will scramble and take cover to make it harder for you to hit though sometimes they seem to have bad aim, expose half their body when taking cover, and take a long time to fire so mostly the fights are fairly easy. There's also a health regeneration system so as long you don't take too much damage in a short amount of time you'll fully recover. Seriously, Lara is probably a superhuman, jumping and climbing around like nothing given the insane amount of injuries she sustained throughout the game.I like climbing around and exploring the terrains and structures. I feel like going ""wheeee~"" whenever I slide down a rope.  The view when you climb up really high is just breathtaking and at the same time triggers my fear of heights. There were some parts where I spent too much time figuring out how to solve until later on it turns out that the required tools have to be unlocked by plot."

The gameplay is a mix of classic Tomb Raider exploration (in the best possible way) and more modern and intimate combat systems. The visuals are frequently incredible and certainly underrated.  Strong voice acting drives a great story that will have you transfixed up to (and past) the game's final cresendo. 10/10 from this reveiwer - I couldn't imagine it being better.As an added bonus - the multiplayer is actually very fun and has a small but dedicated community. If you're after more once you finish the game's core experience don't hesistate to jump in.

The game alternates calm and intense moments and it's good for playing in short sessions. Lots of Easter egg hunts; I've finished the single player campaign with a 92% completion rate.

It's a huge departure from previous TR games that had you control a Barbie Doll with shooters along a fairly linear run. Granted, Lara is still shimmying along ledges and shooting baddies, but large parts of the game have lost their linearity and are now open areas that you can scour for story content and loot. The enemies are better, your own tactical possibilities are better, the physics and the physics puzzles are better, and the storyline is vastly better. This game is an adventure and a shooter and an exploration game, and it does all of these things well. The graphics and physics have improved enormously, and together with the competent voice acting (extraordinary in the case of the German voice for Lara, Nora Tschirner), it all comes together to make a huge immersive experience that took me over 30 hours to complete 100% -- on easy. There was never a boring moment. (Some of the boss fights have something of the old TR, you need to do a special move and then hit him just right, and that three times in a row; also, some of the quick-time-events break immersion, but we're talking minutes out of many hours of gaming.)I've played different versions of Tomb Raider before, and don't recall ever making it to the end of the first level. This one, I couldn't put it down. If you own it and haven't played it, you don't know what you're missing. Do play at least into ""Coastal Forest"" (you should get at least to the part with the wolves) and ideally up into ""Mountain Village"", which is the first really huge level. (You will realize how huge later, when you learn to shoot and traverse ropes.) If your computer supports it, do turn on ""Tress Effects"", which makes Lara's hair appear as single strands. I played with all settings maxed (except for AA) and a resolution of 1280x720 (reduced for framerate) on a 24"" monitor, and the game looked gorgeous. But it's not the looks, it's the gameplay that kept me hooked."

Chronicles Demo on PC. So i'm pretty much unbiased when it comes to Tomb Raider series. Since most people nowadays totally ignore the legacy where certain game comes from, closest notable (in my opinion) is XCOM. The Firaxis  remake and the, eas it 3rd-person shooter.. Which i heard was.. MEH at best. But i'm getting sidetracked.Tomb Raider follows the exploits of Lara Croft on her first expedition to seek an mythical tomb of an ancient Empress. And i cannot say anything more about the plot because i try to avoid spoilers.On the subject of storyline, i finished it in 10 hours if Steams playtime-meter is to be trusted. And this was with SOME faffing around some of the optional tombs an collectables. I finished the game at 77% Completion and that in 10 hours, might show some padding towards its length. However since i can somewhat give the optional time wasting on EXP-Grindings part, i think if you just blast the main storyline i'm sure it can be done under 7 hours. And since the story is (what i can see) about Laras development into the iconic heroine as portrayed in the original series.. So blasting through the story, might cause you to ignore the character development and other fine details altogether. The story was.. Okay. And i really cannot explain it that well, this is like trying to explain the storyline of any of the movies to someone. So with that excuse i shall escape stage left...Into the second part, which is the gameplay.Standard 3rd-person affair. Jump, climb but no crouch for some reason, unless you are in a fight situations. Which i will get to in a bit.. Basically, the gameplay consist of running around the area, climbing on those certainly obvious ledges and wall-kick jumps. But the heavier part of this is the combat, of dear...Combat, like in the previous paragraf. is the standard 3rd-person action affair. Taking cover in some conviniently placed chest-high walls and stuff.... Although the game somewhat tries to urge you to do it stealthily, which i did not succeed, even with intense trying. Since it kinda looks like that stealth is viable to a certain point and then you are forced to pull out the big guns and pulverize some fools. And speaking of weapons, the bow... I noticed that it might be possible to pass the game with just the bow, i'm pretty sure it can be done. Since the enemies suffer from the same ""I'm sure in perfect cover right now""-Syndrome which caused the halfwits to position that way that their head is visible. And they give enough time for you to aim and fire the bow. Some of the enemies rush you, which when you get the counter-maneuver can be gotten rid of with a matter of seconds.. But lets get rid of the tangent before i say something offensive...Visuals and music are.. somewhat forgettable. I cannot at the time of writing, about 15-minute after competing the game. Remember any part of the soundtrack. Other that the pounding music during combat...Visually, the game is also semi forgettable. Although you would think, that a semi-tropical (or atlest in the Tropical climate-zone) Would have some vibrant greens and lots of foliage.. Instead you are treated so somewhat bland sortie of bleak forests , broken down bunkers, decaying villages and other equally imaginative areas. I might sound a bit biased, but that is because i have been playing FarCry 3 recently.  And after playing other bleak visual games i just get easily turned off.Otherwise, passing some of my pet-peeves. I feel that the game is good. Even if i'm turning a bit naggy with it.The strongest part of the game, is the storyline. And nothing much else, everything else feels... Hmmh.. I think the only way i can portray my thoughts is, to say that everything else feels unnecessary. Not really contributing in any way, like i said, i felt as the games length was padded. And like i also said, everything else pretty much only serves EXP-Grinding and nothing much else. But can that be an excuse ? Not really, and can the soryline carry the game ? Yyyyyyes ? I think. Although thinking about the story just made me remember some of the the obvious plot twists...ARRRR... Me brain!Anyway.. Tomb Raider is a reasonable story experience, even with some of the minor quirks it has. Although some friends of the original series might find this SECOND reboot, (Yes i DOUBLE checked that if i was correct.) A bit more in tune with the originals and also making some newer generation compromises a bit... Meh.Trust me, there is a treasure at the end of this Tomb, this, renmant of the gaming culture wrapped around is a see-trough vale of next generation graphics.Tomb Raider get a rather reasonable: B, as in BUM."

I've never cared about the Tomb Raider franchise or Lara ever before. This game made me feel some empathy for her character and adventure.This game, while riddled with problems, is pretty fun for the most part. The story plays out like a bad early 90's movie. The side characters are horribly written and annoying as hell. I crossed my fingers for them to all die. The only good characters are the Crofts. It doesn't really make sense to have these annoying characters since they do nothing in the game and Lara is the main focus. There are action moments that are bordering ridiculous and entertaining. I found myself either laughing at or laughing with the game. You'll know what I mean with you encounter them. The game only fails when the game tries to make take these scenes with a straight face instead of humor.The gameply is a mix of boring boring boring faux-exploration and fun firefights. It's similar to the Zelda or Batman Arkham games. It's a linear game with an open world feeling. You'll open new areas depending on the tools/weapons you're carrying. The puzzles can range from overly simplistic to convolutedly difficult. None of these puzzles are at the very least realistic.Tomb Raider steals a lot from multiple games yet it does a lot well. The cross bow is maybe the best cross bow action I've ever played. You pretty much start with the cross bow yet later in the game you'll have access to other weapons and guns. But I mostly stuck with just the cross bow because it was so much fun. The game is at its best when you're in peril. Either horror-esque moments, survivalist-danger moments, or firefight-action moments. There are several jaw-dropping gorgeous scenes that combine great art direction and scenery that I really did not expect. It's kinda amazing these scenes made it into this game.For all the similar game design pitfalls that this game duplicates from other franchises, Tomb Raider builds on the action-adventure platform and makes it its own. Lara is finally cool again. But please make the side characters interesting (or non-existant) and stop with the horrible 90's story-line."

I had sort of high hopes for this title and it filled those, and even more. In the game, you are Lara Croft, an adventurous woman that wants to know the secrets of the island called Yamatai and escape from there. But how did the game turn out?I don't want to spoil it too much, but just be aware that there will be many emotional parts. Main character and his friends feel meaningful to the story. You can sense that they are people too and don't obsess some super powers that makes them immune to danger. This keeps the game interesting and makes you to want investigate the lore even more to progress the story.After you have beaten the game, you can go back to the island and explore the places you didn't check out. I'm pretty sure that there is replay value with higher difficulty. Also multiplayer is a thing but I didn't like it. It took fairly long to find a match, and when it found one, both enemys were level 60 (I belive it's the maximum or pretty close to it) and my team mate was around level 40. When the game started, I and my team mate just got rekt by the enemy. Maybe the game is just too old to have enough players for multiplayer.I really liked the graphics in this game. Visuals had a really good ratio with quality and performance. When the sky is clear, you can see really far and still the fps dosn't go down that badly. There are some places that can hit the frame rate but those are rare. My Intel HD 620 had an average of 30-40fps with normal-high details 720p resolution (Ambient Occlusion, high precision and FXAA disabled). Don't even bother using TRESSFX hair quality if you don't have more higher end computer. Enabling that dropped my fps like 65%. It may look cool but is fps hungry.There are a lot of sounds in this game. There are different sound for walking on different surfaces etc. You can really feel immersed into the place you are at currently. Dungeons have their own ambient sounds that make them feel like dungeons or tombs, how you wanna call them. When heavy music with high bpm kicks in, you know there's something really cool or dangerous happening. The soundtrack is epic and meaningful.I didn't notice any major bugs in my playthrough. No camera clipping or physics bugs. The only small annoyances were with some walls you could climb. Lara just didn't want to climb on top of the wall and I had to reload a checkpoint to get further. Also the game didn't crash even once and alt tabbing is a breeze.Now after playing the game, that long list of awards is easily explained... It's a great adventure and leaves you to want to play more Tomb Raider games.The game is kinda gory and includes disturbing scenes. It also includes a lot of intense situations with some things that can scare you. If you don't like those, I recommend skipping this one. Otherwise, give it a go! You won't regret it! I promise ;)"

You're Lara Croft who isn't really experienced with combat and agility (other than climbing mountains and things) unlike the older games in the Tomb Raider Franchise who is on a ship looking artifacts with other crew members, and it crashed by mysterious storms leaving Lara and the team shipwrecked on this strange island. With Lara separated with the rest of the group, she must find shelter and start hunting for food so she can survive the night. Within the island witness danger with a mysterious cult who were men who was also shipwrecked on the island for years and cannot leave due to the mysterious weather conditions that stops rescues from leaving. It's up to Lara to discover the mystery of the island and save herself and the crew into safety.I like the combat in this. Like I said about Lara, she isn't really experience. She finds a bow and some arrows and starts hunting with it. The bow and arrows are my favorite weapon in the game. I would use over powerful items like the shotgun and assault rifle. It's a very stealthy weapon and it feels fantastic when earning a headshot without someone noticing that his 'brother' got killed. It's rewarding!There are a lot of collectibles in this game, some are very simple like GPS caches which are very small and well hidden and there are very complex puzzles like the optional tombs that I've mentioned below. They are very rewarding to find these and earning around 5 achievements for them. Although, I didn't collect them all within my playthrough, I decided to continue the post-game which is just the island in free play. I am very thankful the developers did this since I was worried when I got to the last camp site and it said 'No return point' and I will have to replay the game from the start.The optional tomb challenges was one of my favorite things in the game. The discovery of them was so interesting and I will always head on in them when I get the chance. The problem is.. they are really small. It takes around 10 minutes. 5 minutes to look around the area and 5 minutes to actually complete the tomb. You get a treasure map for that area and that's it. You leave it. They are around 6 of them and that's it. It's a shame about that. I would loved some more challenges other than the 'Press X to light statue' or 'Press X to pick up egg'.The other problem I had with this game was that the enemies was too generic. They were 80% Cult followers men (I'm guessing they were from the same cult since they have the same models) 15% Wolves and 5% Temple Guardsmen which only appeared in two levels and that even had Cult followers in them as well. I didn't see any other dangerous animals other than wolf and man. Well, at least they are no spiders in it! (other than Underworld).I haven't played the multiplayer yet but I heard from others that it isn't really worth trying it out. I'm unsure if they are anyone who stills plays it.  I mean, I should try it out but nah. Maybe later..I would still recommend this game. Definitely. I'm not a big Tomb Raider player but I didn't stop playing this game. I would love to play a sequel if It had similar gameplay to this. Thank you Crystal Dynamic and Square Enix for this reboot."

The strange thing is, I don't replay games, only a few games have a replay vaule for me and one can count them on about the average finger count of a persons right hand.This game is one of my all time favorites on the PC, and since I passed it twice it's most certainly on my top 3 or 5 list amongst Jade Empire, TES IV Oblivion (the game I completed more than two times) and CoD4:MW. The other two games, I'm not even going to mention since it took me more than 5 years before replaying them.Tomb Raider (2013) gets a 10/10 in my book. It has a story, has good graphics, runs fine on many systems and the most important thing - is really interesting -> offers some replayability."

There really isn't much interactivity, and there are way too many quick time events. I liked the stealth parts of the game, but the combat just isn't very good; the weapons don't handle very well.

At the beginning I found my heart pumping and my head racing as it would put me in scenarios that felt very real and very exciting. The idea that I was getting my adrenaline pumping from a game that wasn't a multiplayer shooter was quite different from what I was used to. This left me feeling great about completing missions and tasks. I really enjoyed the crafting and modifying of all the tools and weapons in the game as well. The system they used and the progression at which you were able to add things to a weapon seemed to flow very smoothly as the difficulty of the game increased. Even though these modifications were quite unrealistic I still found myself thinking ""Well it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lara Croft. She can do anything on the spot."". As far as story line goes it was a little confusing at first with all the gods and how the storms tie in with everything. I found though that this confusion wasn't due to a lack of explanation but was more to immerse the player in the game with Lara as she fights to find out what the island is all about.I really loved a lot about this game and can't think of many things that I didn't like. 9-10/10"

Now its even more about murder.You play as Lara Croft, the world’s most durable woman. Lara is in search of an ancient kingdom that is supposedly in the pacific near Japan. Hey look, its real, and suddenly the ship she’s on, the Endurance, is caught in a storm and actually breaks in half. After being knocked out by a stinky man, Lara wakes hanging from the ceiling, escapes by lighting herself on fire, and then takes rebar to the side.Hey good job Lara, 5 minutes in. Lucky for us, Lara is a genetically engineered super soldier capable of shrugging off most wounds and also possibly being the greatest mass murderer since Genghis Khan.Hey, its not murder, they started it.Now Lara must find a way to get off the island, and not die horribly because this game is weird with the game over screens. Like, I feel like someone got a little too into animating Lara suffering. Please don’t hurt my beautiful daughter like that, I care for her deeply. Tomb Raider is a remake of 1996 action platformer: Tomb Raider about Tomb Raider. Only this time the Tombs are kind of a side thing and its mostly about platforming and shooting people that deserve it. I mean, thats what the other games were about, but now you kill significantly less hostile wild life while you go about your business. Lara is armed with a plethora of weapons, like a pistol, machine gun, shotgun, mandatory girl bow, and a climbing pick that can also pick human brains. As you play the game, you also gain skill points that gives Lara more abilities to work with, like literally throwing dirt into peoples eyes and also stabbing them with an arrow head like she’s in TF2 or something.Oh yeah, the combat is fantastic.Every weapon has a nice OOMPH to it, and Lara is such a nimble and mobile character that you’re basically always on the offensive, safe for a few scripted instances. The combat areas are just open enough that you have full reign to just go nuts. Lara climbs fast, moves fast, and dodges fast. As long as you’re moving and know when to use cover, you can basically fight circles around the cultists chumps that though they actually stood a chance against a rich girl in her 20s. A lot of gameplay I’ve seen have people playing it like a cover based shooter, popping up to take shots on enemies. But the problem with that is, if you stick around in one place, you can get overrun pretty easily. There is enough enemy variety to keep you on your toes after the first combat encounter.And, I mean, you can play Vanquish as a cover-based shooter as well. You shouldn’t. But you can. If I do have some complaints about the game its that sometimes the platforming doesn’t agree with you.   Lara won’t grab on to what you jump at or just flat out slide off to your death without a chance to save yourself. The supporting cast is basically just toast. They sort of just exist to move the story along, there’s some drama but its drama the same way American cheese is cheese. Except Grim.Grim’s cool. Tomb Raider was a surprise, I wasn’t expecting it to be such a blast. I don’t remember where I got it, I think it was from Humble Bundle for free, all I know is I didn’t pay for it.I don’t pay for things if I can help it. It usually goes on sale for sometimes as low as three dollars, which is kind of a steal. I had a good time if not just how good the combat was. Pick it up, or else.I didn’t mean to threaten you, I’m sorry.Tomb Raider gets an 8 out of 17 or something. George Lucas’ daughter is a professional MMA fighter."

You do not have to play through previous episodes in order to enjoy the game at the fullest.+ Exploration+ Story+ Characters+ Graphics (dat hair)+ User-friendliness+ Decent multiplayer+/- Console-esque gameplay+/- QTEs+/- Little to no recoil+/- Lara's accent (I personally love it)- Repetitiveness- No replay value- The shotgun has more bark than bite- The controls feel clumsy- No manual saveAll in all, I recommend the game to everyone, not only to the die-hard fans.I would like to begin by saying that I haven't played any of the previous episodes of the series. This review comes from someone who has little idea what the Tomb Raider series are about. Having said that, this game is a great (and easy) way to get acquainted with Ms Croft.I must admit that I enjoyed the game much more than I thought I would! The thing I like the most is exploration. Although the plot is quite linear (it feels like watching a film), the places we travel to (which are accessible at any moment via ""Fast Travel Camps"") are admirable. This is not only due to their design, but also thanks to the amazing graphics. I can only imagine how tremendously good this game looks on ""high"" settings... The story is told in a multi-dimensional way. Throughout the course of the game, we can find various documents which show the events through the eyes of different characters. I definitely recommend taking the time to read them.The game is designed for consoles and, in my opinion, the gameplay suffers greatly from it. To begin with, there is an abundance of QTEs (Quick Time Events). Some swear by QTEs, but I cannot stand them. Second, the gunplay is characterised by little to no recoil and relies on random bullet spread. I know that many people prefer to just point and shoot, but I prefer having recoil as I believe it increases the skill ceiling in multiplayer (the one who controls the gun better wins). Weapons are overally well-balanced, but the shotgun has more bark than bite. And last but not least, the controls feel clumsy and are not responsive enough.Although the story is presented really well and there is a lot of area to explore, the game gets slightly repetitive. Also, it is very easy (at least on ""normal"" difficulty). Some riddles are more challenging than others, but finishing the game is almost effortless.A few words about multiplayer: it is decent. My favourite mode is ""Rescue"", which is an interesting variation of the good old Capture the Flag. One team (The Survivors) has to grab a few med-kits (their location is mostly random) while the other (The Solarii) has to execute the opponents. The multiplayer may be laggy, as it relies on peer-to-peer connection.To conclude, this is a very solid game and I can definitely recommend it to everyone, not just to the die-hard fans. There are some shortcomings, but overall I am fond of the game.P.S. Please check out my other reviews here: My curation page:"

And they were right, there was too much of it compared to the originals. This one is even worse in that sense, it doesn’t really have anything in common with the original beside the name. It’s an action game in the vein of Uncharted, and where there were puzzles before there are shootouts here. It doesn’t even have tombs, not really – the optional ones that are there are a complete joke. Unless if, of course, you consider whole Jamatai as one giant tomb. Which isn’t really far from the truth. An old school fan, and I always considered myself as one such, of TR really wouldn’t find much for him here.I came for tombs and puzzles and got shootouts and set pieces.And I found myself not caring at all, the gameplay was so fun, the graphics were breathtaking, even collecting all the additional crap was fun. As nostalgia is a curious thing, nothing will probably ever beat the likes of San Andreas, Mafia, Allied Assault, Most Wanted, RE4 etc. of my favorite games list, but this is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. And besides, Lara is nice to look at."

The gameplay is enjoyable, not tough (playthrough on hard) and very linear if played by the game's rules. The story takes place on an island known as Yamatai and features the queen Himiko. These two topics are Chinese and Japanese legends (Yamatai location even being discussed and argued about within Historians), and the writers of Tomb Raider (2013) had run with it and created a TR game just based off of the names. The gameplay itself is moderately simple as I had stated above only if you play by the game's rules. There are a lot of minor time savers (roll jump cancel and out of bounds), but those would be for speedrunning the game. If I could compare this game to something else I would say it is very similar to Last of Us. You can switch between 4 weapons, customize and upgrade them. You are also given the options to buy skills with skillpoints you earn which give you better combat options, survivability and exp gaining. The game can be played in a guns blazing style or a more stealthy approach. Depending on situation one may be more favorable than the other. I think what really stuck out to me were the characters themselves. You can really feel the transformation that Lara goes through from when you first start controlling her to how she's almost a different person by the end. Each character that you meet is defined well and you will have love-hate relations which each one. Overall it is definitely worth a playthrough as it is a very stress free game and has a good story."

The graphics are good and the world is well done and same goes for the sound and voice acting.As for the gameplay I can only say that Tomb Raider = Assassin's Creed + Far Cry 3 + Lara Croft.At a smaller scale, of course.It has a cool Far Cry 3 atmosphere and the skill/level up system as well as the weapons upgrade/mod system are similar but not that complex. The platforming is very similar to the one in AC series and that's definitely not a bad thing, What's really cool about this game is that Lara is now a more human now, not overconfident and expressionless like it seamed in the old games.

Some fans felt more betrayed than Henry Hill's friends did when he ratted them out at the end of Goodfellas (spoiler alert), but I for one applaud this risky tactic and I genuinely enjoyed the gameplay. The story was alright. There was some sort of magical force that would kill anyone who tried to escape or enter the isolated island. I wasn't really paying attention to it because I was too distracted by Lara's accent. I think it was either Kiwi or South African. The characters were a wide variety of personalities. Some friend of Lara carried around some stupid camera recording nothing relevant while the rest of the cast worked. For some reason the enemies in the game call her the ""Sun Queen."" There was this one nerdy guy though who totally wanted to bang Lara, but she had him laughably deep in the friend zone. Whoever wrote the parts of the story where he tries to flirt with her deserves a promotion. Some Scottish guy was also in the storyline somewhere and for some reason he had to make it clear he was Scottish at every given opportunity. He died from falling off a cliff, probably because he was drunk off of Guinness. Overall I would give the game an 8/10."

I was constantly compelled to keep moving; one session, i started at 9pm and by the time I felt the need to check the time, it was 6am.The voice acting was simply stunning.

As a fan of action-focused RPG games, I found the gameplay quite enjoyable, especially when you have collected a few upgrades for your weapons. The constant GPS cache and artifact collecting can get dull pretty fast, but thankfully, they're not essential to the main plot and game progression. The storyline itself was decent enough for a modern game (even though it is really linear) and definitely better than what the original games had. Lara and the rest of the ensamble have distinct personalities this time, and that makes the story more captivating and lets the player get invested in the plot as a whole. The graphics are really good for the year the game was released in and Lara's hair physics is quite a joy to watch.This is a great game for one or two playthroughs and even offers a fun multiplayer. I would definitely recommend the game, especially since it's constantly sold at a discounted price."

When it came out, it was a breath of fresh air for the franchise. The new Lara was easy to empathize with, and I found myself caring about her.Gameplay: 9/10There are a few moments where you have to wiggle Lara around to get her to crouch into a hole or slip into a crevice but overall the game plays well and feels good. Apparently, the game suffered from a lot of crashes when it released, but I hadn't noticed many at all from 2014 on. Just don't alt-tab out unless you've paused the game. Exploration was a little iffy in some places, especially the Challenge ""Previous Inhabitants"" where the last poster is in a ridiculously hard to notice place, but overall the exploration was a bit too easy. A few of the achievements will likely require you to replay the game once; the requirements for ""Chatterbox"" are not obvious unless you are very close to the target and you will probably miss them in the first map area. You can probably get all the other single player ones in about 20 hours.Controls: 9/10The dodge/counter mechanic feels a little clunky at times, I often missed the counter early even though it felt like I was hitting the button at the right moment.Graphics: 10/10The graphics feel a little dated after 7 years, but are still beautiful enough to stand up against modern titles.A beefy card is needed for this game, using a RTX 2080 @1080p I had to set Anti-Aliasing at 2xSSAA as opposed to 4xSSAA, but everything else was maxed out or turned on and I managed 119-200 FPS with V-Sync enabled even in heavy combat sequences. A 2080 Super could probably run it with completely maxed at this resolution, but should tone back the Anti-Aliasing at higher resolutions.Music: 10/10The music is superb. Suspenseful during tense moments when your trying to sneak or kicking butt and noticeably calm when you've cleared an area.Sound: 9/10There are moments where Lara will start talking at the campfire, and if you accidentally used the fire you'll probably already exited before realizing she was saying something. Thankfully, you can review these at leisure. Just open the Map and click on ""Documents"" in the upper right area of the screen. This is thankfully the only issue I've noticed with this game. Shots from weapons are real enough to feel right and directional ques come across correctly. Caverns have echos of water drops and flames roar and crackle.Overall: 9/10A score of 9/10 is my minimum for a Game of the Year nominee, and this game certainly was mine for 2013. It's a good game, and if you like action shooters with a bit of exploring, this will keep you content."

I have to tell you, given the thought that I bought it for 4,99€ on special's discount, money more than well spent. This game is AWESOME and overall best tomb raider game ever. What more one of best aciont games ever. I mean yes, all games have flaws but this game's flaw (yes, singular), if it has it, you have to really really really try to find it. Ok, now if you're still with me, upthere is true...mostly...Honestly, good this game ofers really puts shadow over bad but there are some anoying stuff with this game hardly worth mentioning. Or to be picky and/or ""really really really try to find flaw as said before..here are some.. (some spoiler allert) : She could scream bit less, cause, even though justified, it is bit rutheless what dev's are doing to her during gameplay hours.  MULTIPLAYER!!!! theese games should NEVER EVER EVER step into waters of multiplayer. what the hell is that? What is that good for EVER? you're not buying this game for multiplayer, if you are you're sane..but fortunately I don't focus my review or grade on this part of game. So ye... I would need 19999999 more words to spit on MP...you get the picture. I'm only playing MP here cause I am an achievement w#0re, and I want every single achievement I can get. Yep, suffering...I know I know, having a disorder is a b1tch. Four years ago, when I first played this game I was running on Athlon 64 X2 3000+, 4 GiG DDR2, and nVidia 8800 GTX. Had a good game experience, but I wished that I could see the game in it's full glory. So having lara's TresFX hair was out of the picture. So was SSAA4x or some of thos nice high end graphics settings. I mean gaming with Lara's fancy hair (where every other enemy or ally have nothing similar...unecessary option if you ask me), you hardly notice difference.. Who does give a S#1t if her every hair behave differently and who has time to notice that, once you've seen it initially? Point on this : Now I have replayed this game on Intel i5, 8 GiG DDR3, nVidia 660 Ti, fairly stronger than before and as i recall i had same settings as before.. so quite of upgrade for nothing? Difference? While before I had poor framerate when running high settings, now game runs fine but my DCII on GPU was louder than my mother in law stepin on a dog's pop in the middle of her living room. Now you don't know the sound of that..but trust me...ANNOYING!!!! I had to turn down graphics settings again to have bareable gameplay. Don't get me wrong, I don't think my config is High End now, but it's quite alright for the time, and I have no problem with other games. I'm just saying they could do bit more effort into fixing this aspect of the game. Game looks very good on lower settings too though. Can't wait for the sequel. ""Rise of the Tomb Raider""So everything considered, and I know i did b1tc# a bit about it, I still give this game solid"

I have come full circle and finally brought the game to completion in regards to the side challenges, which prompted me to write a review for this wonderful game. A doughnut who mainly enjoys multiplayer games and seldom singleplayer adventures, I was blown away by Tomb Raider. Tomb Raider grappled me with interest, quite literally, from the get-go and I was sold. If you take a look through my gallery of screenshots, it is quite apparent that the game started out beautifully and evolved into one-heck of a diamond mine by the end of the tale. I remember quite a few times in the game just standing and looking around spamming [F12] while Solarii soldiers made quick work, attacking me in my transfixed state.Although Tomb Raider's scenery is fantastic, that is not the only area where this game shines. You are  Lara Croft. Immersed into a vast world of assassin-like game play, you must use your survival instincts and various weapons to progress throughout the story and attempt to conquer the zealot by the name of Mathias. With pristine and seemingly realistic graphics, you will venture through a mesmeric experience with puzzles, obstacles, parkour, fights, take-downs, and more.I snagged the GOTY edition during the Summer Sale, but this game is worth the full price. Prove your survival prowess and step onto the ominous island of Yamatai. 9/10 - Challenges are a bit onerous. 8.5/10 - Not the best final boss fight. 10/10 - Not confusing, easy to learn, and extremely fun with variance in take-downs. Nope, more so eerie. None 10/10 Not easy. 16/50 achievements are multiplayer based and are tedious. Hidden achievement (Called Chatterbox, look it up before you begin).  10/10 This game was created for singleplayer. One and done sort of campaign. I do not see myself replaying the singleplayer. 3/10 - Not a game that excels in multiplayer. Very rarely are there players online."

You may hate her character at first, but stranded on a remote island full of bloodlust crazy people quickly turn her into a badass adventurer that we all love.The graphics and the details are gorgeous. Lara's movement is so smooth and real. The control's also very good. The gameplay itself is more balanced, not only dominated with puzzles, but there're also actions, stealth and survival.At the other side, I feel that the puzzles're rather easy. Puzzles have become a major part of the series. By lowering the puzzles difficulty, I feel something's missing. I hope the next TR will come back with more challenging puzzles.Overall, this's a great game. A must buy."

MP is a great way to spend some time on, leveling up your rank, upgrading weapons, unlocking items is very fun in this game and you will never get bored.

Also, around half of the achievements are for multiplayer, which kind of sucks for a primarily single player game.Still highly recommend this game for the story alone."

Do you like a lack of choices? With an action/adventure setting. You will love this game. I do not. It is a quick time event on a leash. I hate to say it but even though this game is very polished and seems to have a good story the hand holding and the quick time events make it on my not recommending list.(And one of the least favorite games I have played in a decade.) It breaks any immersion. I will keep playing to see if it gets better. As its not a bad game but for the money I would look else where. So I kept playing, but this game is not getting better. It is very average with no replay value. Are people paid to wright good reviews for this? I mean you don't raid tombs, and you just do quick time events, meshed into cut scenes. I bought this for 3.99 and would rather have my 3.99. I think people are to envolved in how Lara looks to notice the poor attempt at game play. The story is average as well. Seriously the first Tomb Raider wasn't great(get over it, it wasn't) but the fact this is claiming to be the same in the series is just wronge. You would think they would branch out like Tomb Raider 2 did, but no. There are less options on how to do something then back in Laras PSX days. At least there you didn't get ""PRESS A!!!!"".... PRESS B, oh you're dead. Retry? With visuals better in open world games that can't be why people like it. Maybe it's the story? No... With Bio Shock Infinite proving this is a trash cliche TV movie story. It's not the gameplay. It's just aweful. The only thing I can think of is the SLI/Crossfire scaling, but seriously are you running it at 150+ FPS? So if you like average games that run well, with lazy quick time events. This is for you. I am ""Overwellingly Postive"" that this game is average at best. Xbox One is getting a timed exclusive on the next game. I say let the One have it and contain this mess. Why? Why? Why, do people like a lack of choices and sub typical third person gameplay. And for any one who want's to argue.... QTEs! QTEs!!!! QTEs... QTEs... They should not exist"

In the end I gave up on them and stopped buying. I saw all the great reviews this new version was getting but I still held back, it wasn't until many friends began recommending it that I decided to revisit Lara's world and I'm very glad I did. For me it felt less like a improvement on the series, more of a complete reinvention. Gone was the cute, ridiculous, big boobed caricature. Instead was this more believable human with emotion, detail and fragility. No game is perfect but I find it hard personally to find faults. The graphics were beautiful, the contextual animation of Lara amazing, the story decent, voice acting good, level design fab and action and gameplay great.

Games like these made my bitter childhood a better childhood. What can i say this is the first and only Tomb Raider game i got to play as a kid and i'am yet to play the others ( will play them all soon :D ) but from what i can say this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10/10. This is 3rd time playing this as i'm writing this. The first 2 times i played it as a kid :) ( obviously i played it cracked ) now that i'm grown up i got it on steam and why ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ not! completed the story. Thank you Games :)Actual review -The story takes place in an island where Lara Croft and her colleagues are trapped in an island because of a shipwreck caused my natural disaster. They initially came to this island hoping to find something with historical value ( i wont spoil dw). But later on they discover that they are not alone in this island and the shipwreck wasn't a ""Natural Disaster"" Our goal as Lara Croft is to explore the tombs and find the secrets of the island and find a way to ESCAPE! on the way you will face a lot of powerful enemies and a lot of puzzles and ♥♥♥♥ yea expect a lot of parkour :).Game play review -Is this game even 2013? The story was amazing the graphics were gorgeous the game was soo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ smooth ( always has been even on my old 10 year old pc ) puzzles were not that complicated unless you do the optional tombs which can be quite challenging but not complicated ( 12 year old dumb me did those common guys XD ) it takes 10 hours to complete the story and i think after completing for me the progression was 62% and to get to 100% you need to do all the side quests and complete all the achievements ( cant be bothered zzzzzzz. i have a life :D ) yes buy this and play the story what the hell are you waiting for :) i don't care if your'e 13 year old or 69 year old grandpa play it this a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ movie but you know what you will get to experience it rather than sitting on your couch with ur chips and coke XDp.s. the character Samantha ( the one who got chosen to be Himeko's vessel ) is 100% my type.

Graphically, you can rarely fault this game. It offers a massive variety of environments, from deep dark caves to beautifully sun bathed landscapes, and captures the idea of being stranded on an island perfectly. The vast mountains and asian inspired scenary is almost flawless. However, is it a different story when it comes to gameplay?To start off, this game offers a lot of things in bucket-loads. The first is combat. The combat feels fluid and the guns give some meaty kick which is nice compared to other third person shooters which can sometimes be lacking. There are also a wide variety of weapons, which in turns means that different situations can be dealt with in many different ways. The upgrades system can also provide some variety to combat, offering different attachments for weapons which can be obtained in order to suit your needs as a player, such as the silencer you can get for the tactical pistol, which can be a life saver in situations in which a quick silent ranged kill is in order, since the bow takes some time to get to maximum accuracy. The second is exploration and discovery. I feel like this part can be linked back to the fact that the graphical fidelity of this game is mind blowing, because exploring different areas of the map and seeing new things generally feels very rewarding, although in actual fact, you're often not rewarded at all. Platforming feels responsive and accurate, as well as genuinely satisfying.The third is the stealth element of the game. In the periods of time in which stealth can be used, it is effective and satisying. This is largely due to the absolutely brilliant minimalistic UI. It aids in immersion tenfold, rather brilliantly.However, this game does lack when it comes to key elements of the game. It is up to you whether you think these will bring down the enjoyment of the game to you. Tomb Raider, in it's legacy, has always been about platforming and exploring. Unfortunately, large parts of this game are dedicated to combat sequences which are both much too long and much too repetitive. Although there is a large array of weapons, it is often the case that enemies are just far too bullet spongey, and take far too many shots with any weapon in order to go down. This gets especially annoying when it comes to long combat sequences which cannot be avoided with stealth and are entirely scripted, as that offers even less variance. Linearity is also a problem in this game, as well as the scripted nature of some sequences in the game. I felt like I was being pushed down a road that I didn't particularly always want to follow, which not only ruined some areas of the game but also broke immersion. For instance, there is a scene around 35% of the way through the game in which there is a shooter hiding behind a shielded gun. In order to take this shooter down, you have to manoeuvre your way through the garden to a rope. However, I saw various times when I could get a good shot with weapons, but it was just scripted to not allow that paricular outcome.Another problem is the storyline. It's not anything special, nothing we haven't heard of or seen before. And characters, while initially interesting, are somewhat shallow and superficial, and often don't play any role other than to cause problems for Lara and generally extending the length of the game where it is not necessary. I will however give props to the fact that the period of time when Lara is alone and cannot find her crew, her character, through the emotions she displays, is really tested, and I feel like it was honestly one of the better 'character gets stranded on an island and has to find safety and a way home' kind of situations since Lara has to deal with the fact that she is alone. Desperation really hits home, and her emotions were so well presented that you genuinely feel pity for Lara and her situation, and you really want it to all be okay. I also have to give props to the sound department and the voice actor too, both having done amazing work with the various emotions from anger to sadness and desperation.This honestly feels like the type of game in which after completion, you may be able to hop into and just admire for it's beauty. It has faults, of course, but smooth gameplay and beautiful scenary create a masterpiece of video gaming. Lara starts off as a panicked hopeless character but as progression continues, she turns into a feared ruthless killer willing to do anything and go to any lengths to save herself and her crew, even if it means doing so alone."

If you have every played, or wished you could play the Uncharted games on Playstation 3, you can't go wrong with this game. it takes what made the original Tomb raider games great, and takes them back to square 1, easing you into a game full of traversal and a few puzzles, but with some familiar gun play and cover shooting and stealth.You will find that the game has a lot more to it than the Uncharted games however, with much more variety in traversal, and different gadgets that help you get around, such as a rope and arrow to make ziplines, and a climbing axe allowing you to climb all over specific walls, unlike the very linear nature of the Uncharted games. another aspect that removes itself from the Uncharted game's linear nature is the free-roaming hub world mechanic, which means you can go back and explore any area you have previously visited, with new gadgets to get to new areas, and even with this, you never really need to back track too much, and when you do, you don't feel forced into it, you do it because you want to.Weapons are pretty good too, you get a bow, a pistol, an assault rifle and shotgun, which can be upgraded throughout the game, increasing their stats and adding secondary modes such as a grenade launcher on the rifle, flame arrows for the bow, silencers for the pistol and rifle, and incendiary rounds for the shotgun, you can also carry all 4 weapons at all times, and switch between them at will. so although there are only a few weapons, you always have access to the right tool for any job, and the different modes mean they never get boring.This game is also very good looking and well optimised for PC, giving me a solid 50fps with all settings maxed out except AA on my mid-range PC. (AMD FX-8350/AMD HD 7870)My only complaints are that the enemies are rather cliché, (grimy cultists and tough-as-nails mercenaries), quite a few things that happen in the plot are rather too convenient, and QTEs can be rather unforgiving near the beginning of the game when you haven't got the hang of them, thankfully you are never far past a checkpoint, however that could be a complaint if you like games that punish you more for failure, I personally don't mind, too many times have I given up on a game that took me back too far when I died, or i had to stop playing between few and far between checkpointsfor DLC I would recommend not bothering with Multiplayer DLC, as Multiplayer is dead, nor would i recommend the skins, none of which look as good as default, however I would recommend Tomb of the Lost AdventurerAgility SkillPistol BurstPistol SilencerAnimal InstinctHeadshot Reticuleall these together come to just over £1 when on sale, and are single player upgrades which should have been included in the base game as far as I'm concerned, this should save you about £1.50 off the GOTY price."

It even automatically saves mi-puzzle or after finding each collectible. So the penalty of death is only one or two minutes of retrying.+ Four weapons to choose from. Bows are such a pleasure to use!Pros or Cons, depending on your taste:+ The player is very well guided. Some examples are given by the three next points.+ ""Survival instinct"" allows you to see enemies, interactable objects, climbable walls, places to advance the story, and collectibles in your surroundings.+ The world is mostly linear, so it is not too difficult to find your way through the map, even though the texture of objects from the same location is very similar and not that distinguishable. In fact, most of the time you just keep moving forward, which is the only possible direction because the other three is blocked by insurmountable objects. On the other hand, exploration is very limited since paths are mostly prescribed.+ Puzzles are very light-weighted, including those in the optional tombs. Besides, Lara gives you verbal hints about how to proceed.+ Metroidvania influence. Some places or collectibles are only accessible when you have the necessary gears. So getting new equipments also unlocks more ways to explore the map.+ By well-balancing and interspersing puzzles, free roaming, action events, and cutscenes, the game keeps players engaged.+ Depending on how much time you spend on collectibles, side quests, and option tombs, a typical first playthrough takes 10-20 hours. IMO, this is just the right length to avoid being dragging or repetitive.* Your skills and weapons can be upgraded. You will be fully (or almost) upgraded at the end, even without much farming.* Very few side quests.- Quick-time events are such a pain, even on Easy mode. And some puzzles also require jumps with good timing.- The plot is meh and contains supernatural elements. But I like the depiction of how Lara grows from a feeble lass to a strong and independent  tomb raider.- You are still free to roam after the end. However, apart from collectibles and optional tombs, there are not much else to do, and enemies rarely spawn. The whole island feels empty, bleak, and lonely.Serious Cons for completionists:- Highly missable achievements that require a second playthrough to get.- Tons of difficult-to-find collectibles necessary for certain achievements, some have no sense at all in the background setting of the game (I am looking at you, ) some are even not shown on the in-game map.- 30% of the achievements are related to the multiplayer mode, which is dead on arrival and not even available on MacOS.Final words:Tomb Raider is a great game. Its story, gameplay, design, characters, graphics, all go very well together to give you a leisurely enjoyable experience, even for newcomers to 3A action games. Provided that you are not a completionist, I would say that it is a no-brainer to pick up this game. Besides, Tomb Raider is the first title of the second reboot (aka the Survivor Trilogy) of the Tomb Raider franchise. It has modern graphics, aesthetics, and gameplay design. So this is also the right starting point for anyone new to the franchise.PS:None of the DLC is actually useful. So if you wanna save a few bucks, just buy the base game instead of the GOTY version."

Great characters, environment and story!I need to admit that the last time I played this game long term or rather played the story was back in 2013 when the game just came out, so unfortunately I don't remember the story properly and therefore can't write a constructive review about the story but I know that I've enjoyed it a lot.About a month ago I decided to complete the game to 100 %, cuz I still had it at somewhat like 75 % or so. Guess what, it took me ""only"" around 10 hours of playtime to get the remaining relics and GPS caches and do all the challenges.The only negative things I could bring up, would be that the switching of weapon mods is a little bit unfamiliar (for me), that you can't run (why they didn't implement it in the single-player but in the multiplayer is very confusing), and while we're at it, the multiplayer is dead (you can't find anyone playing this game in multiplayer anymore, so all the multiplayer achievements got unachievable but luckily enough I played it back in the days) and also the graphics may not be the best if you're comparing it with today's games (obviously), but for a game from 2013 you really don't need to look at that point and be real with yourself, do you really care about excellent graphics if the story, characters and overall Gameplay is superb? No, I don't think so.I'll play the sequels for sure!Ooh, and a quick note, if you're planning to do for example the achievement ""Deadeye"" or ""Boom Goes the Dynamite"" after the story mode like myself, don't even try cuz guess what.. you slaughtered everyone on this poor island and nobody is going to respawn just like in real life... damn.. realism at it's finest.But it's worth the 20 bucks...

As a musician/singer I think those elements are also very important in a game. - RPG elements: Lara will evolve during the game, you can spend skill points on her, it's a nice change, but it could have been done better. In the end there's only one way to 'build' your Lara character. It's also nice you can upgrade your weapons, but that's also very linear, you can't make your own choices.- Secrets/lootable items: I'm a big fan of lootable items in games and acompletionist. I loved searching for all those GPS's caches, relics, documents etc.- Multiplayer: It's fun to be able to play as any character in the game, each will say their own line when you start a match or kill someone. Unlocking Lara is tough, you need to get to lvl 60 and it will take a lot of time. Especially with bow-snipers who will one-shot you :) But before you get there you will unlock lots of guns/pistols/bows and will be able to create your own playstyle.I can recommend buying the DLC maps and DLC Hitman-guns.I can't wait until the new Tomb Raider game comes out, I can't imagine it won't be available for PC. We'll see..."

I remembered being amazed with the fact that not only was it a boy playing a game with a female protagonist, she also kicked ass. He had all the games that had come out (this was like 2004) and I watched with envy as he played a cool game that was ""too grown-up"" for me. Now, buying the 2013 game (after it came out for Mac) I'm glad I got to experience this amazing adventure.The graphics are amazing. Although the lips aren't always in-sync (especially when you are talking to other members of the Endurance), the scenery is breathtaking. The animals scurring across the grass, the Tombs, even the blood river scene are detailed perfectly. The dialogue is really good in this game. It doesn't feel forced and it doesn't make you cringe. The music is just right for each part of the game.The story is just as good as the graphics. Although the secondary characters are given little character development, it doesn't feel like each one is flat and is only there just because. You feel for the Endurence crew. The gameplay is entertaining and thrilling. The combat can be a challenge at times but that just makes the game better. Even the stealth parts can be exciting. You can either try to quietly shoot the enemies and make your way through the area, or you can say ""screw it"" and attack them. Either way works (most of the time. However, there are some areas that you need to rely on stealth only).Tomb Raider has that way where it feels like you are placed in Lara's own shoes, not just an outside force controling her. This is a game I will replay again and again. 9.4/10"

It has its strengths and especially the first half is mostly very enjoyable, but the second half is pretty much just an interactive Hollywood action movie with a teaspoon of adventuring thrown in. You get more adventure pleasure by orders of magnitudes for the same amount of money if you buy some LoK or older TR titles at once.The immersion is mostly very good, with gorgeous graphics, well-done level design and a convincing soundscape, sometimes dented by the clichéed characters and story. ""Magic"" is a pretty lazy deus ex machina, and it's thrown around very liberally here.The game seems to have been designed with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in mind, because activating Lara's ""instinct"" negates all need to think about what to do and where to go, and the tombs are mostly a joke. The first three are moderately challenging, the last ones are actually amongst the easiest aprts of the game. Calling them puzzles is an insult to puzzling really. They're really more of an afterthought to justify the title, as the tacky ""Tomb raided!"" congratulatory text shows.Looking for the collectibles provides the main bulk of adventuring challenge, because a minority of them are hidden well, but mostly the way to them is just ""complicated"" to stall time (run up there, jump down there, slide down there, climb up there) instead of hard. Because of Lara's instinct finding out which is the right way is also a no-brainer. So unless you're very disciplined and never use the instinct function (the hardest difficulty does not deactivate it), this game has next to no adventuring challenge.The weapon upgrade system is interesting in the beginning, but overall it's pointless and won't noticeably affect your playstyle or combat success. Upgrading for the sake of upgrading.As mentioned before, the first half is mostly adventuring with a bit of fighting, like you're used to from TR games, but in the second half you will have many moments where enemies just constantly pour down on you like you're playing an old school arcade shooter, and some stationary wave-challenges. The last one in the monastery is the biggest and also the most infuriating one. It was actually the last straw that made me decide to write a negative review."

Lara wakes up on the island and someone kidnapps her. In this adventure, Lara will need to discover the paranormal secrets of the island. And now pro's and con's:Pros: 1. Good voice acting.

The devs did a really good work with all the little details, Example: when you jump in water (as Lara) some of the mud on her disapears wich is reallistic.3. Soundtrack is made perfectly with the locations / story parts.4. Locations are beautiful, and even more if you play on the highest resolution.Cons: 1. After finishing the storyline, there's nothing to do.2. The story line is too short :DI recommend this game to anyone who loves adventure / TPS (third person shooters).

This game received a lot of press and lot of attention. From Tomb Raider is back, to who the model for Lara Croft would be, to changes in Lara Croft in general. I initially obtained the game to play when it was released as the press and the hype for this game. Tomb Raider right from the get go engaged me. The opening was packed with action and done really well. The initial story grab your attention and grabs hold of the player within the first half-hour. You learn your abilities to the get go and realize there is more to the story beyond the story. You find your first tools but also the first archeological finding. The story of the island and story of other characters are told through these items as you travel through the mysterious island to find a way to escape with your friends/crew.The story moves at a steady pace, leaving it quite easy to keep up with the story and catch back up if they put the game down for a few days. Though as the player, I felt a bit annoyed at times it took time for the story (Lara) to catch on to the plot The game developed you (Lara) as needed. Providing power ups ability improvements, enough scrap to improve and better make Lara and her tools into stronger items. It was easy to play with both the controller and the keyboard in single player mode. Did not have difficulties in timed events or with aiming in either fashion.Though the story moved, I ended up not going for 100% or anywhere close. I found it a chore to find GPS caches and some of the items. I decided to continue with the story as I was more interested in what happened to Lara and the gang as she tried to solve the mystery rather then go hunt and find items towards the last 1/3 of the game. I still ended up with about 16 hours of actual game play, which I find is respectable for a game today.I even tried the multiplayer. Though it was alright with team deathmatch type set-up for what I tried. I think the production of a multiplayer was a waste on the developer/designer time for a Tomb Raider game. I found though the controller worked well in single player on PC, was a handicap in multiplayer.Most of my time in the game was enjoyable. After a while though I just did not feel like searching for all the items and move on with the plot for the game. I expect there to be a sequel or series of games after this revamp was really well made and received.I highly recommend playing if you have not already. It was a very good revamp of a series and I expect more to come."

It shares a lot of the same ""protagonist miraculously making it through the heaviest application of Murphy's Law possible"" action sequences while pausing a bit more in between to let you catch your breath and puzzle-solve-platform your way around collecting every possible achievement token that isn't nailed down.The graphics are impressive, the guns are weighty, the hero is likable (even if she does repeat ""I can do this"" a few dozen times too many), and the enemies are moderately challenging (in more of a ""occasionally we throw 5 guys at you at once while someone off in the corner is unloading an automatic rifle in your direction and some other sneaky punk is lobbing explosives you should probably dodge"" than in any sense of individual prowess).  The story is fun, the backstory to the island and your crew is interesting to read through as you gather it up via collectible journals, and the omnipresent ""hint view"" button is there should you ever really be left scratching your head on a puzzle or lost in the woods.Only con: some QTEs that are rather unforgiving, but if your system is fast enough to play this then the reload times are negligible and the checkpoint system is very supportive."

It runs very nicely for the most part, potentially better on AMD cards especially if you run TressFX. Display support is great as long as your display is wider than 16:9. FOV is not adjustable outside of CheatEngine which breaks the aiming zoom. It's playable at a standard PC gaming distance, but it's still a pretty significant problem, the biggest the game has in this respect.Overall, it's quite good, just as the other recent Square Enix titles. Hitman, Sleeping Dogs, etc. All 3 look and run great, and all have incredibly satisfying mouse and keyboard controls. People will insist that 3rd person games are just meant for controller, but that's just not the case with ones with such an emphasis on aiming, especially not when they're configured this excellently. The only issue with the control are that while not aiming, the camera auto-turns to follow Lara's movement direction. I'd really appreciate the option to toggle that.I'd never really played the old Tomb Raider games in the past, and that seems to be a major point of criticism against the reboot. I later purchased a few of the older games on steam and played them for a bit. Even in such a short period of time, I can confidently say that their raw mechanics pale in comparison to modern videogames. Concept and gameplay ideas are very different from raw execution of those scenarios and mechanics. The controls were clunky, the combat was pure auto-aim and it doesn't make any sense to the competent modern gamer, though the game's puzzles were compelling. Tomb Raider 2013 is absolutely a better game overall by far, but they've clearly changed their focus. I would have enjoyed more in-depth puzzles and I hope they do that for the sequel, but the combat and general movement systems feel far nicer in the modern reboot.The raw shooting and traversal feels excellent, and the environments are relatively diverse for the single island it's restricted to because of the plot. I'd like to see more places in an Uncharted style, traveling all over the world, and it's possible from this point onward now that they've established the origin story. On that note, the whole concept of Lara really becoming the iconic character wasn't really done properly, as the ludo-narrative dissonance is immense between the bordering on tears helpless emotions in the early cut-scenes, and the act of ripping through 20 heads a minute with arrows in the next clearing. If you play with a controller or are really bad at the game it might be more reasonable, but it's still notable. I remember that that was the second most common point with the initial reviews of the game. I went in just wanting satisfying gameplay, and I was more than satisfied. The story elements and hits of history/myths helped keep interest up, but I certainly didn't find it the primary draw.The visuals are high fidelity, but it's relatively monotone in terms of palette. You can improve it significantly with SweetFX, but it needs a pretty dramatic change. (I'll link the custom preset here if I ever perfect it) It's a nice atmosphere, but I've never been a fan of overly strong grey fog or washed out colors in games.General audio is fine but not particularly memorable. Voice acting, particularly from Lara, is great overall. Sadly however, most of the characters lack complexity and growth. The most memorable bits are Lara's voice, and the various areas and set-pieces throughout the game. The story itself is compelling enough, though it ends on a weird note that I'm unsure of whether or not it paid off.Going in, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. I don't think I liked it quite as much as Hitman and Sleeping Dogs, but its definitely up there in my AAA favorites of that year (2013). It's a very solid port and the shooting mechanics are quite satisfying, particularly the Bow, which was by far my most used weapon. The ""Tombs"" are few and far between, and are relatively basic/lackluster when you do find them, but as a shooter, it's still quite competent."

More like 'Horde Killer'! Most of the time  instead of looting tombs and exploring, you will be killing never ending waves of enemies, as one shoot-out scene is followed by another. And while the graphics are looking great, the shallow gameplay outweighs all the positive aspects of the game.Tomb Raider 2013 is a reboot of the franchise, taking you back to the very beginning, when Lara Croft wasn't the experienced adventurer we know since 1996.Following the shipwreck on a Japanese island Lara is fighting for survival, while going through a journey that changes her forever…At least that’s the concept on paper. But let’s see how it actually looked!When you first take control of Lara, the first thing you will notice, that how vulnerable you are, and you can’t help to feel empathy for her for being in this desperate struggle for survival. The game starts out great, as your main objective is to regroup with your friends while trying to survive against both nature and hostile survivors. During this section of the game Lara’s tools and weapons are very limited, but as the game progresses and your arsenal grows, the character development suddenly stops. After the infamous attempted rapé scene, where Lara first kills a human being, the game almost instantly turns into a brainless shoot-them-up. Up to that point you tried to sneak upon enemies or evade them, after this point you will be killing them in group of dozens.In order to progress you will be FORCED to kill everyone you see, else you will be swarmed. These „horde” sections happen very often and they get increasingly frustrating as the game progresses. By the end of the game Lara transforms from an unexperienced survivor into a battle-hardened killing machine. Seems like somewhere during the game development the Crystal Dynamics guys lost their focus...The swarm events paired with dumbed down puzzles deliver a very shallow gameplay. The platforming sections of the game are great, and very creative but sadly there are not too many of them, and they are simply not enough to compensate the mindless shoot-out sections.The graphics wise Tomb Raider is one of the best looking games on PC and it’s fairly well optimized: it provides you with stunning visuals if you have a good rig, but it runs on weaker hardwares too.Overall, Tomb Raider 2013 is a mediocre game at best, and I would only recommend it for fans of TPS action/shooting. If you are looking for good adventure game, then play the older Tomb Raider games and avoid this one as far as possible!  -Gorgeous graphics.-Environment and level designs are very well done.-Platforming sections are very creative and fun, but sadly they are overshadowed by the shootout sections which fill out the majority of the game.-Handholding gameplay: the „survival instinct” skill shows you everything, including waypoints, object you can interact with and even highlights the enemies for you-Puzzles are obnoxiously easy.-Barely any tombs to explore. There are around 10 of them in the game, some of them are even DLC content, but most importantly they only require about 5-10 minutes each to complete.-Repetitive and extremely frustrating gameplay. While the game starts out great, it soon turns into a mindless shoot-em-up as you will encounter hordes of enemies every 5-10 minutes."

This one I started and played it through with a lot of passion in about 37 hours of time, to make sure to get some achievements.Based on this experience I can say that this game deserves to be played. The game offers a great athmosphere, stunning graphics (played maxed out on a 670 GTX), great audio / music and while you play it, most of the time you feel like you are hired as an actor to play the first role in an action movie.The whole story in this game is consistent and of epic scale. I really loved to see what's comming next.Well but there are some drawbacks I do not want to hide either in this review:- the events are triggered which becomes really annoying- the AI is quite good but often enough you find some ways to exploit- fights against bosses are annoying because most of the times there are cinematics or scenes prior the fight that you cannot skip so in case you are dying you have to view these again and again and again... and again.- the puzzles are easy most of all times- a few fights are really challenging e.g. those with the bosses or hordes of enemies that try to kill you- the levels are linear and quite ""tubes"", I prefer open world games to be honest- Lara is quite indestructible and invulnerable.- It would be cool if the dirt / crud on her skin would be more dynamically, e.g. would clean up if  he is running through rain or water.Despite the drawbacks I found, I still I think that this game deserves a fair score and I consider it to be the funniest and most enjoyable first person ""adventure""  I've ever played. Thus I rate Tomb Raider with a 8 / 10 score and can highly recommend it, especially to those that might enjoy the good story placed well in an asian scenario.If you are interested into it I have collected and posted my impressions of the game in a ""Tomb Raider Photobook"" on :"

Big open maps, designed with exploration in mind, cleverly broken into several parts that you uncover as you go, with the help of new tools you find along the way. Each map promotes exloration by having several secret areas with short puzzles in them. I'd spend hours making sure I got to every corner of each map. 2. Enemy AI. Human enemies use cover, flanking maneuvers, suppression fire, pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails to force the player to move and think on his feet. 3. Most platforming sections are really fun, with short in-engine cut scenes from time to time to make traversing maps a bit more interesting.There are two things I didn't like.1. QTEs (Quick Time Events) - these should've never been included. I have a feeling it was implemented under pressure to make the make more ""cinematic"". Which only manages to make TR look like an Uncharted knock-off. What's more, some QTEs are scripted so badly that a quick load would go straight into the QTE I just failed without giving me any time to gather myself. QTEs were by far the biggest source of frustration for me while playing TR.2. Gunplay. For some reason shooting in this game feels weird (probably because of the fact that the game's controls also support gamepads and their sensitivity is tweaked with them in mind), it never felt saisfying to shoot any of my guns (shotguns have terrible range, rifles have terrible recoil, and pistols are generally useless when facing groups of enemies, without the extended magazine and increased damage). Fortunately, most locations allow a stealth approach.Overall I loved the game. It could've been better, but I think it's a worthy addition to one of the most popular game franchises."

I knew of this game, but never really seemed intrest in Tomb Raider. Then I played it, and oh my word, I do not regret a single cent spent on this game.Its amazing, beautiful, cool, sweet. Buy it :)"

I play games to feel like I'm doing something cool, I don't play them to watch a cutscene or pretend pressing forward for 20 seconds and occasionally moving to the side is compelling or engaging gameplay. Graphics are nice for a 2013 game, and it runs at 120+ on my 1080 at Ultra/Ultimate."

Amazing! The island is huge and we have a lot to explore. The story's very well written and it will keep us playing non-stop. The single player is definately the best part of the game but if you wanna have some fun with friends the multiplayer is good for that. This is definately the reboot that the tomb raider series needed. It's one of the best action/adventure games I've ever played and I'll dare to say that this will be one of the best games of 2013!

It's not often I will write a review and not finish the game (still playing and will finish it) but it's so bad ass, it really is pretty good for the apparent reboot. The graphics are amazing and the story line is good. It's not a total open world but you can wander about the areas to collect loot and stuff and find hidden things. But eventually you have to move forward for the story to move forward. And you do have the means of back travelling should you have missed items before. Some items you can only get later in the game, so you have to go back anyways.I have never played any Tomb Raider games before. This is my first Tomb Raider game, and I am very impressed, very pleased with the game play. It's very addictive to me to play. I am almost done and I have been playing for about 2-3 days. It's a lot of fun to play.As usual, I bought it on a very good discounted sale.Enjoy"

You're no longer playing as Lara Croft, archeologist & gymnast, you're now playing as Lara Croft, professional killer(with over 100+ confirmed kills easy, greater than the # of tombs she's raided/archeological digs found), explosion magnet, and relic destroyer. Are we sure this is Tomb Raider or are we playing Uncharted? But hey, it's a game, it runs well, there's pretty graphics, and you shoot bang using generic 3rd person shooter controls. Only got to playing it now because it was offered free on Steam, otherwise I'd still recommend the Tomb Raider Anniversary if you want to know what a remastered Tomb Raider should be."

The gameplay is entertaining enough, although it is ridden with the Quick Time Event cancer which takes away a lot of fun. Nonetheless if you stomach these QTE then the rest of the gameplay is fine. The unfortunately linear game is somewhat saved by decent main character and storytelling. Audiovisuals are also gratifying. Overall, TR is a good game to get on a sale."
