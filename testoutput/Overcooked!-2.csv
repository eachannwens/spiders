You play as one of the many available chefs and it is your job to feed the Unbread to save the world. The story plays out trough some dialogue from the king after certain stages, The story is nothing special, but it is a funny universe and it should give you a laugh or 2.The Onion king his dog and all playable characters are extremely likable, They don't say much but they all look very funny, If you are a shark a mouse or something way crazier, It will have a friendly face. The enemies are a little disturbing but also quite funny, Undead loafs of Bread, It probably won't give you or your children nightmares.The game is mostly focused on multiplayer, Every single gamemode can be played with up to 4 players, Online, Local but also a mix of the 2. You also can play it solo, But you will control 2 chefs and have to switch between them to manage the kitchen. it is still the same game, A very chaotic experience, Coordinating with yourself is harder than it sounds.There is the Story mode, which brings you to an overworld where you can launch levels, You start in 1-1 and before you can start 2-1 you have to visit the castle and talk to the Onion King. There are 6 worlds in the main campaign, and every world has 6 levels. There is a ton of DLC, some free and some paid which bring a bunch of new worlds, levels, chefs and recipes to the table. Only the host needs the DLCs, You can play along if you just own the game and are in a multiplayer game.In the main Story you can also switch gamemodes, From Story which is the default, Practice which disables timers and Survival in which served meals add time to the timer. Next to the main Story mode there is Arcade mode, Which is just a random level from the main Story or one of the DLCs, It is a nice thing if you completed every single level with 4 stars. Then there is a Versus mode, In which 2 kitchens have to fight it out, It is always 2 versus 2, But you can play 1 vs 1 too by controlling 2 chefs.The gameplay is extremely hectic, Raw ingredients need to be chopped, Cooked, Baked, Blended, Steamed. Grilled, and mostly they need multiple steps to prepare, Then you need to combine all the prepared ingredients on a plate and deliver it as fast as possible. There are more recipes than I can count, It starts easy, But things get complex pretty fast. Good teamwork is essential for getting all the stars.Next to the obvious cooking you also have to wash the plates, make sure nothing burns, deliver the orders on time and make sure you don't mess up the ingredients. If you mess up a recipe you can throw it away, If it burns you have to grab the fire extinguisher and put out the fire before it spreads.The levels are even crazier, There are kitchens with a road running trough it, People dancing in a Conga line, trough it, or even kitchens on a few floating rafts in the middle of a river. There are kitchens which have moving parts, switch positions, have portals, buttons and even cannons to reach out of reach platforms.The graphics are adorable, It is simple but charming, Things you can interact will stay the same and are marked clearly. The decor is ever changing, You go to all kinds of restaurants, Indoor, Outdoor, On a river or high in the sky. The Soundtrack is very cosy and uplifting, But it gets tenser inside the levels as they progress, especially the last 30 seconds. It is a very nice fit, and each theme has its own soundtrack. Together it creates a very nice atmosphere that is fun and suitable for all ages.The game runs fine, There are just 2 things that bother me, First the game Crashes on controller connect, Which is especially awful for a multiplayer game. And secondly the Steam Cloud save is not working. Other than that the game runs very well I get a very nice 200-300 fps. Not a single problem next to the 2 forementioned things. The worst thing is that these are a long standing problems. And there doesn't seem to be any interest in actually fixing it.After you complete the story and all the DLC with 3 stars you can fight it out in Versus mode where you have to compete together with someone or solo against another kitchen. There is also Arcade mode, This will just pick a random level from the Story and DLC. There is no random generation, A lot of DLC, but even after completing everything the game remains a lot of fun, The human factor is just so unpredictable and it causes some very chaotic and funny situations.The game is fun but frustrating, Crazy and Chaotic. Blame your friends for burning the burgers, not preparing the mushrooms and throwing sushi on the road. It is a great game and certainly worth your money, Just be sure to backup your save files."

We simply connected a couple of old wired Xbox 360 controllers to my PC to play this game together in our house and it was a blast! It will test the strength of your relationships, haha.But why can't I recommend this any more? The developers released a compilation version of this game called All You Can eat which was Overcooked 1 and 2 in one bundle plus some extra features. Trouble is, they are continuing to release free content updates for that version of the game but aren't adding those updates to the base Overcooked 2 game!! So anyone who already owns 1 and 2 separately has to pay all over again for All You Can Eat if they want to receive further content updates.This is a despicable business tactic and shows real contempt for long time supporters and fans of this otherwise excellent franchise."

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Just like the original, 2 is a chaotic party game where you and up to 3 friends work together to serve top-of-the-line dishes while coping with and overcoming terrible kitchen designs, bizarre situations and natural disasters. In sum, frantically fun.  Both Overcooked! games are great but I recall enjoying the first game more. The new features introduced in 2 were welcome but sometimes flawed and unnecessary. Somehow the fewer gimmicks and simpler levels (for the most part) in 1 made for a more fun experience. Regardless, I enjoyed Overcooked! 2 as a whole; it is still the chaotically fun co-op experience that I’ve come to expect and love from the Overcooked! Series. Looking forward to 3!"

Review will be from the first perspective.Being quite familiar with the first game, my partner and I were super excited for more cooking chaos but ultimately we didn't feel the game is worth the money. The first three/four worlds we 3-starred everything on our first try just from familiarity with the game, the throwing mechanic has a lot of potential and the Kevin levels were a lot of fun but in the end it feels like we only got about 12 levels of actual difficulty.Overcooked 2 was the time to add in a level editor, not switches on the world map (what are those even for, anyway?). Make the game replayable, maybe a new game+ that you can select at the start if you're familiar with OC already/unlocked at the end of story that changes up the base game. OC2 isn't a sequel, it's just the definitive version of OC1."

Overcooked returned with many new features and the most highlighted one is online multiplayer! Yes, you can play now with your online friends, unlike the first game which only supports local co-op/PVP. We are back to Onion Kingdom and must help to defend it from the hoards of The Unbread. (undead) The story is fun and cute, and the stages are more challenging than before, you also keep unlocking new recipes that require you and your friends to team up or yell and shout during the whole stage. I had so much fun playing it with my friend and sister.The artwork is fun, you'll have so many chefs to choose from and unlock the more you advance into the game. The map is huge, each chapter has multiple stages and each stage has a unique challenge, besides the DLC's which adds even more contents. There are also Kevin's the dog, stages where you have to cook and serve dog food! those are really hard to make!The soundtracks are nice, fitting the gameplay, nothing too loud. I played this game using a controller, not sure if it can work as smoothly with a keyboard. The trophies are a bit challenging and need some grinding, but what makes this fun is when you play it with your friends, you wouldn't feel that you are grinding for anything.  You can team up with total of four players together.Pros:+Beautiful visuals and locations design.+Fun Soundtracks.+Unique gameplay+Multiple Chefs.+Bonus stages.+Huge map and many stages to play.+New Game+ unlocks an additional star to earn and difficulty. +Seasonal free content + paid DLCs.+Local and online multiplayer.+Many recipes (You unlock more as you advance into the game).+Steam achievements.Cons:-When you fall down into the sea, the game freezes for everyone for a couple of seconds until the player respawn. After finishing the main game, you'll unlock a new challenge and that will require you to get a fourth star in each stage! The developers still bringing new content and adding more recipes. With the new Holiday free update, you get to feed angry hoards and defend your kitchen at the same time!  I highly recommend it for people who enjoys multiplayer challenging games."

However as a big fan of the first one I can't help but point out some huge problems with the second one that have kept me from enjoying it.Overcooked is at its best when you are figuring out how to solve the level efficiently given the layout of the level in front of you. You make a plan, divide tasks, and refine your execution until your team is a well oiled machine. Then you move on to the next level and do it again.It's at its worst when the levels are built to slow you down or irritate you. Not particularly challenging, just clunky. You end up standing around a lot. You often have to wait for platforms to reappear or to get to you. There's nothing you can do to speed it up. I'm cool with dynamic levels that force you to adapt, but not when you end up just standing around waiting for the level shifts to occur. The first game's levels felt like they were asking the question ""can you find an efficient way to get things done here?"" This time around the levels are asking ""can you find a way to get anything done here at all?"" I think they knew the levels were clunky and made the scoring system very forgiving to compensate, because we got 3 stars on almost every level the first time through. I know they're releasing a NG+ so maybe the difficulty will change, but going back and replaying levels is not that appealing of a proposition due to the level design I described above. I am hoping future patches fix this game. The foundation is solid, some new levels and appropriate difficulty would solve everything.If you are considering this game and haven't played the first one, I suggest buying that one instead. It is far less polished, but the design is on point."

Many achievements are a bit grindy, and require doing 100-500 of something, which by the way many people have counted including myself to require much much more than the actual amount it says it requires.  Most of the grindy achievements have to be done afterwards since there isn't enough levels to get them on normal playthroughs, unless you replay the levels a lot."

Also, the last mission of the game was pretty lackluster and probably one of the easiest missions in the game to 3 star. I did most of the game, earning a score on most missions of approximately 2x the required amount for 3 stars and only a few missions required a 2nd try to get full star rating. When playing multiplayer, there were several lag spikes, to the point my friends froze in place for about 30 seconds, multiple times. On the note of multiplayer, only the host earns achievements, chefs, and any sort of progress. I wish the unbread made more of an appearance rather than the odd points on the world map and the beginning cutscene. It is a good, fun game, but not worth the full asking price. Quite disappointing especially coming from the first game expecting it to be better, like a sequel should be."

(ovc 2 in short) is developed by Ghost Town Games Ltd. and Team17 Digital Ltd. It is published by Team17 Digital Ltd. The PC version was released on Aug 8, 2018 and it is also available on PlayStation 4, Switch & Xbox One. As of this writing, Metacritic  shows:I am not going to address the obvious question: Does the sequel of the beloved 2016's overcooked live up to the expectation? Instead, i'll be asking you: Are you  of those people who is  by all the comments you read on reddit/metacritic/steam reviews/forums/etc and is on the fence whether to purchase overcooked 1 or 2 because of all the  feedbacks? I totally understand what you are going through and I can only say, it's not the product's fault. its the people. They are causing all this  over one of the  couch co-op/co-op product in the history of gaming/current market (Well, at least as of this writing in the year 2020).Once again, the onion kingdom needs saving. This time around, onion king accidently summons a horde of unbread. *gasp* So thats where players come in. The objective is to serve the food while overcoming different challenges/obstacles presented in each level. That's easier said than done.Play up to 4 players via local or internet multiplayer. The campaign offer players 6 worlds@regions to explore with a total of 36 levels and 8 Kevin levels that needs to be unlocked. Aside from the campaign mode, Versus mode is still available and there's an Arcade mode now. Once you complete the entire campaign, you will unlocked 4 star mode. Play with your food chefs!If that's not enough to satisfy your culinary experience, there are currently 5 DLC's available for purchase and a new free DLC coming up in July 2020. Controls: WASD keyboard and controller. Keyboard key binding is not available.Audio: The background music sets the mood and tempo for the game. Different background music will be played in different world/region (similar like ovc 1) Every player action has feedback sound; dash, chop, throw ingredients, fire, falls, etc. everything. +1 to the teamVisuals: The overall concept is still similar with ovc 1: simple, colorful, clean and plain looking (does not have details in the costume/looks) however I find that ovc 2's color to be more . Aside from that, we have a lot more new cooks to pick from; eagle, mouse, octopus, beaver and etc. +1 to the teamThis is a major section to cover. The dev's expanded on the existing mechanics & level design of ovc 1. They really up their game with some of these changes. The notable ones:These are just from the base game. If you own the DLC's theres even more creative/weird stuffs; moving around the kitchen via cannons, water squirt guns to wash dishes, backpacks to pick ingredients from, Marshmallows, hot dogs, drinks, milk shakes and more..Looking just at ovc 2, base product (excluding the dlc's) overall, it ""feels"" as if ovc 2 is more polished than ovc 1. The level design is more creative - where it forces players to do more/interact/react more as compared to ovc 1 which makes the game feel more intense. Does that mean it's more difficult? I am highlighting this because , overcooked games will always be coach co-op/co-op centric product that tries to make you have fun with friends/people. It is  dark souls. The fact that the devs made ovc 2 to allow players to make some mistakes/blunders and still manage to obtain 3 stars is to cater for the general audience. From young kids to adults, from casuals to hardcores. Each one of us have different preferences. I dont want to play with 4 perfectionist players. It's stressful. I also dont want to play with 4 jokers. it's crap. ovc 2 offers that balance. Those jokers will never be able to obtain 3 stars - or what if they do? or what if some of us can play or cannot play as good as  but still be able to obtain 3 stars. Whats so damaging? Is there any harm to lower the skill ceiling? to the community? to the mass market? or it's just your pride and ego? or your butt?So, coming back to ovc 2, i expected the devs to build on ovc 1 mechanics  what i did not expect is to this degree of change. It is a massive amount of effort and one that i have to applaud to all the teams involved in the production of ovc 2. The DLC's are great addition but also very challenging/brutal experience. If there's any negative point(s), i am slightly disappointed that they took out the rats and blackout levels from ovc 1. Yes, those were really annoying levels but I have some fond memories from there. I was also really hoping for a final boss, but what i got was a defense game mode. But as a whole, the product offers more positives than cons. So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for overcooked 2 is a  Crispy Golden Taco worth 9/10. *Eats the crispy golden taco in the cannon while the entire kitchen is on fire*"

I will do my best and shed you the truth about this game and my experience playing through it... (WARNING It's a long read. TLDR at the buttom.) Overcooked 2 is one of the few games that support both local and multiplayer.  A good feature on paper, but I've seen enough games struggling with the input and lags. Overcooked does not do this. They were able to execute the host system flawlessly and it feels great to move around.Like the host system, the gameplay feels polished. The mechanics are simple. Collect, Cut, Cook and repeat. The first maps are set up to be easy, to make you feel accomplished, confident for the next challenge.Suddenly, it all stops. You are surprised at not getting the three-stars in the first attempt. You frown, but laugh it off. The next map is unlocked. But you are not going anywhere until you get that full star.700 Score for three stars? That's easy, you just got 650 and you barely tried. And so you Collect, Cut and Cook. You get past 700 scores, but you keep going. This map had tarnished your hot streak. 800, 900. A thousand... You showed that level designer. No longer would they underestimate your skills.The adrenaline fades but does not completely vanish. It lingers in the background, ready to answer your beckoning call. A small smile form on your lips. And you are pumped for more.As you progress through the maps. New challenges appear and you are forced to be more creative. You are stuck again. 1500 Scores for the three star.You use more time studying, watching. Then you see it. It was so obvious... The answer radiates like a second sun, and the route is set.As ingredients are flying through the air. You start understanding its more behind the gameplay. No longer is it a cooking simulator. But an acrobatic dance. Suddenly, the ingredients collide and fall either off the map or in the worst case; Staring back at you from an unreachable spot. Your brilliant flawless cooked steak is chilling in the cold wind. The time is moving, you grit your teeth and collect, cut and cook another. You barely make it, and a heavy breath escapes your lip. Just to realize you have been holding your breath all this time. Sh*t... The game is really pushing you now.Buttons are pressed, fires are spewing, tables are rotating, people are blocking...What the hell is going on?The level designer you showed earlier has stepped up his game. The previous strategies become useless. The randomly generated actions take you off guard, and you are surrounded by fire. Unable to move, unable to reach the fire extinguisher. ""Bull Sh*t"" You press restart.Again, this time. Your finger slip and you throw your dish into the trash instead for adding an ingredient. Your eyes dart to the time, then to the score, and back to the timer. You realize you won't make it. You press restart. Ingredients are collect, cut and cooked. The time is ticking, you realize this is it... The tip is at x8 and this chocolate cake would get you enough score for the three stars. You pick up the plate, run over to the oven. The beautiful majestic cake sits on the plate perfectly. You nod to yourself inside, the art team have done a fantastic job. Who in their right mind would not take a piece of this cake? After all, it was filled with the best ingredients in this world, and better. It was fueled by your hard and passionate work. Shaking yourself from the thought, your eyes dart back to the timer. It's blinking. In a panic, you move past the spewing fire, and charge the rolling belt head-on. Your eyes widen. In the brink of panic, you forgot it was rolling the opposite direction. Gritting your teeth. You press the dazing button, and it works. You are moving forward!Another button press. Your one step closer to serving your masterpiece.Another, it's so close right now. You could smell the three stars now.Your hands drenched in sweat, you go for one last push.And your thump slip, the character is slightly tilted in another direction. A sudden gasp is audible all around you. And a horrifying scream fills the room. Little-Jimmy in the corner is crying, your best-friend Bob is furiously cursing in the living room. Your girlfriend is looking at you with one of those familiar looks... But unlike the previous time, her disappointing look felt more disturbing, perhaps it was the clothing. Disgusted, defeated, ashamed, you rise up from the couch and turn around to look at all the familiar faces, and freezes. Grandma Maria is holding your gaze. You hear her mutter to herself ""The cake is a lie.""TLDR: The game is one of my favorite games in 2018. Do not let the family-friendly art deceive you. This game is brutal, it's been a while since I laughed out loud playing a game, especially for my own stupidity. This made me realize again how fun games could be. I would recommend playing this game together. But if you like to be challenged further. Playing alone would take some serious effort."

My wife and I were really excited about this game having played through the first one many times over. We will keep playing in case we're just judging this too soon, but so far this is a disappointment compared to the first one. My wife is a professional game designer, and we spent a lot of time just picking apart details and poor executions, which was kind of sad :( the story mode map was just made unnecessarily more complicated and brings nothing extra to the game. In fact it's annoying. We were excited to finish and switch to arcade mode so we didn't have to mess with the map, but arcade mode didn't appear to display our previous scores, so we didn't know what to beat. The levels are either poorly balanced, or we just haven't figured out a good strategy for each yet. The levels have so many little things that get in your way, though, that we often didn't want to replay a level to perfect it. They just were not that fun. In the first game, we would finish a level and be like ""awesome! We can do better! Let's try that again!"" That sadly just didn't happen in OC2. Some levels change 2 or 3 times throughout--the first game did this, but in that one the dynamic levels never seemed out of place like they do in OC2. We would have happily paid for more content in the first game with similar philosophies in level design.To be honest we're not that surprised. So many good games make you think, ""wow this is great, I hope when they make the next one they understand what makes this one so good and don't mess it up.""My advice: If you are looking at this game for the first time, just go get the first one instead."

We completed the last mission, supposedly a bossfight, with 3 stars on first try with no effort. Then the game made us watch credits which i couldn't skip so i quit the game and my progress didn't save. The game is lacking any novelty, apart from several new recipes, dashing and throwing it's all the same, but easier. Almost no UI improvements were done, there's no quick way to restart levels, you have to come back to the centre of the map after each area to hear another boring part of the story. Don't get me wrong, the mechanics are still very fine, the core of the game is really fun, we enjoyed our playtrough, but we feel a lot of disappointment as well. In my opinion the game is not worth its price at the current level. I expected more from a sequel.Disclaimer: We  didn't play any online features of the game, just the main story."

You'll have to cooperate with your teammates to fill orders in time and collect enough points to pass through the levels. It's very similar to the first game, but there are a number of improvements to it, including online co-op and some small improvements in the controls.This game can be played with up to four players. I think you can play alone, but I can't imagine it being all that enjoyable. The fun really comes from playing the levels with your friends and figuring out the best way to run your kitchen efficiently. I've played the game with 2, 3, and 4 players before, and while some of the levels are best suited to one particular number of players, I think all of the levels are playable even with just two players.Story mode has a variety of levels to play through, although it really isn't very long. However, there are a variety of other goals to complete as well. There are 4 stars to collect on each level, there are a few other game modes to try, and there are a number of bonus levels as well which are still being added to. I also think the levels are incredibly fun to replay even without much new content.I love the art style and the music. It's all very cute and rounded. The chefs you can unlock are all very cute, with a variety of different people, animals, and other creatures to choose from. The background music is nice to listen to and well-suited to the game. The story in story mode is pretty bare bones, but it's fine, a game like this doesn't really need an amazing story.The DLC in the game is worth buying, but not necessary. There is a ton of content and replay value to the base game, especially with the occasional free updates, and the DLC is all self-contained. However, each DLC adds new recipes and level mechanics, and the DLC levels all have replay value of their own.Overall, Overcooked 2 is a great game to play with your friends. I've had a lot of fun playing the game with various friends and will probably continue to come back to the game over time. If you don't have people to play with (in-person or online with voice chat), you can probably skip it, but otherwise I'd highly recommend it. 10/10"

Bringing Online Play to the table, Overcooked 2 already is an immense improvement from Overcooked. The level designs are creative, diverse, challenging and great fun. The level requirements themselves or time constraints can be difficult at times, but overall a great experience, and I deeply enjoyed 100%ing this one with my friend. Didn't cause any rage or arguments or even general burnout for us, but I think that's largely because it's overexaggerated for comedy how difficult the game is. Mostly you'll be laughing or too focused on your tasks at hand to think of anything toxic. Tons of character options, tons of themes/levels/foods, and tons of DLC that only enhance the experience and are also very worthwhile to purchase. Additions to the game only need to be purchased by one person for the whole party to experience them as well. Along with the expected levels, the game also features tower-defense that breaks up the flow in a much needed way.I can see myself playing this game for dozens of more hours, and my only qualm is that I wish the online matchmaking was more active. However, if you're already have someone in mind, you've nothing to lose.:) I strongly recommend this one, full price or not."

In a way that's no problem, we loved the 1st one (yeah, I am another one of those that did play it with his girlfriend) and we couldn't way to play more of it, even if it didn't add much stuff.What falls short compared to the 1st one is level design and balancing. The 1st one was a gem in that sense, with each level absolutely well tuned and requiring to be played multiple failing times until -bam!- you could get 3 stars.Overcooked 2 levels tend to be far too easy in general (the surf'n'turf DLC is far better balanced), using map dangers more as an obstacle than as part of the complexity (e.g. the leves where you can fall).Then comes the 4th star, and it's close to unachievable in terms of difficulty.One really bad side of the new visuals, if you have multiple food items on a surface perpendicular to the screen surface (""vertical""), it's impossible to understand what's where and what spaces are free.All in all a pleasant game to play, but could have probably evolved much better than how it did. Still got a 75/100 in my books, and I do recommend playing the Surf'n'turf DLC."

The game has a unique way of uniting players together as one, which is a key facet of the games immense success and I thank the developers sincerely for providing the community with a game that has so much potential in such a seemingly endless journey of benevolence and comradery. As a result of this, I have awarded Overcooked! 2 a 6.9 out of 7 raw tomatoes. I thank you for your time."

Im not the best in general with games that require a lot of effort and complicated mechanics. Im one of those gals that prefers those cute, straight forward games that are simple and fun. This game might look overwhelming but is actually fun. The game is chaotic in a group setting but if you want to actually know whats going on trying it solo a few times after playing with some friends and building up some confidence. I really enjoyed it and after exploring for a few hrs have come to really enjoy and appreciate this game. I do believe to really take the experience to a new level you need a group of people who you enjoy gaming with or a buddy who can be as invested. A fun co-op that is straight forward enough to get through it without breaking friendships (at least not yet) XD In the end if you are looking for a cute fun game to casually play this is a good start especially if you got friends to share the experience with."

If you play with family members or friends, I hope that your relationships will survive this game, as it will strain those relationships to the max.In this game, you must prepare food of different kinds for your customers.  You must grab ingredients, chop, cook, bake, steam, and plate them and deliver them timely in order to reach a certain amount of points.  Three stars is what you're aiming for, and while it may be easy on the early levels, it becomes vastly more difficult at the later levels and in the DLC add ons.You will prepare pies, pancakes, salads, hamburgers, hot dogs, smores, kabobs, pizza, and so much more.  For some you will use a BBQ or a firepit which requires you to use blowers to intensify the heat or add chopped wood in order to cook faster.  The worst part, and this is horrible, you also have to do dishes.  The amount of work required to get three stars in the amount of time given is not easy.  The more players you have the more points is expected that you will get.The storyline is forgettable, King Onion, or something like that, and his sidekick dog Kevin need you to save their butts of their kingdom, and cooking wonderful meals delivers the saving grace they need.  Ridiculous, but ultimately funny and forgettable.  In the main game, there are several worlds, I think 5 or 6 with 4 levels each typically.  Each world provides a different atmosphere or different scenery to move around in.  The DLCs offers three worlds each with 4 levels a piece.  Overall there is more than enough levels to keep you busy for a long time.I will admit, I've never played this single player other my experience of doing a two player versus.  You must click a button to switch between your two chefs making the need to get things done quickly rather more difficult.  Did I mention you can burn down your kitchen if you overcook something?  You can fry mixers or burn things, as a red exclamation with a loud alarm starts to sound to alert you that you need to hurry and save it before it's too late.  This adds to the stress of everything else that you are doing.  This will get you screaming, yelling, complaining, blaming, and shouting at your partners, and hopefully it's all for the good laughs of what this game does.  It is the most stressful multiplayer atmosphere ever and I loved it.There are many achievements, none too impossible to obtain, I have a few left, but I think I'll be able to unlock them all before I'm done with this game.  The game can be played 4 player couch co-op, versus (2 on 2) or can be played online as well.  I only played with controllers and the controls are great, nothing sloppy, but I'm not sure how this would play only using the keyboard.If you're looking for a laugh out loud exciting multiplayer game, this is definitely one of the best I've played.  This is originally a time management game, but they've never made them like this before.  They took these a to a whole new level, and it's very fun.  Pick this up if you haven't already."

Throwing stuff around is the best part.The only real issue is it gets slight desync issues when it's 4 players.As a little criticism for the gameplay:This game makes use of movement impairments quite too many times.Moving platforms, wind blowing you away, moving bands etc.It becomes struggling and waiting for the level to line itself up so you can bring the 4th ingredient into the weird fish mash thingy you are mixing in a blender, then you wait some more for it to get mixed then it's another struggle until you arrive at the cooking station.I would rather like if they had more ""optimization"" levels, where you had to find the fastest route, the best way to keep the food going. More like a real restaurant where you have to sort out the dishes, figure out if you need the pan or the fryer. Organizing rooms and ingredients.But it's not like a huge issue."

You can 3 star campaign levels solo pretty easily, but you'll need a decently skilled friend to get you to 4 star those levels, if that matters to you. Best feature of the game imo are the versus levels (couch doesn't have any issues, but online is stupidly buggy, esp cross-platform). There are only 6 versus levels that come with the base game, but the Surf n Turf DLC adds two of the best levels, and is well worth it for the price. My boyfriend and I have spent a good number of my hours on this game exclusively playing couch pvp and yelling at each other. Fun time, 10/10 would recommend."

But it definitely felt more fun than the first and for sure less stressful (at least the main campaign). But that doesn't mean it's totally easy. In reality, the difficulty seemed all over the place when you get stuck on some random level but the final one you can 3-star in two tries. So keep playing, it's possible to 3-star most of them with a bit of practice. Worth mentioning is the new game+ mode that unlocks after you get all stars. In this mode you need to be even faster and get 4-star ratings, effectively giving you and endgame goal after you would normally be done. This sequel looks just as good, maybe even better, than the previous game. Smoother UI means it is easier to see what is going on and what you are taking/placing. And overall they worked to improve the aesthetics & level design but kept the art-style. A nice addition are hidden (Kevin) levels although I would prefer if the requirements were visible somewhere outside of Steam guides. Included is the FREE Seasonal Updates DLCs which, as of time of writing, consists of 27 levels (5 + 5 - Winter Wonderland; 7 + 5 - Spring Festival; 5 - Suns Out, Buns Out!; 5 - Moon Harvest Festival). It's a mix of all previous DLCs (recipes, mechanics, tools) plus a couple of new ones, all coated with their unique art styles. This is dispersed between six areas accessible from a central hub. No story with the Onion King (and Kevin) this time. The difficulty is often higher, especially for two or three levels in Winter Wonderland. These levels might challenge you A LOT and are no joke even compared to some of the DLC campaigns. Overall 70+ levels to try out (including the free DLCs) in one of the best co-op games currently available. Playing solo isn't great but if you have someone to play with this game is a blast!------------------------------------------------------------------"

Lots of extra modes and additional chefs for cute cosmetics.Nothing beats pounding out the sashimi to a killer jam while playing as a raccoon in a wheelchair, ha ha!The nice thing about Overcooked 2 as opposed to the first one is if you're playing 2+ player they've added this handy 'throw' feature; where you can THROW each other ingredients which makes some stages hilariously work out. Hard to imagine playing without that button...work the extra few dollars on sale or off IMO.Thanks!"

The core gameplay is fine but there are a handful of quality of life changes that need to be made.1) Allow players to change chefs prior to starting the level, not at the main screen.2) Also, I have had the game lock to 'keyboard' when you have a gamepad and had to restart; I think the solution is just to avoid pressing keys prior to the main menu.3) Players that try to spam A to skip the opening screens are thrust into the level select screen and then have to back out back to the main menu; a minor issue that can be fixed by forcing the players to press START rather than A to open the main menu once the opening credits are finished.4) Game will occassionally freeze at the loading screen for levels.5) Netcode is inconsistent and desyncs are not uncommon.6) Difficulty for 2 and 3 players (I haven't played with 4 players total) is generally too easy, but also inconsistent: with the exception of 1 level, I was able to get 3 stars by an extra 50% or more. In particular, level 5-3 is very challenging, but 5-4 is at a difficulty that I would expect for the first world. In general, the numbers for the stars need to be tweaked. Overcooked 1 was challenging, perhaps a bit too difficult (I had to solo a few maps to get 3 stars, or 'cheese' them by playing with 2 players rather than e.g. 4), but this is too far in the other direction imo.7) The ending is incomplete. The final level hardly has any build-up and is very straightforward (also it seems a bit cramped), especially compared to the final boss of the first game. The end scene is a few lines of dialogue; I was expecting quite a bit more for the ending, even if it is just a short cinematic in the style of the opening scenes for the game.8) Throwing is inconsistent. It would be nice to see a highlight on the map of where your object will land once you throw it.In general, the levels seem to have fewer good gimmicks and are less inspired than in Overcooked 1. Even though the first game had some misses (e.g. the ice and lava levels), there was a lot of variety and I was willing to overlook a few bad levels. Overcooked 2 doesn't have many terrible levels (except maybe 5-3 or 6-2), but is definitely lacking in overall variety, particularly with the recipes. I'm surprised things such as the flame thrower from the holiday DLC didn't make it back to this game.All in all, the core game is still solid, but there are a number of QoL and polish issues that make this game closer to an 7/10 rather than the 9/10 I'd give the first. Fix the bugs and improve the netcode and I'd say the game is a 8.5/10. Not quite as good as the first but still worth a purchase."

This is a classic 'spinning plates' type of play that's scales up and up and up.My only gripe with it is that some of the levels stop the 'flow' of the game, by putting obstacles in your way that prevent you from moving or performing an activity - I sort of think that at all points in time during a level, I should have to do 'something' even if its not the thing I wanted to do exactly - some levels miss this mark and you end up literally watching the clock tick away while you wait for a platform to appear. The best levels are the ones where its simple - nothing is moving around or floating - and its just you and your mates cooking against the clock, and the only reason why you fail is because your best simply isn't good enough, rather than you were blocked by a level script for 60 seconds."

Perfectly content with the first Overcooked after three-starring every level, the announcement for Overcooked 2 that came in June was welcome and exciting news. Knowing that a sequel for a much-loved game is in the works does conjure up some concerns about whether what made the original so successful would be built upon or pivoted to a worrying direction, but Team17 and Ghost Town Games knew exactly what made Overcooked click and brought more of that in the return to the Onion King’s domain.Bringing new recipes to the kitchen while old favorites return, Overcooked 2 presents players with more challenges than the first to diversify the food prep mayhem. From the new sushi dish to everything else players will encounter, the recipes are broken down at each initial encounter to keep new and old players on as level a playing field as possible. While you’re presented with different recipes at the start and throughout the rest of the game, you’ll find that the core mechanics and co-op antics that made the first so successful thankfully still permeate the game.Having played through the entire first Overcooked game while repeating levels to obtain better scores, it does seem that this one holds players’ hands less than the series’ debut. The difficulty quickly ramps up quickly, not to an unmanageable level, but certainly to one that seems to be at a steeper angle than Overcooked. It’s clear that the game expects players to be familiar with the first, and though it’s hard to speak from a new player’s perspective having experience the first, co-op gameplay with an Overcooked newbie suggested that the difficulty incline wasn’t just anecdotal. After retrying the beginning levels a few times to get the hang of it, everyone was on the same page, a necessity that hopefully won’t deter new players from enjoying Overcooked 2 without prior experience.The sequel has challenges in store for new players as well though with more dynamic levels that do their best to get in your way. One of the biggest examples of the level improvements that you’ll see early on is a sequence that throws you from one setting into another mid-level. A hot air balloon ride seemed like it’d ended when the balloon and the kitchen basket came crashing down to make it seem like we’d done something wrong, but it was actually a dramatic transition to a new kitchen below. There are even portals in some levels that players can either walk through or fling ingredients into to make them pop out somewhere else. If you thought the first Overcooked’s levels were creative with players eventually cooking in space (expect more intergalactic challenges here), you’ll find that Overcooked 2 provides a fresh set of memorable levels ranging from swamps to mine shafts, all with fireballs, moving structures, and other obstacles looking to delay your progress.The throwing mechanic is one of Overcooked 2’s most notable changes, the other contender being the online play that now connects chefs across the world, and it’s far from a gimmick. It’s a helpful tool when every second counts, but it’s also not option. Players will find that many levels force them to throw items to one another, if not to obtain a higher score than simply to get a passing one. Overcooked isn’t a game where you’d do something and think “that was a great play!” but Overcooked 2 allows for that feeling of success by tossing and catching ingredients in time to complete an order.Co-op is still core in the new Overcooked game, and that’s something that both helps and hinders it. While games shouldn’t necessitate that you play with friends for them to be enjoyable, Overcooked 2 is simply more enjoyable when played with others. Going solo is still a viable option, but the premise of having at least two controllable chefs in the kitchen will always mean that having more than one player is the intended way to play. It’s simply not as much to play solo when you feel like you’re sharing a controller with yourself while still somehow operating on two different wavelengths, but the online multiplayer at least gives everyone with Internet access the chance to experience Overcooked 2 alongside someone else. There’s a new emote system in place to assist with this, and while it’s enjoyable enough to do some goofy gestures at one another or inform teammates of basic actions, it’s hardly a replacement for the teamwork, frustration, and excitement that comes with voice comms or couch co-op.Overcooked 2 will at times make returning players wish that it could’ve done just a bit more with the sequel, but playing it safer is perhaps the preferred option to avoid a disappointing sophomore release. Like the first, it’s better with friends, but that also means that it’s got exceptional replayability with the experience being different depending on who you play with. Overcooked 2 – and the first Overcooked, for that matter – is a game that belongs in every co-op campaigner’s collection, and if Team17 ever decides to make a third, I’ll happily return to the kitchen once again."

The game uses a gameplay full of different challenges, eye-catching and attractive environments, and of course, music that will satisfy every player. Made by Team17 studio, the game is not without flaws.

The game requires you to work with your friends to cook up a storm in a kitchen that's constantly changing and evolving. And let me tell you, it's a recipe for disaster - in the best possible way.I found myself frantically chopping vegetables, throwing ingredients at my fellow chefs, and trying not to set the kitchen on fire. It's like a cooking game on steroids, with insane challenges that had me laughing and screaming at the same time.But the real fun started when I played with my friends. Suddenly, we were all shouting at each other, trying to coordinate our movements and figure out who was responsible for what. It was chaos, but it was the most hilarious chaos I've ever experienced.And the best part? The game doesn't take itself too seriously. From the ridiculous character designs to the over-the-top kitchen settings, Overcooked! 2 is a game that's all about having fun.In conclusion, if you're looking for a game that will have you laughing until you cry, then Overcooked! 2 is the game for you. It's a cooking game that's equal parts fun and challenging, and it's guaranteed to bring out your inner chef (or your inner disaster chef, at least). So gather up your friends, grab some snacks, and get ready for the wildest cooking adventure of your life!"

(The whole idea of the rush and mayhem of making an order and serving it). So actually enjoying this game was a big unexpected surprise for me. Secondly, be prepared to play this either in real life together, or in a voice chat if it's online play. It's practically impossible to play otherwise, as communication is key. I initially fell in love with 'Overcooked 1!', however to be honest me and my friends probably got to level 10 and everything just went downhill. For such a fun game, each levels' difficulty is bazzaringly escalated like there is no tomorrow. One second your at level 1 playing the introduction, and the next you've lost your voice and your best friend. Unfortunately (or should I say fortunately) to say we never picked up from where we left off. This is where 'Overcooked 2!' comes into play.The progression in the difficulty of levels was just french kiss! The amount of times I have successfully pleaded for my friends to get this game should be a crime. Yet it did not fail to please anyone. So a happy crime :) The tutorial level is such an easy and great way to expose you of what is to be expected. It's so easy to learn and master the fundamentals of the game. All levels can be played repetitively without erasing previous data (duh), so engaging with this level for every newcomer is a positive must!!! Once you have mastered a great deal of levels and have progressed through a big chunk, I would recommend playing with 3-4 players. Not because it's impossible to pass the level, but rather because the maps do become fairly more spaced out, with different work stations a mile from the other. (of course not literally)In stating that, it's also great with playing with just an extra person or two, as the scores for the levels change and adapt accordingly. *If I can recall correctly*O Overall, don't let 'Overcooked 1!' fool you... just skip it and buy no.2! O Everyone could and should play this game! No matter how you would consider your level of gaming.O It really encourages you to learn how to communicate effectively and efficiently among your co-players.O Because who doesn't want to make a fake pizza, sushi, fish and chips, burger, dumplings, salad (questionable), etc. O Oh and you can throw food too. Ingenius. O Washing dishes? You got me in the first half not gonna lie. O Who let player 1 drive around on the map? O Lost my best friend to a shrimp and some rice.To find out more.... get the game :)*This is merely a review to show my passion and love for this game. I hope the message is conveyed half decently, and that this review sells the game to you!*"

A deceptively marketed, gimmicky, overly short step backwards. Stick to the original outside of a deep special. = Intro = A big fan of the original, the wife and I have dozens of hours into it. Was extremely excited for the second one to the extent that we preordered it.= Gameplay =Make sure you have a gamepad. This is *not* keyboard friendly.The core mechanics are the same as the original. Lots of new gimmicks in each level compensated by a very low 3 star score required. This results in a game that is both more irritating and less challenging. I remember some levels in the original that took me and the wife upwards of a dozen tries and we still had a blast. There were perhaps 3 levels that took us more than one or two tries, and we were glad to be done with them as these levels felt like we were working against each other. One in particular had a purple shimmering background that physically hurt my eyes. A wildly inconsistant difficultly level. The game is mostly very easy compared to the original, aside from a few extremely annoying levels. The final boss was an extreme letdown - we 3 starred it on our first try.Tone and theme constantly waffled. Rather than having 'worlds' like the first game, you jump from theme to theme and back again on a per level basis at random. This makes the entire game feel samey, while the original had a unique theme and gimmick each world.The multiphase levels seen in the previews are cool, but there were about 3 of them the entire game and I felt a bit cheated. The vast majority are just one area.After finishing it, we are battling to even remember the levels that gave us difficulty.The hub is also bizarre, with no rhyme or reason - finding switches feels like needless busywork and padding on an already thin game. Constantly having to go back to the middle to progress the story became a chore. We blazed our way to act 6, beat the multiphase 'boss' level and were expecting a final epic act involving the zombies to unlock. The game then just...ended.= Graphics and Audio = Graphics are pleasant and bright and the variety of chefs is cool. Audio is solid with a few catchy themes. Nothing wrong here.= Story = Meh. Compared to the charm of the original, we now have a disjointed, random trip through a bunch of unconnected levels with an overarching but NEVER SEEN 'zombie' theme and then a 'final boss' where we don't even see the zombies! = Value = Poor. There is far less content and enjoyement here than the original game for about triple the price. This feels like a studio mandated product rather than the lovingly crafted masterpiece of the original.= Overall =+ Core gameplay is still fun+ Multiphase levels are cool+ Cute chef designs- Overly short- Gimmicky- Overpriced- Multiphase levels are rare- No consistency between levels and themes- Overly easy aside from a few irritatingly hard levels- Lame climax= Final verdict: This is a sad and disappointing followup to the amazing original game. It feels like something the developers didn't want to make. Wait for a deep special if you are interested, or better yet - just go through the original again."

One major bug is that when dropping a plate, it does not drop onto the table, but instead in a weird position that cannot be picked up again. Also in some scenario it could be dropped into a corner that cannot be reached. 4. I really like the sound of the onion king ""ba bi ba bi bu wa wa wa wu"", but it was missing in this expansion. Hopefully we could have it back. 5. Back to stage design, nothing about stars, but some stages was totally disgusting. I remember there was one stage that the in lava keep changing, which is so thin that we have to be so careful when delivering things. I guess it could be better when using keyboard to move, but for controller, a slight offset on sticker could cause a suicide in lava. This is not a good design at all. There was another stage that we control a platform in the middle to make burittos, but for 2p mode it was too much mess because one of us have to keep dropping, picking and control platform. However in 4p mode it was just as easy as nuts because one can just stay controlling the platform while others could just do their own thing. There were 3 sets of cooking material on each side(3 pots, 3 plates, 3 pans), so it was just one for each. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR1. Star requirement for 2p, 3p, 4p are same, which is ridiculous.2. Some kitchen were not well designed.3. Bugs4. No sound from NPC."

With the improvement of multiplayer mode, Overcooked 2 is an exciting, occasionally frustrating, and hilariously enjoyable co-op cooking game. The levels and themed and unique. There are many unlockable characters, a bunch of recipes to complete, and creative obstacles to make the job even more challenging. There is no combat in this game. Well, not in the traditional sense. Feel free to throw food at your friends or shove them into the water or off a cliff. The goal in this game is the race against the clock and to make as many orders as possible and send them out from the kitchen. Overcooked 2 is a huge improvement from Overcooked. The option of multiplayer was there in the first game, but the option for online multiplayer allows this game to be accessible by friends and family who may not live close enough to one another to play. [Or with the recent pandemic, where it may not be safe to play with other in close quarters.] The accessibility to play this game is there. The player can choose to use a controller or the keyboard and mouse and of course you can switch up the command layout any way you’d like.I simply adore this game. It’s good, wholesome fun where you and your friends will be tossed into some insane situations and laughter and screaming will ensue. The levels are beautifully crafted, and the music does not get old. I would recommend that if you buy the game, give a bit of a test drive and then maybe give the DLC a go if you find yourself really enjoying the game. The DLC is more challenging at times, but you gain access to new playable characters and new recipes. All in all, I found the game and the DLC it to be well worth it.

This matchmaking system works well for players in same country, but for oversea connection it still depends on both player’s network.The versus map in Overcooked 2 are getting more competitive than Overcooked 1, instead of completely separate the two teams by barrier, players in Overcooked 2 versus game are able to reach the other team’s kitchen to either stealing their order or making trouble in their kitchen.Overall, I really enjoy this game and I believe you are going to learn lots of tips and tricks during your game play.

Immediately, I can tell that more attention had been put into how the game looks, functions, and feels. It looks and plays considerably better and smoother than the last one with animations, visuals, and overall performance getting improved. For me, the most noticeable and welcoming of these changes has to be the increase in numbers of level variations. The locations of which you'll be visiting are now much more varied and will be taking you to all manners of environments including underground, air, lakes, urban centers, and so much more. Some will even have level transition bringing you to multiple locations in the same game. It's awesome, and I wish the developers would've done more of them because of how fun they are to play. Aside from that, if you're a fan of verses and arcade mode, there's even more content to gorge down on and enjoy, all with their own beautiful and unique levels to experience long after you're done with the main campaign. There is simply a lot to love about Overcooked 2, and I highly recommend anyone who's in the market for a new fun co-op game to definitely check it out."

The gameplay, I would say is definitely improved. The 'throw' button is very handy. I also like the online part, but with no voice communication, 4 random chefs in a hard level is very difficult.  Plus it is a little hard to find chefs to play with. I very much hope there is going to be a DLC soon with more levels. I was so excited for this game and waited months for it to come out.

Therefore, It's difficult to understand why on PCs with split keyboard control the multiplayer mode is not properly implemented. We are three local players at the same place and the only way to play together is to buy three versions of the game and play online via internet. This is because it's not possible to play with more than 2 local players and if additional online players are added all other local players are removed. That is nowhere stated in the game description and i guess only applies to pure split keyboard controls (but also to the Christmas update). Secondly, other online players (not personal friends) can only be found through steam discussion groups. There's no in-game player matching and search engine. For me this is a joke, in particular, for a multiplayer game.The game itself is great - it's just too expensive to play it with family."

Previously, you had to have a perfect or near perfect run to achieve three stars but now it's possible to clear the three star score by several hundred points each time. There were only a couple levels which took more than a few goes to get three stars and when we finished the final level with several minutes left on the clock, it was definitely more ""Oh, that's it?"" as opposed to the euphoria from finishing the first game. The charm of the original game was the frustration of missing the top score due to a seemingly insignificant error and toiling away for the elusive third star but that has been ungraciously taken away in Overcooked 2.So far the expansion is promising and has been much more challenging to get three stars for each level!

It brings the multiplayer online which was not something I was looking for (couch coop is the way to play this game to me), but apart from that, zilch.The graphics are practically the same, the option to ""throw"" stuff is more confusing than anything else, and the mechanism around it are underwhelming, and, having played the complete game in less than ten hours, I can say with confidence that the game is boring.To players from the first one, the levels propose no challenge whatsoever (we gained 3 stars all the time with no coordination, and the addition of the fourth star is a bad attempt to offer more difficulty), no evolution nor main theme (on levels from the same group you will do burgers, then sushi, then pizza... and do it again on the next round), lowering even the bar in terms of immersion or at least lore.Some ideas just fall very short, like the ""new and improved"" map which brings... well nothing.The game is bugged at times (some items end up in the void of the inbetween two squares), which is not a very big issue but still, for a second opus, it's worth noticing.In fact I'm thinking the addition of the multiplayer is the root cause of the letdown that is to me this game, seeing as I'm assuming they lowered the difficulty to cater for the online multiplayer aspect of the game, and that the bugs must mainly come from there.I'm always bewildered by the praise made around second opus of games like this one. The first one deserved it, but this one gives no reason to be bought, and it needs to be acknowledged.Go buy the first one."

A colourful blend between a fun challenge, terrible food puns and adorable art style--Overcooked! 2 certainly serves up a succulent dish of friendly fun.  Sadly, like a game of Monopoly, it just isn't fun when you're the only one playing.Overcooked! 2 focuses on testing how well you and your team cooperate with each other.  Gameplay consists of orders rapidly being placed, which the team must complete and serve up to earn points which accumulate into a rating out of three stars.  When the whistle blows, you and your friends will be scrambling to meet order after order by preparing meals--mincing the beef; chopping fish; mixing aforementioned ingredients with flour into a mixing bowl... Whilst teams which function together too slowly will find themselves failing orders, overzealous teams will, on the flipside, fight against becoming overburdened as the food overcooks or equipment breaks.  The time-sensitive mechanics of the game gives weight to each player's actions and the game's creatively-designed levels prevent simple routine and muscle memory from diluting the difficulty of the levels.  One mistake after the other my sous chefs and I found ourselves in hilarity amidst a nightmare of problems we couldn't even hope to solve in time.  These moments, I find, are unique in games such as Overcooked! 2, whilst I would have been expected to be frustrated at minor screw-ups and mission failures with other more serious games; the inherent lighthearted music and art of Overcooked! 2 just makes you feel happier overall.  It's a difficult phenomenon to explain, but it's one which can surely be felt.  After all, comedic tension is rare in all forms of media nowadays, from videogames to films.  I certainly did not expect Overcooked! 2 to be so hilarious and so entertaining.However, the game is certainly not without flaw.  Whilst I understand the rationale behind the decision to allow players to instantaneously throw ingredients at maximum power, without any middle ground as to how far the ingredient should be thrown.  Personally, I enjoyed the additional lighthearted chaos that throwing items everywhere could wreak, though I'd imagine the lack of additional control over the palyer's character could cause some frustration among those more competitive than myself.  Furthermore, the detected area of activation for some in-game items can be deceptively long yet deceptively short at the same time.  Overcooked! 2's arcade-y and intentionally forgiving controls sometimes end up fighting with the player, as instead of dropping it through a shaft for the next player in the team to pick up, I found myself placing the bowl onto the nearby boxes and tables next to me instead--something which grew nervously frustrating at times, to the point where I would have lost my mind, had it not been for the game's soothing ukelele-based soundtrack.My initial impression of Overcooked! 2 on the PC was soured by the game's single-player.  It slowed some things down, giving the sole player two chefs which they could alternate between, straining my multitasking capabilities.  Though it seemed slightly innovative and interesting, it completely failed to captivate me with its charm like it did the second I hopped into a party with my friends.  I can't blame the developers for trying to at least make it work for singleplayer, though; unlike how many other couch-multiplayer games out there which can't even be played in singleplayer.  Thus, the effort is still there and I believe the developers should be commended for at least giving players the option to play alone, in a game marketed and designed entirely for couch-coop multiplayer with friends.  Lastly, need I mention that the game is quite a great port and works very well with the keyboard despite being designed with the controller in mind?  Great work across the board!Overcooked! 2 is a simplistic port from the console, and evidently was designed with a controller in mind.  I didn't expect any fancy graphics or shading like I do from triple-A titles, and even so I was impressed by how nicely Overcooked! 2 manages to pull of its art style.  The game doesn't look like anything much and that's a good thing.  Those of you out there with the simplest of laptops should find running this game a breeze thanks to its minimalistic and cartoonish approach, much like its predecessor.  The game looks great enough, without bells and whistles that overcomplicate its accessibility.Finally, there's that great, glorious lighthearted and fun soundtrack that numbs the frustration and anger.  The mixers may be broken, the customers may be getting feisty with their orders, the kitchen may even be on fire as well; but the genius with the ukelele strums away and everyone just laughs the troubles away.  Overcooked! 2 provides no shortage of these moments of juxtaposed havoc and serenity, leading to a very enjoyable experience for the whole party.Overcooked! 2 is simply the cutest party game I've ever played, combining simplicity with the complexity of teamwork, this game will test you and your friends.  It's just a shame that it, like all other party games, doesn't really shine as a singleplayer game.  But then again, why would you be getting it if you're the only one?Overcooked! 2 offers hours of fun for a reasonable price-tag, and is a must-have if you already have a group of friends who are planning to purchase, or have already purchased it.+Low system requirements+Reasonable price+Great fun with friends+Lighthearted and tongue-in-cheek design and atmosphere+Many levels+Great soundtrack-Singleplayer is a bit boring, but that's expected-Only truly shines if you manage to convince your friends to buy it with you"

428,48,Alphadoriest,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alphadoriest/,6,,1,5.3,"Posted: August 27, 2018","2,082",0,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/ae17b53a762b3c3fd14aba4e048573b842afcf93.jpg,"The original was pure un-feta-ed (is that how you do it?) fun that appeared unbeatable on co-op. It's back, confident and emboldened with much of the same antics of 2-4 player cheffing in the least practical kitchens you'll have ever seen. Only this time, the obstacles are more devil-licious, there's now a fourth star for the hardened, battle-scarred unicorn chefs out there, you can throw and catch ingredients to your heart's content, and online invite-only and public arcade sampling of levels is now finally available for the friendless of us out there. The main strength of Overcooked was always that its central puzzle was very much a human puzzle. Pure cooperation. Achieving the flow present in actual kitchens through allocating rolls (yep), synchronising your timing, ironing out inefficiencies, and becoming one mind, one machine. That's why I always thought the later levels of even the original, wonderful as they still were, actually worked to undermine in many ways the main function of the levels, the human puzzle as it were. They'd insert too many flow-stopping complications that would make a single dish hard to serve. Overcooked 2 doubles down on that with new mechanics like lever-controlled platforms and oldies and goodies like the slowly swaying platform - artificially eating into your efficiency. But if you were to remove such obstacles, what could designers do to ever mix things up? I think the key is to allow efficiency and flow to always be achieved. For instance, there can still be some optimisation around a swaying platform given there is enough for the two parties to do either side and its movement frequency is just right. Having everyone stuck on a massive single platform controlled by a lever, however, seems like opting to kill the machine and making the one mind just the guy operating the lever. It's telling also that such a level is nigh on impossible without voice communication in online arcade mode. Other levels have an instant, unspoken understanding of the division of labour. That said, a nifty addition for online is definitely the radial communication for a quick nudge - even if I find the only one I really use is 'washing up' over and over again. It's like being at home.The narrative premise in the rising of the unbread certainly earns its due laughs, but knows it's but narrative justification. Like the original, it's an abrupt end, and perhaps less climactic this time. Less explosion and more an onion telling you you've done a good job. It's not a big deal, but perhaps a little something to sweeten the deal at the end rather than evoking bad arcade game practice would've been better. I still love the overworld. Driving around is still a joy, and with additions like optional attainable levels, platforms, etc, it's only been improved.Completing the game would then grant access to the four stars new game plus, though. Something which should go some way to simmer down veterans with some extra challenge. As a recent update, it shows the devs are committed to delivering this dish well-cooked. I can only give them a full four stars in turn for that.The single biggest boon to my experience with the game is the addition of the arcade online mode. Since I haven't been able to get as much local play going as I would have wanted, this has been invaluable. It's well-populated and you can get a lot of sessions in. Instead of selecting from a menu of specific levels, you choose the themed chapters and have it randomised from there. It would be nice if there was some ability to request specific levels or even replay one you just botched. I assume there's no voice chat since I didn't encounter it. Despite my complaints that some levels seem like they demand it, I think this was the best option. It keeps play thoroughly uninterrupted by bellowing and frustration and preserves a non-toxic environment. It's an excellent time, but online drop-in of strangers to get through some of the campaign would have been doubly marvellous. I suppose I could seek out people through something like Discord if need be, or ask the girlfriend nicely one more time. Like its predecessor, this remains co-op in its purest form - largely because it still plays off people self-organising and optimising so perfectly. It carries over all the presentational joy and fun whilst adding many quality of life changes - the biggest of which, online arcade, is a game changer (this game, that is). The recent post-launch addition of new game plus means it will dominate your chosen party's time for even longer and should work to resolve difficulty concerns. The new more impeding level design elements and mechanics can seem like a downgrade in how they interrupt flow, but this is still the well-cooked experience you know and love."

It's cute, it doesn't take too much time to clear, and there's a certain level of replayability  (i'll explain why it's only certain later) as there are other modes besides story that you can have fun with. It's the type of game you can pull out during a group sleepover and everyone will have a great time whether playing or watching (unless everyone has already played the game, then it'll probably be dull :/)Other than that, there are several problems I have with it. Read on if you want to find out what I feel are the cons of this game.Firstly, why the ♥♥♥♥ do I have to drive a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bus around the map to get to  the level I want to play? I don't get it. Then there's switches that you need to press to activate certain ramps to get to certain stages. Like just why? It's unnecessary and adds 0 value to the game.Secondly, why the heck is there a storyline? Nobody cares. It's poorly written (something about undead bread called unbread), and honestly having to drive all the way back to spend a few seconds rapidly hitting enter to skip through the onion king's speech is  a waste of time.Third, some level designs are HORRIBLE. I understand that they are trying to shake up the gameplay and introduce more chaotic moments but some of the elements added are just ridiculous. Its really just there to piss you off.Fourth, story mode feels really short. Thank god I bought this during Summer Sale on half price. There's only 6 words, each with 6 stages and 8 kevin levels which brings the total story mode stages to 44 levels. That took about 8 hours to clear. Of course, you can purchase the DLCs for more content, but judging from the reviews, it's pretty meh.Fifth, other than the stages the developers have included, and other modes such as versus, there's really nothing else to do once you have played the game for... lets' say 20 hours. The game will be fun for a while, but once you have tried everything multiple times? It will become dull. It would be nice if they could implement community created levels, but that would probably harm the DLC sales so... :') Overall, I still think Overcooked 2 is a decent game to have some chaotic fun. Just make sure you pull some of your friends in or set up Steam Remote Play for co-op. Singleplayer is hell. Oh and don't play it too much. It gets dull after a while."

Also versus mode 2 vs 1 is just bullying, opponents can steal stuff or squeeze and push your unused character.Around first dozen of stages are definitely easy to get 3 stars for solo as many claimed, tossing obviously makes it easier too instead of running back and forth in first game, the stages get harder and more complexed after that.If I have friends to play with locally I'd just get Overcooked 1 which sadly I don't (unless tossing and more recipes and chefs are good reasons for you), though I still think Overcooked 2 is pretty fun, and maybe get that on sale if you worry there's not enough content."

I find the lack of level differentiation a total let down because I was a big fan of the ice / space levels in Overcooked 1 (because, yes, sliding to your death is still a fun mix when you're hyperfocused on doing something). Difficulty has been generally toned down from something formidable to downright aggravating and thanks to the point multiplier, you can easily get (3) stars in one try. I expected more things happening on the main map since they introduced switched but things got repetitive too which is a bummer. But the biggest let down for me was the last few levels. The last boss of Overcooked 1 tooks us almost 5 hours trying to polish our teamwork, so I anticiapted that same exciting feeling. Sadly, the game blew it off with the most underwhelming finisher. It went like ""Oh. Wait? That's it?"".Overcooked 2 is still a nice co-op game that challenges you and your friends but the sequel is a half-baked comparison to its predecessor. If you're planning on getting this, I'd recommend that you buy the first game instead."

Either way, I used Parsec to play with a friend so I cannot speak to the online multiplayer implemented inside the game itself. At it's core, the gameplay is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it. The game took me roughly 7 hours to complete with one friend and we both agreed that purchasing the DLC wouldn't be worth it for the price as it just adds new levels. Sure, there are more items to make but I've seen more content packed games for cheaper. However, I do hear only the host needs to purchase the DLC which is nice.No matter what, I would wait for the game to go on sale. No need to purchase at $25. I would probably put this game at no more than $10."

I play with my SO and even without much strategy and adapting as we go, it was too easy. Now there is an update which include a 4th star on each level, but as soon as we fired the game, we though this was a mistake. See the progression for the 1-1 world: 20 - 160 - 300 - 2650, it's an incredible jump. Our first playthrough of the level was around 1400. We managed to reach 2165 after half hour of attemps, with an 'almost perfect' riskless execution, which for me is the fun way to play this game. This means dashing whenever possible, no downtime for either player and delivery of 43 dishes in order, so the tip bonus can stack as much as possible. Even so, it was impossible for us to even glimpse what we could do to reach it without using mechanics which require perfect execution. Is it possible? Probably, but this means we have to work in other ways to achieve it, which leads me to my next point.The controls are improved from the first version, but even so they still a little clumsy. The dash has an internal cooldown which is hard to time, you either spam the dash button or try to time it and don't dash sometimes (a little buffer for dashing would go miles in improving it's feeling). Grabbing and dropping items always leave something to be desired, since they are not precise enough most of the time. There is a distance which you can do the actions but sometimes the action does not fire. Other times, it does something you do not want to, like you are on top of a treadmill but it decides to drop your item on the table on the side of your character.With the imprecise commands, it's impossible to execute perfectly on your plans, which sucks the fun out of trying the challenging 4th star scores, specially with a non hardcore gamer like my SO.Tossing was a good idea and mechanically it works nicely, but it doesn't work properly with my next point.I don't like the physics being applied to the floor items instead of the locking to the table ones. To reach high scores, you are required to toss items, but then some rules about the item interaction change. For example, if a tomato is on the counter and you bring the plate to it, it will put the plate and the ingredient together. If the tomato is rolling on the floor and you try the same mechanic, you will drop the plate, then you have to pick up the tomato to be able to put it on the plate. It does not make sense for the mechanic to change because of the environment, it should be consistent if they expect you to reach such high scores.Unexcusable, it does not need to reach Mario Maker levels of sharing but the only thing I want is to be able to face different challenges endlessly (or really easy flows for an extended period of time). Creating custom levels would solve all the longevity issues of the title. The game has more levels than the first, but a lot of them lack personality. In two players, the first raft level (with the item tossing) is ridiculous. One player is on one raft with the cutters and... that's it, no access to the other side. The other player has to collect the ingredient, toss to the other side, receive the cut ingredient, put on the plate and serve. WHY does the game didn't put at least some of the ingredients on the other side is beyond me. Being able to toss the plate would also solve a lot of those limitations (so the delivery could be on that side) but the devs chose to allow only ingredient tossing (which is OK, but limits those kitchens).The map on the first game was charming (and useless). The map on the second one has a useless mechanic to activate some buttons to raise platforms. They are always obvious and add nothing to the game. So it's even more useless.I love the idea of the game, but I hate the implementation of the same problems of the first without all the charm which made it an instant classic at my home. If they reduce the complexity of the 4th star, I will gladly play it and the game goes from a NO to a Maybe.Overcooked 1 continues to be a more balanced game with more engaging kitchens and scores with are on the perfect sweet spot of difficult enough but never too far away to seem like it is impossible, so I recommend you play the first game instead."

Thankfully, the devs patched it up by adding a 4-star requirement to each level. They have also adjusted the 3-star requirement for subsequent DLCs to be a bit more challenging.I really hope they eventually fix the freeze that happens whenever someone falls off the map for the first time after the game booted up. The issue has been reported, attempted to be resolved, but not fixed for a long time now.I LOVE THE FREE CHEF UPDATE (the girl pirate is so pretty)!!

The story starts out with the Onion King as he has tasked you and a few other chefs if you have them to make food for everyone in the Onion kingdom and on your way you will come across new ways to make food and new challenges for you and your friends to over come.The gameplay is simple yet it can get crazy as you need to cook food, make sure the food is prepared in the correct order, deliver it to the hungry people, wash dishes, take out anything that catches on fire, and fight the time limit.  And having a friend does help out a ton and the game is more fun with friends as you get to yell at them for messing up and they just might do the same to you as well but that's the fun with Overcooked 2.  The graphics are cartoony and and wonderful and every area you go is different as you go into China Town, in the sky, in a mine, on the sea, you name it.  The characters are all cute and you feel bad for them as they are trying their hardest to cook and get the job done and the only thing they get is more orders to cook food but they get tips at the end of the day and that's your score so make sure to get the order right as you want to try and get 3 stars on the level.  Overcooked 2 even with it's simple gamplay is challenging but it is really fun to play with friends and it's best played that way, so grab a friend and get cooking as it's going to get crazy and rememeber, throwing food is this game is fun."

One level had a road where you could get run over, with no lights to indicate when the cars were coming, the tables moved constantly and the wind would blow you away from whatever you were preparing and into the road for you to get run over - bearing in mind that if you 'die' with food you lose it permanently. Don't get me wrong, I'm down for challenging, but I would much prefer the challenge to make the cooking process more complex rather than introduce 5 different elements at once that make it near impossible to even do one part of the process of completing a dish. It's such a shame because we were really enjoying the game (and we liked to repeat levels in order to get 3 stars) but it got to the point where every single level was more frustrating than the last until we just stopped playing. I'm sure it would have been easier with more people but if a game supports 2 players it should be able to accommodate it.TLDR: Fun at first but later levels feel like theyre designed to make you tear your hair out"

Light colours, funny graphics look childish but you will see how it is sometimes hard to beat a “game for kids”.Here we have a sequel, in my opinion, of one of the best cooperative games – . I already reviewed the original game and you can check the review out here: The Onion Kingdom is in danger again and we must defend it by polishing our cooking skills! Hmm… Anyway as in the original , the story itself does not really matter here, as it is again just a background for all the fun which cooking in  provides.The game in technical aspects is almost perfect. It is not buggy, it runs really smoothly. One of the main features in  is multiplayer which works just fine: it is easy to connect and achievements are given to all the players. However only the game host can select levels/DLCs and moreover only the game host can drive the van to travel on the map :(Original  didn’t provide much in-game communication as it was intended for couch playing, however with added online multiplayer, the game provides something like that – 6 emotion animations – which you could use to show what you think about your companion’s action.  Unlike in  which contained only slap ability (and which was the best, I miss it so much), here the emotions are useless because you simply do not have time to use them if you are really tryharding as I did.The game provides the same joy and satisfaction of completing the kitchens.  also offers a free expansion and a few DLCs for additional price to continue the journey in the Onion Kingdom. In my experience, the game and some of the DLCs are a bit more challenging than the original  and in some ways it is not a good thing. As some levels are more frustrating and it is really easy to forget about the fun. Additionally there is a competitive mode to check who is the real professional chief among your friends and you.Speaking about gameplay, a new game-changing feature has been added – throwing. Now you can throw the items directly to your teammate or even to a pot/cutting desk/frying pan or anything else (but I guarantee 100% rage on the diagonal aiming if you use the keyboard, so I highly recommend using a gamepad). The ability is really cool and it allows you to save some time as the dishes themselves become a bit more complicated – in some recipes you would mix the ingredients before frying, baking or steaming. So I believe the game still remains balanced. is a great example of a perfect sequel which provides the same fun. There weren’t that many changes compared to the original game as  was a really really decent cooperative game by itself. So, whether you already played  or didn’t, it actually doesn’t matter, you can start your journey to the Onion Kingdom with either of the games :)"

Whether you're playing for fun, playing with a group of people or a partner, or if you're trying to grind out 3/4 stars for each level, there is always something to come back to. It may not have an endless amount of content, but whenever a new DLC or content update is released, I'm always excited to jump back in and learn new levels and overcome new obstacles.Highly recommend."

I finished my story campaign with a friend from another country and we both had such an enjoyable time screaming, shouting, and laughing at each other. The game difficulty may feel underwhelming at first, but a new challenge arises after completing the main campaign and makes the game that much more exciting and fun. I'm also really enjoying the free seasonal content being released from time to time, which has been very creative and cute.

Don't get me wrong, it's still a great game to have fun with your friends. The chaotic aspect of the game is largely improved with new mechanic and features.But for those who have played overcooked! the amount of excitement just isn't there. In my opinion the level design for overcooked 2 is TOO EASY for experienced players. Me and My friend only had around 10 retry to have all normal level 3 stars. With 10 hours in, the only achievement locked is the dish washing one. Yet I have't finish the story of Overcooked1 with 25 hours on the record. You just don't have the constant ""go back for more stars to unlock new level"" going on there.Maybe the game decided to work more towards the competing part, focused on the arcade and versus mode. But for me a causual game like this shouldn't give me the pressure of a PVP game. It's easier to have fun in PVE and less likely to get your temper in.Wish there would be more content for this game (DLC maybe?)"

NOPE, it goes harder, maybe when they discuss the game one of them questioning how to make this harder, just add more moving platforms don't just side to side make it up and down, raft in the river and even DRAGONS. well after all i think that this game is great despite never play the previous overcooked tho, the game mechanics itself is good yet not great either, and for the dlc the levels are quite few and after i buy season pass why i didnt get the surf and turf and must buy it again, i confused because they say its season pass. anyway 9/10 worth playing with friends or family, ya just don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up too much or maybe you'll have no more friends and family....kevin kills us"

Personally, a minimum of 2 people to play the game because in single player you control 2 chefs which can be difficult to manage. The game features 7 chapters to cook through with a 4th star unlocked after beating the game. I aim for at least 3 stars on every level otherwise the game will be done in about 6 hours. I have bought the DLCs for the game which add a lot of content to the game. If you are just getting into overcooked now, I would recommend buying ""Overcooked: all you can eat"" which includes Overcooked 1 and 2.Can't wait for Overcooked 3"

There are a lot of reasons behind it.I have played both Overcooked 1 and 2 for a quite long time. I have got most levels 3-star in Overcooked 1, and all the levels (including Kevin levels) 3-star in Overcooked 2. Right now I'm playing for the fourth star with my friend, and I really dislike the gameplay.According to the description of the update, the fourth star appears after finishing the story, which means you have to play all the levels at least twice to get all four stars. It is extremely boring, since the levels are unchanged in all aspects, except that the target score is ridiculously high. The gameplay really sucks. In the first several levels, all you need to do is to pre-chop everything and throw it on the ground, so that you can deliver dishes non-stop to get the score. It is not how a kitchen should work. A normal kitchen should not exploit the paused time. In my opinion, the four-star levels should add more elements (e.g. slippery roads and rats in Overcooked 1) to the map to further test the cooperation, rather than to test players to push the right button again and again.Also there are more problems other than the difficulty one. There are NO achievements relative to four stars, which seems really frustrating to me. It took me and my friend almost two hours to complete the 1-1 to 1-6 four stars, but there’re no rewards at all. The only new feature of Overcooked 2 is the action of throwing. It is fun, but it also has some bugs that can ruin your whole plan. I also wish there will be some additional conditions besides the target score to get the full star, such as not dying in dangerous levels, and not cooking the dishes until the last second. It can make the game more challenging, more reasonable and also more fun. Boldly increasing the target score shows that the designers really don’t understand the game. Difficulty doesn’t matter that much, fun matters. Finally, the single player experience does not change much. It is as boring as that in Overcooked 1. I would be glad if there is a separate story mode for single player. I see huge potential in the Overcooked series, but Overcooked 2 just miss most of the points. I hope I can pre-order Overcooked 3 with confidence."

It's again humorous and full of puns, fun levels AND it has multiplayer which was missing in the first one. The levels are not as challenging anymore - it's fairly easy to reach 3 stars - but after you've completed the story, you unlock the possibility to gain a fourth star in every level which seems impossible. I've seen videos of people doing it but you have to do everything perfect. I think it's a good compensation for the story being a bit too easy."

The game plays like the previous one with chaos extravaganza as you progress with more recipes. The online play is clearly why people will be drawn to this but sadly I experienced lots of bugs. My chef would stop responding to my controls and appear at later point where I instructed him to be. This happened on occasions where I joined another game and when I was hosting one too. Single mode had lag as well. Something else to keep in mind is that the keyboard plays with awkward controls, as you can't remap the keys.

The level design in the first game had no online co op and everyone had a shared space-- meaning there needed to be communication on who was going to play what role. I didn't beat that game because I had a perfectionist attitude and the difficulty really rolled me over. People who beat that game will probably steamroll this game because the roles are often already separated for you and have already mastered the art of splitting roles. If they enjoyed the first game, they might as well get the second one. Overcooked is a one-of-a-kind game.2) New players who play soloThis is a very different game if you're playing solo. There's no communication. There's you switching bodies and doing the work of two people with one person. It's significantly harder this way, but the scoring system (and the chopping/cooking) has been adjusted to make it doable. I hate playing single player on this because it's a lot more work. I'm sure the three stars are much more rewarding, but you know, trying to synchronize your other self with maximum efficiency AND being prepared for the next menu item is a puzzle in itself. I might've enjoyed a little more if there just wasn't a ranking at all, but being a perfectionist ruined my fun as single player. Would not recommend it.3) Players with friends with compatible work schedulesThis is the target audience. If you fall in this category, you should know this game is a must-have.Cons--I hate the weather. I hate the pitfalls. I hate falling into the water. I hated the fact that the conveyor belts switched direction randomly. In fact, I hate when my storage ingredients move around. I especially hate the wind. I found a way to dodge cars at least. Pros--I'm amazed that we beat this game. We got into a rhythm after like the third or fourth try and god I never want to play those levels again. At least the ones with any of the hate I mentioned up there. So yeah, there's a feeling of wow. We actually made a good team. I have never really felt that in any of the Mario games I've played."

We thought to buy it since we saw some YouTubers play it and we thought it looked fun, and it is! I love the cartoonish art style, that's one of the reasons I bought this game. I personally I ain't into realistic graphics that much. Maybe that's because I'm a little bit into weird, funny stuff rather than serious stuff. Not that I don't like really serious games, but the funnier, the better in my opinion. Anyway, about Overcooked! 2; I didn't play the first game, so I can't really say either it's better or worse than it, but from watching YouTube, Overcooked! 2 looks more creative than Overcook! 'cause of the following reasons (for me): more creative locations, better graphics (if you're that kind of guy), and more stuff to cook. It's still the classic Overcooked! with a 2 slapped after it, with more stuff to cook really. Not much of a deal, but it's fun! So, if you have a controller (I'd recommend 2 controllers though, I find it better to play with a controller than a keyboard, but it depends on you) then give it to your friend/brother/sister/child etc. and play this game! It's awesome and fun for the whole family!NOTE: This game can be played online too, like 2 different people playing from 2 different PCs. I find it more fun to play localy though."

The story and characters feel a little , and the cutesy graphics and music  the chaos and fun frustration this game provides, but that doesn't stop Overcooked! 2 from being an incredibly enjoyable experience with friends.The simplistic controls and adaptibility of said controls means that you can rope your dear grandmother into playing OC! 2, and that you and your sibling can share the same controller to play. The short but intense rounds trying to cook up a dish encourage awareness and keeping track of multiple on-screen elements, while coordinating in an increasingly complex and changing enviornment.

If and when it gets fixes I will change my review, but for now the co op mode is sh*t.edit: AFter playing some more it also seems that the difficulty of this game is way too low. 3 starring almost all levels first try whereas in overcooked 1 we sometimes had to restart 3-4 times just to get 2 stars."

We completed the game within 5 hours which is quite short for this type of game at this price point.Seeing how simple this game is, I don't see why there isn't a map editor, with community workshop maps based on a grid system. Or at least, why isn't there different worlds with different biomes... Imagine a desert biome, where food would decay quickly if left unattended. Or an ice biome, where one of the hazards would be that you slip on ice. This game could have been so much more.

Most of public that I met tend to keep spamming the cussing emote when I made ONE mistake. Just ONE. I understand the frustration but I find it is not necessary to do so. It made me feel soooooo bad about it and quit the game immediately and I've encounter this so many times already. I don't understand why people can get very elitist and toxic in a game like this. Seriously chill the ♥♥♥ out? It's not a competitive game where you compete with other teams to get highest score smh.To the new players, I don't recommend going online public. Take your time to learn and practice and play with your close friends only. Online public are bunch of elitist players that take things too seriously in a fun game. There are a few nice gamer who can take you slowly but you don't get to pair with them much."

Sometimes I compete with my friends, and sometimes I work with them on levels. However, the only thing that makes me feel bad is that I feel that the operation is too complicated, and it is difficult for me to control these operations. In addition, at the back, the game rhythm will become very fast, so it means that there can be no mistakes, and the hand speed must be fast. However, playing with friends will not have such troubles, so I highly recommend playing this game with friends, you will feel the joy inside."

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

This game will totally stress you out, but in a fun way.There are three stars for every level, and the number of points required to get the stars goes up with the number of players. Very slight spoiler about the new game + mode:  I found  just as fun if not more fun than While you technically can, I wouldn't recommend playing alone. It's just hard because this game is really made for multiplayer, and especially four players. I've found two or four works best.Also, the DLC is great. It's just as fun as the main game and includes new elements and mechanics that made the base game great.If the game and DLC is on sale (it often goes for 50% off), it's absolutely worth it."
