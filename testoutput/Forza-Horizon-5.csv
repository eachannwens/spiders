Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line?

The first few hours were great, but then after that I just got bored. I was just like ""Where the hell am I seen this already ?"", and ahh yes, in Forza Horizon 4. The sad truth is, that I do not really see the point buying this when you have and played with Forza Horizon 4. The game is exactly the same, but it has a lot of improvements and a new map, and basically that's it. The problem is, that I already spent 100+ hours in the predecessor game, and this one just got boring. Worst part is that I bought the Premium Edition (although it only cost me 62,99€ instead of 99,99€) and never touched it since October 19, yikes. Maybe at some point in my life I'll play it again, but not now.In my honest opinion, only buy this game if you did not played FH4 to death, otherwise you will end up in the same shoes as I am."

There are some quality of life improvements in the UI, some new multiplayer-centric activities, but overall it plays the same as the previous game. That itself is not a bad thing, as obviously the devs stick to the tried-and-tested formula that works. But this time it feels like they played it too safe. Who knows, maybe the DLC will introduce more new content and changes, while the devs focus until now was to get the base game done ready for the November release slot. To sum up:- If you haven't played Horizon 4, buy that one on sale instead of 5. It looks almost as good, it's sold at a good discount, it has more content and less bugs, and the online community is still active. -  if you liked Horizon 4 or you want to run with the cool kids and play the newest game, then I can recommend Horizon 5. - if you didn't like previous Horizon games, there's nothing new here that will change your mind."

For context, I used to play Underground 2, Most Wanted 2005, Burnout 3, Burnout Paradise, Midnight Club 3, and a little bit of Pro Street, Test Drive, Blur and some rally games.At its core, FH5 has a good sandbox. There is a wide variety of cars ranging from supercars, tuners, muscle cars, offroad vehicles, and pretty much everything in between. The customization is good too - you can modify tiny little details about each car or download other people's creations and use those if you want to skip to proven results without much effort.The world available has almost every location type you could want in a racing game, however one key thing is missing - a metropolis area, or some sort of street/city scene. There's a very small town and the streets are way too narrow for high-speed racing, so that particular flavor of racing is frankly completely missing in this game. Otherwise the game offers plenty to enjoy, and because of a wide variety of different cars, tuning options, and adjustable difficulty settings, you can effectively move the slider between casual racing and simulation to lean towards one or the other.Then there's the online mode, which is a big let-down because of several core issues. The game has a very muted social aspect, lacking things to do together, and limiting player to player interaction. First of all, there's a lack of central hubs in the game, you mainly only find people at the starting area, with nothing interesting nearby. Because of that, people just drive around a bit and leave, you don't form groups to go do other things.You only see players who are near you, if you get distance between yourself and another player, they disappear from your map, you can easily lose a friend you could have made, and overall you never know if a place you're driving to has 10 other players there or absolutely none. This was never an issue in other games, you could see where everyone is, and most players would go to places where they saw other people.Other players are ghosts by default, you can't interact with them and you don't feel like you are sharing the same space with them. This has been very jarring. I can see other players around me, but it still feels like playing alone. I've never experienced that in other games, and it's just really sad. I have fond memories of hanging out with other players in Burnout, doing stunts together, racing, playing cops and robbers, crashing into players, I often stayed in the same servers with the same people for hours on end.In FH5 you don't feel any kind of server unity, you feel completely disconnected. Even if you find a convoy with other players (which then disables the ghost mode for people within the convoy), it still doesn't feel the same, because ghosts by default means everyone in the playerbase has a different mentality, almost like they have no idea what to do.You can honk at someone and drive off hoping they'd follow, and they're not going to, because they're used to everyone being a ghost they can ignore. This is in contrast to other games where a honk-and-run leads to people following you 99% of the time, and it felt like a secret code, if you honk at someone you've made a new friend.Lastly, in many other games like this, you'd have a wide variety of challenges to complete, which directed players towards certain areas, got them together and gave them things to do. FH5 doesn't have that. Horizon Arcade exists, but you need to wait in a small circle 5-15 minutes, which nobody is going to do. You could vote-start stuff like this in Burnout Paradise, they did it better over a decade ago.So all in all, this game is complicated to review. If you just want to kick back and listen to music while exploring a beautiful world with fast cars, FH5 does scratch that itch, and there's plenty of story content to keep you busy. But if you're looking for a fun and varied multiplayer component - you're going to be disappointed, because you won't find that here.I'm giving it a thumbs up regardless because even though it's not what I was looking for, it's definitely not a bad game and I have enjoyed my time with it."

It has over 500 cars, a massive world to explore, endless possibilities of car builds that add fun to the gameplay itself, and a lot more that you should explore for yourself. So why the negative review?1. Post-launch updates and support is horrible and sometimes straight-up negligent. I'm primarily focused on the online open racing and here's a list of problems that I've encountered: - Broken Headlights: The developers have changed all online street races to night-time only, but the headlights are broken so the game constantly looks pitch-black. - Cheating. Cheaters who race online are not banned. Glitched times have taken over the top of every rivals leader boards and they're not getting banned or have their records taken off. If you raced a track in a blueprint event, your time has a chance to get posted onto the leader board as well. Yet if you made a livery with the North Korean leader on it you'll get a 800-yr ban or smth.- Horrendous track designs: this in my opinion is what turned most players away from offroad races. Have fun when you made a 3000-ft blind jump only to find a 3-ft wide checkpoint right next to you after that, OR ramps placed perfectly to flip your car/truck over. - Connection Issues: I use ethernet but still constantly got disconnected from online lobbies that I've already locked in. The game was flat-out unplayable online at launch but the developers managed to fix most of em. Long wait time still happens occasionally which could take up to 10 minutes from my experience. 2. Contents-Many cars were missing from fh4, which the developers claimed to be from licensing issues but some fh4 cars are still available thru seasonal rewards or forzathon shops but not in AUTOSHOW? wth?-Cars in general are more powerful in their respective classes comparing to the previous horizon: an A800 car in fh5 handles like ~S1/850 cars in fh4, which makes higher classes harder to handle, especially on S1 and S2 dirt and off-road races, where super cars or even formula drift cars with off-road tires more competitive than actual off-road cars/trucks.- Speaking of cars, meta cars are more dominant in this game than in fh4. Take a look at different leaderboards and the top is always dominated by them. While you can still make your own tunes and compete with them online, this issue is worse than the previous horizon, as in fh5 cars like Bone Shaker require little to no skill to be driven fast and competitive.>>So that's been said, is the game still worth buying?<<Yes! Personally I think the singleplayer contents are amazing. The expeditions and showcase events are well-designed and exciting to play. The story mode is fun and helps you get familiar with the driving mechanics too. Even if you're not into racing games or cars in general, this game could still be an amazing experience for the driving, exploration, and customization. Besides the car packs, which come with the premium edition, all the cars in the game can be bought in autoshow with in-game credits or acquired thru seasonal challenges. Kudos to PGG for making a game with virtually no micro transactions.At the very least, the game's graphics on ultra and extreme are just eye-candy and it's surprisingly well optimized on low-end hardware as well. You can get smooth 60fps with medium graphics on a GTX1660 and it still looks better than a lot of other racing games out there. As a matter of fact someone posted this test on YouTube where you can actually run this game without any graphic cards to begin with.>>So why the downvote?<<As of now, there are just too many gameplay-affecting issues that the developers need to address in future updates. As someone who mainly spends time in online lobbies, the experiences I've had with these issues are just not pleasant. Right now the series desperately need some competition in the same category: sim-cade racers, to show how PGG should handle post-launch supports properly.Until all the issues have been not only addressed but also fixed, I'll keep this down vote. Thx for reading."

However, something always felt off, and now that i've played some of the prior games, I feel like I know what it is. (I'll be comparing it to the previous title mostly as its the only one you can still buy on steam - idk for how much longer though)Graphics - One of the first things you'll notice is the graphics, they are impressive - if you have a machine capable of running it at max settings... Theres been no care into the lower visual settings, and that shows greatly on my system, I have a 1000 series GPU, Forza Horizon 4 looks GORGEOUS on it, and runs extremely well on the max settings, the cars & weather look stunning & every season is distinctly different in terms of colour balance. Whereas in this game, anything lower than High looks like a game fresh out the Xbox 360 era with just more polygons. Cars look almost like stickers on the screen, and weather effects look awful & can be really distracting while you're trying not to be wrecked by the AI.Forza Horizon 5 on Medium Quality... Looks worse than Forza Horizon 4 on Medium Quality (and runs a lot worse), and I dont believe there is an excuse for thatStory - if you could even call it that is uninteresting, completely uninspired & an absolute pain to get through. The dialogue is not entertaining at all, and often times just feels depressing to sit through. I dont even know how they managed to screw up the welsh drifty boi's dialogue, but it just wasn't as memorable as his appearance in FH4. Theres a distinct lack of interesting stories to do, and it feels like a very missed opportunity to showcase the unique environment of Mexico & its culture around cars. The Vocho story is a great example of what they couldve done, but instead that is the only story that focuses on Mexican car culture. FH4 has lots of memorable characters, each story felt distinct & THE BUSINESSES, OH MY GOD THE BUSINESSES - those are fun. This game does NOT have businesses, which were where a fair bit of my FH4 fun came from, an odd choice - and thats kinda what describes a lot of this games decisions... Odd.Car Selection - Great, but theres yet another odd choice in how its handled. Both Fiat/Abarth & Alfa Romeo are still missing even though it has been almost a year since the game has released, and despite massive amounts of asking from the community. Theres a distinct lack of unique American cars, brands like Saturn or Scion (both defunct im aware) are missing, theres a serious lack of saloons or other Consumer ""i can get this"" cars, Theres only 2 Cadillacs, 3 Pontiacs, 1 Oldsmobile (its a cool one, but still), and very few cars that would actually be common in Mexico... BUT there are ~60 Fords & ~50 Porsches, so it seems like they had their priorities straight when trying to add cars to this game :/. They also seriously like to add cars from previous Forza games & pass them off as ""new additions"" - I dont mind there being cars from previous games, but stop trying to gaslight us on the Forza Monthly streams into thinking they are new to the series. - We want cars we haven't driven before, not ones we've driven hundreds of times. And REALLY like adding supercars or sports cars, which I understand the appeal - but seriously I want my sleeper cars back, makes more sense to have them especially with an apparently ""better"" street scene in this game. Theres also a severe lack of appearance customisations, most cars have 1 spoiler option, and 90% have no options for bodykits, or really anything that most people would want to change. Its not too big a deal, but it'd be nice to have some more customisation options.Online & Bugs - OH BOY I have a lot to say about this. Theres been a day one bug, that continues to wreak havoc on our convoy sessions, that has recieved no fix or even acknowledgement by the devs. & that is the random freezing that happens occasionally when you rewind. In single player, this isnt much of an issue. However in multiplayer, especially if it happens when you accidentally hit rewind, it can seriously kill the mood of everyone in the convoy, and make even the most passive person ragequit. Fix the damn bug already. The online experience is awful, you cant join your friends convoy ingame anymore like you could in FH4, you now have to use the ""Xbox Game Bar"" otherwise you cant play with your friends, its once again an odd choice considering they already had the framework to join other's games in FH4. Its also a massive middle finger to anyone who runs this on linux through proton, since they can no longer join their friends games as its now OS locked.The biggest annoyance personally has been something that they absolutely refuse to fix, and thats the lack of balance between the cars. If you've ever driven the boneshaker (or most of the cars added by the Hot Wheels DLC now) you'll be aware of how absurdly overpowered they are, if you encounter a Boneshaker in A Class open, you will not be fighting for 1st place, you'll be fighting for 2nd because the boneshaker has finished the race 20 seconds before anyone else did. I want to love this game more, but the lack of care the developers have to actually rescore the cars to match what their actual performance is, its genuinely awful. Its worse knowing that these cars have been known to be broken since day 1, and there has been literally nothing done by the devs to actually fix them. So you'll always encounter them in Open or Tour.I want to say this game is good, I really do, I love playing it, and I love being in the game racing. But I feel like this game could be a LOT better with next to no effort from the development team. They could fix the unbalanced cars and instantly make the game 100x more fun to play online. They could remove cheated leaderboard scores & make getting the highest score mean something. They could actually add unique cars to the region, or listen to their damn community, but they won't. This feels like a ""safe profit"" game. A game manhandled by some execs into losing its soul just so it could be an easy game to profit from. It feels corporate, its not the same horizon you had as a child/teen on your xbox 360, and its not the same game as the previous title. Its a soulless husk of a game within a series that was at one point the greatest open world racing experience. I'm still going to play it, its one of the only open-world racing games & I dont exactly have a choice to fill that niche. I want this game to be the best it can be, but it really feels like i've joined just as the ship was going down. Good Graphics wont save a game with an awful experience, and this has been a champion of awful experiences lately."

Nothing beats the feeling of taking your favorite car, wrapping it in a cool livery, and going ham on the roads. So why am I not recommending it? Well, there are a few reasons, and it all has to do with how the devs are running the show. The devs will ban you for dumb reasons like making livery that's somewhat political in nature perhaps, but then they don't ban the clear cheaters on the leaderboards. There are speedzone records that are legitimately impossible without glitching the game, and yet, the devs seem less interested in going after those guys. There are bugs that cause physics rubberbanding, bugs that cause visibility issues, but the devs would rather release multiple patches to make it harder and harder to obtain super wheelspins. They straight up removed the super wheelspin masteries from several cars, because they were too cheap to obtain. The harder level AI is absurd and does not obey the same physics which bind the players, they will rubberband up to the the player if behind, but you as a player can almost never catch up to AI ahead of you. There's a running joke that you have to ram the AI off the road, or else you can't actually win. The rewards for a lot of the weekly seasonal challenges are garbage, like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ horns and crappy clothing items. Speaking of clothing, there are a ton of them littering the wheelspins, and you're probably more likely to get a pair of socks than a car. The game would rather license yet another Italian exotic, than license actual interesting D, C, and B range cars. There's a glaring lack of European cars, and yet we have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of Ferarri cars, and yet somehow we don't have the Testarossa. Where are brands like Alfa, Fiat, and Lancia?And I haven't even scratched the surface of the issues. Point is, if it's on sale, or you really enjoy driving and just wanna have fun, it might be a good deal for you, but I just can't recommend it."

There is no AI, there is no intelligence. Non-human cars do not obey the same physic as you do. They follow the racing line at a preset speed (which depends on the difficulty setting), as if they were on rails, no matter what car they're in.Only once you are very close to them does physic start to influence them, at which point they completely forget how to drive and usually brake, even if in a straigh road.So, your only chance to win (at higher difficulty level) is to take the lead very early, usually in the first few corners, by dive-bombing and ramming. Failing that, once the lead car get a couple of seconds in front of you (you always start a race mid-pack, so you're always at a disadvantage), you can forget about catching up. Just restart the race and ram harder...Oh, and obviously they cheat, they accelerate much faster than you, and in the off chance you get a significant lead, they rubberband back to you at insane speeds.Of course, you can lower the difficulty, at which point the game becomes a walk in the park. Not fun either.It is such a shame, because Forza Horizon 5 is a fun car game, but a terrible racing game...Edit : And to add insult to injury, the game is full of bugs (some small, some progression-breaking, all annoying), some of them having existed for months, and the devs don't seem to give a flying **** about it..."

Unlike most people, I was expecting exactly a game that was quite similar to the previous one with very slight improvements, and it lived up to those slight expectations. My first impressions when I got into the game were kind of mixed. I certainly saw the improved graphics and I really liked how much fresher the game itself was based in Mexico. FH4, which was based in England, was quite ""colder""I'm pretty happy with the gameplay itself. Whether I want to play singleplayer or multiplayer I know I can have fun playing either mode. I want to pay more attention to the multiplayer, however. I spent quite a few hours in it and had quite a few good moments, but like everything else there were some downsides. I've run into hackers in a few sessions, but I've seen people complain about their far more frequent occurrence. I've personally seen hackers quite rarely, but it's not like they don't exist. I've also seen quite a few modded max level accounts and so on, which is pretty ugly and unprofessional for a game of this level.That aside the multiplayer is a wonderful place with room for everyone. Want pure races of various kinds? There's Horizon Open for you. Prefer to drift? There is a special place where all drifting competitions are organized. Or maybe you fell in love with the battle royale modе that was added in FH4? Well, it's here too, so I guess there's something for everyone to enjoy. The game currently has 97 achievements. You can do quite a few of them by going through the game's story, as well as through the Hot Wheels DLC. The ones you won't get by going through the singleplayer are pretty fun and show different details of the game that you might not notice unless you're focused on getting those exact achievements, but I really think it's worth the try to be completed.Aside from the intro to the game, you'll be able to alter your difficulty settings at any time in Forza Horizon 5. It pretty much depends on you. You can either make the game very easy for you or very hard. I suggest starting with the lower difficulties and gradually working your way up. I know you'll see yourself taking more money as you raise the difficulty, but you'll make a lot of money anyway just by playing and forget about watching your credits. Ignore them and you won't know when you have so much money that you don't know how you can even spend.The graphics are very beautiful. So beautiful that they make you feel warm inside while looking at them. And that big open world that you can roam around and explore... The graphics are so good that a lot of players like to just set up cruises with each others, drive slowly and enjoy. What can I say about Photo mode... I'll let the pictures speak for me.The Soundtrack of Forza Horizon 5 features over 100 songs available through six radio stations, each with a different genre and host. However i prefer to listen to my playlists on Spotify but some people prefer the in-game music and it ok so i don't mind it. I had no problems at all.Game tested on:The game isn't that new anymore and it gets discounted often, so I think it's best to wait for a discount and when you see it get it right away. The game is truly unique and worth your time."

You then come face to face with the mastermind of the event himself, Papa Fernando, and his V O C H O in a 1v1 winner take all race for your freedom along the mountainside. In an Initial D F&F Tokyo Drift fashion you and Papa Fernando race to the finish with you winning it by a second.

Not because the AI is good, but because those lazy developers made it so enemy cars don't answer phisics. Change of road type? You drift like mad as they go on rails.High jump? you could bottom out and lose lots of speed while the AI simply lands softly without losing speed.Found a good trajectory? Sorry enemy AI slams you from behind!They could have just taken the top pilots, used their times and telemetry to actually make good AI. This is PURE LAZYNESS from the devs, who could have made us face the best of the best pilots of this game, and get amazed by perfect tunings and trajectories, forcing us to sweat to improve to their level.Instead they made the AI cheat its way to victory, forcing you to either slam into them to break their speed or find other cheesy exploits.This is why, until they fix the AI, i will keep a negative review. Fix the AI and it's a most-reccomended game.""Can you win at pro/unbeatable?""Yes, you can. Not impossible BUT. You will end up smashing into cars to slow them and slam into corners to keep as much momentum as phisically (im)possible. For a racing game it's tatamount to need to cheese the game to out-cheese the AI. It's not something one expects from such a AAA game studio.And of course, if you ever let the lead car go beyond 100 metres, it will completely ignore obstacles, so the small branches slowling you down or somewater will have zero effect on a too far away car, meaning you get the penalty of obeying in-game phisics as the AI ignores it completely.Update: it's useless to write ""lol u bad"". If you never saw the AI cars glued on the ground for what would have been a 100 meters jump, you are literally blind. Kudos on playing a game about cars while blind tho. That takes skill.Update 2: INCREDIBLE! NOW THE FIXED THE GAME! And by that i mean they updated the code of conduct. In a game with no chat.And the usual ""railroaded AI car that sprint more than you and ignore phisics"" is still there in all its glory.And for new cars....we got some electric stuff and nothing much more.WHAT DOES A MAN HAVE TO DO TO HAVE A MERCEDES SLR?

Not that I didn't expect I would since I loved FH4 so much. Overall, the game feels like an improvement compared to FH4 in almost every way. The map is much larger and has a lot more variety compared to the map of Horizon UK. The overall feel of the game, looking the past the connection and stability issues, has been a lovely experience and I am definitely going to play the game till the end of its lifespan. The UI feels a lot cleaner and has less unnecessary elements to it, though I feel they missed out on a few things I'd love to have had that were in FH4. I find it harder to join friends compared to FH4, where it would show a friends name over a icon in the main page of the pause menu. Looking at players you follow for customization is more troublesome (and tuner ranks and such dont seem to work right now) since you gotta be in the festival for it, whereas in FH4 you could look at them anywhere. I also do tend to prefer the old cars tab of FH4, where it had smaller icons for your cars, thus being able to fit more in one screen, although I don't hate this new one at all. On the other hand though, I do like the new car collection thing where you get rewards for having collected cars and are able to quickly buy them through the collection. My issue with it, though, is that it nor the horizon promo do not show the base PI values for each car at the very least, (which makes things troubling if you're like me and end up tuning most if not all of your cars and when you need to have something for some championship, you can't just look at base PI values somewhere to get a better idea for what to build on but honestly, its fine, I can live without it). I do feel like Horizon Super 7 is misplaced. Poor thing is hidden in the creative hub where nobody will look for it (which is a shame cuz it was such a great fun idea to add on to FH4).The soundtrack is... While I think there's a ton of great tracks, I don't think its as good as the one that FH4 had but thats purely my opinion of it and Its not really that big a deal.Gameplay feel has improved. I don't know if its just me but while the physics may be a little wacky, cars seem to feel a good bit more responsive (even a bit too responsive at times... looking at you, Sesto FE, but hey, its an arcade racer lol).For example, they've managed to make RWD and FWD drivetrains a lot better. They do not feel super inferior to AWD anymore in my opinion.Its a little easier to find yourself alone in eliminator than it is in FH4 due to the size of the map which is understandable but its generally a very good time all the same.Horizon tours is one of my favourite things to be added into the game as they allow you to basically play Trials (with reduced difficulty) continuously with different car types and races. My only real issue with is that it currently needs more variety. The cards themselves are great but there should really be more than 1 set of races for each of them. Even with 3 different sets of races would be great for each card because it ends up being kinda boring that while you do still end up having fun driving S1 cross country with anything goes, its always the same 3 races. Speaking of which, freeroam rush (horrible gamemode) has been integrated into the tour which, while I hated it as a racetype in FH4 (bc its so luck based), I'm loving it with the tour. Its real fun to drive from one race to the next one. Perhaps they could make it so that in the future, ignoring big races like goliath and such, each card is just randomized (starts from a random race, then just looks whats the closes next one of the same type up close and has you drive to that one and goes on till you've done 3 races for the tour). Race design overall feels great imo. The way most of the races are designed feels fun. We no longer have dirt races where only 7% of the race is dirt! Hooray! The cross country and dirt races especially are some of the most fun races in the game, with the ones up the volcano being some of my favourites. PR stunts feel pretty good, although I find some of the drift zones a little... eh, compared to the ones in FH4, which is a shame bc a lot of my time in FH4 was spent on drift zones but there's lot to love here. They're all good fun. I love the addition of accolades and trailblazers (finally) to FH5. Those were some of the peak stuff from FH4's DLCs that I felt shoulda been a part of the game in the first place. Accolades give you a ton of stuff to chase for in the game. Even if you dont much care for the accolade score, I personally find it very satisfying to see those accolade completed things pop up on the screen (not to mention that a lot of them have great names, I love that!)Festival playlist, while being generally more or less the same, offering much of the same things as it previously did, now has a new progress system, counting points instead of percentage for progress and showing you how much each activity nets you progress. On top of that though, there's new stuff like the treasure hunts (no million credit drops like in fortune island though... C'mon PG, you can afford to give players more than just like 50k for that... even 100k would go a long way), the horizon open challenges and the eliminator challenges, which are a welcome addition, not to mention that there'll be player created eventlabs stuff starting from S3, which is gonna be exciting as well as showcase remixes and featured story chapters in the future seemingly.Events lab is awesome! The addition of Events lab gives course-creating and building up custom races a tons of new options. The addition of props is pretty much expected, but the budget for the lab seems pretty crazy from my own experiences with it. You can add like a fences and stuff and still be nowhere near the limit. Not to mention that beyond the props, there are the race rules that you can mess with to make effects for the race or even completely new rules as we've seen in the festival playlist a few times already. Its really exciting what can be done about it but my one complaint about is that you can't edit a track once its been finished once. Huge bummer if you end up testdriving the track and find out that you forgot something or that you placed something wrong.  Customization has its ups and downs. The loss of Rocket Bunny has left a good few cars without the bodykits that were so memorable on prior titles (RIP RCF and that WANG lol), but on the other hand, there's a bunch of new bodykits to love, like the KRC and TPC ones for the '92 RX-7. Outside of bodykits and such, basically all of the cars that were ported over from FH4 had their PI values adjusted and the PI system seems to work differently in some ways in general. The addition of more tire compound choices is especially something I am very grateful as it allows for a whole lot more customization (Driving hypercars in S1 is dummy fun, especially cross country!). In terms of livery customization though, while the livery customizer has certainly improved from FH4, I can't reaaaally forgive that they hyped up the new editor to be similar to like photoshop and such only for it to nab some basic elements from editors of the kind, though it is understandable to some effect.The carlist as of right now has plenty of great cars. basically most of the interesting ones from FH4 (Where's I.D. R tho?) and a whole lot more interesting ones coming. I for one am real excited to drive that XJ220S TWR. I ended up hitting the maximum limit for a review. Had a lot more to say but guess not lol. Too bad.Anyway, great game! love it!"

I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?original review:why you WONT buy this game1. AI is cheating. unreasonably fast. huge different between ""highly skilled"" and ""above average""2. Connection problem. Connection suddenly broken in the middle of the event. Also, sometime it shows ""unable to join the session"".3. Narrow wheel controller angle. only have 180degree (if ur take it serious, go buy other sim)why you BUY this game1. Graphic is great,  (but more hungry than FH4)2. Tune car, comparing other cars sim,racing game, not much game can do the paint job and swap part for car.3. Good community? multiplayer, this remind me ""need for speed world"", you can roam and randomly race with sb on the map. chillhonestly, review is very subjective. why not try it and refund it (or keep it)?

But I intend to review the game and my experiences vs. just spouting of my opinions about it. For the impatient amongst us: this is  one of the best racing games in my Steam library. Not perfect, but oh so darn close!I haven't seen any better start to a game than this...  you're  dropped into the game and by doing so you'll also get a solid first impression of the general racing types it provides: from street / circuit races on tarmac (""asphalt"") right down to rally racing and let's not forget the rough offroad challenges either!But first, for those unfamiliar with the series: what's Forza Horizons? Forza is Microsoft's flagship game when it comes racing. Forza is to Microsoft what 'Gran Turismo' is to Sony.  though is an open world with a more casual approach to the racing genre. It has simulation options for tweaking your cars, and there's plenty here to make your racing life seriously challenging. But at the same time the overal focus of the game is on an ""arcadish"" gameplay where fun and excitement go absolutely first. And boy, oh boy did they deliver on that!Horizons then is  an in-game racing festival where the organization went completely overboard by boldly reserving a  chunk of land to host all their festivities in. 24/7. Going by storyline there are cameras and radio relays everywhere which makes it possible for the general public to basically follow every driver they're interested in. Of course that's storyline; it basically boils down to you, being a driver, becoming part of the racing event of a lifetime. And it'll be up to you to decide how you're going to experience all this.The general idea is simple: explore the massive landscape and go find the races and challenges which mostly appeal to you. Win, earn credits and get better. This game has it all... from street races (with or without traffic!) to challenging offroad races where you'll have to fight both your opponents for your place in the field as well as the elements to keep your car on the road. And more... don't be alarmed if you drive across the road minding your own business when suddenly... <flash>, you've been snapped! No, don't worry about a speeding ticket, instead worry about not passing this section of road fast enough for you to qualify ;) Or... just don't bother of course if you don't want to. The choice is always yours to make.Now, in order to race you're going to need some cars. And Horizons provides! oh dear... First you'll get a car for every racing type that's available, but that's only the beginning. As you progress into the game you'll unlock other cars as well. You can go ""car hunting"": trying to find a barn where a car wreckage is hidden (which, fortunately for you, your mechanic can fix up!) or... you can try your luck with the wheelspin: a chance game where you can win grand prizes, such as ... new cars.And then there's the car shop where you can buy new or used cars. And don't forget about the car auctions either! This is a  cool feature IMO because it allows you to sell your car(s) to the highest bidder. Or... try to place a bid on a car yourself while hoping that no-one outbids you.Once you have a collection you can always change into a different car every time you want.Houses then are landmarks where you can ""relax"" and sort things out with the events and your character (like customizing your character with new stuff). While they definitely look nice you can't really interact with them, so don't expect to get access to garages or garage boxes which might showcase some of your cars. At best you can consider these houses points for fast travel and to get full access to the game customization options. And... they're also rewards which will grant you a perk, depending on which house you got and have set as your home.Besides, sleep is for the weak, there are races and events to be done! :PWhen you're in freeroam cruising around you'll come across other players. Don't worry; they're sillouettes at best so you don't have to worry about running into them. Of course... you're always free to challenge someone to a race to see who's best ;)  Events then provide you with races to do and it'll be fully up to you how you want to approach them... either you go solo and take on the AI drivers, or you can (sometimes) hop into co-op or pvp mode where you'll work together or against other players. The game has it all!What I personally enjoyed the most about the Horizon series (I also played 4) is that you can fully decide on your difficulty settings. And gradually make things harder on yourself. By doing so you'll also get some extra difficulty bonusses when you win some of your races. For example, right now I don't play with a line that always marks the best place on the road (I only use these in corners to indicate braking points) and I've also set my damage to simulation vs. cosmetic only.But as is common for this game: you're  in full control!  Did you slam into an obstacle and now your car is almost totalled? No problem! You can just hit rewind, take the race back to a point before your crash and then try to avoid it. Or... you could also consider just dealing with it to see where it leads you to. Your race, your choices.No, this game isn't perfect, there are plenty of issues going from small to big that still need to be resolved, but I have full confidence that it's being worked on. There's also the issue that not everyone will be directly affected. I've read stories about people suffering from the game crashing on them while I haven't had any issues with that at all. So... your milage may vary, as the saying goes.But honestly?  This game truly comes close,  close to perfection and one way or the other can definitely be considered a masterpiece of its own. If you enjoy cars, if you enjoy driving and ""experiencing"" cars then I really think you're going to have the time of your life here. It doesn't only have to be about races and fast driving you know... what about taking a beetle (Volkswagon Beetle) out for a relaxing drive around the countryside where you simply admire the massive landscape of Mexico stretching out before you?Of course... it's also perfectly possible to grab a Ferrari, Lamborghini or maybe a McLaren or whatever other sportscar you fancy and just start burning some rubber. Or maybe you're more into getting a huge four wheel drive and go cross country straight through swamps or dense jungle terrain? Or maybe a desert is more to your liking while you're imagining to be in the Paris - Dakar rally?One way or the other I cannot help but be convinced that you're going to be blown away by the atmosphere of this game, just like I was. I  recommend getting this game. Unfortunately I cannot give it the two thumbs up it deserves because... then I fear crashing into something!  Don't review & drive kids! ;)Thank for reading!"

However. It's one of my favorite titles even then. Forza Horizon 5 is an overall great experience if you're like me, and don't get bored by just playing the game, even if at this number of hours, where progression feels like it no longer exists, it's a great buy for veteran gearheads and student drivers alike. Most of the engines sound great, the tuning and driving feel good and engaging, and unless you're someone who tunes at least 2 cars a day like myself, there's plenty of cars to choose from. The balancing leaves a bit to be desired, as there's always just a set and defined ""meta"" in these games. With all that said. I'd recommend it, but.. wait for a sale. The online community will probably make you want to slam your router in the trash then go cry in the car if you're new."

Graphics are gorgeous. Terrain and race tracks are much more varied and characterful. They seem to have fixed the issues with convoys and multiplayer queues crashing (we used to average around one race every hour trying to play competitive in a convoy). Tons of stuff to do for everybody whether that be drifting, road racing, or just roaming around and exploring. So many positive things it's hard to overstate how impressed I am.The reason I have to vote ""no"" right now is the most important aspect of any racing game... the racing. Right now the game is making such an attempt to be new-user friendly that what you actually do in a race really has no real impact. It doesn't matter if you carefully upgrade a track weapon, lovingly tune it, and then drive like a zen master. You will do exactly as well as someone who takes a car without upgrades and just barrels around the track wildly, crashing into every wall and corner. The AI will also ""smooth"" their performance to how well you are doing. Did you bring a 260 mph top speed missile? Every AI driver will be able to do 265, even in tiny little cars with a quarter of your horsepower that are designed to be nimble instead of fast. Did you bring a darty little car and plan to earn places in the corners? Every AI will take that same corner flat out, even when in massive muscle cars that should struggle to complete gentle corners.When every car feels roughly the same, when your level of effort and knowledge in building them don't matter, and when how you drive them has no real impact in how you place, then what's the point?I'm really hoping this is an initial bug to be worked out. If the situation improves, I will JOYFULLY recommend this game. But until that happens, be aware that a twelve year old picking up the controller for the very first time will be actively competitive against someone with 1000+ hours of racing experience under their belt. May as well just watch gameplay videos at that point."

But I can't recommend it, because for me it's horizon 4 with a new map.I think the game mostly improved in the areas where it was already good, and became only worse in it's weak spots.So at this moment I believe that it makes more sense to buy horizon 4 with discount.Pros:Basically all the pros of horizon 4, so I keep it short.+ Graphics is great.+ Car sounds are good. Soundtrack is okay.+ Plenty of cars.+ Flexible tuning.+ Large map.Cons:- No feeling of progression at all. Game just throws at you the best cars in first 20 hours of gameplay. You can open almost everything from a wheelspins without do a single race. In a race game.- AI. Maybe it was the same in Horizon 4, but in this game it looks so fake. Many times I have a situation when I overtake all the drivatars, and they just form a train and ride like this (one after another on exactly the same line) till the finish. So they don't even try to imitate the real race and competition. And yes, they don't care about the game physics. If race has a jumps or water in it, drivatars have a huge advantage, because the terrain doesn't affect their cars.- ""YoU'rE a SuPeRsTaR!!!111"". It is way too much this time. All these radio announcements sound so unnatural, you are praised for absolutely everything. They don't reward, they just cause facepalms.- Stories are mostly meaningless and dialogs are weird. In one of the stories there is a phrase like ""Why people don't like sandstorms?! They're so fun!"". I mean there should be a line somewhere in being so optimistic and positive, right? Horizon has so great potential for a proper singleplayer campaign, but it's just a waste of time now.- Constant interruptions. New adventure! New wheelspin! New level after a race! Dancing before the race (WHY?)! Dancing after a race (WHY?)!- I can't say much about the online, because it constantly disconnects me, I was able to complete only a few races. And I still can't find an option to find a race in a specific class. It's so frustrating. Why I can't choose a race type and a car class so I can drive my favourite car in online race?"

The folks who developed this game also managed to overhaul progression by quite a bit. IF you thought Forza Horizon 4 was a beast with all the different ways to progress, you have not seen anything yet. And the new modes they've thrown in are crazy fun. Can it be overwhelming getting started? Yes. Is it still fun? Absolutely. They managed to make things like the stories better and more engaging, by giving each discipline their own unique little story, and even giving more personality to your driver. The stories also are a good way to get accustomed to the different disciplines if you are a Forza Horizon newcomer, so definitely don't skip those early on.Weekly seasonal events are also still a thing, but they've tweaked them a bit. For example, you earn points instead of percentages. And you also now have car restrictions for seasonal PR stunts, which will make things a lot more interesting when completing them. For example, your PR stunt for a speed trap will not work by cheesing it with a 599 XX Evo anymore each season, and will now call for you to use a specified type of car. While some a small few may not like this, I'm sure others will enjoy it, as it will sort of give you more incentive to explore more types of cars. I personally grabbed the Premium Edition, and I think that is well worth it. But even if you grab only the standard or Deluxe, there is still a ton of content day 1 to get you started. However, if you look forward to the expansion packs, just grab the Premium now and get it over with. The savings are more than worth the extra $40 usd. On top of that, you get a boat load of extras besides the expansions, such some cool VIP perks, tons of extra cars, and more. And the cars are absolutely amazing this time around. I mean they've always been amazing, but I think they actually managed to make them look even better this time. And some nice tweaks too, such as improved tire smoke, improved engine audio, and even for a select few cars, functional convertibles. Sadly the convertible option is not for all actual convertibles, but it is there for some.  Mexico is the latest venue for Horizon, which has seen many other locations in the past.  Last outing we had a fictionalized tour of Great Britain, but while something felt oh so right, something also felt lacking. The Britain map was no doubt fun to drive around, but it was not that fun to actually look at. It sometimes had a dreary look to it Even at times the radio announcers would joke about this. Not compared at least to something like Forza Horizon 3, which was absolutely fun to look at. Bright, cheery, tropical, and just a blast to look at. But when playing 4, something seemed lacking in 3, 3 felt kind of, well, flat compared to 4. which was, well, a much more fun to drive around map. Lots of elevation. I don't know if that makes sense, so let me sum that up. 3 was amazing to look at. 4 was fun to drive on. Well, 5 manages to to get the best of both, and go bigger than both at the same time. The map is roughly 1.5x bigger than Forza Horizon 4. There are tons of elevated spots. Like massively elevated. Hell, there's a freaking Volcano in the game! There's sand dunes to go off roading on near a massive sprawling beach. Desert areas full of cactus to smash through. Latin inspired villages and towns. Tons of tunnels to rip through. Jungles! Ancient temples to drive around. There's just so much, and it is all gorgeous to look at, and most importantly fun to drive around. Note: Now for those who grab the game today, keep in mind, the game is still early, and you will probably experience some bugs (even some crashes), as a lot early access testers have talked about, but the folks at PGG/T10 have acknowledged these issues and are working on a patch to drop either tonight or over the next couple of days. They've already fixed some things, such as server issues that were problematic early on. So at least they are not sitting on their rears doing nothing."

Don't bother, just buy an older horizon game. Forza horizon 5 excels in areas previous titles lacked and fails in areas the franchise had previously mastered. Car customization, map scale and track design are all excellent. The problem comes from the AI. As someone who played most previous titles forza 1 - horizon 3 on the top difficulty settings I expected the typical AI design but was instead met with the rubber banding of a typical ubisoft racing game release. The mechanics directly punish you for doing better as the AI gets shorter lap times whenever you do. This is further worsened by the fact that each race regardless of track size is flooded with AI racers that follow the exact on rails driving line. The AI brakes, turns and accelerates so similarly that every race feels like you are competing against a bullet train. You will NEVER beat an AI off the line since they have godmode acceleration for the first 5 seconds, and they will take corners at double the speed a player could realistically take. AI cars hit speeds normally unbachieveable at the class. To win a race, the strategy is to banzai bomb straight for the corner, and then aggressively block the AI for the remainder of the race. So long as you don't get too far ahead of them they wont gain rubber band acceleration and the AI all but shuts off."

Why on earth do I need more than 8gb vram in 1080p with maxed out settings? - Keep in mind that sometimes there is memory leak and you will have to restart the game in order to play with stable fpsThe game is almost 1 year old and devs still haven't resolved any of the above issues.."

Hot Wheels expansion is amazing, lots of things to do and you ultimately have free roam from the get-go, giving you the freedom to do whatever you want without worrying about story progression. Community liveries can be really impressive and you may find yourself sinking hours customizing and tuning your cars. Many exclusives available for collectors, and you can even find custom-painted ones being auctioned by japanese artists.I'll occasionally get some visual artifacts when playing on my PC which was only fixed by restarting the game, but otherwise it runs pretty much flawlessly. On the low graphic settings, it's also able to run a stable 30-40 fps on my steam deck, though with the DLCs installed it takes a huge chunk of storage (>130GB)."

And the cars you can win through festival playlist are also 80% dlc cars from Horizon 4. Alot of bugs in the beginning and still to this day. And still not even 1 dlc release to this day (The game has been out for almost 7 months). Pretty upsetting when you buy the ultimate version wich is €100. I think it just gets really repetitive for me. Can't enjoy it as much as Horizon 2 and 3.

There is also so much to do from races ranging from dirt, to track races to challenges & stories in-game that there is always something to do in game.

No. Do not buy right now. The game itself is brilliant, and once the servers are working properly, I would 100% recommend.

I might buy again in the future, as I liked the game, but as for now, it's more of a statement to refund than wait around. Who knows when a fix will come, and when one does, who knows what will even be fixed. As for now, avoid the game, and thank you Steam for understanding and refunding.EDIT #2Their Twitter support has just tweeted that a hotfix is coming 'later this week' that will address• Crashing• Wheel problems• Connection IssuesStill no specifics on what will be fixed.These issues started on 5th.

This game is a blast. It's everything I could have asked for. See my original review below and see why I have so many rewards. -UPDATE: I got the game to run. Had to perform a thorough uninstall of my antivirus and disable several apps to get it working. Not sure what exactly caused it to work.Man, there are a lot of comments and awards here. Thanks to everyone trying to be helpful. For those reading between the lines and understanding that I just want devs to be held to higher standards, you're all based epic kings.I am keeping this review negative because things like this shouldn't be ""known issues"" on launch day. Especially with a soft launch a week in advance. Once this issue is fixed and I deem the game good, I will change it. No one (read: no one) should be making drastic configuration changes to their system to play a game. It's a PC game this stuff comes with the territory, I get it. But these guys are making what is supposed to be a polished Triple-A gem.That all being said I am having -fun- so far, like I knew I would. Be weary buying this one right off the bat, or try it with a Game Pass trial.-Original review below-I'd sure love to play this game... one that I happily paid full price for. Why is it that common apps are stopping this game from launching on certain PCs? That's my issue. It's not running. Yes, I see that there are fixes, but it's late on *full* launch night and I work in the morning. When did we become okay with this sentence being written on an OFFICIAL support page?""We would suggest disabling ... any overclocking, hardware monitoring, streaming, recording, and any nonessential apps while you play the game.""FIX YOUR GAME. No devs would ever get away with this level of idiocy 15 years ago. I hope to revise this review to a thumbs up, but there better be a patch out with a quickness."

Forza Horizon 5 was my introduction to the Forza series.  I wasn't sure what to expect from it, but it looked like a fun open-world driving game, and I wanted to try it out.The graphics are stunning, Mexico looks absolutely beautiful.  The cars look great with excellent attention to detail.  There's a huge range of cars to earn (>500) by completing various races, events, stories, accolades etc.  Some are also RNG rewards that you can win through Wheelspins.  Car customisation via upgrades and tuning options are great to experiment with to find the right set-up for your favourite cars.  I absolutely *love* this feature personally, but for those who don't, there's also community creations that you can use instead.  You're also able to create your own liveries with endless possibilities.  I also love this feature, although my favourite cars are almost all sprayed purple with black wheels and tinted windows... I have a type, okay! :) As for the story, it was meh.  Not memorable, some very tedious moments with non-skippable cutscences.  However, it encourages to explore parts of the map you may not otherwise experience.  I generally opt for more simulator-type games, i.e. realistic driving.  This game definitely does not fall in to that category, it's leans more towards the arcade-y style... and that's fine!  After a hard day at work / college, it's stupidly fun to drive around like a lunatic destroying fences, drifting, super high speed, big jumps etc. all while earning points and combos to gain fast XP.  It's even more fun with friends!  The tracks are decent and offer lots of variety in racing styles from drifting to circuit to rally.  The EventLab feature allows players to create their own tracks.  This is great fun - people's creativity will never cease to amaze me.A lot of the negative reviews I've read mention issues with performance.  It's been fine for me, just one stuttering issue in ~38 hours of gameplay.  No crashes at all.  I didn't experience connection issues to friends / other players either.TL;DR - Great game if you're looking for a fun, open-world driving experience.  Lots of styles of racing and tonnes of cars to choose from.  Looks incredible.  Lots to do.  8/10 for the fun factor."

Unfortunately, the multiplayer is horrible, it feels like it wasn't made by people capable of rational though, and it's been made for 3 year-olds.- Multiplayer is absolutely horrible. It's nice having random people drive around in your world, but there is so little of them. Unless you're on the highway, near the volcano, or at the festival you won't be meeting many people. There is this awesome thing they advertised so much called ""Horizon arcade"" that consists of, get this, 3 WHOLE GAME MODES!! Those are, team king, survival, capture the flag... or crash opponents 1, crash opponents 2, crash opponents 3. You do this twice and you're fed up with it, and fed up with people leaving your team after round 1, so you're stuck going 2v6. Online racing is either: you have the OP car so you're racing in the front or you have the non-OP car so you're stuck getting rammed in the back. Including when all players are on the same team against AI. Still getting rammed by teammates.- Creating your own events. This was also advertised as a great amazing fun thing. It really isn't. There is no option to save what you made, so if you want to make something worth while you either sit down for 10 hours straight or just not do it. These events are constantly shoved in your face, at random. So there is this thing, Super 7, it's 7 random community challenges that you have to beat. I did this once, and never again. Every. Single. One of them was just hold gas, drive straight, and jump and then ""WOAH you actually beat the distance you were supposed to jump, incredible job! Would you like to like this challenge???"". One would think that they would feature some actually worth while creations but nope.- Livery and designs. Oh boy, this is where the PG3 comes to play. Anything MILDLY sexual will get you banned. a sticker on the car that says CarHub that looks like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ logo? Yep ban. A sticker saying ""free VBucks""? Yep ban. An anime chick with giant breasts and barely any clothing? Nope, seems fine to me. Best thing about this is that they never tell you any of this stuff is banned, and even promote those liveries. When buying a car you get taken straight to a page with user created liveries to chose from. I bought the BMW Isetta, and the first recommended livery was the CarHub one. I used it for 1 day until a friend told me i can get banned for it, at which point i removed it. 5 months later i get banned for sexual content, which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me over in the last day of a month long grind for an achievement. So i can redo it all again. Promoting bannable liveries and then banning people for using them, without telling them you can get banned for something like that. Hipocrisy at it's finest.- If the game is made for 3 year-olds why is the main reward mechanic a literal slot machine huh?- The games AI is some of the stupidest AI i've ever seen. At first i started at ""Above Average"" difficulty, and thought ""cool, the more i play the better i am, the higher i can make the difficulty, and the more rewards i get"", except, nope. The higher the difficulty, the more made up the stats of AI cars are. They accelerate from 0 to 100 in 0.2 seconds. They take a corner at 250km/h, they slow down from 250 to 40 in 0.2 seconds. It's so horrible. But to be fair it doesn't really matter, higher difficulty makes you get more money per race, but 99% of your money comes from the the aforementioned PG3 slot machines, so it's alright.- General bullshitting. They included lots of assists you can turn on in difficulty settings, Which is nice, if 3 year-olds actually play this game they have it easier. Except, they made the assists so damn strong, a blind person could play the game, literally. Most popular strat to playing the game? 50 laps of the longest race, place the controller in a way where it constantly accelerates, and go to bed. But the devs don't like this. Which makes me wonder why they implemented those assists in the first place, and why they haven't done anything about it for 5 months.- Information shown by the game is wrong in 99% of the time. ""This race can only be done in this class of cars"" so i click on allowed cars list, pick one, upgrade it, take it into the race, it doesn't allow me to take it. So i take some random car instead. Teammate next to me is using the car i wasn't allowed to use. Or, ""use SUV for this one thing"", took a car from the SUV list, did that thing, didn't count. Had to look up a guide and pick what car they were using in order to finish it. Basically if there is a challenge to do, just go to google, look it up, follow the steps one by one to avoid any stupid broken game design, and you might be able to complete the challenges.- The characters are the most annoying people i've ever seen in a game, unless you are the target audience, a 3 year old child.I already spent 100 euros on the game, and to be fair it's fun driving around your dream cars in the map. But is that worth spending so much money on? Looking back at it, no, it really isn't, especially with the way you get treated by Microsoft, but i should have known that."

Many others have the same problem since the release of the Donut media update. My biggest problem with Forza is that they really love to recycle old cars that no one cares about and should have already been in the game at launch. The new cars Forza also adds are ones no one asked for and are never used, i can think of countless cars the would be amazing to add to the game, nissan stagea, nissan laurel, toyota chaser, lexus is300, the list can go on. Lastly their story modes are cringy boring and don't last long and aren't that intriguing, example, hot wheels, and i constantly hear the donut media story in all the exciting ether."

Some parts feel more arcade, others more sim.. it's like they're trying to mix Horizon and Motorsport.If you think the vehicles understeer too much, set your steering to sim under difficulty settings. Even for dirt and cc races it feels alot better, not getting the same ""sim twitches"" as back in FH4."

There is just sooooooo much to it.                                   At heart Forza Horizon 5 is an open world racing game, with an added online component and a huge map, you can freely explore, which offers a ton of variety. No matter if you enjoy Street Racing, Off-Road or Drifting the most, there is an environment for you and a ton of events that go along with it. Beside all this I never touched a racing game that offered so many different vehicles and tuning opportunities. Thankfully there are pre-set configurations, also from the community, that you can use. But if you want to fine tune everything to the smallest detail by yourself, you can do that as well of course.                    The game looks absolutely stunning, definitely the most beautiful racing game I’ve played so far. So is the audio, the cars sound great, the music is good, there is a DJ in the radio has some good lines (which can also be turned off) Absolutely no complains there. So far I experienced some game crashes which happened randomly, so sadly no idea what causes them. But beside this Forza runs super smooth on high on my pretty old pc with constantly 60fps. They did a great job in the optimization from what I can tell.     The option menu is vast, there are countless options for audio, gameplay, difficult and graphics. You can fine tune the game to your machine. Forza 5 also has an own benchmark to check if you run into any issues. The game also offers a ton of accessibility options, which is really nice. It’s great to see that most newer games offer these now, so everyone can enjoy our lovely hobby to its fullest.      To make it short, Forza Horizon 5 is one of the best racing games on the market right now, and offers content for every kind of racing fan. The World is huge and offers a lot of variety, there are more cars than you can count and the sound design is fantastic. If you’re even remotely a fan of the racing game genre, you should absolutely give Forza Horizon 5 or you will miss out on a great experience."

I am someone who has played every single Forza game coming back from Forza Motorsport 3.Forza Horizon has just become a game only-for-kids, on one hand this is absolutely amazing - but on the other hand, the other Horizon games also tailored to kids in its own aspect. Have you ever went back and watched cartoons from your childhood? Do you ever notice how now that you're older, you understand some different jokes? Forza Horizon was kinda like that, it appealed to kids by being easy to pick up, fun to drive around with friends/AI, having their own jokes and it was one of the few games doing something .I would really like to recommend this game, but only due to its predecessors, if you get the chance to try out any other FH game, go for it. Forza Horizon 5 completely removed any idea of progression and throws you into the game as a ""superstar"" from the previous Forza Horizon game, which isn't too bad, but from the little time I have on this game(60 hours at the time of writing), I have over $25m and 500+ cars. I recently launched the game after about 2 weeks of not playing and I was given over 40 Super Wheelspins. They literally give you handouts for everything. I can guarantee you will never have to purchase a car from the Auction House or the Autoshow. I've completed the ""campaign"", all story missions and explored most of the map. The map is supposed to be ""massive and full of life"" but between the online reliability and lack of traffic even when it is there, most of the map is just boring. They have evenly spaced out cities, all with a single ""quirk"" about them and nothing else.The story is forced, lacking emotion and the devs are so out of touch on the cultures they're trying to re-create that it's actually insulting. I guess according to Playground, Mexico is literally only uncles building 70's VW Beetles, nothing else. Where's the focus on drag racing on the streets, meeting up with friends and baja'ing in the desert? Where's the tuned and riced out cabbies? This game has so much potential to be apart of one of the best racing game series ever.The only way I can recommend this game is if you purely want an open-world, fun-handling racing game where you don't have to grind (At all); but to me that isn't fun, the fun part of games like Need for Speed and Forza Horizon is actually going through the story, having to progress to unlock new parts or cars, and enjoy the immersion."

There's no progression. You don't feel like you're achieving anything. You're not overcoming challenges. The game just feeds everything to you right from the start and only a few hours in I felt like I'd already seen it all. You know when you do a cheat code to unlock everything and turn on god mode, and it's cool for a little while but then you realise there's nothing left to do and it's actually not that fun? Forza Horizon 5 feels like that right from the start. You start with a tricked out Corvette and a sick rally car. About every thirty minutes the in game lottery will give you a new car and about half of them are also top class cars. Right from the start. There's six classes (D, C, B, A, S1, S2) and you START with S1 and A cars. The bottom three classes are basically meaningless unless you... want to do slow races, or something? There's no progression up from slow to fast, you just start at fast.Not that it matters! Almost all the races let you enter with any car and will pick matching opponents for you. There's no need to get faster cars to play the harder events and progress that way. No, you just show up in WHATEVER, and then just participating gets you 75% of the possible progression points (""accolade points"") that event has. Winning gets you the other 25%, which feels insignificant and is entirely unnecessary to actually progress, so why bother?The open map challenges are much the same. Three levels of difficulty to achieve - and you start equipped to very easily get two stars on all of them.The game becomes a very bland grind of driving around the map to do unchallenging and unsatisfying activities just to tick them off the list. It's so dull.It's a real shame, because it does look gorgeous and the car controls actually feel great, but that's not enough by itself. I'd rather go play NFS Heat, which is also gorgeous and plays great but ALSO has meaningful big-picture gameplay."

This is an utter joke now. What on earth happened to the team for Horizon 5? There has been so many changes and so many setbacks, that I'm actually starting to get annoyed and concerned.It's quite clear that there is absolutely zero consideration and engagement with the community. Most, if not all of these issues wouldn't be here otherwise. It was the biggest release for Microsoft so they have made their money. So why would PG care about the community and player retention with no micro-transactions to milk us with.I love Forza Horizon, I really do. But at this rate, I'm questioning on what's going to happen at the end of all this and I regret shelling out the money for the Premium Edition. Horizon 5 has been a mess, and I'm sad to see it go this way.- Cheating leaderboard times are still there.- Cheaters/hackers aren't punished.- Random mass player bans for ""offensive"" liveries whilst the cheaters have free reign over leaderboard times.- No ranked races because losing hurts my safe space. - Removal of wheelspins and super wheelspins from car mastery tree.- Super wheelspins now have 1, 2, and 5k ""rewards""...- Super wheel spin cash prizes are capped at 300k. - Unnecessary, tedious grind for all players and a big kick in the teeth for newer players to earn money. - Basic bug fixes from day 1 still aren't fixed. i.e. The game still stutters after any loading screen, or challenging a new player in The Eliminator. - Engine sounds cut out and stutter when navigating around any section of the vehicle upgrades. - All transparent surfaces are blacked out on the vehicle thumbnails. - Only two convertible cars actually have a convertible animation. - They removed online team, ranked and custom adventureAbsolutely pathetic."

The driving is tight and responsive, not floating too far off either end of the sim-cade tightrope and striking an excellent balance with how the cars feel in weight and grip. (Most of) The tracks are engaging and a blast to rip through in a majority of cars and performance classes and the open world is varied enough in surface and style to always have somewhere else to go or a new style to try. The cars, even with so few actually new inclusions are still well detailed and the sound improvement over Horizon 4 is tenfold.Yet in good faith I cannot recommend this game to anyone, despite singing it's praises above.The core of the game while still indisputably Horizon is hollow and of little extra substance than Horizon 4. Campaign? Even more unengaging than the previous entry. Chocked full of style and cultural references without having any point or driving force, no escalation in car type or class and a story so forgettable it retroactively makes 4's look better by comparison. It's basically a sandbox and while everything is done well or at the least passably there's just no incentive to experience anything but what they railroad you in to with regards to the story.Online? Still absolutely plagued by the previous entry's problems, some even exacerbated throughout this entry.Load times have been made somehow even longer even on ssd, and chances are half your lobby is gone by the time the race actually loads. The convoy system constantly breaks and splits your party or makes them invisible or a plethora of other issues that weren't even present in FH4. The world system somehow feels even emptier even with the same amount of players, none are to be found roaming or racing along the highway or doing much of anything really, might as well be playing horizon solo. The racing? Again plagued by the issues of it's predecessor. The lead ai on higher difficulties getting rubber banding from p1 all the way to the finish and lower difficulties being absolutely pointless if you have access to any way of steering your car at all. As for online racing it's basically flipping a coin on if your opponents have functioning brake keys, constantly using cars in front and walls to take corners instead, which I can't even blame them for as there's piss all incentive to race cleanly or for anything but 1st. While the collision detection system has been improved from fh4, ghosting players much more frequently it doesn't do anything to mitigate the issue as at the next corner without any repercussion your opponent can just attempt to barrel into you or a wall with minimal issue, even in team races.Cars are again being drip fed through content which for the most part isn't a bad thing, but there's so few new additions you're basically playing to get cars that they removed from fh4 for no discernible reason half the time. The customization has been improved and although still meager is better than previous offerings. The paint and vinyl system is still fantastic and the community always has excellent designs on offer (as long as they don't get banned for being funny or having any ethnic iconography).Open world activities and timed lap rivals are infested with cheaters, any seasonal car is hoarded and sold for max price on the auction house making it unobtainable for the average player without some decent luck or a massive time investment to grind out the money. Event Lab while plagued by low effort content also has some amazing tracks and ideas by the community and is by far the best way to enjoy this sandbox racing experience.It pains me to have to be so harsh on the game but with such little innovation and constant issues there's not much of a reason to pick it over horizon 4 unless you've already played that one and even then this just feels like an expansion of that game.There's a great game core here, there really is but it's mired in a box without a soul. Just go buy fh4 instead, because this game is much of the same with even less charm."

If you don't have a car game community around you to play this game with, don't buy this.However, if you care about messing around with cars, tuning them to bits, drifting for high-scores, hotlapping, etc. then absolutely go for this thing. Just be aware that this game is not created through passion and drive, this is a market research product made with crunch through-and-through.There is no soul here, just one-size-fits-none and toxic positivity. It permeates this game.Good (in my opinion):- Tuning- Car selection- Physics- Trial racing- Rivals- Volcano roadsBad (in my opinion):- Lack of progression and meaning- Character cast is sterile and positive unto death- Limited scope of fun things to do on your own- Festival playlist (FOMO)- Zone instancing (world feels empty online)- Map emptiness (feels like a tourist brochure, not a place where people live)Details:The positives of this game is the sheer amount of cars available, the physics, the driving and the tuning. I love how much you can mess with a car and that most every single tuning slider has a noticeable effect on how you must drive. I like hotlapping and getting better at driving, perfecting sectors and all that jazz. I also would like exploring... if there was anything to explore.The bads are far more weighty than the goods. There is no sense of progression at all and this is the main gripe I see people talk about. This is a sandbox where there is no fun to be had from the top, developer-made excitement. The only excitement is the stress you feel when you know you've not played this week and that there are limited-access cars available that you're gonna miss. This game's entire replay hook is FOMO and it feels so unbelievable disingenuous that I refuse to partake in it. But if not doing the festival playlist, what else is there to do?Nothing. This game is completely void of fun for anyone without a dedicated community of people who want to play this game with them. I don't have that. I'm not a particularly social person online. My friends don't play car games. This means that all the fun I can have in this game is the fun I make myself, since the developer's entire vision is market-research-based and the game is targetted at the youngest of car game players.You know, there would have been something to be had social-wise in this game, but a new feature completely annihilates that aspect: Zone instancing. I thought this was a great idea before release. The game would be more alive because there would be more people per zone, since the game would make sure that every zone would be populated with players, unlike H4's 64 players per server instance being spread all over the map. But this feature is absolutely awful for this kind of game. People you interact with (with no text chat) have a 90% chance of just vanishing into thin air the moment you cross a river because you're sent to separate zone instances. The map literally feels more alive when you're driving around in offline mode.The map itself has some good parts. It feels interesting for the first few days of playing. The big mountain and the roads leading there, Guanajuato, the hotel area, Playa Azul and the canyon, all pretty places for sure. But I found myself missing something quite soon. The map is... a tourist brochure. It is so perfectly procured to give you a sense of 'Mexico at its peak' that it feels sterile. There is nothing happening anywhere on the map at any time, ever. The entirety of Guanajuato feels like it exists in a separate dimension where robots take care of the roads and houses. It feels so squeaky, digitally clean that you can't imagine anyone living anywhere in the city. Combine that with the absolutely awful and non-stop cheeriness of the cast and you've got a world that you can't connect with in any way, shape or form. It doesn't feel like it was made by humans for humans. It was made by market researchers for stockholders. It was made to ship units. The map is big just to be a selling point.So are most of the main changes made to 'progression' from H4. A large point made during the run-up to release was the way you unlock events and festival sites. You do some stuff, rank up and eventually you get a point you can spend to unlock a new part of the game. Sound fun, like something to do. But this is over in the first few days you play and it doesn't feel like progression. It doesn't feel good or even bad. It just is. You'll unlock almost every single race event immediately (another selling point, actually) and then it's just... accolade grinding. Or story mission grinding. Or, as it will be eventually for everyone, festival playlist grinding.There's more I could say here but others have said those things better. I'm gonna end this text wall here. I will still play this game once in a while, just to scratch that itch created by NFS Underground 2 and that era of car gaming. But I can't recommend this game to anyone who likes stories or meaning in games. If you like cars, go for it; this is the absolutely best CAR game of this style ever made.However, I'm getting more depressed every time I boot up the game to find something cool and fun to do with all these cars. My eyes are now scanning the horizon, looking for the next big thing in open-world racing. Maybe Solar Crown will do something for me, though it looks far too arcadey. We will see."

It takes nearly everything that worked about Horizon 4 and introduces a much larger, more varied, and overall better world to explore and some semblance of structure to its ""campaign"" progression. The racing is as good as it's ever been, the new Horizon Stories have some fun conceits, and the expeditions, while small in number and easily finished off in the opening hours of the game, do sometimes slow down in ways the game doesn't usually foster. It does carry over some UI issues from 4, however, and as of the time of writng, there are many issues regarding servers and performance.Still, this is an excellent game that I'm confident will keep me coming back for the next few years."

Most or all of the things that annoyed me in Horizon 4 are fixed. I should be fawning over this game, trying to get all my friends in on it, but I can't recommend it in its current state. There are so many problems, it's honestly laughable.The game crashes to desktop reliably, often without giving you the courtesy of an error code, and shows generally poor performance despite comfortably exceeding the developers' recommended specs. Online open-world play is basically impossible due to constant network problems, with players disappearing and reappearing around you. Offline open-world play is also undesirable because of brainless AI drivers that get in the way. Glitches and exploits abound and every leaderboard is dominated by blatant cheaters. Even basic features like daily challenges straight up don't work half the time.But the most annoying thing that ruins the game for me is that AI racers cheat by having impossible levels of grip, rather than being any good at actually racing. This is especially prevalent in cross country events where even on middling difficulty settings, an AI driver with a significant lead is uncatchable, because they can take the world's best line and always get perfect traction out of corners and jumps. There is also a powerful rubber-band effect, so you can never quite leave a field behind you. The AI really only reacts to the presence of the player, so they stay in their stupid little racing line, not overtaking, not defending, nothing, for the entire event if you aren't near them. If you play on a high difficulty, they put you in their rear view mirror and you never see them again; if you play on a low difficulty, they're shockingly bad and pose no challenge whatsoever. I understand that programming AI is difficult and processor-intensive, but this just feels bad to play against. The only way to get a decent race is against human players, but every lobby is full of rammers and ragers, so your only option is time attacking, racing other players' ghosts. For such a huge game, it's extremely disappointing.If these problems are addressed, I might change my recommendation later, but at present, if you really have to have an open world racing game, get FH4 instead."

I like to complete every race before moving to the next stage but it almost feels like they got rid of the stages and just dump everything on you at once. Other than that the game is fun.

Quite honestly, this game is a joke and I'm not sure if there are any actual programmers in this studio. Edit: But still, even with it's minor improvements I sunk in like a sucker that I am and I'm not as pissed as I was before.I've only played around 3 hours of 5 and about 400 of 4, to top it off, I played 4 on Xbox One so moving over to PC is already a massive improvement for me.I'll start with the positives, I'll omit graphics as they're obviously better:* Better physics and balancing, especially when it comes to RWD cars. I feel like in the end it'll all boil down to omnipresent AWD conversions, like in 4 and 3, but at least you won't be completely left in the dust if you decided you don't want to put a completely unrealistic conversion in your car. Ad. This is even more significant than I first believed, while it's still not an overhaul or made from scratch, it's really well tuned and gives a lot of joy.* Map looks pretty good, I haven't seen a lot, quite honestly, I've seen more in youtube videos than in my actual gameplay, but it seems really goodAd. After playing for a while longer, I have to say, the new map is really great, with much greater variety and it's slightly bigger as well. I like it more than the UK, though the UK wasn't really done right ( Then again, I know IRL UK quite well while I basically know nothing about Mexico)* Engine sounds are considerably better, comparing from memory sounds from 4 to the few cars I own in both games.* Very well optimized, I've got a pretty high end laptop, AMD 5900HX and a 3070 and it can run this game at extreme settings (higher than ultra) in 1080p at 60 FPS. Later on I'll try it on native res, since I've used an external display, but on the other hand I didn't even switch to turbo mode so it's a positive outlook.Ad. on my laptops native res 2540x1440 it does drop frames here and there, still very smooth, though I dropped as low as 34 frames. Still, it is really well optimized.* The new Horizon adventure is well, not necesarilly a positive due to horrible (HORRIBLE!) dialogue and unskippable cutscenes, but it is something new, gives some guidance and apart from story elements it's quite interesting.Ad. After doing a couple more, not all of them are horribly written, you won't find any sort screenwriting mastery here, it's mostly just bland/silly, but bland and silly is better than some of the atrocities I've witnessed in this game.And now the negatives:* UI is almost exactly the same as in 4, it's not as laggy, but I've played 4 on Xbox One. It's equally slow though, which is infuriating. It's astonishing they still haven't been able to add a simple little tick in the auction house to indicate you own a car and a filter to show only unowned cars. Simply astonishing.* Tuning is the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it was in 4 and if anyone tells you different or you read somewhere that it's better you can immediately disregard any future opinions from that source. It's EXACTLY the same. And as in 4, you can go for style points in terms of visual tuning by opting to use manufacturer parts but only the Forza parts offer tuning. And as before, they look exactly the same,Ad. There are couple more options in regards to suspension tuning, and gearbox tuning (definitely the most significant change, you can choose up to 10-speed transmission and fine tune it), some additions here and there, some things missing (but not much) but still, definitely not ground breaking tuning revolution, it's more or less Horizon 4+.* The Showcases that I've seen are copy pasted from 4.* Unskippable intro, extremely cheesy narration.* They managed to reduce the number of cars and in result, car roster's missing a lot, including such obvious additions as all the Lanzias, not even a Stratos in sight,  or a 98 Dodge Viper GTS, which were present in 4, but instead you can choose a BMW M5, M5, M5, M3, M3 or Audi RS(insert number here), choose your pick. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of cars in the game and you'll find one for yourself easily, but they've cut a lot of vehicles and barely added anything interesting, a Eunos Cosmo would've been interesting for example. Still, there are SOME new additions.* Character customization is a politically correct joke, you can choose implants, hearing aids and your pronoun, but there's only two voices to choose from (one female, one male, independent of the chosen pronoun) and still no facial hair. * I feel like the beginning is drawn out on purpose to give you very little time to get an actual feel of the game. While it's relevant on Steam, I guess not so much with the Game Pass.* You still don't get a single credit if you restart the race on the finishing screen (as in you finished the race, but want to improve your score, so instead of picking continue you choose restart event). This is quite frankly shocking, it was the same in FH4 and IIRC FH3, it just shows that the testers weren't really into the game if they didn't care about this massive time waste.I feel like this is a good moment to underline that this is a AAA game we're talking here in a long running series from a major studio and publisher.I was pissed at 4 that it wasn't enough of an improvement over 3, but damn, now I simply feel I've been fooled and cheated. I also overshot my refund window, though I feel like I could still get a refund cause it doesn't work on the Steam Deck right off the bat currently, even though it says it's playable in the store and I specifically purchased it from Steam to be able to play on SD hassle free, though all in all I think I'll keep it as I'm a little starved for Horizon and traveled 4's UK far and wide.To sum it all up, I'm sure I'll get a lot of enjoyment out of this game, as the physics have been somewhat improved (a major gripe I had with 4) but that doesn't change the fact that this game feels like a big expansion pack for 4, with some elements cut out, instead of a standalone product. If that what's you're looking for, more Horizon 4, then it's great. If you're looking for more Horizon that's also been significantly or even moderately improved, skip this one or wait for a deeper discount/ play on Game Pass.If you're completely new to the series, I'm honestly at a loss, it would seem that 5 should be the one to get, but 4 has a much better price and considerably more content, while lacking only some minor improvements.Edit: Out of further things they didn't improve on, simulation damage is still basicaly a handicap to the player and there were no accomodations made for that setting to be playable. In FH4, in cross country races, every big jump ended with your car being completely ruined, I discovered that they didn't change that in FH5 through a scripted event which ends with your car falling from a hill and guess what, I had to clunk my way to the last checkpoint at a third of max speed. Clap clap. Out of other remarks, there's simulated tyre wear now, which I believe wasn't present in 4, but there's still no fuel consumption.Load times are really long.Still no way to quickly switch TCS/TCR.Rewards still don't scale by class (lower classes take longer to complete races)Filtering by type doesn't seem to work in the auction house."

After approx. 1 hour of gameplay your GPU will stop focusing the FH5.exe and you will drive around with heavy stutters at the point where I pulled up both steam and the ingame FPS counter and well, the GPU is barely being put load on and I literally have only 30-40 fps at that point, all my convoy partners have this exact issue aswell after every full hour of gametime. (Bypass for this is to just restart the game, thanks 100€ version)Nearly on every single online PvP race the game will either crash, freeze or completely bug out to the point where all cars turn invisible. Me and my convoy partners all freeze at the same spot when doing these sort of races (especially when the scoreboard pops up after every race) and yeah the really only content we could do is this ""Goliath race"" which is a looong ass run but hey atleast we only crashed there ONCE.If you want to do campaign with your convoy, you can forget that because the convoy leader will get the progress and the rest not, you will realize that you have to do everything all over again to gain the progress (Exp and CR is given tho, but not the campaign progress) I paid 100€ and I am beyond disappointed. It was not worth it and I look forward to the devs fixing the huge amount of bugs/issues that they listed themself in their ""Release Notes and Known Issues"" section. The list contains more words than what I had on my exam essay in 10th grade, so good luck to the devs fixing all that.All these issues are mostly happening when being in a convoy, we do not seem to experience this playing alone, but is this game really fun alone? Think about it.Base game: Worth for those who play this singleplayer with current issues.Deluxe Edition: Nah.Premium Edition: Well bought it myself but nah."

Yes, and no.  instead of buying it full price. (Right now, anyway.) The game is equally fun there, and maybe even runs better.The game is good! It's really just a re-skin of FH4, but that was a breakthrough game and there is nothing wrong with reusing the base of what made it so good. Physics are the same, the game plays the same, there is just more to FH5. In terms of gameplay, it is almost 100% the same. BOT opponents have become a little harder, but that is okay. I'm sure they'll look into that and tweak it some - I hope so anyway. There is more available in terms of racing, arcade like events, challenges, etc. Events can be made by the players, too. I haven't fully looked into that, but the possibilities are definitely there and seemingly endless. The game has a good variety of racing available: dirt racing, street racing, drags, rallying. It's all there, and it's done well. Drifting is also an option, although that was never really my favorite.Graphically, it lacks impact. While the Xbox game looks stunning with its highly optimized graphics, its PC counterpart has made little, if any, improvements over FH4. Textures are blurry and not as good as could be, and I have experienced that over longer periods of time (30m-1h+) the game starts dropping in frames. It feels like the game is incredibly poorly optimized for PC experience. Once again, I hope that over time the devs put in some work to make it look as good as the Xbox version, because that looks incredible. There is huge potential there.When the game initially came out, more issues became clear. They are slowly working on fixing those, with some bugs already eliminated. Given the work done so far, I do have fairly high hopes that more bugs get squashed and other issues are looked into as well.I have thoroughly enjoyed my every minute spent so far, and I look forward to playing again the next time. Feel free to ask questions, I'll gladly answer anything I can about the game."

Graphically it is nice, the music is...uh...it's music, I'm not a big fan of most of what they opted for but I'm certain a lot of current generation people think it's the best OST ever.Racing feels fun and the various cars all have a slight difference in how they feel as you drive them, which will easily result in personal preferences for any player.What bugs me, aside from the bugs and crashes and server connection issues, is much more fundamental to the game.Not only do we start out as the all star best racer ever, I'm assuming as a continuation of Forza Horizon 4, but the game throws the top tier cars at you immediately.This is a game with hundreds of cars and the vast majority won't ever register on your radar, because they're all so low tier in performance and potential that you'll never pick them up.Tack on their version of the Loot Box which is a ""wheelspin""(loot box), that randomly can give you a great car for zero effort, and the game guts any potential feeling of accomplishment in terms of growing as a car owner.Then we have the AI obviously cheating, and no game makers you can not make me think otherwise.  The AI will immediately leap dozens of yards ahead of you at the start of every race as they accelerate two to four times faster than your car out of the gate.This does not feel like a fun race, this feels like an uphill battle against a cheating system.  Toss in how the game will lock you into higher end difficulties which make the AI even more gamebreakingly capable and sometimes I want to just walk away from the game forever.On top of that the game is basically just a whole lot of everything everywhere, scattered all over a large overworld that is fun to drive across, and you'll end up spending more time driving from place to place rather than actually racing.One final gripe:  Can't skip cutscenes.This is 2021 people, it's not 1997.My friend bought me this game and I'm happy he did, I am having fun with it, but the game has some fundamental problems that'd make me say ""Do not buy this unless you absolutely love racing games, or it's on a good sale""."

This is my first  game, so if you are here expecting me to talk about if  is better or whatnot you won’t be getting that here. I should also mention that if you are someone who plays a lot of  or  and you think you can play this game just fine too, you can’t. It will give you a feel on how to play it, however, don’t go expecting to be a pro.  is an actual racing game with real-world driving mechanics, and it will give you this feeling right when you start playing. has you tasked with joining an event as a celebrity racer called  and you will be going in this series of events in each outpost area. You can have standard racing, offroad racing, cross country racing, street racing, and more. Each race will require you to go through checkpoints to stay in the race, failure to do so will result in you going back to get that checkpoint. However, to prevent this from happening, you can engage a rewind feature that places yourself back near the checkpoint. I should note that missing checkpoints or using the rewind feature online, will screw you over big time, so I recommend successfully going through all of them in the race. is a very big place. You can drive through a dense jungle, a desert filled with cacti, through towns, nice shorelines, and traverse a volcanic caldera. Then there is the , think of it as a battle royal mode, where you and another racer battle in a head-to-head race. Horizon Arcade will make you go to these Arcade markers against other racers in challenges and minigames.!!My favorite race has to be  - it’s a giant race where you drive all across  and I picture it being a giant drive around the country.There are at least 526 cars for you to collect and you can either unlock them, buy them with the CR you get (the game's currency), or buy the DLC ones. You can customize the cars to your heart's content with a variety of colors, engines, horns, or skins. Go and get that nice cool sports car of your dreams and put an anime skin on it, or not, your creativity is your freedom.You can even change the appearance of your character, which to has a lot of options for you to choose from. There are only two voice options and I wish there were a few more to give you that freedom of choice for your character. The cosmetic options are very nice, and you can change the appearance at your house at any timeFurthermore, there are houses that you can buy, which will give you access to a new location for you to customize your cars or character in. However, you can’t explore them or even go inside the house so there is not really a point in buying them in my eyes.FH5 has a lot of nice things but it has a few issues with its gameplay that are noteworthy. My first problem is the fast travel locations; these will fast travel you to an area of the map that you want to go to. My issue with these things is that I just never found them useful as I just wanted to drive around to that area. Why fast travel when I can just drive to and through the jungle in my !! Of course, this is just my personal opinion and if you like doing that, then use them to your heart's content.Another issue I had was when it came to the  events, these are marked by pink circles and when you enter, you will need to wait a bit before the game starts. However, there are rare chances where you will go through a circle and will be thrown into the game with no intention of playing it. I wish they showed you the timers on when the game starts on both the mini-map and the actual map.There is also some downloadable content for you to acquire and these DLC’s can either be something that you can enjoy or a complete waste of money, depending on how you view it. Some of them give you extra cars while others are completely pointless, if you are someone who is a huge car person, then I suppose getting the DLC’s that have cars may be worth it.The  DLC might not be worth the price as it just reveals the locations of the fast travel locations and XP signs, where you can just use  and save your money, but it may hit the mark for those looking for quality of life DLCs. I also hear that  does not work at all currently, so I would pass on this one until you see confirmation that the issue has been resolved. has to be one of the most beautiful games that I have ever played. It shows us a rich  landscape and is really eye-catching. I especially love the night scenery when going through the towns, it just feels so nice to drive through. No other game has topped how great these graphics are and it shows that the devs have worked hard on making the game look the way it is.I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. You will need a good computer to run this game unless you want your old one to start smoking but I don’t think that’s a smart idea.I have also experienced some crashes when the game started which was rare or when I checked the ranked leader boards. I do hope they fix this issue with a patch someday down the road.The soundtrack consists of actual real-world music and has a decent selection of songs, like  by . That one has to be one of the best songs in this whole game, in my opinion, a straight-up banger. My only issue with the music is that there was no rock station but oh well.    is a fun racing game that offers lots to do, see, and explore. Regardless of if you are new to the series or coming from , I do recommend this game. There is plenty of content to be enjoyed throughout the game and with how big the game is there will always be stuff to do, even into the post-game. It has really beautiful visuals that will catch your eyes and plenty of cars to use or try out.However, I can't recommend  at full price. While I did say there are lots to do, it's not exactly the content that I would pay 79.99 CDN for. There are other games you can buy like ,  (plus it has DLC's that are worth the price), or you can buy food. The game is fun, and you will get some enjoyment out of it, just wait for a sale before buying."

It's almost impossible to join one and even after joining you get disconnected all the time.Multiplayer races are impossible due to connectivity issues with the game itself. Players get disconnected.Multiplayer leaderboards are filled with cheaters who don't get banned.Multiplayer eliminator races are unplayable because of the disconnect issues. Head to head also doesn't work.Achievements and accolades are a big part of the game. You can track your progress in theory but at least half of the accolades are broken therefore does not get registered/ does not able to complete them.Weekly online challanges are impossible to finish since almost all of the multiplayer elements are broken/ not working.You can't finish at least half of the Festival Playlist.The game can constantly crash for no reason at all. When playing solo, when revinding, when in a multiplayer lobby, when in a solo or multiplayer race. Literally anywhere. Massive memory leak issues.You can get removed from your club after restarting the game therefore can't even try to join your friends lobby.DLC house constantly disappears. An ingame content which was bought for real money..Blueprint and Eventlab race route creators are also full of bugs and have bunch of issues.The game is full of graphical glitches which can happen even on high-end hardware.Your save file can be corrupted and you'll have to start everything all over again. Even though there is a cloud save Playground Games support does not help you.Also if your save file doesn't get corrupted you can get a roll-back since you can't even save your game progress and it only happens randomly but when you crash it can't save.And much more...So there is no content in this game which is fully usable/playable and bug free.On top of this:Playground Games (developer company) bans people for any reason whatsoever:- Having an alcohol brand on your car (even if it's based on a real racing car 1:1)- Having a cigeratte brand on your car (even if it's based on a real racing car 1:1)- Having a website logo on your car- Having the name ""Brandon"" on your car (it really happened)- Having a paw on your car (literally an animal paw livery)- Having a General Lee livery from Dukes of Hazzard- Having a swiss flag livery on your carAnd much more... And you don't even have to be the creator of these liveries, you just have to apply to one of your cars and they will ban you.Who doesn't get banned?- Cheaters who fill up the multiplayer scoreboards with impossible scores- Creaters of real NSFW and really offensive liveriesPlayground Games refuse to communicate with the playerbase. They refuse to fix the issues of the game. They just turn their back on the players."

But unfortunately, FH5 can't transfer save games because I previously played FH5 on Xbox Gamepasss, and I wanted to continue the Hotwheels DLC on Steam, but that couldn't happen and I had to start over from the beginning. Even so, I still enjoy FH5, for some reason racing games always make me very relaxed and make it a healing game.You should try this because FH5 has a unique story introduction and provides a more realistic and less arcade driving experience."

Horizon is a good game, but it's also a game that has not changed in any meaningful way since 3 and 4. Sure, the handling characteristics have improved... But what about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, the glitchy physics, the overpowered vehicles, the bad lobby systems, the world that constantly feels empty of players, unlike how it was advertised... etcForza Horizon has become the widest ocean of a racing videogame, with the depth of a puddle. Outside of those motivated by competition, the game feels nothing more than an empty sandbox. It's a pretty sandbox, but the collectibles feel like pointless, rewardless grinds. The festival sights are still just un-interactable fields of uncanny, unreactive crowds. There are no meaningful rewards in this game for dedicated players. The showcases feel dull, meaningless, rubberband-fests. Some horizon chapters just straight up let you cheat, and some don't... why...?I don't want to keep talking trash about this game, because it's genuinely fun, it's neat. But, it doesn't feel like a labor of love, it feels like labor for money. Why innovate when recreating the formula saves money? If I'm being honest, I think I would rather be playing Forza Horizon 4, because it runs better, despite being on the exact same engine and it's now completely incompatible with some older gpus that could run 4 on highest settings.... And since forza horizon physics are affected by your FPS, since 4 also runs better, the physics are also better. The fact that we got seasons and then they just got rid of them? The world in 5 does not change in any way nearly as meaningfully as 4. 4 was ambitious compared to 3, 5 is lethargic, formulaic compared to 4. The hot wheels dlc in 3 slapped, the hot wheels dlc here is mid, almost feels like a nostalgia cash grab for 3's players.I'm gonna keep putting hours into this game, but sometimes I feel like I'd rather be stuck in traffic than playing the most formulaic videogame I have ever owned.tl;dr It's a decent game, but, PLEASE do yourself a favor and mute the speech volume."

I will leave this as a negative review for the time being, as I assume people looking through negative reviews are doing so to look for any sort of critique for a game, so here's my experiences after the hotfix dropped.One positive thing that I can say is that game crashes and being disconnected from online are much less frequent, making it actually possible to play in a convoy with your friends now However, other players will still disappear randomly even if they are in your convoy. This extends to even the Eliminator, I won a game of it without seeing a single other person despite the fact I wasn't going out of my way to try and hide. Racing online with your friends seems to also work a little better, although I encountered a hilarious one-off bug with one of my mates being desynced and falling out of the sky on a flat road right in front of me. That isn't to say that I haven't had a few disconnects though, and I've only had one game crash. If you want to do massive skill chains to get accolades for them, you're still better off doing it offline as if you get disconnected half-way, people are still losing all of their points for no reason but at least your car won't be stopped dead in the process.Something else that has come up that wasn't present at the time of my original review is that there are a  of cheaters now. On rival's leaderboards, on the accolades hall of fame, and even in online races. FH4 had it's fair share of cheaters in rival time trials and online too, but it's even more blatant in this game with far more people doing it, with people having very visible speed hacks in races and rivals laptimes of under a tenth of a second. The top 100 to 200 times are all cheaters depending on how many people have done it, and as for the monthly rivals, this extends beyond the top 500 all being cheated times. It's not a huge problem as this isn't meant to be a competitive game (ranked online modes have been removed), but I still like doing hotlaps from time to time and seeing how fast I can go. Wheel support, at least for me is hit and miss. I still often have to unplug and replug my wheel several times to get force feedback but obviously this won't be a concern if you exclusively play this game with a controller. Custom control profiles still aren't being remembered.The last thing I have to say for now that isn't necessarily a bug or exploit is that I hate what they've done with Horizon Arcade (the new Forzathon Live). There's no notification of when they start anymore, because there will be multiple Arcades per hour, instead of having one every hour on the hour like in the last game. Not only that, but there will also be two completely separate Arcades lasting 10 minutes each rather than one lasting 15 in FH4. Combine that with the goals being ridiculously high, it's almost impossible to get it done for the festival playlist unless there's a large group of players all taking part. However, that's not likely to happen outside of asking a lot of friends to join you because there's no notification for them. This is a serious oversight on the developers, as I've seen more people doing Forzathon Live in FH4 on a consistent basis, even if there wasn't anything super valuable in the Forzathon Shop.All things considered, would I recommend this game now based on how the average player would play the game and what they would care about most? Yes, especially if you have friends to play it with, and I've changed this review to a positive one to reflect that even though my views on this game are still neutral. The average player probably doesn't really care about setting the fastest times in rivals, or the cheaters online, or wheel support because they would be spending most of their time playing with friends most likely, or customising cars, or going through the campaign events and a few custom events too.  I anticipate the developers will address other important issues that haven't been fixed yet in the future but if you're reading this and debating on whether or not to buy the game, here's my verdict:- If you're more casual about things and intend to primarily play with friends, I would recommend FH5- If you are going to play mostly or entirely on controller, I would also recommend FH5.- If you're going to be playing mostly alone, I'm not sure. For a game that has had over 10 million people play it, FH5 sure does feel empty on the online side of things with servers not showing that many players.- If you're the kind of player who likes to do some competitive racing or hotlaps, don't bother. I don't think they will add a proper anti-cheat system and remove illegitimate laptimes or scores anytime soon.- If you're going to be playing this with a wheel, I would also say don't bother. It's seriously frustrating to unplug and replug my wheel several times in several USB slots until the FFB decides that it wants to work and then having to set my custom control profile again every time I launch the gameI'll update this review one more time after another update inevitably comes out to fix more problems and change my recommendation accordingly.________________________________________________________FH5 has a solid foundation to be a good game, but right now I can't recommend it. Too many problems with not enough urgency behind fixing them which has caused me to refund it. When it works, it works very well. The suspension and tyre model physics are improved from FH4, force feedback on wheels is better once adjusted (especially off road). But instead of fixing any of the actual problems that players are experiencing, they'd rather fix the bloody treasure map of all things.There are stability issues, issues with multiplayer (namely convoys and horizon life) not working, custom controls and preferences not being remembered and having to be set every time you start, wheel support being hit and miss (a feature the devs specifically said they have improved) with me having to unplug and replug my wheel to get FFB to work. Also, taking part in Horizon Arcade (the new Forzathon Live) will cause your game to crash if you weren't there at the very start, and they decided to reduce it down to 10 minutes (from 15) for some reason.I will pick this game up once the issues have been addressed but for the time being you need to vote with your money if things will ever change with broken game releases. Don't buy this game if you haven't already, wait for the devs to fix it."

This will likely be my last Forza Title ever purchased.For a major title game by a major studio to have THIS MANY release issues is just straight embarrassing.  The game is virtually unplayable in online mode. constant disconnects and server side issues (oh, whats that, youve racked up a 100k skill score?? random server interrupt that makes your car act like it hit a wall and lose all your skill points). The game does funny things in solo mode too. Theres a free house with the VIP pack, you ""buy it"", access it, log out, and when you log back in you no longer own it, but when you go back it says ""free with vip"" so you click it again and it tells you that you already own it, but you can not access it.... Sometimes when you log back in youre in a different car than you were when you logged out (usually back in whatever car you started with). But the worst part of it is, through all the hype over new this and new that, this game feel, looks, and plays, EXACTLY like FH4. I mean seriously; races are named the same and have the same general layout, many of the barn finds are the same as they were in FH4. In fact, some of the cars from FH4 have LESS customizable options in FH5 than they did in FH4. But oooohhh, here, put a 10 speed transmission and paint the brake calipers; apparently that quantifies as 'unforeseen levels of customization'.The next Gen graphics are good, assuming you have something powerful enough to display that high of detail, otherwise, it looks the same... And in typical Horizon fashion, you start off with several million dollars worth of cars, and have no real challenge as, whether your racing online against other players, or solo against drivatars of those players, Horizon has never been about finding the best line and winning the race through skill; its about never lifting off the throttle and using the other cars as bumper guards to get to the end and win.Theres so much more that this game lacks in but if youve read this far youve likely read enough. I will keep playing (mostly because I wasted $100 on this game), but until the devs either fix a TON of stuff, or this game goes to 70% off, dont buy it."
209,22,gpu lis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/amaryllis_vfx/,18,,1,204.7,"Posted: November 15, 2021",160,1,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/3bffb1013f1ee641e20bdb209019116487c4d223.jpg,"FH5 is basically an improvement over FH4 in every single way. Playground Games have taken user feedback from FH4, its 2 expansions and its live program and implemented it in FH5 to improve the experience. Looking at FH4, it's very likely that this game will also be supported for around the same time. The visuals have received a significant improvement over FH4 with the inclusion of higher fidelity car models and world geometry made with photogrammetry. The new Global Illumination system provides more accurate lighting in most conditions. The 12K skies captured on location are back in FH4 with 10 times the sky presets available in FH4 providing a wide variety conditions to drive in. Ray Tracing is available only in Forzavista but can be enabled in gameplay with a Cheat Engine hack. Notably with all these improvements over FH4, the spec requirements are still relatively modest with the game performing well even on dated hardware without sacrificing too much on quality.SFX have received a big improvement over FH4 with higher quality recordings as well as a greater number of them providing a lot more unique sounds to the wide selection of cars. Car upgrades now affect the sound of a car, meaning cars sound a lot more unique as every player customises their car differently. Ray traced audio has also been implemented; bouncing sound off of the environment (tress, rocks, mountains etc.) to provide realistic echoes and low tones. One of the important features of any Horizon game is the soundtrack and PG have curated an excellent selection of tracks along with many original tracks made in collaboration with artists they've worked with in the past specifically for the game. All the radio stations from FH4 are back with Timeless being rebranded to Eterna.The handling model is the most important aspect of any racing game. Horizon has always followed the simcade approach, providing simplicity to casual players and complexity to experienced players. FH5 improves on the handling model by making the cars feel more weighty and responsive and the new changes to the suspension model makes it easier to drive off road. Wheel support has also received a big improvement, adding support for more wheels. However hand over hand steering is still missing. Driving modes and raising/lowering the roof in convertibles in freeroam has been added, however currently the feature is limited to very few cars and hopefully the number will increase in time.The new weather events in the form of Tropical Storms and Dust Storms make the world feel more Dynamic and add interesting challenges to the gameplay by affecting visibility and traction. These storms can be seen from a distance and players can choose to drive into them or avoid them. The same is true with the Seasons system. Previously in FH4, players were forced to play in snow or rain depending on the season. However, in FH5, snow and rain are limited to certain parts of the map allowing players to opt out of them.Expanding on Blueprints and Super 7 from FH4, the new Events Lab feature gives even more control over custom game modes and props to users allowing for even greater user generated content to be made. Events Lab allows players to set their own game rules and create actions using If-Then type actions .The campaign is now called Horizon Adventure and adds a lot more progression compared to previous games. Players must earn accolades which are like mini achievements for completing various actions in the game which then unlock points that can be redeemed on various activities that further the campaign. The way that it's been set up allows players to earn accolades from any activity they liked doing and are not forced to do activities they don't like. Accolades provide incentive for players to play the game in different ways and explore activities they usually don't indulge in. The accolades leaderboard encourages competition amidst players to rise the ranks.The season system returns from FH4 with a slight redesign to adapt to the new location. The traditional seasons, Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, are now simplified and called Hot, Wet, Storm, and Dry. The festival playlist which ties in to the week long seasons is back with a few tweaks and the promise of including user generated content and making more substantial changes to the game world such as the world makeover for Christmas, adding snowmen and presents to smash around the world. Online Adventure is now called the Horizon Open and does not feature ranked racing (might change in the future). Eliminator has been added into Horizon Open, which is the battle royale game mode first introduced in FH4 and quickly became the most played online game mode. Horizon Tour is a new game mode which involves Team vs Team racing against AI. The extremely long loading times in FH4 sadly carry over to this game along with the inability to mute in-game voice chat. Whether the new handling model changes makes AWD and meta car builds less over powered will only be made clear with time. Forzathon Live events from FH4 have now been renamed to Horizon Arcade with some changes. The changes made to Arcade has made it unplayable as the lack of participating players combined with the small time limit and big score requirements makes completing the event almost impossible. As of the time of writing this review players are expecting connection issues which should be fixed soon. The game has 3 editions on offer- Standard, Deluxe and Premium. Standard and Premium offer the best value with Deluxe only adding the Car pass over the standard edition. If you're new to the franchise, the standard edition offers the best value. If you're a Horizon veteran and know you're going to put in a ton of hours in, Premium could save you some money on DLCs you'll end up buying anyway if you bought the Standard edition.FH5 can be seen as a refinement of the formula that worked so well for past Horizons. One of the best handling models in any arcade style racing game, breathtaking visuals and a soundtrack to complement it. Mexico as the new location is a great choice, providing a wide variety of environments combined with the new weather events adding more dynamicity. With this being Playground Games' 2nd live service program, and their history of listening to community feedback, the game is sure to improve over time and receive new and interesting content over its lifetime.tl;dr If you liked FH4, you'll love FH5. If you're new to Horizon games, this is a great one time experience even if you don't stick with the game but chances are you'll get addicted.

There are deserts, canyons, jungles, beaches, a volcano etc. so it always feels exciting to explore.+ Vehicle sounds have been improved a lot and they change based on the upgrades you install.+ Hundreds of cars with huge variety. There is something for every taste, from JDM tuners to American muscles, SUVs and trucks to supercars.+ A lot of events to participate. There are the classic sprint and circuit road, rally and cross country races but you can also play drift races, a battle royal mode, player-made modes etc. or complete the story and open world challenges.+ Previously it was very hard to drive rear wheel drive cars without assists especially when they are upgraded to higher performance levels so people usually converted them to all wheel drive layout but it is much more comfortable now.+ The campaign is better than it is in Horizon 4. It was basically non-existent back then and the festival was present only at a small location. Now the festival atmosphere is better felt with different locations across the map.- In Horizon 4 you could select specific class and type of online races you wanted to join. For example you could choose ""A class road races"" if you didn't want other performance classes or rally and cross country races, but unless I am blind I don't see this option in this game, so you will always get a random class and type. The cons are nothing compared to the pros and how fun the game is so I definitely recommend."

As someone who's played every Forza Motorsport game and Forza Horizon game, this is by far the most beautiful and polished the game has been. It's an absolutely stunning game and very well optimized, Mexico can't be beat. It is easily becoming my favorite map out of any of the Horizon games. There is more than enough things to do, earning money is rewarding, variety of races is endless especially when it comes to community blueprints and mini games. Music I'd say is good, not great. Pulse radio was always my go to now it seems like a pop station now, I find myself on Bass Arena now. Other stations are good lots of variety, there's something for everybody. The amount of cars and customization is one of the reasons why this is easily becoming my favorite Horizon game to date, endless cars. They've added more parts to add and customize, they listened to community and fixed the audio so I commend them for that. Final Rating: 9.5/10Only thing I continue to feel in the most recent Horizon Games is that there really isn't a campaign, well there is but doesn't feel like it. As they kinda just throw you in the world with 400 races and pretty much say ""Do whatever you want"" for me I miss the feeling of grinding for a purpose other than ranking up and buying every car I want which is nice but I want more out of it."

So far, I've had an awesome time with the game. There's little ""progression"" and the story is laughably bad, but thankfully that's not the point. It's all about taking whatever car you want and letting loose in Forza's open world. The best part is, you get to play however you'd like. Personally, I did all the cross-country and dirt events first and still, at 80+ hours in, haven't even touched the street racing. The soundtrack is pretty good, personally Hospital, Pulse and Bass Arena are what I cycle through. The only real complaint so far is the net-code and online issues. Still haven't made it past round 2 of a Horizon Arcade, so here's hoping that gets smoothed out soon. If you're a filthy-casual like me, or a hardcore sim engine-tuner, you can enjoy the game at your own leisure.edit: 12/7 Horizon Arcade has been adjusted to amount of players which is great, but still online issues have not been fixed."

I liked forza horizon 4 alot, as the seasons where so beautiful, and the online experience racing on the highway or meeting friends was way easier. Alot of people would disagree with me on this but i wish forza horizon 5 had a smaller map..... Its harder to meet players on the open world experience than previous games.. And the online mini games are the same.They promised more customization with cars... But i didn't see a difference from FH4 for the most part in that category, but the cars do sound better, like WAY better. You know im a big fan of realism, and to be honest i really don't enjoy the map... The developers did a awesome job of highlighting the forest and desert areas(offroad), but the city and street life in nonexistent.... In forza horizon 4 there was more variety, you could fit in perfectly with a lambo in a upper class area of the city or drive a old beater in a rural road. Now its like im driving a 2 million dollar lambo through little village dirt roads to go to my little beach loft lmao like doesnt feel realistic. The developers only focused on the off road aspect of the game taking 80% of the map with mostly rural roads, then leave a little village for the streetlife and street races. If your a big fan of offroading and offroad races then you would probably like this.. But if your like me and like some need for speed action, or some nice city to rip up in a lambo... Then this game isnt for you. Theres alot of politics in this game too.... People getting banned for livery or the wrong stickers on their car, but cheaters not getting banned. The developers are slow to addressing issues with online cheating, but quick to ban anyone using ""hate speech"" and doing grey area petty things. I dont really care about these issues personally, but these issues seem to be getting worse with each game.Get this game on a sale, and try it out.... or theres always forza horizon 4 :)"

In terms of bugs, they do get extremely annoying. The main issue I am having is crashing after pressing start on the main menu. Alongside this, a narrator voice automatically comes on despite being off in the settings. 4 months since release and it's still not fixed??? Playground should at least start fixing these issues than adding more on top of it. Anti-aliasing can also use some work as it's still not looking good on extreme settings.

I had high expectations and after 50 hours ive seen most parts of the game and can do a short review. For everyone who played Forza Horizon 4, it will feel like home if you first enter the new menu screen. There are some new features like the expeditions, but basically the game feels very similar to his predecessors. The difference between those games is the setting it takes place in. Every title has its very own feeling, because of the culture and the country its representing. In that case, Forza Horizon 5 is no exception.The map is bigger than everything we had before and the mexican style is implemented very well. There are many kinds of nature and scenery, like beautiful beaches, large fields, canyons or deserts with nearly white sand. The feeling of going on a holidaytrip to mexico just by playing the game is awesome. The world is beautiful made, with many details and some interesting secrets, the amount of cars is huge. Not that many new ones, but nearly everything we know is back. In terms of races you can choose between offroad- and classical onroadraces. Because of the beauty of the map you are going for some great tracks and with higher difficulty quite challenging races against the AI or friends. Other than that, you can do the typical drift zones, speed cameras or the ,,storys'' the game tells you. Those storys are a quite nice addition, which is representing the countrys culture but get boring very quick, cause the missions are very repetitive and the scenarios in my opinion are totally irrelevant. The first expedition into the jungle is sadly the only one, which stands out and was just awesome. Theres so much to do and you can choose what youre doing next or leaving out.But what would be Forza without the cars. Like i said, the selection is huge and nearly each one is great detailed, even the interior is realistic made. I love to spend hours in customizing my dream cars, set the rims i want, the colours, the grade of window tint, nearly everything is possible. Even the rims are licensed and some bodykits and spoilers too. In my opinion, its one of the best feelings in a videogame to build your car and drive it, while listening to your favourite music, through the beautiful scenery of the game. Hang out with your friends on the beach while watching the sunset, explore the awesome world cruising in your favourite car or race some other drivers. Its the feeling of a living world youre set in, a short trip to one of the most awesome places on earth. These things describe the best what Forza Horizon is to me. And thats exactly what Forza Horizon 5 takes you in. In the actual state the game has some negative aspects too. The AI is a bit inconsistent. Sometimes they let you overtake, while driving much slower or you loose the next race on the same difficulty, cause they are driving like on rails. Often you cant create a convoy or the game desyncs while in race. These things kill the awesome feeling i described in some parts, but the devs are working to fix those issues. In terms of performance the game is running fine. I can recommend this game to everyone who is interested in cars and/or racing. For me its the perfect mix between arcade (NFS) and simulation (AC). If there would be many games of this kind, which are as good as Forza Horizon, it wouldnt be that successful. Wait until the bugs get fixed and you are getting an awesome game.Thank you very much for reading and have a nice day."

I really loved FH4 and so far really enjoying this one. The beauty and detail are unparalleled, the creativity by Playground games is what really shines throughout the series. They obviously know how to make a good racing game but they also know how to make a good game ( If you catch my drift), I was a non racing fan for the most part of my gaming life aside from the good ol NFS MW days but when I play a Forza Horizon game, I really find myself enjoying the different degrees of freedom it offers whilst remaining true to it's core.That being said, the steam version recently got an update to adress some issues which many of us have faced during the first two weeks following the launch. After the recent patch I did notice few stutters while first booting up the game then it dies down 30 secs later. The LOD and draw distance are still an issue even on Ultra atleast for me but looks great in Extreme but FPS crawls to 25. After the patch, the draw distance is slightly better but far from perfect. Also I'm using MSAA 4x and it kind of looks shimmery at times, I remember this being an issue in FH4 which was fixed eventually.The thing is they are still releasing updates for FH4 and fixed major visual bugs in FH4, so  I am confident that they are more than capable of fixing some draw distance and shimmering in the following patches.TLDR; The game has few visual bugs but they will be fixed very soon but if you have a low-mid end PC anyways and you prefer lowering your settings, you won't be disappointed how this game looks and runs on lower end hardware."

FH4 has more populated lobby and a lot more player interaction, 100 cars more, better UI and more interesting map.If you have 1000 hours in FH4 and want more of the same formula but slightly different, go ahead I guess, otherwise I'd stick to FH4, at least until FH5 is heavily discounted.FH5 still has many issues that predecessors had - devs seem to completely not care about fixing core mechanics of the game and rather spend time implementing features which are not that important - like opening car roofs, pronouns or sign language (to torment deaf people with terrible, cringeworthy story I imagine.Main cons:* AI still uses a completely different model of physics than the player, basically random car models on rails that never slide around, push you with great force and randomly decide between accelerating twice as fast as you and not using accelerator at all.* UI is worse than FH4 in many aspects, much more ""consolized"" and large - two cars in a garage column? Really?* Many bugs and issues still persist - for example, crappy auction house that is slow to use, lags and bids often fail for no reason.* Story reached new heights of cringe, especially with every other sentence being mix of english/spanish.* Lobby building seems to be much worse than FH4 - I logged into FH4 and saw 60 players on my map, here I never saw it past 15. This leads to a lot less interaction with other players, especially forzathon/arcade, you are lucky to have 1 or 2 other players doing it with you (there's also four happening at the same time, unlike single one in FH4).* Still not many visual tuning parts and wanting adjustable aero forcing you to use ugly spoiler on every car - please, just make adjustable aero some invisible checkbox.* No businesses* No ranked* Visual bugs and crashes that I don't experience in FH4For pros, car sounds are better, a few more performance upgrade options."

You will love this.• Other gameplay changes like event organization, more trailblazers etc• Optimized enough for my trusty old 1070Ti to run it on everything maxed at 1080p at around 60 FPS.• Steam version is not broken like FH4Cons:* Horizon Arcade. What was supposed to be a fun 10 mins like Forzathon Live, became a grind. Even after 2 weeks, it is not doable.• Some connection issues in between, which the devs have already said they are working to fix it; so may have already been solved.• Radio maybe? I really enjoyed song selection in FH4 more.• Not regionally priced like FH4 If you liked previous Forza Horzion games, you will definitely have a good time with FH5."

I do not recommend spending that amount for this, its not worth it. Give it a try on the pass first. If you get FH4 and FH3 ultimates together on a sale you would have almost the exact same game as this, better maps and more terrain and weather diversity and still have some money left over instead of buying this broken mess.*Mexico is underwhelming, uninteresting and boring.*Not sure if its the location itself but Mexico is by far the worst looking Horizon map, not sure what they were going for, realistic I guess but ended up with dull. Compared to FH3 and FH4 the visual presentation difference is night and day, they still look better somehow. To be clear, the textures are better, models are highly detailed and the number of props in the map are significantly more than the previous games but they just don't look good.*There are several technical and online issues atm, crashes and bugs. Same online problems as before, loading and sync. Haven't come across input lag so far which has been an issue since FH3.*LOD issues. The terrible draw distance makes the terrain and foliage, which are already bad looking worse as 70% of the screen and view look pixelated and low res including the skies, like a game from 2010s. Black horizontal lines bars due to SSAO, broken textures, low fps crowd, pixelated smoke and dust etc.*Weather effects are recycled and not even improved upon and imo mostly worse. The only new thing is the dust storm which is basically the blizzard effect in brown. No more than bare minimum effort was put into water and rain effects, weather effects on the environment aren't great either. You have look in the menu to find which season it is.*For a game centred around fun, festivals and party, the UI is as basic as a formal ppt done in the last minute. *Festival locations are meh. Even Australia festivals were better to look at, from near and far.*Character customisation is the same as before with just different hairstyles to chose on the very specific stereotyped 3D scanned faces that look like nobody. The player talks now so that's new.*Vanity items are just handful, the emotes and most things are recycled from the last games.*Woke signalling nonsense, pronouns, prosthetic and face masks for whatever reason and that too in a racing game. They could've easily done a balaclava or bandanna instead but NO! they've just got to insert their political bs at every given chance because 2021.*The handling and physics is almost identical, Unless you're deep into tuning, you wont notice the difference.*The new engine sounds are there but I assume most people like myself would just turn down sfxs to listen to their playlist.*I don't mind multiple Horizon releases in a gen, we get more locations to drive in and that's great, but this game is downgraded in more things than it improves upon. Now I know why they would talk about nonsense like graffiti for hours all the time because they had nothing else new to show. FH4 was an actual generational upgrade from FH3 and people still liked FH3 better and still do, so remember that, most of these ""improvements"" are subject to preference."

Also, no co-op with convoys and random players- Terrible light exposure where the map is too dark when it is afternoon- Lack of features compare to FH4- Wheelspin is now awful and grindy- You cannot skip dialogue in Super 7 - A stupid tree in the middle of ek balam CC circuit- Did I mentioned that Bone shaker is broken?- Drivatars are unfair and make you question life- You cannot do custom Horizon Opens: You are forced to race in Classes and race types randomly- Steering is still locked at 90 degrees. Where is the full 900 degrees?- Some livery artist got banned for making sfw anime liveries.- Playground games event is the same as FH4: a complete mess of a game mode- The Eliminator feels like a copy n paste, but different cars, horrible map and horrible stutter each time you do head to head. For some reason, final showdown does not have that horrible stutter issue. Also the game takes forever to reset your car, should it get stuck.- Playground game devs had years learning from their mistakes from Forza Horizon 4, but does not seem to care and poorly executed 5. Meanwhile Turn 10 are flawless with their support tickets.- Power builds are being meta- As of playing the game, it feels very unoptimized; constant stutters whenever you access the menu- Ui is too simple and not well designed compare to Forza Horizon 4. It's as if a 12 year old who has no experience in graphics design made it.- You cannot gift cars to specific players. Minor issue though- Leaderboards are still broken and filled with hackers filling up the top - Random convoy race is non-existent. The convoy in Forza Horizon 4 was fine, while 5's is too overcomplicate and inconvenient. In 4 you just go to an event, select co op or pvp and randoms could join in. 5 does not have that, because you have to create a convoy, state whether it is a road, dirt, street, etc. and wait for a player to join in before you select an event and start a race. Sounds complicated? Because it is!- Influences > Accolades  - The music in Forza Horizon 5 are mostly miss. Nothing is memorable and hospital music is bare bones. The previous Horizon games did it better- Ray tracing is only available in ForzaVistaI am aware that the devs are working hard to improve the game, but have they learn from FH4? The bone shaker being broken proved otherwise. In conclusion, I rather pay scalper price for a PS5 + Elgato capture card and Gran Turismo 7 than to play this repeated mess of a game."

However, Most of the content in the current game is recycled such as some cars which are in FH4 are placed in Festival Playlist in FH5 as new content. Those cars should be at launch if there are no licensing issues unlike the case of Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Lancia that is the actual licensing issue. Also some features like Midnight Battles should reward the cars that are new to Forza instead of the cars that already exist in the first place. Bugs and glitches haven’t been fixed properly even hotfixes in each updateDespite the recycled contents, The updates that FH4 doesn’t make into it is the new customization such as new rims, new bodykits from other manufacturers besides Rocket Bunny and Liberty Walk. The bodykit of Hyundai Veloster surprises me unexpectedly and it becomes one of my favourite bodykits. Eventlab creates new areas or custom maps for drifting, photography and more. This new feature in FH5 helps the community create new things.The main map of FH5 is mixed between FH3 and FH4, FH3 brings diversity in each area of the map and returns multiple festival sites and the airport meanwhile FH4 brings historic city into it but the issue of FH5’s map doesn’t have urban area like in FH3 map. So the map in FH5 is basically FH4’s map with many biomes. In terms of car list, Car Pass DLC is worth it for discounted price. Some cars are pretty good with proper customiztion but some new gen cars such as Audi should be free in Festival Playlist. New cars at the post launch don't have as much as I expected. Online mode is quite soulless unlike FH4 where most people are active in Forzathon events that make the event look like the car meet. Online racing and custom event is not different much as FH4Forza Horizon 5 is a sandbox-ish game where you can choose and buy one of your favourite cars to curise or race. Freedom and customizability are the key. So the overall score for this game is 7/10."

Devs can and will add feature with future updates like in FH4, of course this game has everything FH4 had, but it's now better and bigger and has a lot of time to become even better. The map is huge, elevation changes are insane comparing to previous games, different bioms and districts look great. Huge amount of different events, the biggest final races Horizon have had so far. Car collection is not that rich as it was in FH4, but it will be even bigger after a couple of seasons for sure.Seasons are great, but I miss ranked adventures. Without them usual adventures are full of tryhards with meta cars, overall adventures are useless unless you're doing daily challenges for season complition.EventLab should be mentioned too, - the tools that were given by devs are insane. Many players already have created stunning events with their own layout and rules and many yet to come.This game can be kind of boring, because it lacks good progression, but it's definitely good for chill racing or cruise alongside the coast.

I've always been the biggest fan of the horizon series. I don't typically enjoy arcade racers, but Forza USUALLY hits that sweet spot. I dont know why they got rid of daily drivatars rewards... and where are the businesses? It just feels so grindy and pointless. You unlock all the races not through completing them, but special events? Where is the sense of progression? I could go on and on, this season has felt the most grindy so far. no variety at all. Buy this B series car and do a race, then buy this B series car and do a race. why not do races B through S1 and swap across race disciplines. I feel like they could have used so much more of the map as well. The beaches are empty and useless, near the west area, a whole off-roading area exists with no roads or anything.

There are various graphical and gameplay glitches that make the game extremely less immersive. - Anti-Aliasing sometimes will devolve into an early 2000's pixel platformer.- Black polygons will show up from time to time on the surface of dirt areas.- In online mode, the car will suddenly stop after being disconnected from the server, resulting in the loss of a skill chain.- Landing in some areas of towns in the game from either Danger Zones or ramps will result in being trapped by unbreakable walls, buildings, or other objects.- In online mode, some player's cars will freeze mid-air after being launched from Danger Zones.- SSAO will sometimes lower in resolution mid-game, showing bars across the screen from the Horizon, making it harder to see distant objects when driving. (Ironic, really.)- LOD will sometimes turn into the 1st generation Source engine.- Crashes.- Long load times, even with a NVMe SSD.- Level-ups will sometimes not register, resulting in the game showing you as a level higher than you actually are, even when the rewards have been given.On a good note, the northern Mexico map is vast with great detail and realism, although a lack of potholes from my few times visiting Mexico myself. The selection of vehicles in the game is also a great improvement from FH4, and the details are extremely photorealistic. In addition, the gameplay and races are highly varied, and the substantial amount of online interactivity makes this game one of the best online racing games on PC.Though these bugs can be ignored from time to time, I have ran into issues involving a multitude of crashes due to lack of memory optimizations. Consequently, I have lost numerous amount of hours of progress on extensive wraps and decal group creations. I cannot recommend the current state of Horizon 5's PC port as of right now, and with later fixes I'll be enthusiastically inclined to change this review."

AI drivatars are a joke, season challenges are often impossible due to a lack of quality control, a lot of non-seasonal challenges and achievements are bugged, the devs are banning people for making (or using) skins with copy-written materials on them. It's just a bad game. It feels like a slapped-together asset flip of previous Forza games pilled high with pointless, gimmicky new mechanics that might as well not be there since they didn't improve the base gameplay at all. In fact, driving, in general, feels worse. Handling is better granted, but the dreadful AI together with the terrible matchmaking ruin it. Unless you love driving around a mostly empty feeling sandbox world, or tuning cars, please don't buy this. It might be better with friends, but so is getting punched in the face."

The opening scene is awesome. You jump out of the plane in a car and your adventure can start. There will be a lot of work but it will be fun and you won't turn off the game.The game offers so many activities to do. You will be building not just one place for the festival, neither two but 5. Yeah, 5! Each race type has its own festival place plus a place for PR stunts. To do it you will need to collect accolades. These are small challenges. Some are easy to complete but there are some challenging as well. Big map of Mexico offers many races but not too much. I must say devs made a good amount of races. There are 4 types of races. Road Racing, Wild a.k.a. Dirt Racing, Baja a.k.a Cross Country and Street Racing. Everyone will find his favourite. Thanks to the big map that contains different areas from desert through fields, jungle, city to a high mountain which is a volcano. Races don't feel the same as in Horizon 4. I very like new stories and expeditions. There is a lot of them and they add more story feeling to the game. The game feels more like a racing game with a storyline than just plain racing over and over. Also, moderators in radios are responding to activities that you do in Mexico. By the way, radio stations have a good selection of music.The visual of Mexico is stunning. When you will climb on top of Vulcano you will be looking at the whole map with opened mouth. Another great thing is car sounds. Finally, they are nice! Horizon 4 has some cars that sound really good but it was just a few cars. Horizon 5 is completely another dimension and Dodge Viper has proper sound too ;). You know what? Try to change the exhaust on your car. Boom! The car has a new sound. Cars are changing sound when you upgrade them. Isn't it awesome? Devs did a great job with car sounds.A very important thing in racing games is handling. Forza Horizon has the best car handling from the amount of all open-world racing games. You can adjust it to your preferences. Yes, you can't make a simulator from it but if you turn off all assistants you will need the skill to keep your car on road. You can feel the weight of a car. Cars don't feel like karts. I'm looking at you - Need for Speed. Ok, what about the cars list? Well, it's... nicely chosen. You can find there more than 500 hundred cars. Horizon 5 has a very good economic system that doesn't let you grind many hours until you can buy a car that you want. Trust me. You can really fast make some credits and buy what you want. Also, you will get many cars for free from wheel spins or by completing activities. The auction house is there too so you can buy some expensive cars cheaper here. Cars have two new features. The first is every car has launch control. Just shift reverse gear and then back to the first gear (or press downshift and upshift together) and hold break with gas. Release brake and the car will get perfect launch. The second is working convertibles. Well working yeah, some convertibles can put the roof down or up but also there are still many cars that cannot. Hopefully, devs will add this feature to all convertible cars. Also Mercedes AMG One has two driving modes. Would be nice if devs use driving modes on more cars.As with all games, this one has some negatives as well. The launch of the game was not the best. There are some memory leaks, bugs and connection problems but devs are working on fixes, and I hope many of them will be fixed in the next big update."

It does a few things quite well in order to crack through to me, someone dealing w/ ADHD. In my experience, most open ended / open world games occupy one of two extremes: Completely directionless play (Minecraft Creative mode) and ""The ubisoft tower"" of completing one simple objective and having hundreds of chores immediately unlocked on your map. This game sits somewhere in between those, though its exact position oscillates as you play, and can be influenced by what you're doing.You start the game doing something cool immediately, and get to sample a few different kinds of cars and styles of racing right out of the gate. The game doesn't shy away from showing you how large its map is, but it intelligently hides most of the content that's on offer. Unlocking more is based on choices you make as you pursue the threadbare, albeit competent story the game has. It has an almost MMO-oriented pacing in regard to how you pursue content and unlock more to do. Different styles of races and environments have their own ""quest givers"" and ""quests"" to complete, which will unlock races that offer progression towards the next narrative beat, and a handful of side races that you can do for fun or rewards. If you ever feel stuck on what to do, the game contains an AI companion of sorts that you can call upon any time to guide you to an objective, loosely based on the kind of progression you've asked it to guide you to.I've played 60 something hours, dabbling in all of the race varieties I've come across, including setting foot into each major DLC. Nowhere near a ""done"" state with the game. I do think it becomes a bit less ADHD-accessible when you approach the end game, as the game gradually cares less about hiding what's available. The content distribution and volume is likely to have something you'll really enjoy, and you can really focus down on 1-2 styles of play and still have a ton to do.The only drawback with that play style is the reward mechanisms the game has, when combined with how many cars and other kinds of rewards there are. You might find yourself satisfied with circuit and street based racing, but if you want to unlock certain cars, certain emotes, and complete the story, you're going to have to engage with cross-country and off-road races, too.Not a bad game to play solo or with friends. Competitive types will likely end up disappointed, there isn't a ranked mode and the Horizon Open consisting of random races with random players takes away some of the satisfaction. Time trials exist for every course (whether they're official in-game courses or community made), though a significant portion of the top spots on the leaderboard are occupied by cheaters. Those that trail behind them have completely mastered the art of breaking the tuning system outside of its semi-realistic responses to your adjustments, extracting more performance from cars than they otherwise could, and they drive those cars exceptionally well. If you choose to compete here, you'll probably need to feel satisfied with placing in the top 5% or top 1% of times, or only comparing yourself to your friends.At the end of the day, this game has a ton to do, but the quality of any one thing it does is diminished. Not as much as you think, since this is the 5th Horizon game, built upon the legacy of the motorsports series that came before it, but other titles that specialize in one or two areas are going to be more satisfying to players seeking specific kinds of experiences (arcade/""fun"" oriented physics, simulation-based physics, competitive racing in multiple formats, more concise track lists for the community to compete on and benchmark their performance with, etc.). Worth mentioning that there's an absurd amount of accessibility options to accommodate most disabilities and a dial your own difficulty system that will allow for just about everyone to play regardless of ability."

Instantly loved it, by October I had all the achievements and cars excluding 4 pre-order machines. Understandably I awaited FH5 since it was announced during E3. After 30 hours I can say the new instalment exceeded my expectations.From the moment menu kicks in with its captivating music evoking Mexico vibe so much, till the  Goliath race across the map, there’s so many aspects neatly executed here. It’s a step-up from the already good FH4 in almost every department.Graphics, lighting, map design (especially its huge verticality which I haven’t seen in any other racing title to date). Audio, highlight of which being the sandstorm both looking and sounding insane. Everything is . 1.5x the map size of FH4. Longer drift zones. Online Forzathon events more fun to participate in. Online racing revamped in an immersive way (you drive to another destination with the same people you just raced with).Horizon Stories now having different episodes scattered throughout the world. Trailblazers, treasure hunts and  challenges incorporated from FH4’s DLC. Weekly festival playlist with new event types and twists (car brand/class restrictions for PR stunts – I’m looking at you). Mexico rendition is so sunny and vibrant compared to gloomy Britain, with every part of the narrative telling its interesting culture.Driving model has also been improved upon. It needs a bit of time to get used to. Cars have more weight to them so understanding (and utilizing) weight transfer rules while cornering is more important. There are assist and difficulty settings to help you with the learning curve.FH5 runs great on my old i7-6700 and GTX 1060 GB. 60fps, bit less in intensive races (1920x1200 display, 'high' graphics preset which the game recommended itself). This was a nice surprise as before the launch I was sure I’d need to sell my kidney to buy RTX 3060.Online connectivity hiccups during early access weekend for Premium edition owners spoiled the fun, unfortunately. Seriously counting on some in-game compensation from Microsoft…To people saying it’s just another FH4, let me explain. The series has always had two words in its name, every time both of them being  and . It’s just the following number that kept changing, and boy… I wish every other numbered series improved at least as much from the previous iteration, simultaneously preserving its best features as successfully as FH5 does. 9/10"

It will discuss issues that may not be present in the game anymore. I urge you to actually read the review before making an uneducated comment, because I actually don't hate this game. I genuinely love it, and will continue playing it. I'm simply giving an honest, unbiased review on some of the issues - as a long-time, avid player of all Forza titles.Forza Horizon 5 is the (buggy, dysfunctional) car game for non-car people.I really enjoyed this game. This is the most fun I've had in a Forza title in a very long time, and it's definitely miles above Horizon 4. However, I can not in good faith recommend a game that is clearly unfinished. This game REEKS of ""rushed for a holiday release"". There's so much wrong with this game, but they neglect to remedy most of it. There's a constant memory leak issue that reveals itself, usually around an hour of playtime, requiring a restart. I physically can not run the game on ""Extreme"" settings, even though my computer physically could. After ~5 minutes of driving around on max settings, the textures will begin to corrupt and the framerate will tank.Attempting to play with friends is a frustrating, grueling task that will likely result in you giving up and closing the game. Never in my life have I seen a game with such an unstable online mode, WHILE TRYING TO PLAY WITH SOMEONE ON THE SAME WIRED CONNECTION AS ME!The AI is also extremely frustrating. I have no idea what they did between Horizon 3, 4, and now, but the blatant disregard for the game's physics performed by the AI can get infuriating very quickly. The rubberbanding is extremely exaggerated in online play, as drivatars in completely stock C or D-Class cars will just decide to make manoeuvres as if they were on rails. Doing any sort of off-road race is a no-go unless you're AWD/4WD. Why? Because the AI will AWD swap every single car, without fail, every time. This makes attempting to enjoy a RWD or FWD rally car a very hard task, as every race will now become exponentially harder.This game is chock-full of graphical glitches too. Floating rocks, botched collisions, incorrect shading, the works. The Can-Am Maverick's rear quarter panels are void-black most of the time. I have no idea what factor plays into this, but it's not a constant issue. The Mercedes X-Class lacks a modelled engine (which it had in Horizon 4), and the Ford Racing Puma's hood will not open properly. Only the sound deadening of the hood actually goes up when you open it, the rest of the hood stays shut.NOTE: This next paragraph is entirely opinion.A personal gripe of mine that doesn't necessarily affect gameplay has to be the lack of vehicle variety and progression. If you're the type that likes steady, somewhat linear progression, where the supercars feel far more rewarding in the end, this is not the game for you. There is an extremely glaring omission of just, ordinary, everyday cars. The potential for upgrading could be so much better if we were simply given the regular counterparts of the cars, leaving the insane custom builds of them as a conversion kit. I simply don't understand this, because Forza historically, up until the mid 2010's was always very good about vehicle variety. Where is the Mexican domestic vehicles? I counted one. The Renault 4L. That is the only vehicle that is discernible as the Mexican market version. I would HAPPILY drive a Ford Topaz, Chrysler Spirit, Peugeot 404, Chevy Caprice, Dodge Ramcharger, Opel Fiera, the list goes on. They really dropped the ball on including Mexican vehicles in ""The Mexican Car Game"". Beetle this, Beetle that. The Beetle has been in nearly every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ title. It's not new. Would it have hurt to include some more obscure/ordinary Mexican vehicles? I would bet money that nobody at Playground Games has heard of VAM. Another thing! Why the ♥♥♥♥ is there licensed traffic in this game? Just include the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cars! You guys literally have the models for all of them already, because they're just ported from older titles.Anyways, this concludes my rant. This game has so much potential, but it really drops the ball on functionality. I wish people wouldn't happily advocate for pushing developers to release an unfinished game with the ""it can be patched later!"" mindset. I'm very happy for the record-breaking launch on this game, but clearly something was done differently that breaks the multiplayer in this. I just wanna play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with some friends.UPDATES:-Online sort of works now. Still nearly impossible to do a convoy free mode road trip, due to players popping in and out all the time. But I've had 0 issues within races as of recently!-The texture corruption glitch that happens during a memory leak has been fixed, but the memory leaks themselves still happen."

This is better in almost every way and there's so much to do and collect that it can even be a bit overwhelming at times (and that's a good thing)! I wasn't expecting a game that looks this good to run really well, but it does (apart from a few dips here and there). The game rewards you for your time and you'll always be unlocking something throughout your playtime. If you're looking for another game to grind and to try and unlock everything, I'd recommend getting some of the DLCs or the premium edition to help with that. Otherwise, I'd recommend getting the base game/playing this on Game Pass instead, all of which will still get you a remarkable experience!"

New and returning players alike are both guaranteed a lot of fun here. They are indeed, doing it better than any other open world racing game on the market!Yes. I usually start my reviews talking about the game’s story, but since Horizon 5 doesn’t have a traditional story, I’ll discuss the gameplay in detail.At its core, Forza Horizon 5 is an  with a lean towards the arcade end of the “arcade-sim” slider. You’re dropped into , complete with  After you’ve been dropped off in the hub, the game gives you a small number of races and stunts to complete so that you can earn points and unlock more races and story missions. It’s then up to you to decide what you want to do. Maybe you’ll explore the whole map, discovering new locations and collectibles? Or maybe you’ll spend hours drifting a Supra, testing how many millions of combos you can get? Or maybe you’ll work your way up the volcano  and see how far you can launch the Corvette off a ramp? Let’s talk about what Horizon 5 offers you in terms of racing.  You unlock every race type by progressing through the story mode and once unlocked, you can participate in any available race whenever you want. You’re also free to do any race with whichever vehicle you want and the AI will match your car type and performance class. Want to race down a volcano in classic muscle cars? You can. How about racing trucks through a rainforest? Go wild. With the exception of the weekly challenge races, the game never forces you to use a certain vehicle type for a race, adding immensely to its replay value. The game’s weather also changes every week, so a you might find yourself drifting in the middle of a sandstorm in the weather one week, followed by a race in a thunderstorm the next and then racing atop a frozen volcanic crater the week after that. One of the things that has had a substantial overhauling from Horizon 4 to 5 is the game’s progression system.  They range from the simple, like winning races or 3 starring a stunt, to challenging, like driving from one place to another in a certain car within a time limit or stringing together a specific skill chain. Once you’ve collected a certain amount of points, the game gives you an unlock point so you can unlock a chapter of your adventure. Every chapter costs 1 point apiece, so you’re free to unlock whichever chapter you’d like. Some challenges even unlock emotes, chat lines and new cars, so you’ll always wanna keep an eye out.I mentioned Horizon 5 being closer to an arcade racer than a sim racer earlier. Basically, before you start of any race, the game lets you choose from multiple available difficulty modes and driving assists, with harder difficulties and no assists rewarding you extra money. The game also has a pretty  allowing you upgrade a car’s engines and transmission for more speed and acceleration, or tyres and drivetrain for better handling and so on. There’s also a pretty  that lets you fine tune exactly how you want your car to feel. It’s not a lot compared to any serious sim, but it’s still pretty extensive. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t explain the tuning system in much detail, but for those who just want to get to the racing without having to learn about rebound stiffness and camber, you can always download player made tunes for any car and get straight to the action. Speaking of player made tunes, let’s talk about some of the game’s online features. The game lets you  If your work gets used, you even make some money in game! Every race in game can be co-oped against the AI with a team of upto 6 people, and you can also play PvP. Horizon 5 also offers two game modes exclusive to PvP, the Playgrounds mode and the Eliminator. Playgrounds mode is a series of modes where you team up with others to take on the enemy in games of tag and soccer. Eliminator is Horizons take on the battle royale, pitting upto 50 players in a game of survival. There are also hourly events, the Horizon Arcades, where you have to complete a bunch of mini missions with other players in 10 minutes for points that you can redeem in the game store for rare cars or cosmetics. Want a certain car, but it’s too expensive or rare? There’s the auction house in game where you can bid on cars against other people! With so many online features and the weekly challenges, it’s easy to see why Horizon has sometimes been called a racing mmo.Making an open world look and sound good is a huge part of the immersion. How does Horizon 5 stack up in this?Freaking phenomenally, that’s how. Each of the game’s biomes looks and sounds spectacular. A lot of detail has been put in the game and it shows. Even on medium and low graphics settings, you can go on top of a cliff in the canyons or the volcano and look around for miles in game. The world is full of little details, like small dogs and donkeys roaming about in fields and villages, who will always manage to avoid your car! Driving in the desert, through a sandstorm is as thrilling as you’d expect, because you can see it’s size looming over you as you approach it. The lakes and canals in game dry up in the hot season and then fill back up in the rain and storm season. All of this is exceptional attention to detail, and its brought to life with amazing graphics. The city of Guanajuato is also reproduced pretty well, with great recreations of its historic landmarks, streets and tunnels. A plus work all around in the graphics department.The game sounds just as great as it looks as well. The cars sound great, and when you change their engines or exhausts, that change is reflected in game as well. That is great attention to detail and a massive improvement on Horizon 4’s stock car sounds. The game’s soundtrack is good. I’ve already found a few new favorites, though you mileage might vary on this. Forza Horizon 5 is one of the greatest racing games I’ve played and certainly a top contender for best game of 2021. If you’re a fan of any sort of racing game, you’re gonna have a fun time playing this. Even at full price, this game is worth every penny."

Once they announced the second expansion, I was even more dissatisfied. I bought the ultimate edition of this game which if I had known I wasn't going to get the special ford deluxe with the steam version of the game even though I bought the special edition controller which only worked for like 3 months. Content updates for the game were abysmal and lacked any replay value. This game is as stale as it gets and I can't believe after all the years I spent playing the forza games, this is what it's come down to. Forza motorsport looks like it's going the same route. Until they present a fully working title with less of the crappy content updates and more to actually do besides watch a bunch of 3 year olds v12 awd sawp every car in the game and claim skill for winning in the broken meta, I will not be recommending this game to anybody or buying another forza game and I'm sure many of us feel the same way."

It's hard to describe, although the steering in the game takes a little getting used to. I'm used to the way NFS plays, but it's kind of refreshing with this one, and the amount of cars is a bit insane. Beware the auction house, don't put a low starting bid on an expensive car, there are a ton of people lowballing players with auctions waiting for the last second buyout bid, learned the hard way, so if you have a million pound car don't put it up with a 40k start off, there's a good chance you'll only get 40k or 39k after they take their fee's out. I don't mind since i'll be leaving Forza soon, just letting you know :) Bids can't be cancelled, so once a bid starts you can't stop it, and don't start with a low bid unless the car isn't worth much.

I have all prior games with all prior expansions/DLC for Forza Horizon, and almost everything going all the way back to Forza 2 on that side. I am massive, massive Forza fan and it's likely someone playing one of these for the first time may not even be able to associate some of these as issues, what with the game industry just generally being as unacceptably bankrupt with product launch and post-game support as it has been lately. I want to make it abundantly clear before the rest of this kicks off: I believe they can fix or at least remedy most if not all of the problems with this game... given a few months' time and a lot of elbow grease, though there may potentially be some things they just cannot patch out as issues- namely the current iteration of the driveatar system, or complete lack thereof, and what they appear to have replaced 16 years of Turn 10's work with.Because I'm going to be so harsh on it after this, let me point out some serious positives to this game first. Amazing world design overall, up there if not outright matching that of Forza Horizon 3 while adding the wrinkles of seasons from Forza Horizon 4. Graphically masterpiece-tier. The raytracing reflections on the car running on my 1080 make the cars look closer to what they did in Forza 7- like cars rather than overglossy plastic. I couldn't bring myself to play with it off, even with the performance hiccups it might be bringing- it was too integral to the feel of the game. Fantastically executed. The world, too, feels like a living, breathing place. Sandstorms will kick up in the dry season (in weird places, mind, and sadly do not affect physics or handling that much). Most of the map transforms into a slick during the wet season, and the mists that swirl in the swamp can and will give way to random bouts of fog. This game, for all its faults, is still without question a technical triumph on what they've put together (don't conflate this with smooth performance, more on that later). I recommend going to see Digital Foundry's video on optimized settings for FH5. I was able to get it to run at 50-60 on a GTX 1080 with those, for what metric that may be worth (I also run a setup with four 1080P monitors and it was running on one of those, so take that with a slight grain of salt).This game has also now beaten the desire straight out of me to play it until they fix some of the more glaring issues. Between the patch on the 3rd of December, and what immediately seems like they've completely dropped the work Turn 10 has done on the driveatar system to have a unique selling point... They have instead replaced the built up AI behavior, and just made what you're racing against based on replays which I can only assume they intend to use machine learning on (which on all difficulties are sped up). It's intensely annoying to race against, and takes me out of the experience so often.Graphically the game is a marvel... but you're going to drop well below 60 regularly even on a GTX 1080 because they omitted some very essential optimization features, not least of which is the intensive and GPU consuming process of cloud generation. There are no options for that, it thinks my monitor runs at 59 hertz and does not give me an option to force 60 for proper VSync to function, and on top of that, as Digtal Foundry has noted in their optimized settings guide, the VSync option provided will give you a fairly decent-sized performance hit regardless of system, and you're better off just turning on VSync in your graphic's card's control panel. The result is a game that cannot run smoothly even above natural refresh rate and literally required the game ready drivers or better to not be a total performance mess (bizarre thing I'm not sure how many have run into: at one point I had 3-5 crashes an hour, I was never able to track down a reason, it just... stopped at one point during my last week with the game). Give it, at minimum, a few months, I'd argue. Right now it's not the refined experience you expect if you've played a prior entry (even from the relatively jank launches this side franchise has had compared to the main Forza's titles), and doesn't even have many of the options and features of the prior entry that were there at launch. Whether you can look past these issues or not... do your research a little, because unfortunately, a text review cannot exemplify most of the problems this game has very aptly, nor are you guaranteed to have anywhere near the same experience as I did. As always, your mileage will vary.And thus, the condition of this thing smarts, and it smarts hard. It smarts that higher difficulties literally play out like sped up replays that have been spliced together. It smarts that the AI gets a massive head start and rubber bands like there was no conception of time in the game. It smarts that the AI completely ignores the laws of physics you must obey in accordance to these replays, breaking my immersion in the only way I have to engage with it much while I have no patience for the netcode. It smarts that there's so much good... hindered by so many issues. To the devs: Please fix, I'll wait. When you're charging $100 for the full product ahead of time, your fans deserve better than what you have delivered, and we have come to expect far better than what you have delivered on PC already from the past two games. Do us a solid and bring back the driveatar system, if it's even possible. It was a far better solution than this... thing... you've hackneyed together to replace it."

Fortunately, Forza is back for some time. I will say straight to the point if you like Forza Horizon 4, you will certainly enjoy 5. During my almost ten hours on early access, the game was engaging, more than most racing games that were released in the past few years. - As always, Forza has a neat selection of cars to pick from. At launch, we have the choice to pick over 500 Cars!- Bigger map, bigger exploration! I always admire Mexico, the culture, the atmosphere, I'm biased to say this is my favorite location in the Forza Series aside from Australia.- New Sounds, handling improvements, the handling model too feels different but in a good way.- Graphical Improvements, weather effects, smoke effects.- A new fair addition to customizations, however, still not meeting NFS quality. - Connection Issues. Understanding the game is just released with a day zero patch, this will be addressed soon.- Lack of story (as expected) but brace for the cringe dialogue.- Lack of progression. I do like rewarding progression more, so everything is handed to you like previous titles.- Texture issues, map disappearing. However, this has been noticed and will be addressed.- Crashes, mostly GPU issue overheating. If you have a RX 5700XT I do have a workaround that may be a ((fix)). Please read below:Playground games cause a lot of stress for this card, for the people who have Black screens or Shutdowns in minutes of playing. I encourage you to look for Fan Curve Speeds and change it to 50% before playing the game. I went from 87C+ down to 73C and was able to play for hours straight with no problem. In my theory, the card does not cool down fast enough with factory settings as the game puts your card on 100% load instantly. If this does work for you, let me know, please. I mentioned this to a few people to try and has fixed their problems. these are the settings I tried and have fixed my Shutdown problems while playing a few minutes.Overall if you're looking for a decent Arcade-Sim, Forza Horizon is a nice pick. Though, I would also encourage you to try the game out on Gamepass if you're unsure as a demo. You do get a discount too as well for buying premium with it."

There are new missions that were marketed as coop-missions but you can`t play them with friends. There is no new content in the game compared to FH4. Everything is basically the same with some improvements. Online has the same issues as FH4 had. You have to wait 10+ minutes to join the race.I`ve bought premium edition and the bonuses for VIP doesn`t work (or at least you can`t see it).On top of that there are a lot of bugs:- Lot`s of crashes- Constant disconnects from online- Unable to join friend's lobbies- Friends/Players vanishing in front of you- Sudden stops during race as if there is a wall in frony of you• Buggy textures (yesterday all of the buidings for me kept vanishing when i was near them)I like it because i enjoyed FH4 (also new car sounds are incredible) but i expected a lot more for the 100 USD edition gameDon`t buy it right now. Wait until it`s in playable state.If the devs fix it in the future for FREE i will reconsider my reviewUpdate:It has been almost a month since the release and nothing has changed.The game has the same issues and there is no communication when the devs will fix the game.On top of the previous bugs now you can`t even do weekly challenges if you have completed expedition and story mode before.11.03.2023 nothing really changed. they add 4 cars every patch. some of them not even new but copy pasted from FH4. the dissapointing part this game is boring. i only play it because there is no casual open world racing game right now on the market

I finished a race that had a large jump at the end and I was several car lengths ahead, after the jump I lost all momentum but the 3 AI behind me didn't and shot past me. I rewound several times and couldn't escape the momentum loss. IMO this is a major issue that needs to be addressed, because it will cause you to lose a race even if you're clearly in the lead.Edit: looks like the original issue was fixed in a patch...but as much as it hurts I have to keep the review as a ""do not recommend.""The game is constantly ""trying to connect"" to online servers. Its safe to say that they're broken at this point. Please stop spamming me with that message. Continuing, when connecting and disconnecting there's about a 10% chance that you lose all of your momentum. In free roam its mildly annoying, in a race it causes you to lose the race. I blame the bean-counters for the server issues. C'mon guys.Week later update: Servers seem to be fixed and the AI seem to be fixed. So I'm throwing it to a recommend now."

I want to love this game, but at every turn, at every corner and straight, it's trying it's hardest to make me hate it.If you're looking for a rewarding racing game, keep looking.This is the Skyrim of racing games, without any of the mod support that made Skyrim what it was."

The cars look as good as in The Crew 2. I don`t know if it is just me, but the car sounds are equalized. In The Crew 2 I have the feelings every car sounds the same. Also I love the fact, that you can have all cars and you don`t need to grind a summit for a special car. And then you get sad, because others used gltich or they are just better. Get the game now!

Multiplayer aspect provides a challenge as you can compete with other players in a large variety of games, races, jumps etc. However multiplayer ranking system for racing and Playground Games is based purely on experience rather than skill, therefore to be ranked higher you need to simply spend more time playing. Would suggest Forza creates a system based on average skill points/wins per race/games so that competitive players can be better matched and aspire to improve."

You’re able to race in the dry desert, to ruins in the lost jungle, to the snowy mountains, to the beautiful coast and beaches and then all the way to an erupting volcano. They have you racing through hurricanes, sand storms, going through rivers and waterfalls. I mean, the experiences this game has are endless. Bomb soundtrack, a more casual than competitive multiplayer, and car tuning (as always) oh and don’t forget anime liveries, tons and tons of anime liveries XD. All of these things will keep the longevity of this game alive for a while. The only small issue I have is they took away body kits that other cars had in the previous titles. They still have them for some cars but cars that had them before don’t have them this time.

With some missions it's the easiest to become first or get 3 stars and with others it seems impossible. It feels like they did not test some of the missions themselves because they're ridiculous to complete sometimes. The Horizon Arcade concept is horrible because most of the time you don't have anyone participating, making it impossible to complete it and then it starts off with ""Drive 7km to the zone where the actual thing is happening."" They really need to rework this system. Other than that I've been having so much fun with FH5.

In Forzavista onlySome of the vehicle models are ripped from the previous games as their License plates still use FH3/FH4's styleVehicle modifications have always been lacking even removing some isn't new like the 458 had a Liberty walk kit back in Horizon 3 but was removed most likely because of Ferrari not liking modifications being made to their cars but removing previous wide body kits from cars such as the '95 RX-7? That is right, in FH3  the RX-7 had the Rocket bunny kit as a widebody option, FH4 added ""The Boss"" variant to the list now in FH5 no more Rocket bunny but now we have the TCP Magic time attack body kits though are very nice widebody kits it doesn't change the fact that we still have 2 options for that carIn short.

It lacks too much to be worth the price. Big word vomit warning: I did not edit this very much it's all just a passionate word vomit. The gameplay gets pretty repetitive, all aspects of it are stumped in some way. Such as online events. The map while being big is also very boring in my opinion. There aren't any cities it's mostly just wilderness. While the wilderness looks good graphically, none of it wowed me aesthetically so the surroundings got boring after a while. The races in this game get very repetitive. There is very little variation in tracks they all kinda do the same thing. The only saving grace is the publicly posted races. I have so many nitpicks about poor game design I could write a list of 100. It's baffling. Like for instance half the road races are ""street races"" which is just another word for filler races. They just made half their races take place with ai traffic and pretended it was totally different when in reality all it does is give half the road races an extremely annoying ""feature"". This has me writing off half the road races as useless because of how frustrating it is to drive into the traffic and random crashes from the other ai cars. Also, half the races are dirt races which is okay but the vast majority of players play for road racing so it feels kind of a waste. All these factors make the races feel repetitive and unvaried. Which is a shame because the actual feel of the cars is really good. Another issue I have is that there is no form of progression in the game. It's basically just capitalism, grind for money, buy all the cars, that's it. That's the endgame. The ""story"" has you doing random events untill you unlock all the races after less than 20 hours of gameplay. It's really dumb. Truthfully some of the special events are fun and have you driving cool cars and even a parade float with a V8, but none of this stuff is very challenging. You just hold the accelerator and go forward until you achieve the scripted win. These special events are just made to be ""eye-candy"". Fun to look at and experience but shallow gameplay beyond that. Which brings me to the game in general. It was not made to be played for more than 50 hours, which is a shame given the insane price tag. It's all ""eye-candy"" for the mainstream audience. The game looks really good while maintaining very accessible performance. My system easily handles 120fps on high preset with an rx 6600 xt and i5-10400F (for anyone who knows what that means). For a game that realistically doesnt need more than 30fps this is very impressive. However I hardly call this a selling point, I wouldn't spend this much money on a dedicated impressive performance-graphics display. Along with this and the extremely repetitive gameplay that doesn't keep racing game and forza fans in mind, makes me feel left behind. Since the game makes for good ""eye-candy"" I spent most of my time listening to my own music or a podcast while I play just so that I can turn my brain off and listen. It's a good game for doing that, but again, not for the pricetag. The whole game was clearly made for people to waste money on, just to see the graphics and lots of cars and only play for like 20 hours. Plenty of my friends, forza fans btw, have bought the game, played it a bit to finish the story and get the cars they like, and then slowly got bored. The gameplay simply has no hook to keep people interested. It feels like another bloated racing game by a triple A company. For my final point, a subjective one, the Atmosphere is disappointing. The music for instance, is representative of my last point. It's not very good forza fans seem to agree. I've seen reviews from people who thought FH4's music was better, at least for the drum and bass music, which is a real shame because many people really love the drum and bass radio in FH4. My personal experience goes way back to FH1 which NAILS atmosphere to a tee. The music in that game makes the experience feel like a 2000's dance party. The whole thing has the proper energy it needed to stand out as a new racing game. Awesome music was essential because the Horizon Festival was a music/car festival with people visiting for cars and beats, and the hit soundtrack was representative of that. People who were fans of bass arena back in FH1 now find themselves disappointed in the new music, me especially. Go listen to the FH1 bass arena soundtrack yourself, it oozes with personality. Whereas the new soundtrack is filled with new pop hits, old rock scores, and lame ""bass"". Again very subjective but I think it kinda sucks lol. The atmosphere is lacking in general especially with the lack of a story. FH1 had funny memorable characters and a world you wished you lived in, while FH5 provides a cookie cutter world that simply exists to be the place you race in. Outside of the quirky mexican events the personality is lacking and I expect more from such a big publisher. The one good thing I need to mention before I'm done is that the gameplay is still 100 times better than NFS in my opinion even though I've been a big Need for Speed fan in the past, their gameplay is unrealistic and bizzare these days especially with their terrible ""drifting"". Eughhh... No don't get NFS they're too far gone. I got a PC just because all the racing games sucked on PlayStation. Except for the new Gran Turismo, but it's too late to go back now lol. Okay I'm done. Mid game overpriced. Go back to your roots playground games and turn 10. Wow me again like you did 10 years ago. Stop pumping out this cookie cutter open world racer nonesense."

For 140 hours, I have had to hear the Mexican characters in the game (the very few the game ACTUALLY has) speak 3 words of English then throw in a random Spanish word in every sentence. It is so damn corny it makes me believe everyone that was in charge of the writing and dialogue for this game only speaks 1 language because no bilingual person in existence speaks by throwing in words from a different language in the middle of their sentences. This alone has ruined the experience for me because of how unbelievably out of touch it feels and almost racist with some of the stereotypes that are thrown in at times. Now I wouldn't complain about this so much if the VOLUME SLIDER FOR THE VOICE LINES ACTUALLY WORKED LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO- But I digressNow beyond the horrific dumpster fire that is the game's voice acting and writing; there are many other issues with the game that I never experienced once in Forza Horizon 4, which I have at least double the amount of time playing. Some other examples of issues I've experienced in only 140 hours of gameplay:- Online matchmaking very often would have issues pulling me in, I would sit around waiting for the queue and it would say that it's pulling me into a game and it was really a 50/50 on if I would actually end up in the session or not.- Multiple times have I completed a seasonal events / challenges and not received the rewards for it, such as super wheelspins, cars as rewards, etc. Because of this, I never tried to finish an entire series (4 seasons) or complete more than 2 seasons in their entirety.- There is 1 barn find in my game that is completely glitched and constantly resets its progress. Every other barn find was completed within 1-3 days, but the last barn find I have in the game has had its progress reset over and over, and after well over 3 months of playing the game, it has not progressed any further. Of course, I can pay to have the restoration completed for 45,000,000+ credits, but that is an unbelievable amount of in-game currency for something that I'm supposed to get for free. I was intending on trying to get 100% of the achievements in this game but because of this bug, I'll never be able to get the last barn find and get the achievement for completing all of them.- Speaking of achievements, there has been multiple times that i unlocked an achievement much before it was actually completed. as an example, i unlocked the achievement for driving all roads in the game when i still had about 10 more to complete.A lot of these issues are things that should've been noticed during original playtesting and never should've made it to the public. These are things I never once experienced in 4, and it really feels like this game could've used just another 6 months of polish before its release. Now if I wanted to be REALLY picky, here are some other issues I feel were overlooked that I've noticed in my playtime:- While you're in menus, you can't press up at the top of the menu to go to the very bottom, and vise versa. There are many, many instances in this game where you have to press down or up 20 times instead of pressing it once to end up on the opposite end of the menu (or you let go of your controller to use your mouse to click on something). This should never be a problem in any video game nowadays.- Every single leaderboard in the game is ENTIRELY FILLED with cheaters. The Forza devs will find time to fix and nerf legitimate methods people use for XP and credit farming, and will fix any fun glitches that people find, but they can't clear the leaderboards of people CHEATING and going 500,000 miles per hour. Also cheats that have existed since day 0 still work perfectly and it doesn't seem like anyone has ever been banned for cheating either. This makes where their priorities lie very transparent.- This one is very picky I will admit, but there's easily 100+ trees and objects I saw in-game that were floating off the ground. They use the same models copy and pasted throughout many parts of the map that don't work on the terrain that they're being placed on, so many times trees are just completely floating in the air, I've seen XP boards floating, I've seen plants and bushes floating, buildings, etc. I understand how crunched the devs probably were during the development of this game though so this is a very small thing but it really shows the lack of polish this game had before release.Even though I do have a lot of playtime in this game I don't believe it was worth the full $60 I paid for it- especially when it's on Xbox game pass and you can basically get all the enjoyment out of this game in a 1 month subscription (and get plenty of other games to enjoy once your interest in this game drops off like a cliff, as it did for me many months ago!)OVERALL: This game is a 3/10 when you're using your brain, a 6/10 if you have no brain inside your head and perform no critical thinking while you're playing it, and 9/10 when you're extremely drunk."

Well, almost. For my case, the game's foliage (you know, the stuff that fills 60-80% of your screen) now looks like it was meant to. To me, the game is no longer the eye sore it once was. TAA isn't perfect, but it fixes the most glaring issues and makes this game look amazing. I'll feel confident moving this to ""recommended"" once they fix the broken online experience as well as the broken weekly events. Update #2 (6/14/22): I can't believe this game is still in the state it's in. Regular crashes, buggy online code, almost non-existent AA, and foliage looks like it's rendered in 480p. What a ♥♥♥♥-show.Update: A month in and I still say FH5 is a hard pass. Buggy and low-res textures are still commonplace on some screen ratios. The online experience is a tangled mess. Stutters, freezes, locks - it's all still there if not worse. Only thing keeping me in is to stay on top of the weekly rewards, but it's not easy. The left over code and assets from FH4 makes this feel like a bloated DLC, not a proper sequel. Development on this just feels lazy and more cracks are showing each day.The core game is fun (when it works), but I'd recommend holding off until they iron out the laundry list of bugs and broken graphics. No hyperbole: I've gone back to FH4 because it currently performs and looks significantly better than what's been launched with FH5."

(Premium Edition Customer)Starting from the breathtaking graphics - the game honestly looks super amazing! Especially with my RTX 3080 there is no other game that can even come close to this without mods.The performance is also really amazing, as always in Forza games. I have really good framerates playing on 1440p max. settings. And from what I've seen it is even possible to run this game on low end specs, just without the amazing graphics then of course!The next thing are the cars & their sounds - the models look better than ever, the details are just stunning! Also the amount of different cars is really awesome. There is a lot of variety especially as you can tune every car in many different ways! The sounds have been improved a LOT since Forza Horizon 4. Some cars are literally giving me an eargasm. Overall it feels very atmospheric, especially in the interiors aswell!The tuning - this has seen a not too crazy but yet still very good improvement from the last Horizon game. You can tune every car in multiple ways & really make it suit your personal driving style. Also visual tuning, with bodykits etc. aswell as the whole tuning menu have been revised and improved. The selection of rims is great, however many rims are not something I would ever put on a car myself. But there are enough for everybody to like. The fine tuning menu has stayed the same, you can put some time in there to really make your car feel better as always. It is great how it is!The map - oh the map! The size of it is just absolutely amazing! It really takes some time to go from one coast to the other. The variety with the map is purely awesome; you have a really big desert, a giant volcano, a huge jungle and a mysterious mountain area aswell as some fields. There are so many different vibes on this map that it takes ages to explore everything fully! There is a huge area of offroading space too! You can go whereever you feel like going. You want to be in a rainforest but are in the middle of a desert or on top of a gigantic volcano looking over the whole map and beyond? No problem! Just get on the long highway which is MUCH better and more fun than the last one and within a few kilometers you're in the middle of the jungle.The story, missions & exploration - is what is really fun about Forza. You can either just drive around and enjoy the vibe, or just do some PR stunts and try to beat your friends and make your way up the leaderboards. The whole progression system has been revised with category levels for street races etc. have been removed and you are collecting acolade points instead. You can fully decide what event you want to unlock next! There are multiple Horizon Events just like in Horizon 3 again which is great too! Also there are buyable player houses like introduced in Horizon 4 again. There is a lot to unlock and many story races aswell as Horizon Stories to complete. It's not too hard to 3 star them, but it also ain't the easiest thing to do. Overall you will have to take some time in order to complete every achievement etc.The ai has been improved a damn ton, as unbeatable ai really is unbeatable now. The highest I was able to beat so far is the 2nd highest one.Early connection issues and bugs - there are however a few issues and bugs with the game yet to be fixed. No game is perfect; especially not at release. We don't expect that and it is normal for issues to occure. At the early access release we had big connection issues, which were solved after around a day. Now with the release of the standard version they are back again. I expect them to be fully fixed again in 1-2 days tho. A few other bugs including abusing electric engines to gain massive amounts of hp & speeds can also be found.I don't think anybody read all of this but if you did, congratulations and now go and buy this game! There is a lot more to explore than I could fit into this review. Go & find out what it is!It's a great game, solo or with your friends! :)"

A lot of the same cars make a come-back from FH4, but that doesn't make it repetitive. For sure, more (new) cars are needed, but overall with stunning visuals (if you can activate Ray-tracing) an excellent soundtrack, and the same good-old gameplay that made FH4 so adictive, Forza Horizon 5 is an easy recommendation for any casual arcade drivers, or anyone that want a close to life driving experience."

I'll get into those points later on in this review. Let's begin on a positive note.The game is set in Mexico. It's not often you hear that especially if it's a AAA title like this one. Upon viewing the trailer for this game, I was worried about the map mainly focusing on dirt and off-road races. It was only when I played the game for myself that I began to understand the beauty of the map design in the game. To start with, there's a lot more variety in the map design and environment unlike Horizon 4. There's the massive straight line  to test out your car's top speed, the  which is the heart of Mexico, the , the , the  and a whole lot more. I could go on and on.There's even a proper Circuit in this game.The Race CIrcuits and Sprint races are also designed very well. It also helps that no two places feel similar in this map so all the tracks feel unique.In short, I feel like this is the single biggest upgrade FH5 has received apart from the Audio which I'll get to. It feels fresh after 3 full years in dark and cloudy Britain.  In this area, I am a bit disappointed as there's not a whole lot of new cars added but we have to keep in mind that this game already has over 520 cars and that number will only rise as new cars get added through updates. The cars are modeled to exceptional detail and look amazing when out in the streets of Mexico or in the Forzavista with Ray Tracing. I have no complaints regarding the level of detail on the already present cars.Coming to the Physics, it's still largely the same compared to Horizon 4. AWD is still just as overpowered as it was in FH4 and that's a bad thing as it reduces variety. RWD does 'sometimes' give you a slightly higher top speed but considering the fact that most races rely more on acceleration than top speed, there's absolutely no reason to use RWD if an AWD swap is available.I've noticed that the default tune most cars ship with when you buy them or upgrade them are better compared the FH4. They feel less slidey and are very usable. This is very helpful for the new player who doesn't know how to tune their cars just yet or in general, it makes tuning your cars an easier job.Some community tunes are still overpowered and/or glitched to completely break physics and it almost feels like you're playing a completely new game.Overall I'd say that the Physics in this game is good and is almost the exact same compared to FH4 which isn't necessarily a bad thing. As this is a sim-arcade (more towards the arcadish side) you cannot expect to have perfect 1:1 representation of tuning and simulation but for what this game aiming to be, the physics is very well done. This is something that was heavily marketed and showcased prior to the release of the game. The audio was something they had to improve from the previous generation as it was quite lackluster in this department previously.The sound of the engines, tortured brake discs, screeching tyres all sound phenomenal. It's no longer a monotonous revving noise you hear when you're redlining your engine at top speed, it's far more realistic and the audio has depth, is spaced out well and very crisp.Every engine sounds distinct and different. They all sound like they are supposed to unlike FH4.I've run into a few weird bugs when the engine wouldn't be audible until you switched up to 3rd gear but as it's a newly released game, some bugs are expected.Overall, it's a massive step up from FH4. This has to be the one of the best looking racing games I've played, period. Heck, this might just be one of the best looking games I've played. The visuals are striking, that is, when there are no bugs. There's a glitch on the PC version of the game where the Draw Distance is extremely poor even on Extreme settings and it does take a bit away from the experience but I suppose it'll be ironed out soon. I've also noticed the aliasing to be a bit poor compared to other games (I'm playing on 1080p with 2x MSAA) but I'm very picky about jagged edges so you might not notice it.The Performance too is very good considering how good it looks. It runs at a flawless 60 FPS even on a 1050Ti at Medium settings, In short, the cars look remarkable and even the environment looks spectacular apart from the draw distance bug.  There's a lot of things to do in Mexico in this game. You have Street, Dirt and Off-Road races, Barn Finds, Horizon Story, Horizon Arcade and so much more. You could also, choose to completely ignore them and just free-roam around the beautiful map. It's all up to you.There's not a lack of content in this game and it'll keep you interested in it or hours on end. So far, I've been highly positive about this title, but again, like every other game, this too has issues and bugs, so let's get right into them. • : This game has a lot of problems concerning multiplayer and online. It randomly leaves convoys or the server itself and it gets really annoying really fast. It also takes ages to load into and out of online races or sometimes it just gets stuck and the only way to get out is to Alt+F4 out of the game. This has been the case since FH4 and it's very sad to see the same thing happening again. I've also completely stopped playing online with other players just because of this reason, it's that bad. • : It does happen when you're tuning your car in a garage or at times, you cannot even drive a particular car as the game will instantly crash after you take it out of your garage. The game is quite unstable as of now.• : It makes all other people on the server invisible for you and this game mode is frankly unplayable as of now. It's a known bug and I hope it'll get fixed soon in the next few updates. It's an amazing game and I recommend this title to anyone interested in racing games. The issues I've mentioned might get annoying especially if you play online so if it bothers you, consider waiting for a while for patches before picking this title up.When it works, it's a remarkable game and a near flawless experience. It's easy to pick up and play even if you're inexperienced as it's not a full simulator.P.S. Nominated for Steam Awards"

Let's talk Horizon 5.First things first, if you enjoyed Forza Horizon 4 you will enjoy this title as well.Horizon 5 is easily the best racing game available on PC at the moment but it has its issues and it has a lot of them. Some are minor and some are pretty huge.I had my review ready when the game was released. I hold off posting this review because I wanted to give developers some time to fix some of the stuff. Nothing has been done so far. In fact, the number of issues has grown. It's absurd.  A full list of cross-platform and PC-only issues is at the end of the review. The list is HUGE. EDIT: The list is so big Steam says my review is 13, 264 characters too long so I will post a list of Steam related issues only.I got in four days early and put around 40+ hours into the game in four days. Now, a week later, I have only 67 hours of playtime. Why?Connectivity issues. I had this in my ""early access"" period as well but it wasn't as bad and I thought it would be addressed and fixed by the time the game was released. I was wrong. It has gotten so bad I have not been able to play online AT ALL. As soon as I start up the game I get disconnected. I might be able to stay connected for five seconds maximum and it has been like that for the past 7 days at least. It has been frustrating.EDIT: It has now been 17 days since I was able to connect to ForzaLife (online). I've tried around 10 different fixes, the game has patched itself 2-3 times and each time they have claimed to fix the connectivity issue but it's all just lies. Nothing works. Beware!Why am I giving this game a positive review? Because it's still fun to play solo and it has hundreds of hours of singleplayer content in it. Just be warned: As of now singleplayer might be the only thing you are able to do and that includes not being able to do seasonal objectives and unlocking cars in those seasons.Alright. That's out of the way so let's get to what I originally wrote about Forza Horizon 5:If you're new to the Forza franchise then Horizon is the more arcade-y spin-off of Forza Motorsport. Motorsport is a proper sim-cade/sim racer depending on how you want to play it.Horizon is an open-world arcade racer where you can do whatever you want and progress however you want. Now when I say it's an arcade racer, it is, but it's also important to knowthat you can turn off all the assists, turn on realistic damage, set the AI to the impossible difficulty, and enjoy a more sim-like experience.The Horizon series offers you everything you would want in a racing game: Car tuning, upgrading, and customization, a huge open-world map with different areas to free roam in, all kinds of different race types from drag and street racing to off-road dirt racing and user-made custom tracks. Oh, I should also mention there are quite a few different radio stations available to almost every kind of taste... Almost. The rock radio station is a bit lacking and plays more pop/pop-rock songs than actual rock tracks but it's still pretty decent.Car selection is bigger than ever as well. Forza Horizon 5 launched with 534 different cars with many more on the way. Yes, it's true Horizon 4 had over 700 cars in the end but that's with all the expansions and updates. Let me remind you that Forza Horizon 4 launched with just over 400-450 cars so give Horizon 5 a little bit more time and we will eventually have even more vehicles available than in the predecessor.Now let's talk about the online portion of the game a little bit.Forza Horizon 5 is a great singleplayer game with tons of content but there is also a huge load of co-op and multiplayer content on offer.Every race you see on your world map can be played in an online co-op with your friends but you can simply queue for player vs AI co-op races as well.On the competitive side we have the ""Eliminator"" which is a battle royale with cars, your usual casual and ranked street, dirt, and other races, and a playground in which two teams of players compete against each other in zombie modes, capture the flag and a few other modes.The open-world map also has ""arcade"" events in which players either have to drift or do other kinds of stunts to rack up scores together and earn Forzathon Points. Forzathon Points  can be spent on cars in an online Forzathon Shop. The shop is currently unavaible.Now talking of online, I actually have a couple of issues with it. Actually, one issue to be perfectly honest. You can choose to roam your map in solo mode or online mode, in which you see other players drive around and join the open-world arcade events that appear on the map from time to time. Now the issue with this is that I've had quite a lot of problems.The first 5 hours were hell for me. I got disconnected several times in a minute. In ONE MINUTE! The issue is not on my side. My internet connection is solid. It has gotten better but I'm still experiencing connectivity issues so beware of that.That's my only issue so far. Other than that the game is great. The performance? Absolutely brilliant? The game runs at a solid 100 frames per second with every setting maxed out and at 1440p. RTX 2080 super, i9-10900K, 32GB RAM, and with this hardware getting 100 fps at 1440p with every setting on extreme/ultra I can't complain. Runs better than I expected and the game is a real eye candy.I have experienced some graphical glitches here and there but nothing serious so they have not bothered me at all.Definitely worth the full price! Next season will have the DeLorean as one of the seasonal awards so hop on board, get driving, and enjoy the festival with crazy cars, crazier people, and even crazier stunts!STEAM Related Issues     Players may be experiencing performance degradation after extended time playing due to memory issues    There are flickering water reflections on low spec PC with AMD graphics card    Car dials have a ""white-ish"" texture and are blurred when car is moving on AMD card with integrated Radeon graphics    PC - While using 'Alt+Enter' combination the Title still reads 'Enter' button as an input    Upon changing hardware the game doesn't ask you if you want to re-run the graphics setup.

One of us get's kicked out or we can't even start a race. The koop mechanic isn't balanced, doesn't make any sense and fun get's constantly ruined, because one driving error (or a NPC rams you off the street) results in driving way behind with no chance of making places again.

InnovationsThe game adds some great features like drifting tires and transmissions, but its mostly the old game in a new world. Again there are a lot of cars to collect.5. Driving experienceThe cars feel good on every terrain. The difficulty on asphalt got a bit more difficult. The races are nice, the really long ones like the Goliath and Colossus are extremely fun and way better than in the old game.The tuning and customization are like in the old game.6. Racing experienceAfter you've seen everything, it becomes boring. The AI always acts the same. Either you carve through them at the beginning or they hold their lead no matter how good you drive or how you spec your car. Once you are in the lead, they fall back and they drive in one collumn behind you. They won't come back and won't fight with you. They don't seem to have any advantages or disadvantages. So if you spec your car for one specific perk, they will always match you in that regard and be better than you in the area, you have a drawback. So after the start you have to hurry and then you either loose after a boring race or you win after a boring race.7. FazitThe game would be really good, if it wouldn't have so many problems and become so boring.In singleplayer with a high end pc its great, with an a few years older PC its most of the time okay.In Coop it's not enjoyable."

The driving and physics in FH5 are great, the car selection is solid (although there's some MAJOR omissions from FH4, including the entirety of Lancia and Alfa Romeo and many Lotuses which was extremely disappointing). The map has good driving roads though I do not find it anywhere near as aesthetically pleasing as 2's or even 3's. What's absolutely dreadful about this game is the supporting cast/NPCs. They have the worst dialogue, maybe in all of gaming history. It's torture to listen to them.Overall if you like racing games you will like FH5. However I wouldn't recommend it over its predecessor since it doesn't change enough things and it has an inferior car list overall - or so I'd say but FH5 finally added the greatest car, the XJR-15..."

Instead the races are very easy to win, the ai seem to be easy to beat and won't try hard to pass you up if you make a mistake.

It has an awesome number of options for driving that let you play a very arcadey game or a very simulationist one. And the cars. Oh my goodness. There are so many cars in the game. 535 apparently. The game hands you cars left and right. And I love putting anime skins on them and rolling around honking at other players with a musical horn. And I can race with my buddies! I suck, but it's fun anyways.I am very happy with FH5 and recommend it to anyone in a racing mood."

Frequent disconnects. Streets are empty and if you do occasionally find a car there is a good chance it will just fade out of existence right in front of you. AI blatantly cheats.If they had bothered to finish making the game before releasing it then it would have been a good game. Hopefully in a few months they'll have fixed the bugs.

Most of my time in FH5 is spent racing online or grinding rivals.Pros: handling model is great, graphics are stunning, and the map design is generally pretty good. Also Hot Wheels is pretty fun.But besides the pros listed above, this is yet another soulless cookie-cutter open-world racer. The map looks great yet feels empty and lifeless. The 'missions' are purely a waste of time. Characters are forgettable if not annoying at times. The car list is largely unchanged from previous Forza titles; the cars themselves lack detailed modeling and animating, and blatant errors somehow make their way past QA, such as mirrored textures or leftover placeholder textures. Online racing is lackluster and the ranked mode from FH4 has been removed for no reason.Overall, this may be a fine racing game for someone who doesn't particularly care about cars or the genre. However, it is a disappointing one for car enthusiasts and long-time Forza players with many core issues that are hard to address with their monthly updates."

Ths is the racing game and devs forgot to enable support for racing wheels (controllers). This is just unacceptable, considering how miniscule changes from FH4 are, i can't understand what they managed to screw up so badly. In current state, this is barely playable."

It's a great open-world racing game where you don't even need to just do races, you can do side challenges or just drive. Graphics are very good. However there is a memory leak issue where after about 1 hour, you start losing some fps, get some stuttering but after a restarting the game it all goes away.

Yeah it's similar to Forza Horizon 4 but it's not the same. The map it's huge and wonderful, 5 Horizon festival sites, over 500 cars and new songs. In over 40 hours in only 3 days I can say that the game is great and yes it has some bugs and glitches just like Forza Horizon 4 has(at least the Steam version).It has some disappointing features like the rendering stuff where everything I see on my screen which is far away instead of being rendered wonderfully, it looks garbage. Nothing even close to I dunno... Let's say Red Dead Redemption 2.Also the AI is way more difficult on higher difficulties than they were in Forza Horizon 4.On some high difficulties they use some ""upgraded cars"" which you can't even upgrade to those stats, for example the Ford Focus RS,I was only able to upgrade it up to S2950 and the AI had one at X999. The accolade feature is very similar to the progressing system we had in Forza Horizon 4 Lego DLC. It's not that much of a grind for 'em luckily tho. The PC port its good, not great but over time they will patch the game.For those wondering I used an RX 5700XT, a Ryzen 7 3700X 4.40GHz, 16GB DDR4 3000MHz RAM memory and I played in 1080P with MSAA off and beside that everything Maxed out. I also had the game installed on a HDD.I had in some points over  cities close to 60 and above, on the highway and other roads in the middle of nowhere 80fps and above. I didn't encountered any errors like game crashes or freezes but I did get a message saying that my 16GB RAM and 8GB of VRAM memory isn't enough. But that's all. And with that I said everything I can about the game and before I forget :Welcome to Mexico!"

My system is an  i5 6400 with 16 gigs of ram and a Nvidia GT 1650 not exactly a powerhouse system and I am getting 60fps at 1080P. I have even seen it run on a graphics card as low as the GT 1030 via youtube that is a very low powered graphics card. Amazing. I am using a controller. The sounds are awesome and Mexico looks great. The solo races I did were all fun. I am sure they are some issues but I have yet to encounter a single one since playing. Its smooth like butter.

Hands down it is the best arcade racing  game present. Playground Games did not risk to spoil the formula which brought success and cash to them in previous titles and without any serious rivals forcing them towards greater innovation they only added some new features to it . But this does not stop giving gamers the itch to play ""one more race"" in each playthrough.Here in FH5 you will be in Mexico which has a bigger and more colorful map with stunning vistas compared to FH4's ""a bit too sterile"" Britain . It is so huge and and there are overwhelming things to do, so many that the finish line of one race is likely quite close to the starting gate of another.  The map is positively littered with icons  -more than any Assassin's Creed game:)-  so filter will be your friend. -But still I can't help myself thinking Japan would be a better choice instead:)- Overall compared to FH4 the game looks better, sounds better. Apart from seasons now there are day/night changes, weather activites like sandstorms/tropical rain. You will not get bored easily since there will always be a lot of things to accomplish and game will steadily reward you for that forever.Keep in mind that this is an arcade racing game, it does not require a steep learning curve how to drive. If you want to exprerience a more serious racing sim you may go for Assetto Corsa or Project Cars instead. Yet still with lots of cars to unlock, nice setting and custimization options, fun activities and endless action FH5 is an open world racing dream for every player.Whether you are a racing fan or not you will like this game.Enjoy your ride.."

Poured hundreds of hours into that game. Tuning, Racing, Drifting, Off-roading. I'd come on and complete every weekly competition to get the cars. It was amazing. This feels like a complete reversal of what FH4 was and still is. It honestly feels like a complete downgrade except newer cars, better sounds and graphics. That is where the only positives for this game are.To start off with, you are physically forced to do off-road and cross country races to progress. You can't just ignore them if you don't like them, you have to do it. Another thing, when you complete the acolade stage, you are forced to pick an acolade and goto where that is (a showcase race or new event area).Back in FH4, I honestly didn't mind the off-road and cross country races. They are not my favourite what so ever, but I did have fun with them when I did them. Not this game, what so ever. The tracks are complete ass, sharp corners then immediate jumps. Jumps that are so large, no matter what you do, your car bogs down however the AI is just fine. And to top it off with these races, the AI are absolutely insane with them. They can race around cross country races as if they are an F1 car on a race track! They don't worry about grip, traction, balance NOTHING; all while you are wrestling with your car to get around the corners and not go off the course. You do all this effort just for the AI to slam their break, turn in and pass you as if you are standing still. This isn't to do with difficulty, I play the entire game on expert/pro, yet when it comes to cross-country (due to the race being apart of the forzathon playlists to get a new car), the difficulty is Highly Skilled (around 1-2 difficulty notches down) and it feels like I am playing unbeatable drivatars (the top difficulty level). I have had to retry, rewind and redo each race numerous times. It just completely sucks the fun out of it.I mention all of this to not even cross onto the fact that this was all to unlock a 911 GT3RS, A FACTORY MADE TRACK RACING CAR. Why the hell should you do cross-country races for a car that is purely for track use! It' s completely irrelevant. All this does is force me to play races that I don't like and have tried my hardest to avoid just so I can unlock a car that is better for the races I DO LIKE.That was just the actual races and physics! I haven't even gone on about the numerous bugs, irritations and down-right rage-quitting issues!I will keep this one short as it is already long as it is.First: the on-screen narrator. No matter what I do, within Windows, within the game, the onscreen narrator will always start speaking whats on screen for the entire menu until you get into the game. There is no way to stop this, believe me, I have tried. It makes me immediately want to shut down the game, because the voice and the fact that it won't shut up is highly aggravating.Next: Force feedback on the wheel. It is a luck of the draw whether it decides to work or not. You can boot up the game, load in and wait all that time just to realise you can' t feel what the car is doing because the FFB doesn't exist (bearing in mind without it, the car feels like a weightless feather on ice). All of this leads to you restarting the game, multiple times, until it finally starts to work again. And as soon as you tab-out, there is a high likely-hood that the FFB will stop working again.After that: The constant resetting of my wheel setup. I don't have a clutch pedal, but I like using the clutch so I can drift. So to do so, I bind it to one of the buttons on my wheel, meaning I have to use a custom wheel profile. This is completely okay, I did that in FH4 and it was never an issue. The issue is that FH5 resets it back to default, every. damn. time. Every time I open the game, I have to go back into settings and set the mapping to Customer Wheel Controller #1. Finally: Something that is still not fixed, however not too bad, the fact that there are still graphical issues within the game. That being the glitching road textures. You could just be driving normally and then all of a sudden you pass through a stretch of road that is filled with rainbow colours. Not the car, not the grass, just the road. You could reboot the game, go back to the exact road and it will be gone. This isn't an issue with my graphics card or installation as i have checked both of these, however it is still jarring and does break any immersion or enjoyment.This is all just to say that with the numerous amount of bugs, I spend most of my time restarting, rebooting and remapping FH5 so that I can play it. This just leads to me not actually wanting to play the game anymore. It is the reason I have not played it as much as I have wanted to do. The hassle and faff just outweighs the fun that could be had."

Half of it with controller and the other with a G29 Sim Racing Wheel. So obviously I love that game. But after that much time you need a different experience and that is where Forza Horizon 5 falls short. Because Forza Horizon 5 IS Forza Horizon 4. It’s the same game. Im playing the same game again. The differences are like a FIFA game. Now for a Forza Horizon that doesn’t have to be necessarily a bad thing. Forza Horizon 4 was after all an almost 10/10 game. The only things that it had to improve was its sense of speed, proper spots for dirt rally on the map a GOOD CITY maybe some better mountains for more offroad fun, Hill and Downhill races. It also had a lot off small things like the shifting stile being a difficulty setting (very annoying with a wheel) and its rater suboptimal class system. But Forza 5 changes none of that.Actual significant changes Pros:Better sense of speed thangs to ssdMore realistic car feel (better weight feel)Better Force Feedback (Sim Wheels)Much better car soundsCons:Terrible and uncreative map when compared to Forza 4No seriously it ruins the gameA lot less cars than Forza 4 (for now at least)More bugs than cyberpunk (mostly coop related)Conclusion: When you play with a controller just play Forza Horizon 4. The Force Feedback doesn’t affect you and the weight feel doesn’t do all that much. The map is worth it. When you play with a wheel and you can’t get enough off Forza or never played 4 before than the Force Feedback might be worth it or you just play assetto corsa."

The pro :- Nice visuals- Enjoyable driving experience when alone on the roads- Love the designing tool (compared to The crew 2)- Love to be able to fine tune my car to my preference.The Cons- Grindy as hell- Nerf after nerf of the various ways to earn money- Some of the challenges are painfull, especially when having to compete against cheating AI.All in all, when played with friends (and the game keep in sync) it's nice and fun. Enough that I got 300 hours sunk into the game. So why the thumbs down ? Here is why :I did a 6 months break from the game, and decided I just wanted to take one of my car for a spin 2 days ago.I had the game using 100GB on my hard drive for the last 6 months, got the updates and all. But when I started it, reached the login to my Microsoft Xbox account, and then started the game, I got the nasty surprise to be presented with the Driver creation option and not being sent in my previous game.So here I am, 300 hours down the drain and having lost every singles of my achievements.After a bit of searching, I found out it's a common issue both on PC and console. A lot of players get corrupted save or error codes. In my situation I got nothing of such, no warning, no error code, just a complete reset of the user data save file.Now, after contacting the support I have to replay the Tutorial and reach the point that let a player go online. The very part I hate in every game who Gate the access to your friends through ""Tutorials"" and other mandatory things before you can join your friends online and can enjoy playing with them.Hate to have to do it a first time, or every single time a game decide you lost your datas (GTA 5, Dying Light, Forza Horizon 4 and 5). So, having lost everything, and not even sure I can get the rewards for the various Skins I made for a lot of car and shared online, I can't in good faith put anything else than a thumb down."

You can play a $60 game for $1. For an actual review, Forza Horizon 5, once again, breaks it's own barriers. With an gigantic map that is full of twisting biomes and roads, it encapsulates a great and mesmerizing atmosphere of Mexico. Coming from past Forza games, the latest entry to the Horizon series is the best that Playground Games has churned out. The monumental changes to the lighting and particle effects are wonderful, the increased graphical fidelity and saturation of the world is great, and the new changes to how vehicles both handle and respond to the environment are perfect. The only ""but"" I would say is that, as of both pre-launch and after, the game has issues with crashing randomly when in a menu or trying to interact with the UI. I've also gotten into issues where I would get stuck into an endless online match search where I wouldn't be able to interact with the menu, but as far as I know, that issue has been resolved. These are minor in comparison to the solid and polished recipe for the king of arcade open world driving games.9/10"

At this point I am level 117 and almost finished all horizon events on the map, raced in most of the races on the map and drove most of the coolest cars that this game has to offer, so I felt like it is a good time to leave this game a fair review ( at the given moment, as updates come out I will remove and re update my review with new information). Besides I am going through some problems with my secondary SSD which is problem at my end, so I wanted to post a review while my feeling from the game still not affected by anger nor disappointment. game is amazing but quick warning before we get to the review:Many people have low streaming bandwidth which freezes the game and crashes, I experienced it on my SSD which may be faulty and game now being tested on another drive ( will update the review later). But all I can say dev team already works on solution not to mention that I personally reported and contacted support 2 times and both times was greeted by real person who offered help and solutions. How about that? A game dev company that actually values their customers and lets a real person help them out. Some other companies should take good example! Convoy with friends doesn't work as expected, losing connection to each other, patch is in the progress scheduled for this week.Graphics: we will just leave it at that, they are incredible, I was actually very surprised that my i7-920, 18GB, 1070 G1 gaming GTX was automatically adjusted to Ultra settings and yes the game runs very good on 1080p resolutions, nearly perfect on 1080i. Extreme settings is when it starts having some FPS drops. Driving Physics: As someone who comes here from TDU games, the physics are very good. There is one downside to discuss down the review tho, but not here. Cars behave very realistically, understeer, oversteer, you gotta learn your braking zones, acceleration sensation is fantastic and high speeds really feel like high speeds. Your driving can be adjusted by ABS, traction Control, stability assist, and there is simulation mode which really ups the feeling up with cars behaving incredibly real. You can have fun with the simulation even with a keyboard as far as some of the assists are on and you at least half not stupid when it comes to driving. And you gonna love it (sorry, I had to) Customization and car selection: I was very happy that we didnt get spammed by bunch of new super cars, car selection is more than amazing. You have some old cars from the 90s and even 80s and even classic cars and muscle cars. Many of those can be engine swapped to racing I6 or racing V8 with 1000+ hp that will make it mad fun to drive. Ford has amazing line up in this game, you have Fiesta ST and Focus RS that can be turned into Rally cars, mustangs, amazing Trucks that easy turn into Baja beasts, or even new bronco that be swapped with a racing engine at 1400hp, top it off by Ken Blocks hoonigan Stang that probably one of my favorites car in the game with insane straight line performance and possibility to be driven at grip or drifting.There are a lot of old school and modern american sport muscle cars overall which really made it for me and nice older cars such older m5 and m3 and whats not....AMG ONE and VULCAN AMR are absolutely incredible, amazing demonstration of physics and grip around the corners. What a pleasure to drive!Everything can be customized, you can adjust your beasts to straight line performance, drifting or turn into real cornering race car. Wide body's that give huge grip bonus, or the other way around remove any aero and just rip it on the straights. or do a mix of both and than you really have to learn your car, its breaking zones and its limit on the corners. Map: if you coming from TDU 2, think of it as Ibiza on a whole new level. You have one long highway in the middle of the map where you can enjoy some top speed runs, than a lot of smaller roads around the map. But those roads really designed well, it is a mix of straights and corners where you have to constantly adapt as you drive and really get used to your car. The terrain is incredible, as you cruise around the map you go in the mountains, forest and desert, constantly climbing, speeding downhill or just enjoying the bends. On really fast car it takes about 15-20min to circle the map, but than you can keep circling vertically and through other roads. There is also a huge volcano with amazing hill climb section to get there that already occupied by ppl drifting there 24/7 and they are pretty good at it. Very fun to just watch em do it. The runways next to Horizon event in the deserts is already full with people challenging each other with drag builds. Online experience: any driver that is not on your convoy is a ghost for you. So yesss finally you cannot collide with each other yet you still see each other. Once you join the convoy you are no longer ghosted and up to 12 people can be in one convoy together. You can complete races in co-op, and you and your friends get rewarded no matter who was first who second, or you can go PVP vs other people. If you ramming during races you become ghosted for some time until you cool it down, and you wouldn't even be able to draft on the slipstream. Ai in races is nasty! It is very difficult to beat which makes it more fun. What is more fun AI will always match your car! So you can enjoy any type of race with any type of cars with opponents driving same equal cars.So with good things out of the way lets focus on the bad things:Some tuned are ridiculous and will easily allow cars to reach 500km\h or 300mph in ridiculous low amount of time...its fun but not as I would like to see it.Still connection issues for convoy, so the best solution is to co-op some long race after which you and your friends will stay with each other in the session even if you change cars...dont know why or how but it seems to work...Still some performance issues with the game , low streaming bandwith textures, freezes in the game, crashes. Hopefully get fixed this week as promised. A very impressive game, for a real car enthusiast to enjoy. That once gets fixed and patched will probably be perfect.Also, wanted to add the Horizon events races missions, are very creative and enjoyable. Also, the Baja races those did it for me. I am a circuit kind of a person, but maaan those Baja races are really take you to this Horizon atmosphere and maaaaad fun...."

Buy it.Ok, seriously, if you don't know FH 4/5, it is an arcade open world car racing game which has some bits of simulation in it but is definitely not a realistic sim. In this game you can chose between a wide range of activities such as road/dirt/drag/country racing, beat records on speed traps or try a 1000ft jump on a danger sign. You can also just roam the road and enjoy the scenic views, and smash a few cardboards collectibles.The 5th comes with improved graphics and it is gorgeous, the environment is packed with a lot of details which brings life to the world. This time the action is in Mexico which allows for even more variety than previous England: seaside, desert, jungle, volcanic mountain, Maya ruins there is a lot to enjoy. The weather system has been improved with thunderstorms and sandstorms: obviously since it is the first week I have only seen Spring season, so I can't comment on Winter for instance.There are new and really nice volumetric smoke/particle effects: I like how when driving in the dirt, the trail of dust behind the car gets illuminated in red when hitting the brakes. It's one of those small details that make you nod in approval. There is just one silly thing with that: if you happen to be in a drift event in a Forzathon with 3+ cars drifting you won't see the road anymore because of the smoke: I am sure this will be adjusted later. The team is very reactive and already fixed in 1 day an issue with network connections.The lights also have been greatly improved. However the RTX is only working in the static view of the car, not in the open world. It honestly doesn't matter much, the lights are amazing in the Mexican night, but still worth saying.The physics are also improved and objects such as rocks or cacti are now bouncing more realistically. The feedback has been improved on the controller with added feedback for braking and is now more fine grained for drifting and off-road. All the controller dead-zones can also be adjusted in the settings.Also worth noting are the accessibility options: the game speed can be changed, the palette adjusted for different types of color blindness, adjustable subtitles, screen reader and even text-to-speech and speech-to-text can be activated in the settings. Good to see that this is not an afterthought and is well integrated in the game, and hopefully this will inspire other studios.So to summarize, this is an excellent casual car racing game that you can play the whole winter and then some more, coming back to it every week to play solo or online with friends and never get tired of it. And there are also 2 DLC coming."

FH5 shares alot of content with Forza Horizon 4, they cut some stuff out and added some. Feels more like a DLC then a standalone game. In my opinion the new map is really nice so I would still recommend especially when you dont own FH4. The graphics are a huge upgrade compared to FH4 which already looked great. The game runs very smooth and is well optimised but enableing the RTX settings causes some visual errors here and there. I hope they are going to fix this because there was no patch since day one yet. Hint: Buy the Willys Jeep, spend 5 skill points and get a Super-Wheelspin. Afterwards you repeat this over and over again. 😉"

In the menus as well as in-game. The new menu structure and changes to what things are called also make little sense. If they sort the car graphics there is a case to argue for Forza 5. Until such time, anyone looking for a nice racing sim ought to just stick with Forza 4."

I love how they kept the same formula. Just like the previous game, the game is well optimised despite looking so good. Cars sound MUCH better than Horizon 4, but also not the best out there. Still, a massive upgrade. They listened to the community feedback which is always nice for a game studio. However, I can still feel some ""recycled"" audio from cars to cars. Not a massive drawback but what can you expect when you have over 500 cars in the game. The game gives all the flexibility that you want when playing. Do you want a drag car? Drift car? Road racing car? Just relax and cruise? Anything is possible. Building up your car collection is easy as well. A bit grindy, but not so much. There's also multiple different race type and arcades that you can play. You can create/customise races as you want and even go as far as adding obstacles and stunts (GTA 5 style). For car customisation, I would say the only sad thing is that they removed all the Rocket Bunny kits from Horizon 4, but at the same time, we still got some new kits (Liberty Walk, Duke Dynamics, RWB, SSWORKS, Streethunters, TCP Magic, Varis, HKS, some Forza Originals and some fenders) and many more to discover (added content). They also added a new wing for many cars and the ability to space your wheels. I just wish they were more customisation but again, having 500+ cars is not an easy feat. At least the main or most popular cars got some nice available mods. They made some improvement on the in-game designer for all the people creating Itashas or any crazy design/logo.The map is okay. They made the roads very fun for a racing game. The only thing I hate is that it's missing buildings. You will find a lot of forest, dirt and sand but not enough ""town"". Driving all those crazy super/hyper/modded cars on a nature focused map feels out place sometimes. It's like they added more love to cross-country/dirt races and not so much for the street scenes. The map still looks amazing visually on maxed out. Knowing how they operated in the past, I am expecting a lot of upcoming great content. The game has a lot of room for improvement and I do not regret my purchase. Overall, the game is amazing and I recommend it for everyone."

So this game started off very well! I was a happy car boi for just under 2 hours. Then as buddies do, we start up a convoy to cruise in our first vehicles we've purchased and built. This is where I immediately, slid on a downhill slope that returned me to the shadow realm of being a sad car boi once again. This was the first time in my life I've witnessed a car just slowly disappear into thin air, and not only was it just one of my buddy's cars, it was all of them. And then there I was, connected with friends online but not really because once again I found myself driving alone. Depression is setting in as I realize that I had just pre ordered this game for 100 dollars, and the game barely works at all when it comes to online features. I will end on this, the game is very fun and the graphics are a sight to behold, but my god please fix your servers. My friends and I are tired of being sad."

A fun, beautiful, somewhat-arcadey experience with tons of cars and beautiful locations. Tons of activities and great tunes. Of course, I love taking in-game photos, so this was an auto-buy for me.I do hope they fix all the multiplayer problems though. I've got a few friends I'd love to convoy with and so far it's been a hit-and-miss affair, with mostly misses. They already have the problems on their known issues list, so here's hoping they get fixed before my pals move on to something else.Otherwise, this is still a must-own game for fans of the series, and casual racing fans like me. Although high level play is really up there and always awesome to watch. I hope this trend of ports to Steam continues for us who are region-locked away from getting these games from the MS Store."

In fh5 they improved all of that: Better engine sounds, better upgrades, way better and bigger map, graphics are good. One big flaw right now as of release are bugs, like a lot of them, but they are gonna release a day 1 patch that will fix a lot of them."

Multiplayer in this game has been in a sorry state since day one, and while it has received some improvements, it's still a mess, with desync and absurdly long loading times abound. And, instead of fixing that, we get updates with stuff like nerfing wheelspins(which is your main way of earning money in this game). Which is a shame, because the actual driving and wealth of cars is really fun. That's not the only issue with the game though. It also has a really bad ""campaign"" if you can call it that. The writing is pretty bad, and everytime a character calls me superstar it just makes me cringe. Let me make this clear though, the game is not bad. It's actually pretty aight.

It's a sentimental homage to the thrill of road-tripping through postcard-perfect holiday scenery, and an occasionally silly but always genuine Valentine to Mexico's world-famous culture. It's a long-distance, MMO-inspired racer that's bursting at the seams with more races, events, and event kinds than can reasonably fit on some portions of the map – but it never seems overwhelming. It never forces you to do something you don't want to do and consistently rewards you for your choices. It has a lovely appearance, a fantastic tone, and is a joy to play. Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things, to be sure. Above all, it's the work of a master racing company, and it's the greatest open-world racing game I've ever experienced."

I do however say go ahead and try GamePass to try the game and see if it's for you. The game released NOV 8th and as I am writing this review it's currently November 16th and this ""hotfix"" to fix all the performance issues and crashes just keeps getting pushed back further and further. First we were told by the end of the first week of release, the 12th goes by and we get an update saying ""next week"", well I expected early next week since they claimed the hotfix was almost ready, here we are on tuesday and we're being told we'll have an UPDATE later this week. Are we getting an UPDATE or the actual HOTFIX? There is no worse feeling in a racing game to be 12 MINUTES into a race and have your game crash in the last quarter. Oh yeah sure blame a couple 3rd party apps for the crashes... nothing like trying to divert blame when it's obviously your fault the game crashes constantly.

Mexico is probably one of the best maps in the series, if not in any open world racing game ever. - Fun side stories. - Amazing sound design. Huge step up from Forza Horizon 4 all around.- Variety (Street Racing, Mixed Surface Racing, Offroad Racing, PR Stunts, Stories, Expeditions, Battle Royale, Playground games, Livery customization, Custom race building, etc. etc.) - Dynamic and engaging driving physics. - Tuning. You can upgrade a car's performance anyway you want and make it do anything. You can make a cross country monster out of a Ferrari FXX and a quick circuit racer out of a 1956 Ford F-100. The freedom is paralleled - BMW Isetta CONS:- Horrible online. Every mode is riddled with bugs, server issues, long load times, and a lack of freedom. I have had to restart my game at least 15 times due to being frozen in a menu. - Rendering issues. - Horizon Arcade. It's such a step down from previous games that it baffles me. - No Custom Adventure. If you want to race online, you can't pick what class you want to race in or what type of racing you want to do. It was in Forza Horizon 4, why is it gone now? - No peel :(Overall it's definitely a great game, a solid 9/10 when it works, just be aware that if you're purchasing this just for the online it may be better to wait until those are fixed."

As per usual, playing with friends in the open world and in races often results in disconnects promoting a frustrating time at best and at worst the desire to completely quit due to the inability to finish a single race. The lead drivatar still outpaces the rest of the race making it next to impossible to win on higher difficulties without driving like a total scum bag. The worst offense of all though is the laughable level of security which is on par with every other horizon title. You are still able to connect CheatEngine to the game and exploit credits, xp, and your car collection without fear of repercussion. Even worse is the fact that there are already a dozen or so publicly available cheat tables to automate this to an extent and multiple trainers. This has lead to compromised leaderboard validity, the inability to play pvp due to untouchable exploited clients, and a growing disinterest in the game as the rampant and blatant use of exploits continues unhindered for the fifth time.When players are driving around in unreleased unobtainable cars two weeks after launch that's when enough is enough. I fail to see what Playground Games and Turn 10 spent the extra development time on here. This game at it's core is nothing more than a reskin of the last title with a few new gimmicks taped on and a few old systems overhauled and rebranded as ""new"".If you want to do some solo racing, then it's good enough for that, but if you are looking for anything more, I would search somewhere else. With the egregious failure of security, distasteful gimmicks, borderline manipulative ""overhauls"", and complete lack of innovation or iterative improvement of any kind, it is impossible for me to recommend this game in it's current state or for it's current price. If you want to experience this game, go pick up Horizons 4 for a fraction of the price."

Sadly I can't give a positive review because of a few negative aspects. Some accolades are way too hard to accomplish, you need luck, or spend way too much time learning/doing something or both at the same time, like the tunning ones or the paintings. And the biggest problem this game has is the fact that they remove every trace of competition from it. There is no point of playing the game once you have unlocked almost every car in the game, you have enough credits to buy or upgrade anything other than doing the weekly activities list. Every game mode is casual, there is no point of playing them, especially the Horizon racings, recently they added some levels to upgrade on Horizon Open and get some stickers on your name but still no rankings. Without a ranking system means that all the players are mixed together and it's very likely to play against people who is way better than you."

I felt like throwing-up after I clicked uninstall (had a oh sh#t moment about not knowing the location of the cloud save file) and it was too late. Re-installed both programs, signed into steam which was showing my 600+ hours, achievements etc... all was looking good. Fired up Forza in steam, signed into game, signed into the pop-app side xbox app, everything linked and NSYNC.  Was thinking, sweet, all gravy cannot wait to race online wiith an extra 20+FPS on my brand new 4K monitor.... I hit continue at Forza home screen... FBR!!! BACK TO THE START OF THE GAME!!!!! Gutted! I couldn't really give 2F's about my campaign progression or even my rank for that matter, but my CARS!!!!! My legitimately  owned  cars!!!! I had every high-end car, that I wanted anyway, including my pride and joy, the NSX R GT!!!! Took me weeks to finally find one in the auction and actually bid at the right time to get it!!!!!! This car cant ever be obtained again, unless it's auctioned by accident! It sucks cause truth be told, as of recent, I finally found form and was placing in the last 11 races and then this happens to me. I could live without my rank and progress.... but, MY CARS I cannot! I requested a full refund due to this, as there is nothing more I can do. Funny enough, it says if you have put in a substantial amount of hours into the game, a refund may not be possible. Given steam conveniently shows the logged hours that will be the loop whole to reject refund request, Even though, I'm forced to start again with NOTHING!!!!! Anyway, Id be happy to start from scratch, provided that all my cars can be restored, at the very least, my NSX R GT. All I ever play is multiplayer and even if I sucked it up and started again, it would take me a year to get the garage of cars I had, and competing with average cars until then will be painful knowing I had the top end cars to compete in the first place!

Surely when you have maybe half of featured cars it will become a little boring but there's always something to do like grinding cash for another expensive car and etc. But right now it's starting to become like usual gatcha mobile game... Compared to Horizon 4 (stopped playing after horizon 5 launch and had almost full car collection not counting FE), the grind was not that very scary, you could just do anything and still manage to get millions without noticing it. For this title, right now skill points are limited to 10 while (if I remember correctly) forza 4 didn't had this limitation, rewards become definitely smaller (rewards are a joke right now) and drivavatars are so overpowered that it's impossible to drive normally and you have no other choice but ram to them and just slide with walls to pass them and hopefully finish first. Maybe it needs some time for drivavatars to learn tracks and so on, but it really makes them look unnatural when they are unmovable and have unlimited grip and acceleration that makes you frustrated. I haven't tried multiplayer that much but I heard that there exists cheaters (at least I haven't met one). And at least for me I don't see any point anymore to play further this game. It become just logging in for Forzathon event, get points to receive event featured cars and wait another week for another event, just like other gatcha game...Talking about graphics, it looks really gorgeous... if you watch a youtube video of someone playing this game on console. I'm using GTX 1080 and I tried so many solutions, but it still looks very crappy, Draw distance are very noticeable that it's just pain to look at it and overall I don't really see anything special. Forza 4 on the other hand looks better than this on my machine, so I'm guessing this is a issue with PC release because I'm not the only one with these kind of ""features"".Overall, I would not recommend this game for now, better buy forza 4 on sale (if they didn't nuke progression like they did for forza 5). I can't see a really good future for this game with these kind of changes, so my suggestion for developers would be fix their priorities, fix graphical bugs, fix AI, make game more enjoyable and worth your time so we could have a reason to play it every day (no heavy grind please)."

It's clear that they tried to put a heavier focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game, by making it easier to invite strangers to a race and join a lobby. The general scheme of the game stayed the same, it seems they focused on improving upon the previous game, than trying to make crazy changes, which worked well. They do seem to have gotten rid of competitive multiplayer though (or I didn't find it yet).Unfortunately Alfa Romeo/Fiat are gone due to licensing issues (thank you Stellantis), which is a shame, but they might be added back later like Mitsubishi and Toyota were in the previous title. With that said, this is still probably the biggest car inventory of any new racing game on the market. The audio of the cars (which was a big complaint of the previous title) has noticeably improved, though it depends on the model.The map is very large and has many unique areas to explore. Finally there are some long straight roads to max out your cars, but there are also many bends and turns to make for some good races. It's also much bigger than Scotland; after my current playtime I've been to every corner but still don't know every road. I spotted a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing that annoys me too much (floating fences and so on). The graphics are just like the previous title -- amazing, just look at the screenshots.The soundtrack is okay, some songs I like and some I don't. In my opinion it could be bigger and have more variety for a game whose setting is a Festival. Sure, you can always have Spotify or some other thing playing on the side, but it won't be as well integrated. Also, if you turn the sound off, it will stay off (even after you restart the game), unlike the previous title. Overall I recommend this game, if you're looking for an arcade racer with a lot of stuff to explore. I bought it for ~50€ on sale which is fine, for what it offers. (I always try to keep my games below 0,50€/h of playtime and I'm pretty confident I can reach 100h in this one without getting bored.) I probably missed some things in this review, just because there's so much to this game, but for now that's all I have to say.Update 11/2022: The game has enjoyed regular content updates, same as the previous title (if not better).

I'm not sure if it's my drivers or the game itself but unless I'm driving in-game it crashes, no matter what I do in Menu's like customisation, certain cars and certain parts like specific paint colours and wheels etc just crash the game once you try to apply them to your car its pretty much unplayable unless I just buy the car, keep it stock and start driving it. This isn't what I asked for when paying £80 in a Triple A game made by a well established Company that SHOULD know what they're doing by now..I mean come on it's been Months since Launch and I crash twice within 10 minutes of playing.. Also since Forza Horizon 3 the public have been asking for more customisation yet they feel the need to ignore that which should be a very fundamental part of the game, and instead add useless features like Pronouns and Prosthetics so they can push this ""diversity"" move on the consumer to make themselves look good. No offence to anyone it's a point that the company doesn't genuinely care about you it's just about their image. NFS Heat came out like 5 years ago and you can customise Camber, Tyre Stretch, Tinted Lights, Exhaust Sound/Flames, Side mirrors, Exhaust Tips, Actually lower a car to the ground, Bumpers on every Car not just Forza Bumpers etc etc."

Far better than any nfs (except for the lack of cops). Graphics are amazing. Reminds me of BDO but much better!I totally recommend this game to anyone into arcade racing at the highest level of polish and detail.I won't upvote this game simply because it's lacking in 2 aspect that are very important for me personaly, so don't take them to heart.The first one is plot/writting. This game has the cringiest dialogs I've experienced. Seems like they tried to make as safe for work as possible, even when they are talking to street racers. Everyone is very bland. Also everyone calls you ""superstar"" and praise you everytime you race, which is embarrassing. It's like they think you are some sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they feel sorry for you.The other aspect are the avatars. Everyone who knows me knows I like working with girl beauty ideals and trying to explore its reaches and aesthetic values/symbolisms (like how the color palette of the face can affect the compatible color palette for makeup, clothing and even hair). In a nutshell, avatars for girls in this game are dreadful. Even though they copy pasted the same racial archetypes from FH4, I can't understand why they made them look way worse than before. The eyes are almost popping out, yet eyes are smaller. Girls lack makeup. The skin is darker for all races. My favorite girl of HF4, the south eastern asia looking, has an off puting smile fixed in her face. I'm afraid to think they intentionally did these downgrades to imply they are more latin american now, but it's a possibility.I just make her wear a covid mask to avoid looking at her weird grin and I keep enjoying the game very much, always wondering if the devs ever going to fix the avatar, but not letting that take away from my experience."

Handling: My friends and I were skeptical at first that they were tinkering with the handling because it was so precise in previous titles, but they added a weighty feeling to all the cars that make you actually use the brakes and be cautious of spinouts. It feels much better now. Setting: Cannot be happier with the choice of Mexico. The landscapes capture the richness of the jungles and the barrenness of the desert/dunes perfectly. They've spread the events and progression well in my opinion. It may seem like the map is overloaded with things to do, but they are giving you all the freedom to do what you want. Use the map filter if you want to focus on certain things, it is there for good reason. Graphics: Beautiful, possibly better than real life. 11/10.

There are way too many things to unlock in this game, so much so that it's overwhelming. This may sound like a good thing, but it's not. None of them provide any benefits. Also, you start off with a top tier car. That's stupid to me. I'd rather they port a version of Horizon 3 over here. This map is all bare desert, it is the worst aspect of this game. The Horizon 4 map is the best in my opinion, save for the highway. Also while the winter season and spring season sucked in Horizon 4, they were still a cool aspect and nice change of scenery."

But when the bugs are copy pasted from FH4 it just goes to show that they simply don't care about the server issues they promised to fix. The gameplay itself is fun and the map and tracks are fantastic. Engine sounds are much better. It's just everything surrounding the game that's problematic. Here's some of the issues you'll come across online:-Endless loading screens for online races. (exact same issue as in fh4)-Power doesn't cost pi for some rwd cars and they have even more grip than in fh4. Those builds can be up to 3-10 seconds faster on certain tracks-Starting event lab races that you created won't show added props for other players in the raceIt just feels like the alpha patch for the game. Clearly they did no testing for these issues or they ignored them. They always seem to neglect anything to do with online racing. They even removed GOOD features from fh4 such as ranked and custom adventure while adding nothing. So now you're forced into doing races you don't want to do like s2 CC (which has 0 cars that reach 998). I don't understand how things like this can be overlooked. In summary, if you enjoy racing online just give this game a miss until it's fixed and the CORE ENDGAME FEATURES from fh4 are added back in. Even if you enjoy just doing rivals then good luck, there are many easy exploits for rivals times that are allowed by the in game systems. Games nowadays don't seem to do any testing and it's unacceptable."

The game has a lot to like about it: great graphics, great sound, very wide collection of cars that all feel quite different, driving is satisfying and the map is big and has a bit of everything. However, it's absolutely ruined for me because the game constantly throws things at me I don't want and can't turn off:The game hijacks control and opens the map when I get some unlocks.The game automatically starts challenges when I drive through areas where they're set up. This also removes collision with other cars (you can just drive through them), changes my destination on the GPS and triggers various visual effects, sounds and cringey dialogues, completely breaking immersion.The game constantly reminds me I'm not playing in online mode. And that this or that game mode exists. And that I can send cars to people. And all kinds of other useless crap I don't care about. These are just a few things off the top of my head. If I were to jump in the game and drive around for 10 minutes Im sure I could find more. I get that the game is supposed to be an arcade and not a driving simulation, but there's no reason in not letting the player opting out of being constantly accosted with things he doesn't care about.This isn't even getting into the awful writing pertaining any line of dialogue, scripted event, cutscene and story point. Everything that happens in this game tells you how amazing of a driver and person you, the player are. You can hardly find an interaction with a character that doesn't at least mention how you're the best driver in the world. Whenever you turn on the radio you're gonna find some ""news"" about how you're such a legends. All the cutscenes and scripted events are so grand in scale and hype that they remove any sense of realism or immersion you might have had left. Hell, there are even scripted races where you're slightly behind the entire race then make a miraculous recovery and get in the first place meters away from the finish line, no matter how good or bad you were driving. And it's not an isolated event, it happens over and over and over again, as if the player is too stupid to realize what's happening.For the same reason, I suspect, the progression in this game is messed up. You get your first supercar as soon as you start the game. Within a few hours of playing the game you already have more supercars than a billionaire obsessed with them and everyone refers to you as the best driver in the world.The annoying part is that they had a good game at some point in development. But then they created a bunch of content that seemingly came out of a chinese mobile game and shoved it down the players throat. It blows my mind that over a year after the release they still didn't give us the option to turn all of it off. The game, as it is now has enough good to keep me coming back once in a while to drive around a bit, but I always close it with a bitter taste in my mouth because of all the extra ♥♥♥♥ I can't turn off and embarrassed that I spent time and money on a game designed to make children feel good about themselves."

As a completionist, every race, every objective I try to beat, new ones are appearing on the map like there is no end to it just like the previous game, which is nice! There can be so many icons on the map that I have to use the filter once again to see where everything I need is. If you're like me, and you've played FH4 then you might be disappointed with this one because a lot of ""Hard to Find"" vehicle can now be purchased straight from the autoshow. A lot of them are no longer locked behind races or by doing events or behind a wheelspin.Some cars that can only be earned by reaching certain levels or from different driving series like road racing, cross-country, dirt, drag racing, street racing,, drift, speed traps, danger zones for crazy jumps and speed zones. Others cars can be earned by just completing a car collection or by driving around the map & destroying private properties or kicking dirt with drift & burnouts in someone's yard & windows, or simply by driving recklessly & pulling dangerous near misses & stunts to increase various parts of the ""Horizon Life"" experience & reputation.The progression is measured by an ""Accolades"" system & a level system. The more accolades points people earn, the higher their level is with a max level of 2999 or 10 ★ (prestige) still. Each action the player does in the game will be rewarding, including ramming into your neighbor's fences! I don't recommend doing that in real life, however. No matter how much you hate your neighbor. ""APs"" can be earned with the following steps I mentioned above and by showing off your taste & even your artistic skills. Taking enough pictures of cars or the beautiful scenery will give the player more points. But the same goes for creating some 3000-layer-stunningly good-looking paint jobs for a car of the player's choice to help them earn money & Accolades. On top of that, if you are a mechanic expert, then by customizing & tuning vehicles, it's possible to become famous & rich among other players by sharing the best tuning setups to make a car drive better. The same goes for creating paint jobs or just small stickers for everyone to use. So, in case you have none of those skills in you, you can always search for various stickers to put together & create your dream car and download someone's tunes to help you progress through a race you hate so much because the only car you own for a specific class requirement happens to feel like a boat.The UI is kind of bad. A grid rather than a slider feels like it's too much work when you just want to install the best of everything in the custom upgrade menu. This was originally a console game in mind, so I don't get those bad cursor UI designs in games.And speaking of skills! If you're the kind of person who sucks at every racing game, you're just terrified of touching a simulator game because they're often too hard for you, well you shouldn't be scared. After all, you can always adjust the game difficulty along with the AI difficulty & turn them into brainless drivers. If that's not enough for you, there's even an option for assisted steering & brakes, which will pretty much turn the car for you & slow down before every turn. Although I don't know anyone who would use that, but hey! It's optional! Difficulty bonus can no longer go beyond 100%. Shifting set to manual, driving line, damage & tire wear, rewind no longer affect the difficulty bonus CR which is a shame in my opinion.Now back to creativity & AI for a moment. Those who are creative or even cheap & non-competitive can abuse this creation system by creating their race & drive around the map, drawing the race lines they want & the AI will follow. Other players, too, if they don't realize what you've been up to by creating a race track while drunk, ramming into every tree, trash cans & street lights. I'm telling you, the AI will follow! The traffic won't go away while creating them, by the way, so you can also tell whenever someone just crashed into a car while creating the race just because the line will suddenly have a Z in it.As mentioned earlier, there's a lot to be done in this game. There's a form of story mode related to Horizon Festival, but more is to be done even after completing those. So, a Festival playlist consists of completing multiple race events to increase the progression gauge up to 100 PTS for a ""Hard to Find"" car, or an access pass to new events & up to 160 PTS for a legendary ""Hard to Find"" vehicle, just like the previous game. That's the main ""story."" Then there's also a seasonal event that lasts about two weeks with another completion rate of 25 PTS & 40 PTS for random vehicles, which can also be purchased from other players at the auction house for those who hate grinding or for less-skilled players or even received as a gift now thanks to that new feature.Almost everything can be played with friends & strangers, either in co-op or against each other. I haven't played a lot of multiplayer modes this time around.Those who want to own everything in the game will have to work for it. Certain vehicles, horns, character accessories, clothes &... stupid dance moves can only be acquired by purchasing them with Forza Points (FP) from the Forzathon Shop. To earn points, the player must participate in a live group event that occurs randomly on the map. Everyone must participate to earn those points. But not to worry! There's nothing competitive about that event. It's similar to Burnout Paradise's online challenges if you ever played that game. As for the character appearance, the player will be greeted with a character customization menu at the beginning of the game with 25 characters presets to choose from, the ability to change the hairstyle, and hair color, add prosthetic arms/legs, identity to be addressed as ""he/him, she/her, they/them"". Along with two voice options for male & female. Now the character can speak. The player can change their character at any time from their home or from the Horizon Festival. As for clothes like tops, jackets, dresses, legs, ankles for socks, face masks, outfits & accessories, a lot of them will be locked behind a completion system. But it can be unlocked with wheel spins & super wheelspins, which is some form of loot boxes that can be earned pretty quickly by just leveling up (Similar to the Overwatch loot box system, if you ever played that). Lastly, the player can also buy houses, beach houses and some rich-looking houses. Houses, houses everywhere. They don't do much other than looking great or bragging rights and setting the player closer to the desired location on the map. Some will give special perks, however, like double Forzathon points or the ability to fast travel.And lastly, the new weather system. But nothing too fancy. I barely noticed any storms outside of the prologue.Well, that's about it for now! I hope that this review was helpful to you! And I'm sincerely sorry for this wall of text! Feel free to comment down below if you want to know more about the game, or if you wish to correct something I said, even though you probably own the game already & you're just a curious person! Either way, I appreciate it!"

Sure, this is just a DLC to Horizon 4, but listen up.Could you drive Porsches in Horizon 4, or any of the previous titles, without the constant fear of death? No.Could you drive an Acura Integra without it feeling like someone put dinner trays under the rear wheels without you noticing? No.Horizon 5 has FINALLY, after pretty much 12 years since the release of FM3, made driving with this physics model/engine feel good and intuitive.For me that's all that Horizon 4 was missing, decent driving physics.Now, the game is still a sim-cade, more towards sim, with its own twist on what is considered ""realistic"".Take for example, all cars still feel heavier than they should, they rotate slower than you'd expect, more noticeable in cars that are extremely light.This definitely has its advantages, playing on a gamepad or even keyboard is made easier because the cars aren't super twitchy allowing more people with different driving styles to still succeed at the game.Keep in mind, playing this game on a wheel may feel rather disconnected due to this style they went for.All-in-all, Horizon 5 is a great way to say goodbye to this physics model, if the Motorsport reboot changes this (and I hope they do), and I'm really glad it exists.Gameplay wise, it's very close to Horizon 4. Open world, race what you want when you want, do the festival playlist, etc.Now you have the accolades, small achievements to complete, but once you're done with the ones that give you good rewards there isn't much else to do than the usual cycle of ""Tune car, try it online"".Speaking of the accolades, they found it a good idea to have some tied to vinyl downloads, tune downloads, and so on, which is great for completionists who don't have a platform to just boost their numbers...I wholeheartedly recommend this game if you're looking for a fun experience with cars in a very nice and diverse map.I wouldn't recommend this game if you're looking for fair competitive racing because their car performance measuring system is clearly not up to the task anymore, but if you don't mind sticking to a broken META, you should be just fine.TL;DRFinally, good driving physicsIt's almost like Horizon 4, but better gameplay in generalBuy if you want to have funDon't buy if you want fair competitive racing"

You can race on the road, drift, go offroad, play the campaign, do the side quests or just drive around and explore Mexico - you can have fun as you want. There are online and offline races, meaning that if you're not too experienced in racing games you can lower your difficulty level and just enjoy your drive with easy bots that won't leave you 10 km behind. Forza Horizon is all about freedom and having fun with cars.The graphics are stunning, this is clearly one of the best-looking games in 2021. The landscapes, VFXs (like smoke and water splashes), biomes, and Mexico towns... Just sit down and admire. The game has been released on older console generations (Xbox One) which unfortunately downgrades the graphics experience and raytracing is available in the Forzavista only (however, I think it isn't too good - i have an RTX 3060 Ti, so I have raytracing, but it hadn't impressed me too much). The car sounds are very good, they are definitely improved from the Forza Horizon 4. I still think they need some upgrades though. Character voiceovers are cool (real Mexican actors dubbed the Mexican in-game charachters) and the music is fine too (I liked FH4 radio stations more, but it's a matter of taste). And finally - our own charachter has a voice too!The story is about a Horizon Festival and the different activities around it. You are the Horizon Superstar, the most known person here and you are helping to build this show. The story isn't too long, but it's only the addition to the game. You get access to the next chapters by collecting accolades (which you get for progressing in the game). You can complete it in around 20 hours without speedrunning). The game itself can be played indefinitely - it's never-ending and always expanding!The game has a few issues and bugs, but Playground Games is often releasing updates with bugfixes. The game requires a pretty fast PC, it runs at around 70-90 FPS on my PC (Ryzen 5 3600, RTX 3060 Ti, 16 GB RAM, installed on SSD) with Ultra/Extreme (highest possible) settings at 2560x1440p (2K) resolution. Occasional lags or errors happen, but I have never experienced any crashes or other bigger problems. Talking about the price - simply, it's worth it. Even at the full price. You get an amazing game with a lot of content and features. I pre-ordered the Premium Edition and I'm not disappointed. Go buy it now!"

I would recommend trying to get the game on sale as well as it is on the expensive side at full price.All in all 9/10 couple of bugs and freezes rarely though, awesome game cool cars.Played with: Intel Core-i7 11800-H processor, NVIDIA Geforce RTX 3050-Ti, 16 GB RAM"

Having skipped FH4, FH5 makes me glad to have done so. In 30 hours of playtime (at the time of writing), the only differences I've found between FH5 and FH3 are a few set-pieces and the map. That's just not good enough. FH5 and FH3 feel exactly the same in all the ways that matter. I'm wondering if some of the people writing the glowing reviews it has been getting have played the previous games.Why haven't I refunded it? Because I enjoy the livery editor and I love cars.

It's more than a week that there is a glitch that permits some cars to go way faster then the other cars. Devs are not fixing this quickly.- Online services for convoys and social life is still malfunctioning. This means that you will have often problems to see players in your convoy, that you have to recreate convoys when this happens, and that sometime you will have to start a race with not all the players in your convoy. Also, not all the players are usually visible in your map, some of them will only spawn very close to you.- Horizon Radios are very limited. Prepare your Spotify playlists if you want more kinds of music in your game.- VIP benefits are broken. There is a very strong possibility that you could not be able to have those.- Longevity of the game is very short. Once you complete the story, expect to do always the same things, just like in FH4. Weekly series are very short and only last 2 / 3 hours. Lots of bugs in these challenges too.- Not enough updates from Playground to refresh and/or fix the game."

What can I say, and from the 3rd part the differences are minimal.⭐️Car park:⭐️In the 5th part there is a very large fleet of vehicles, in which there is no point.  Most machines are not needed at all.  Also, due to the fact that the developers decided to add such an amount of transport, they scored on detailing and elaboration.  Some cars are missing textures.Tuning is also weak.  There are a couple of bumpers to choose from.  and terrible spoilers.⭐️Graphics:⭐️(2k)(maximum graphics settings)There is no evolution in comparison with the 4th part.  The same problems with anti-aliasing.  In the sun, the game looks disgusting, and this is Mexico, and the sun is constantly here.  More or less at night.⭐️Artificial intellect:⭐️There are also no coordinates.  NPCs follow their own trajectory, and all the stars are similar to each other.  After dozens of races, the game gets boring. ⭐️Final conclusion:⭐️1. It is no different from part 4.2. Graphics.  Not really.3. Artificial intellect. Dumb.Not recommended for purchase!

I found myself constantly saying ""Need for Speed did it better"" at every corner of the game despite NFS not being particularly  groundbreaking either. The UI in FH5 is terrible - it's slow, doesn't make much sense and there's dozens of redundant prompts that get in the way every 5 minutes. Your party leader might queue you up for a race, but you're so deep in UIs that by the time you can back out of all the menus the 10 second (yeah, only 10) timer to accept the event runs out, and you get kicked from the party and everyone has to exit and re-party up again.The sound design of the cars is lifeless. Cars are tinny and there's little to no bass in any of them. To call it 'award-winning' is a joke. And don't get me started on the balancing. This is one of the most unbalanced, or stupidly balanced games I've ever played. Sure, the game gives you over 600 cars to choose from, but only about 10 of them are actually competitive, while the rest might have the same rating as another player's car but only have half the top speed, or slide out uncontrollably on near-straights.There are a very limited amount of race courses in this game, with the devs opting to allow the community to foster their own tracks and have them curated on front pages and in weekly challenges. The problem is people make awful tracks. I just want tracks that flow and have readable/sensible corners, with walls or props that indicate a clear direction. Instead, you get these wonky tracks with no walls or indication whatsoever to where you need to turn, so you spend the entire race staring at your GPS/minimap in the bottom corner of the screen rather than on the road.The story is pretty lacklustre as well, not to mention how 'happy' everything is. Everyone's way too cheerful and the dialogue is cringe. I'd rather not have the story at all to be honest. But it doesn't last long and after a handful of 'races' with random challenges you're on your own to just do whatever. There's no drive to do anything. Now, the game has some good parts to it as well. I very much prefer its physics over Need for Speed, and it's kinda pretty. But that's about it to be honest.I've played this game mainly as a social outlet to play with a couple of friends, and that's really what this game is. It's a social experience with racing, rather than a racing game with friends. But it even contradicts itself in that, as your interactivity with other players is very limited. To remove toxicity, there's no open chat, only a very limited chat system where you get 4 context-sensitive chat messages you can send, but you have to WIN them in lootboxes this game calls 'wheelspins'. You can't send cars or money to your friends without buying them with premium currency - speaking of which, I don't think you can even buy the 'premium' currency. They look like they're special, but you just get them from doing a bunch of dumb challenges.Buy it on sale if you have a bunch of friends who would be happy to join you, or if you're a car fanatic or just want to drive around for a while. But if you're looking for a serious racing game to play, this is 100% not it. Get any Need for Speed if you want basically everything mentioned in this review done significantly better minus the physics, or buy Assetto Corsa if you desire the physics and an open playground."

It is probably fine with keyboard or controller but is basically unplayable with a wheel.  The control scheme is wild with sensitivity and the user definable settings to adjust the control scheme make it worse at best.  PS2 games have better handling models with wheel support.

XP boards are bugged, game design and gameplay are just not thought through, and drivatar mechanics are completely screwed up.It seems like there wasn't much though between ""making it a challenge"" and ""just making it harder"". Anything above average difficulty makes it seem like the front running drivatars are a Performance class above, and the backmarkers are Stock cars with good drivers. As a casual player, it makes it frustrating to try and hop back in, do some seasonal events, and the drivatars are locked to Highly Skilled.Also, it's not just the drivatars that make this game frustrating...PR Stunt (Danger signs, Speed Zones/Traps, etc) placement wasnt thought out. You'll be doing a danger sign where you jump straight into buildings, trees, unlandable terrain, the speed zone by the main festival goes through the exit to the site from one direction, trailblazers are overly difficult...the only stunt still making me want to play is the drift zones.This game by itself is fun, but if you try to do events, or don't grind every day, I would not recommend this Horizon. It seems like Playground Games knows they can make money just by releasing a new Horizon, which is why i waited a year to even consider buying it on sale half off. A year later, it doesn't seem like any work was put, and FH3, FH4, and FH5 all cost same price."

Absolutely stunning visuals and super detailed car models from a huge selection of vehicles. Driving physics with a controller feel  amazing, even if you're not the racing game type of player. Only real downside as of doing this review are the multiplayer issues, meaning friends in a convoy disappear and reappear on a constant basis, also the online events such as 'Horizon Arcade' are barely able to be completed since some servers are just plain empty or other drivers are not visible. I would say that the latter problem will be fixed pretty soon due to being such a newly released title. Optimization wise FH5 is probably one the best games released this year considering the graphics, but that wasn't that difficult in 2021, but props where props are due, 'Playground Games' did an amazing job on this new sequel in the 'Horizon' series.Post Patch (December): 'Horizon Arcade' seems to be somewhat fixed due to it now being scaled down to the amount of players participating in the event which means they are achievable solo fairly easily. Convoys were patched as well, there's no disappearing issue, however either the convoy leader or the members can't see each other completely. Will probably still need some patience for this to work solid. - Fixed!First Expansion - Hot Wheels: This is one of the best DLC's I've ever played in any game! If you've never got to experience it in Forza Horizon 3 like me, definitely grab it for FH5."

This is my first intro besides a little bit of gameplay from Horizon 3, and my review will be limited to the premium edition as that's what I got and other players who only have the base game may have a different experience. That being said, my other friends don't have the premium and don't feel like they are missing out on much so do with that what you will, obviously the big bonus of premium is the future content/expansions being bundled and discounted rather than having to purchase them separately.Pros:Great variety and customizationGreat graphics and optimizationFun to play online with friends and take part in eventsLots of things to doThe way they are doing seasons seems interesting, but also wish that they could be longer than 3-4 days each for the small ones.The rewind feature works incredibly well, especially online. I'm honestly amazed at how they were able to implement it so seamlessly, and it adds a lot to the game and helps tone down frustration if you are trying to complete specific objectives in free roam as well. That being said, the only time I've ever had the game crash (2 at this time) have both been related to me rewinding and the game freezes and crashes shortly afterward. Haven't been able to notice anything in particular that might have set it off.Meh:Lots of small details in the game when you are playing, but also weirdly enough a lack of them, hopefully some features will get implemented later like skipping cutscenes, and other UI decisions that will probably be suggested by the Horizon community.I'm sure there's more stuff but I'll probably add stuff in as I play more.Cons:Story is forced and it's literally torture having to watch unskippable cutscenes with terrible acting and lines. Wish we could skip all the animations that are in the game like the barn finds as well.Other story events are annoying where you are racing some AI like in the showcase events where they look like they are rubberbanding all over the place. The first showcase event with the motorcycles has it bad, and the bikes literally look like they are floating on the ground while they are driving, there's no actual substance to their movements if that makes any sense.Online definitely has issues, constant DC's, being forced to go into free roam from whatever menu you are in just to reconnect, players in your convoy disappearing in front of you or on the map, etc. Also weirdly enough your car stopping anytime you get DC's, which is super frustrating for those who get DC'd often. By that time a restart usually ends up resolving it though.Some parts of online, especially Arcade are frustrating mostly because of a lack of players, there isn't much incentive to play them, which makes it all the more harder if you are trying to do any seasonal or whatever objective and there is literally no one at each point. Maybe a queuing feature could mitigate that? Alternatively just play with friends but they aren't always available.The XBOX live integration leaves something to be desired, sometimes it just won't connect to online even though in game I am online and can play with friends. It's easiest to just join a friend by sending them an invite through in game instead of the XBOX overlay, or them specifically joining you outright.All in all though I'd say the game has been worth it so far, and I look forward to the improvements they'll make and whatever else will happen down the line."

They pretty much said it was one of the best racing games ever. I owned FH4, got all the passes and DLCs and whatnot. So I paid 100€ for this one too, seeing as it was supposed to be a 10/10 game.So I bought the thing and quickly realized someone was lying to me. What was released was essentially a half-product, something that needed months of fixes and updates. And now, even after these months have passed, trees and leaves are still popping up when you drive closer and there's flickering in more detailed textures. And sadly this isn't on lower-end settings, I own a decent setup.How they still haven't been able to address this is beyond me, there are comments about this all over the net. There have been constant updates and the developers have acknowledged to having technical difficulties. So why a well-known review site have it a perfect 10 is beyond me. Sadly I've fallen for the hoax and shelled out a fair chunk of money for a game that isn't worth it even after several months of updates.FH4 was, and still is, a lot more enjoyable, so I can't fathom how they've managed to screw up the visuals so bad this time.  If they ever manage to fix the constant flickering and foliage popups, I'll get back to it, but for now, I've uninstalled it. Shame, if you ask me."

Many of the features such as accolades remain broken, online is still dodgy, and they have completely gutted many of the game reward amounts. Any new players will be hugely behind everyone who was able to get lots of money and good cars when the rewards were higher.Online works a bit better, but it's marred by bad matchmaking, cheaters, horrid lobby system, no ranked racing, and no way to enter into certain classes or race styles. Creative features do not allow you to save and edit maps (they've been promising this feature for a while, but instead prioritized reducing player rewards.)I will make one amendment to my previous review, turning off many of the driver controls, stability, etc makes drifting feel a lot better.==============Original review:The game itself is pretty good as a single-player experience but I can't recommend it for the multiplayer aspect which is being touted as the major feature. Most online activities are busted, Arcade challenges are bugged and when they do work you're lucky to get 2 or 3 players, limited communication options, player cars rarely populate into the world making it feel like a ghost town, and there are constant connection issues, not counting frequent crashes and other horrible bugs.I got the premium edition and so far it has absolutely not been worth it. The VIP benefits often ""forget"" to register correctly, the welcome pack cars are quickly outclassed by a few wheel spin wins or a decent upgrade.  I do plan on playing further to see if they can patch this game closer to what was advertised, and will revisit my review accordingly, but so far it's been a let down.Also of note:-Drifting is fun but drift scoring is wack. Feels like you get twice as many points drifting at 50MPH at 10 degrees than 40MPH going sideways.-Playing for one weekend I've already discovered 100% of the roads on the map, own a quarter of all cars and all but one house, did all barn finds, and found 90% of various other collectibles. The map is dense, but kind of small, I think I had a lot of time to explore because online doesn't work well..."

Hot Wheels is meant to be all about super high speeds and gravity defying layouts. The real problem is that Hot Wheels Park has absolutely terrible flow. It seems like absolutely zero thought was put into the layout of the map. Honestly, did the devs even playtest this DLC? Off the top of my head, here are some examples of track sections with bad design:> Sideways track (non-magnetic) that is too banked, so gravity pulls you towards the guard rail and you lose all your speed> Braking zones over a crest where there is low grip, so you crash into the guard rail and lose even more speed than is necessary> Uphill / almost vertical acceleration zones, where you take ages to build speed while the AI powers on and easily overtakes you> The half-pipe, which has absolutely no grip when you are not on the racing line, making it extremely boring to drive through> Extremely inconsistent physics on magnetic track, resulting in unpredictable car handling and acceleration> Sharp turns or heavy braking zones placed right after blind sections of track (like a loop) which are impossible to foresee so you just slam into the barrier (but the AI is programmed to take it perfectly)> The fact that you can't complete loops in most low cars because the force pushing you into the track is so great that the bottom of your car literally clips through the floor, losing you speedAnother problem with the DLC is the Hot Wheels Academy which is supposed to be the main attraction. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to lock you out of using FAST CARS in HOT WHEELS and force you to use crappy slow cars that can barely go up a ramp? Not only does this make progression annoying, but it also just breaks the game. Even after becoming a Hot Wheels legend and unlocking X-class cars, certain maxed out cars (e.g. FE Sesto, BTTB) are UNUSABLE in Hot Wheels Park because their hidden PI rating is too high and the game thinks your Academy Rating is too low so it forces you to change car...Another big letdown with this DLC is the track builder. The opening race is - sadly - the best part of the DLC, because it takes you around the whole map and they even spend all this time explaining all the cool new track pieces (which is unfortunately plagued with cringe Forza dialogue). For some reason, however, they don't let you use ANY of these in Eventlab??? All you can do is place orange track, crossroads, and boosters... No Air Track, no Ice Track, no Water Flume, no Magnet Track, no Halfpipe. Oh yeah on the topic of massive disappointments, I should also mention that the Hot Wheels Goliath is garbage. It's meant to be the flagship race of the DLC but instead of taking you through the cool parts of the map it's just a mindless cruise around the perimeter with a few loops thrown in here and there. The weekly A-class event around the Ice Cauldron was more fun than the Goliath, which is saying a lot considering how often these weekly events are mind-numbingly boring.To top it all off, the racing is awful. The pre-made races are extremely short and like usual in Forza, you start right at the back. This makes it impossible to win at higher AI difficulties because there's isn't enough time to overtake everyone unless you ram into them early on. In addition to this, the track is narrow and the guardrail on both sides prevents you from dipping your wheels into the dirt to try and get past as is possible in the base game. Add to this the myriad of track layout issues I mentioned earlier and you get a recipe for disaster.Epic fail."

Absolutely recommend it, but maybe not for full price (idc how delusional western companies get with their prices, I'll never pay more than 50 euros). From what I've heard Premium Pass isn't worth buying either, because the content updates are insignificant, so beware. Just get the Hot Wheels stuff if you enjoy the game and want more.- , on par with what you had in something like DiRT 2/DiRT Rally, but with much better tarmac/grip physics. A bit simcade-ish.- Totally . I only have anti-break-lock assist enabled, but for some RWD muscle cars I also enable traction control. No other assists needed.- . You can play this game and practically enjoy a vacation to Mexico through it. You get to see 1:1 replicas of real-life landmarks (e.g. Aztec/Mayan pyramids).-  Yes, some are duplicates in different configurations (e.g. a regular 240SX and a Formula Drift 240SX), but it's still hilarious to me that people complaining about the car roster, when they probably haven't used a 10th of what's in the game. Admittedly, having some eastern-European car brands like Škoda and Lada would be nice though.- very . This is the 2nd prettiest RTX game I own (after Amid Evil). My AMD 5800X + NVidia RTX2070 run it at solid 75 fps on ultra/extreme settings with ray-tracing on.- The  - much stronger than in your average NFS game. Combine that with the spectacular car physics and you get a game where you actually have to know how to drive really well. On hardest difficulty you might even have to strategize in order to win, e.g. in one of my early races I started last and the 1st guy always built up a big lead and the race ended by the time I would've reached him. The trick was to not overtake the 2nd guy early, because he was able to stay in drafting distance of the 1st guy, so I basically had to do a slipstream train with him and bumper-boost him, until we eventually both overtook the 1st guy at the same time.- The ! It knows how to defend the inside line leading to corner and seems to have personalities: some are cheeky and will use you as a wall in corners, while others respect your space.- The  - this goes as far as everyone taking rally cars with official liveries if you take one like that, or e.g. If you upgraded some old Toyota Celica to 800bhp, the AI will also take old cars that got tuned up to beasts.- Nice , if you're willing to take different cars to races - take a buggy, trophy truck or SUV and you can get something like a DiRT 2 Raid or Landrush race, because the AI will match the car class. Also, it's not just circuit races. There's A->B rally/trailblazer/road race type races, as well as stunts drifting, gymkhana, rallycross, Baja off-road stuff... There's also underground street racing, which is a road/circuit racing but with traffic enabled. It is possible to take any car to any race type, but you're obviously going to have a bad time, if you take a RWD 1600 bhp Koenigsegg with racing slicks to an off-road race (then again, so will the AI, because they match your car class).-  is extensive. You can also set it up the aforementioned Koenigsegg with rally suspension and tires and change the drivetrain to AWD to fit it for off-road racing. Customization in terms of custom body parts however is not as extensive as in your usual NFS game, especially in the case of hypercars. Most of the upgrades are functional, affecting strictly only the car's power and behaviour.- . Other games (like NFS or DiRT) have you start with a slow car, which you can upgrade&tune to be better towards the end of the game, while also progressively unlocking better cars until you get a Lambo towards the end of the game. Forza Horizon 5 doesn't have that. You unlock stuff in the most random order. In fact, unlocking new stuff is partially tied to ""wheelspins"" (read: slotmachine), where you get a random cash reward or unlock a new cosmetic, a new car, whatever. Afaik, there's no way to buy additional rolls on the wheelspin for real money. You can also just buy new cars for in-game cash in any order you want. In just 2 hours I accumulated $1 million and the cars have their real-life prices reflected in-game, so I can buy almost any supercar with that money right off the bat. I started with a 2022 Supra, then rolled an old Celicia and a 2014 Porsche Spyder on the slotmachine. As you can probably tell, all 3 of these are in vastly different classes in terms of speed. Then I upgraded the Celica to the Spyder's level for less than 100k. So like I said, there's no order to unlocking anything.- . Also somewhat boring. I'm European, so seeing ancient Mayan pyramids is interesting for me, but only for the first time and some random latino guy going  kinda ruins the experience. Just speak Spanish or just English, make up your mind smh. While these are ""main"" missions, there's a not lot of them, and the races are very much fun. , do whatever you want, the game isn't really meant to be finished 100%.- Speaking of sandbox, after building some festivals, the game will take a crap on your world map and fill it to the brim with markers - basically you get the  but for a racing game.- The  have these silly side-objectives, where you need to run over some boxes in some area, take some screenshots in photo mode etc.. Some of them can be a bit annoying to get, but you want the accolade rewards from them for unlocking new stuff.-  is exactly what you expect it to be: just a bunch of . I was doing a weekly event in multiplayer where a team of players was racing a team of hardest AI. The more AI we overtook the more points we got. I got a good exit out of the final corner, which set me up to overtake the my teammate just before the finish line, but he pushed me into a wall instead. It wasn't even a case of getting extra points for 1st place because we were 3rd/4th. We only get points for overtaking AI, so he did it for no reason other than having a fragile little ego. There's no punishing them for this, you can't report unsportsman-like behavior like in simracers."

I WANNA PLAY WITH NEW PEOPLE BUT YOU MAKE IT SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HARD TO DO SO.Other then that performance wise and graphics this game does great, And playing with a sim i do give props this games feels really good to control compared to past titles."

If you have played the previous, Forza Horizon 3 & 4. You know what's up ;) But for those of you who are stepping first hand into Forza, here's a bit about it:You are a well known racer, known for being able to drive really well, and gain a reputation. You can collect cars of a variety of brands, from Super cars, Rally cars, and even your Every day sort of cars. But with these cars you can customise them to your liking! You can design your own vinyl logos/designs, give it a new paint job, and even on the mechanical side of things, 'mod' your car to improve certain performances. Then, there's the fun part, Racing! Forza Horizon 5 is based in Mexico, where you can explore a wide range races, street races, dirt races, rally, etc. But then there's the Open World part. The world is stunning! Based on real sights seen in Mexico, with stunning details, graphics, sounds, and a whole open world to explore. You can play solo, or with friends, challenge your friends to races, or just mess around and drive Super Cars off the side of a Mountain... Whatever floats your boat really. In Short, I recommend this game to those who are interested in cars, racing, or just having a blast with some friends. And for those previous Forza Horizon players, if you don't have this game yet, What Are You Doing? ;) Hope this helped."

No, not really, are the graphics and sound bad? they aren't great, but are half decent enough, how is the gameplay? Really not bad.So, what's wrong with it? Literally everything else, game stability is lacking, netplay is horrendous, the UI isn't good, QOL changes were completely ignored and issues all the way back from Horizon 3 are still present, the online balancing and matchmaking are a joke AGAIN, the progression is nonexistent and modeled around player retention only.Let me walk you through the ""content"" of this game:1-Play through the core game, there are no real characters, duels, cutscenes, nothing, just sequences of races that unlock sequences of races, sure, i'm not expecting Racing Lagoon here or Mass Effect on wheels so I can vibe with that.2-After a dozen hours at most, finish most of the game's content, go see what else is there to do, find the blueprints and nothing else.From now on, that's it, you're stuck in a barren map, to replay the same races over and over again, you login every week, for a new season to start and a handful of new cars that the devs are holding over your head due to FOMO, god knows when they are making a comeback, so you don't want to miss them, right?You do a coop race that is everything but fun, the netplay is horrible, queues and loads take ages, the playerbase is more of a challenge than anything else the game can throw at you because they are SO BAD you'll need to win the race, and hold the bots back enough for the complete mentally challenged teammates to have a chance to pass, try that a couple times with a 12 minute interval between each 3 race stint and hope you get lucky eventually, then there are speedtraps, jumps and speedzones, for some reason mostly they are set to S2, the objectively worst class in the game and the goals are set so stupidly high, there is no point in trying them honestly, get a rimac or some unbalanced car, download an unbalanced setup and cheese them.Then there are championships, which are either a fun way to revisit some of the races with car restrictions and point system with the option of playing with a friend, or the absolute worst circuits you can muster with a car that should not be doing them, making it a frustrating mess.A little car specific challenge, which is usually fine, but sometimes takes a long, long grind to complete.And last and definitively least, treasure hunts and multiplayer challenges, the treasure hunts range from pathetically obvious to incoherent and the multiplayer...why would you even do that to yourself?If you have severe issues with masochism and enjoy having mental pain be inflicted on you, or if you are so desperate for validation that you're using meta knowledge to dunk on children to get a dopamine hit, you can play multiplayer.So what else is there to do? Nothing, nothing at all, zero, nil, nada.Wait for an underwhelming update that you'll play through in 45 minutes or a ""DLC"" that the devs will put minimal effort on. In a sidenote, how dare they release a ""rally dlc""? Who wanted this? Who was this designed for? The offroad cars don't even have an offroad model, NO ONE enjoys cross country, why would you theme an entire DLC around the worst aspect of the game? This feels like a slap in the face and was the tipping point for me to give up on this game.On a final note, the community, the devs actively support cheaters, communities of cheaters and the support is done by incompetent, unfair and borderline criminal personel, there are so many outrageous incidents that I cannot get into or this will become a twenty page essay, look up on youtube a video called ""The Dark Side of Modern Forza"" made by SP4 if you're interested in the shady, borderline criminal activity the devs are engaged with."

I know a lot of people do not like the current state of the game and that's very fair.

It extends and excels in many of the areas that FH4 was lacking. Such as the map, the car sounds, the graphics, and the overall detail this is apparent in every corner of the game. Being a major Forza series fan, I went into this game with my expectations held high. And boy was I not disappointed. Although the game is still rough around the edges, the sheer love and care that went into the game is simply breath taking. Everything from the scenery, ambience, diversity and cars. The game has taken every detail into account to the point that it actually feels like its own world. Cruising around the jungle quite literally feels like you are in a real jungle, with the intricate and realistic ambience that encompasses you while you play. One of the biggest changes implemented in FH5 is the change in breaking and suspension physics. Although very noticeable at first, both me and everyone I know prefer it, as it provides a slightly more realistic, yet easy-to-use driving style. It makes each car feel more stable and whole, allowing them to have more give, and ultimately more feedback. This paired with the amazingly detailed world (in looks and sound) means that driving around the FH5 map actually seems like you're going on a modern day cruise in your own 1 of 20 hyper car through the Mexican Desert. Something that FH4 was lacking. Each car looks, sounds and feels like its own beast, waiting to be unleashed. FH5 has captured an essence of open world car games that I feel FH4 never had. Emotion."

I have been increasingly disappointed since Horizon 3. Horizon 5 is the result of development team becoming complacent with past successes...Horizon 5 is not a polished game and has many problems that still exist AFTER several patches have been pushed out.Buy at your own risk. Horizon 5 is in a somewhat playable state on my Alienware Area 51-m Laptop. Horizon 5 does not work reliably on my custom desktop. Horizon 5 is an unfinished product that they clearly couldn't afford to finish without our investment post release.I will be returning Horizon 5 until it is discounted substantially.

Forza Horizon 5 is close to fitting in with the rest of these games, what saves it is the solid foundation that playground games has build over the last couple of years and the reputation of the studio itself.Forza Horizon 5 does not break any boundaries or revolutionizes the way you look at racing games. It does the same things the previous entries where known for (for better or for worse). The handling has improved while still having the simcade feeling most fans want from a Forza Horizon game, the car list is ever expanding and the graphics have been upgraded once more.The big gripe I have with this game is that these improvements all feel expected, what came as a surprise where the bugs that plague the game since launch. Especially the multiplayer feels incomplete and buggy. Long loading times between races and random disconnects from the online features. Try completing a Forza Arcade Event... you can't, most of the time. This might seem like I am not happy with the game. Then why do I recommend it?Playground games has proven that, different to other AAA Developers, they care about their games. I am quite confident that all the gripes I have will be addressed and that the game will change over time like the previous entry.For Fans of the Forza Horizon franchise it's a must buy, everyone else should wait for the first sale or the release of more content through the planned dlc."

So I gave it a try and to my surprise my excitement and hype to play this game hasn't turned me down since the day I bought it.You are driving through a beautiful scene of Mexico and you're all busy to do any challenge, any race, any modification or visual changes on your car. The game had an strong beginning and actually held my excitment by receiving new cars, going through the story with funny attractions, new challenges and different types of races very stable. It gives you many opportnunities how you wanna play gameplay wise, such as if you wanna play alone or with other racers from the community, on which difficulty when you are alone, which kind of activity in general you wann do on the whole map in Mexico and much more.For people who like a more hyperactive atmosphere through the story and likes to tune and collect many cars as possible through honest work definitely worth playing!"

If you wanna play alone, this is the game for you. I recommend it.BUT it is not a frickin solo game, is it? I DO NOT recommend it if you want to play with friends or family. The moment you decide to do so the game turns into a Loading Sim and if by some fluke in the fabric of reality you connect to each other you can make 1 (ONE) race and then the whole thing starts again. Out of my 104 hours so far me and my friends have played TOGETHER maybe about 20 hours. And we continue trying to play because there is nothing else to play of the sort. (Can't wait for TDU Solar crown)If you want to play with other non friends or family people online, the game turns into a Bumper car Sim. The option to create custom adventures or whatever they call it in this version #5 is GONE. No more no-collision or custom class racing.I mean what THE FRICKIN HELL Turn10? Its like you copy-paste all bugs from horizon 1 forward and any improvements you made you delete and get a brand new team to design and program the game from scratch+the above mentioned bugs.I have been a loyal Forza fan for years and have played all games since Forza motorsport 1 to present. I was disappointed in FH4 and after this one I dont think I will buy any Forza ever.The game is basically in alpha so do not buy it at full price and definitely dont buy the premium version. The game doesnt have too many hours of solo gameplay (about 20 maybe more if you go for all accolades and achievements) and with the premium you will halve that."
