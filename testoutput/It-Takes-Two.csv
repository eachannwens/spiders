I honestly can't remember the last time a game made me smile and laugh this much while also being totally engrossed in the gameplay. The split screen takes a little getting used to at first and then you don't even notice it.Just an absolute joy to play and hands-down the best couch coop game I have played in about two and a half decades of PC gaming (yikes I'm getting old...).Buy it, you won't regret it! 10/10!!"

While we expected it to be good, It Takes Two, the sophomore effort from developer, Hazelight, impressed us so much, it is now the benchmark for which I will measure future co-op game experiences. We simply lost count of how many charming moments we encountered whilst playing.I could go on and on, but, the selling points of this game are best experienced for yourself.Each painstakingly detailed level in this title offers you unique gameplay mechanics that are never recycled. Communication and cooperation are a must, as well as decent twitch response reflexes. Various mini-games are scattered around the environment, and give you a slight reprieve from your main objective, only to get your competitive juices flowing. (sore losers need not apply!) Controls are tight and responsive, and the camera does a decent job of keeping track of the action. However, those who suffer from motion sickness may occasionally become disoriented or even nauseated due to the mandatory split screen. Overall, this is a very high quality, one of a kind experience that could only be produced as a labor of love. Pick this one up, play it with someone special, and let the hilarity ensue.Highly recommended."

When it ended it was So so so bitter sweet. It had been our thing to do when we had time together lately and now we have no idea what will fill that void of relaxing gaming with my little girl. She rushed to tell my wife we had finished it and she was so proud! But then when she returned to the study, she asked me if I could find a game just like this one...but one does not exist!I have never had a game in the last 25 years or so effect my heart so much as this game, it remind me of when I was young, discovering Shining Force 2 for the first time!The game play, the MASSIVE amount of genres touched on, the secrets, the easter eggs, THE MINIGAMES! The story, amazing!I have never played anything like this. As the final cut scene played my daughter said, ""you know daddy, mummy would probably be crying at this bit"", with tears in my eyes I turned to my daughter and said with a smile, ""Yeh, she might, but not me hey, Id never cry"" It was at this point she noticed my tears, she smiled and gave me a big hug.

Naturally since I’m not able to clone myself yet, I had to actually go out there and find another person to play this game with me. And wouldn’t you know it, I remember that I was married. Seeing how this game is about a husband and wife, I figured it would be appropriate to ask my wife to be my co-op partner, for better or worse. Anyway, my wife insisted that, since she has played every single minute of this game with me, that she be a part of this review. Hello, dear!Yup, the story is honestly really cute and both of us really wanted to see it through until the end. Sure there were parts that we didn’t like but I think it’s safe to say that both of us had a grand time going through the entire game.And she isn't kidding. The game isn’t too challenging for veteran platform players, such as myself, who are basically more comfortable with jumping in games than they are with communicating with actual people. The game pretty much DEMANDS that you have played A LOT OF platformers, LIKE A LOT. It’s hard to deny this. Like I said, the platforming wasn’t too challenging for me but it was waiting for a player that just isn’t as skilled with these types of games. Quite honestly, I think I was more mad at the game than at my wife. I mean, the game clearly wants husbands and wives to play together, right? So, why not make it a little less challenging for newbies? Even though platforming was a huge part of the game, the game dipped it’s toes into almost all other genres. On almost every single level, not only will there be a new environment to navigate through but both players will receive level-specific power ups. Which ones did you like honey?Honestly, I liked almost all of them, especially because you always had to rely on the other player to get through a section. No matter how cool my own power was, it was useless if the other player wasn’t assisting. It’s one of this game’s best features in my opinion.Again, I liked almost all of them. I appreciate when the game keeps things fresh with the environments. With that said, the clock tower level and the music level can kiss my a**.Well, fortunately, the game is very forgiving with it’s checkpoints so we never spent too much time stuck on anything. What did you think of the mini-games? Personally, I thought they were a huge waste of time.Well, maybe if they actually did something for the game, but it’s just like you said, they were distractions. Glad you enjoyed them, though. Any favorites?So, honey, in your own honest opinion. Would you recommend this game to other couples?She is being too generous. I was a real ♥♥♥♥ to her during some harder ( ) sections. As for me, this is an easy recommendation. Not only is this game constantly changing the gameplay and keeping everything fresh but the way how co-op is absolutely essential in order to progress is what really sealed the deal for me.Now as for buying this game, it’s a bit expensive at full price. Fortunately, you can buy a month or two with EA Play and finish it that way, which I think is a better option. Regardless of how you get the game, I think it’s definitely worth playing. Any last comments, honey?(rolls eyes) I’m soooooo looking forward to that."

Its extremely diverse gameplay is held to such a high standard from beginning to end. The visuals are stunning, the story is immersive, and the sound is memorable. Developed by Hazelight studios, the same developers that brought us the famous coop title ""A Way Out"", they prove once more, that the use of split screens can have a place in modern gaming.+ Exceptionally diverse, smooth and genre-bending gameplay.+ Detailed, gorgeous and bright visuals across a myriad of differing environments.+ Simple but relatable and charismatic story about marital woes.+ Copious interactive environments and mini-games to explore.+ Logical, simple puzzles to conquer.+ Friend's pass that allows friends to play the game for free with a player that owns the full copy of the game.- Remarkably easy with an awfully forgiving respawn system.Players are introduced to the dissolving relationship of Cody and May, an unhappily married couple. We witness their arguing and inability to get along, ultimately leading to the decision to tell their child about their looming divorce. This is where the craziness begins and where reality as we know it soon begins to evaporate. This chain of events ultimately causes the couple to transform into Rose's toy dolls. The two try their best to identify a possible cause for this sudden transformation and also brainstorm solutions. They do not get much time to consider their predicament before Dr Hakim ""Book of Love"" abruptly makes his appearance. With Rose's best interests at heart, he sets out almost obnoxiously optimistically to relight Cody and May's love. He sends them on many incredulous and bizarre quests with the goal of reigniting their passion, with each area forcing them to collaborate and understand each other to proceed. Driven by their desire to revert back to their own bodies and after working closely together, they slowly begin to see the value in each other. Realising each other's unique skills and passions which causes many old memories to arise, but is it enough to awaken their long lost love?The task of describing the gameplay of It Takes Two is a difficult one. It is perhaps one of the most varied, dynamic, and energetic games I have come across. Featuring too many genres to name, it masters everything it includes. Every level is a rollercoaster and seamlessly transitions through each element. From a top down section similar to , a fighting short scene akin to , and  gravity fuelled puzzles, reminiscent of  Each area almost feels and looks like a brand new game, it was just that unique. New weapons and abilities are constantly introduced throughout the game. These elements are only ever used temporarily, before being replaced with something else. Shoot down foes, reduce or enlarge your size at the click of a button, defy gravity with magnetic boots, slice enemies with a sickle and use a magnet to grip onto surfaces (or your partner). This is only a small selection of the differing aspects experienced throughout the game and the creative ideas do not stop here. Players also get to swing, fly, grapple and grind rails through the air with ease. Ride frogs, deep sea creatures, make friends and enemies, verse your partner in a variety of minigames and work together to solve puzzles. I was aptly blown away with the amount of sheer creativity seen in each and every level. Whilst the title shares a lot of similarities with other renowned games, the differing concepts are seamlessly combined, providing for a fresh and engaging experience.  It Takes Two is not designed to be difficult in any way. The whole premise is constructed so players glide through the levels with ease, never succumbing to fatigue or feeling bored, with constant new stimuli introduced to grasp players' attention. Despite this, it is important to note that with this in mind, the game is exceptionally and purposefully simple. You will die countless times, only to be respawned almost exactly in the same spot. Being hit with dramatic and seemingly deadly attacks is typically very forgiving and does not result in much damage. All guns have an automated lock on feature, there is no need to aim and so forth.Personally, I did not mind this. I enjoyed the relaxing and childish nature of the game. This stress free approach also ensured I was never frustrated, stressed or bored.  Those looking for a challenging coop game, this is not it. What it lacks in challenge, it more than makes up for with its engaging story and one-of-a-kind masterful coop gameplay.It Takes Two features a unique ""Friend's Pass"" system which allows anyone to download the full game. If both players do not own the full game, the first chapter can still be played at no cost to either party. If one person owns a copy of the full game and invites a friend who has downloaded the friend's pass, it is all free for the coop partner. There is no need for 2 people to purchase the game. Not only does this feature vitally increase accessibility, but it is also a fantastic and magnanimous move by developers, one I very much appreciate. For those interested in lag and connectivity issues, I played this online from Australia, with my coop partner being in the UK. Despite being at opposing regions of the globe, gameplay remained explicitly smooth. Perhaps the only fault could be the rare delay in cutscenes, but actual gameplay was unaffected.Majority of the game is experienced in typical split screen fashion; however, the camera angles are constantly changing, sometimes through a top down view or a shared screen for cutscenes. Each chapter is visually stunning, vibrant and immensely detailed. It maintains the child-like themes and brings household items to life, giving personalities to kitchen items, plants, tools and more. The metaphoric representation is hilarious, obvious and relatable. Ranging from exploring a winter wonderland (inside a snowglobe), the deep sea or infiltrating the wasps inner lair, each area provides a different and visually appealing aesthetic.   The voice acting is exceptionally well done, delivered with emphatic emotion and allows players to better relate to the characters relationship woes and concerns. The entire soundtrack is exhilarating, particularly during boss battles and just like the rest of the game, is ever-changing.There are not enough words to adequately explain the experience of It Takes Two. Featuring extremely varied and diverse gameplay, it stands out among other coop games as a true masterpiece. Its high-quality production proves that the once hated split screen still has a place in modern gaming. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an unforgettable coop experience. For 12-15+ hours of playtime and a pricetag of $AU49.95, it is well worth it and deserves the many accolades it has already received.This review copy was provided to the Devils in the Detail curator."

With each level comes new items to use and new evasive maneuvers to participate in. Each character you meet is so unique and moves the story along in an exciting way.

As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.Aside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to  more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to  more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.It is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came."

The developers definitely knew what they were doing. An attention grabber right from the start. This adventure is well done from the beautiful scenery to the unique boss battles. There are so many different puzzles and every level requires different types of thinking. Nothing ever repeats itself. There are also mini games to add some level of competition so its not always about working together. There is a roller coaster of emotions and the game itself is definitely worth the price. Especially since one friend can play the game for free with the game pass. I will however need therapy after one scene with the elephant doll. Other than that, 9/10."

This is probably the best representative work of the ninth art of the game: game content that can be enjoyed by any age, shocking camera movement and animation, rich and detailed scene design, fine modeling, wonderful music, and philosophical content of the story, and most importantly as a game, it has very creative gameplay and top-level design.It is generally believed that there is a close connection between this work and A way out. The two games have many similarities in gameplay, but in this one, you can see a leap in game quality. This game is undoubtedly suitable for people of any age, even if they are not very interested in games, they could enjoy it a lot.This game is simply too good. But in my opinion, the only shortcoming is that the plot is not too impressive-and this may also be a compromise for all ages. The most impressive thing about this game is the ability that coordinate between characters on different levels. I never felt bored and tired throughout the game, and I was always shocked by the creator's creative ideas. And since the game director is also a movie screenwriter, you can enjoy a visual feast that is no less than a Hollywood movie experience.No matter what kind of gamer you are, this game is definitely worth a try, and it will not let you down. If there are a few shortcomings of this game, apart from the fact that the plot is difficult to impress the players deeply, I am afraid that you must need a friend to play -after all, you can't play a co-op game alone, isn't it?"

The story is about May and Cody, a couple that has seen their relationship progressively deteriorate over time, bringing them close to divorce. This triggers deep suffering in their only daughter - so much in fact, that it awakens an unknown magical force, that transfers her parents' consciousnesses into two animated dolls. The two will have to work together in order to regain their real bodies - and maybe, find love again along the path.ITT manages to deliver a fairytale-inspired general setting, that branches off with diverse locations, ranging from lush forests to castle dungeons and intricate clockworks. The level of detail and care in their realization is impressive, as in some cases, entire miniature cities ripe with details, minigames (and even NPCs!) were created just for boosting immersion. Textures, effects, animations and everything else are of the highest caliber, up to par with 2021 AAA release levels.There is no other game in my knowledge, that mashed together so many genres in a row, and successfully at that. Mainly, this title focuses on puzzles and platforming which are seen a lot during the adventure - however, each stage has several unique segments that transport players into an entirely new gameplay style: Action RPG, Shooter, Fighting, Boss Fights and much more. Such an astounding bouquet, keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting at all times.That's right! In a time plagued with DLCs, micro-transactions, live service games and whatever other hogwash, it's refreshing to see a developer committed to give players value for their money. Anyone who purchases the game, will be able to invite any of their friends to play along the whole adventure, for free. This can be used on multiple people even, if needed, not just once.The acting of the two main characters is spot-on, as it feels emotional and involving at all times. Secondary characters as well sit on a solid level: there is definitely good quality work in this aspect, across the board. Music and effects that encompass each stage feel appropriate, manage to emphasize the action or scene at hand in the right ways, most of the time. Even if ITT's narrative takes major inspiration from fairy-tales, and has a goofy, humorous tone most of the time, it doesn't shy away from some segments that are instead very unsettling. For instance, there will be a part where the protagonists will proceed to . These parts are all the more impressive, because of their stark contrast with the general theme.The choice of separating the view-area in two would be understandable, for local matches on the same computer - however it proves bizarre for online ones on two separate machines. Even if it is helpful to look in the other player's screen (sometimes), that's never a mandatory mechanic, so ultimately ITT could do without the screen-splitting. Especially on smaller monitors like the ones of laptops, the size reduction certainly could prove uncomfortable.My usual Gameplay Breakdown cannot be applied to It Takes Two, as it mixes-and-matches so many genres, making a full breakdown of each would prove nigh impossible, other than a spoiler as well., ITT puts high emphasis on Platformer and Puzzle Game: in each stage, there will be multiple obstacle courses that often will need the combination of the two players' different tools or powers, in order to overcome them. The difficulty curve of such enigmas and platforming sections gently soars, first to accustom players to the new mechanics, and then leaving them free to use them at their full potential. However do not expect a hardcore challenge, as the game is more oriented towards an average / casual audience - which is fine, as it's not *too* easy, anyway. vary for each level, and in many cases they are unique, non-repeating sections with their own, specific gameplay mechanics. For instance, one of them will have players being able to manipulate their body size and gravity respectively, while another one will see Cody pilot an aircraft while May mans the turret to fend off attackers. Multiply cases like this for the totality of the game's duration, and the result is amazing variety. are found throughout the adventure, and put Cody and May against each other in small, competitive-oriented challenges. Also in this case, each minigame is unique and original, can be replayed unlimited times, and some of them will even change or become more difficult as the rounds go on. Winning or losing them doesn't give anything to the victor, they're just for fun's sake, a diversion. Certain side activities though, have unique achievements related to them.Sure, players can die during a boss fight, a platforming section, or any of the unique combat-oriented ones - although a game over only triggers when both are dead at the same time: the blessing of immortality allows both to quickly resurrect if defeated. Checkpoints are anyway very frequent and forgiving, even boss fights will checkpoint at every new phase's start, so losing progress in a frustrating way is not an issue."

The way the story unfolds, the characters, the topics they discuss. Even the message the game sent! It's incredibly well written.And the most important thing: Game mechanics. The game introduces scenarios and mechanics that quickly get discarded before it turns repetitive. Every new segment of the game is worthy of wonder, both by its visual but also by surprise: they always make you do something different, unique. Something that the game will never let you do again. It's like playing 15 different games under the same premise.The only aspect you have to consider is that this game is better for couples.

Very few games are able to truly understand the meaning of a cooperative experience. A lot of games tout ""co-op"" as a major feature of the game, but it never expands past the fact that you can play the game with your friends. Games like It Takes Two and Portal 2 aren't like that. This game is not functional without a friend and it takes full advantage of that fact. I highly recommend picking this game up especially since your friend can hitch a ride with you for free with the Friend's Pass or Steam Remote Play.Gameplay has always been the biggest selling point of any video game and It Takes Two does not disappoint. It's a cooperative puzzle platformer at its core, but don't let that brief description fool you. It Takes Two is constantly throwing gameplay elements from every possible genre to keep things fresh for the whole experience. One moment you're playing a third person shooter with an extremely deadly combo attack and the next moment you're playing a top-down RPG with magic spells. Every chapter of the game gives you a new toy to play with and each mechanic is flushed out to its fullest potential. There was one moment when I thought an area's gimmick was fairly boring with the magnets, but then shortly after I was given a turret that fired magnets that were used to traverse a massive wall. The sheer amount of genres displayed here makes It Takes Two look like a love letter to video games as a whole. And that's not even mentioning the fact that each player gets a different toy to play with. The only exception is the magnet level, but every chapter gives both Cody and May a different tool and mechanic to play around with. Let's use the shooter chapter I mentioned earlier as an example: Cody gets a goop gun that stuns enemies and May gets a flare gun that ignites bugs. And that's where the beautiful cooperative elements come into play, combining those two guns together creates a massive explosion that instantly kills most enemies. It Takes Two's fearlessness when it comes to new mechanics and the fact that the two playable characters offer different experiences makes it so this game has amazing replay value. Movement is another thing the game loves to play around with. There are tons of different vehicles for you to operate in drastically different methods. And that's not to say the game is weak without these mechanics, the core platforming and puzzle solving are strong in their own right. Every puzzle felt very natural and my friend and I never once had to look up a guide when we got stumped. Overall, the game design showcased here is an absolute marvel.Something I wasn't expecting to praise this game for is the artwork and environmental design. While the normal human models are kind of uncanny to look at to me, I think the toy models you actually play as and everything else look really nice! All of the artwork is fairly pretty and what I believe should be the standard for modern AAA games. There's a lot of attention to texture and detail for every model in the game and I really appreciate that. I swear it's good but it's hard to write ""This fur looks like actual real-life fur"" for too long. What I was really taken aback by was the amount of unique environments that were explored. I was worried that the game was going to entirely take place inside the house and everything was just going to be navigating furniture. That fear was quickly shot away as soon as I started exploring the inside of a tree-cave-like-system and inevitably found my way to a medieval castle. One of my personal favorite environments was the use of a snowy wasteland village that entirely took place inside of a snow-globe. It's a treat that the environments are as varied as the game design. And for a platformer, it's pretty important that the environment you navigate is interesting to look around for where you need to go to next. Oh and a quick note: I recommend turning off the soundtrack and listening to your own music of choice. The soundtrack isn't all that engaging and it's very cliche at some moments.However, my biggest complaint for It Takes Two has to be the game's story and writing. The plot is simple, Cody and May are getting a divorce and The Book of Love is a magical entity trying to get them to fall back in love. A love story would sort of imply that the main characters would have some actual chemistry, but I didn't believe Cody and May liked each other (even as just friends) for a single moment. It was very weird for them to be constantly at each other's throats and blaming each other for every little thing only for them to get back together seemingly out of nowhere in the final chapter. There was no build-up to that moment. There wasn't a slow second spark of love, they just went a complete 180 on their opinion of each other in the span of a few minutes. There was even a moment where my friend and I mocked Cody for complaining that May isn't at home because she's paying the bills. Cody and May in general aren't very interesting characters anyways, as they boil down to the stay-at-home mom and stay-at-work dad tropes with the genders swapped. Dr. Hakim was also an extremely annoying character that the game wanted me to like, but he only filled the role of an irritating antagonist up until the final chapter. Tone is something I think It Takes Two struggles with. It's a divorce story with profane language, but with such a childish attitude and understanding of the whole situation, so much so that it got to the point that it was actually humorous. There was a major plot point where the couple decided the best course of action was to make their daughter cry and that was eventually followed with one of the darkest scenes I've seen recently. If you've played the game, you know what I'm talking about and it was completely out of nowhere to me. Both my friend and I didn't care for the story at all and we actively wished for a different outcome in regards to the ending. It's really hard to care about a love story when both of the main characters are insufferable and hate each other.Overall, It Takes Two is worth the $40 price point. It was really surprising to see EA publish a genuinely good game, although that's most likely because they had little involvement in the creative process. It Takes Two is a wonderful experience that I enjoyed from start to finish. There wasn't a single dull moment in the 12 hour playtime."

I had known him firstly from when Jerma985 played A Way Out on stream with a friend and thought of the concept of how Josef tackled Co-op games was interesting; something that was in real need of innovation because it always just feels like an afterthought with most games. While the way it was tackled was interesting, I thought the gameplay itself was more or less lacking in comparison to the story and ideas that they kept serving up to the two playing. Finally It Takes Two was announced and honestly at first I thought it looked corny and such a weird departure from the more serious tone Josef’s game had in the past. I was cautiously optimistic regardless of my really baseless first impression because as we know from Josef, passion and determination run through that man’s blood like water runs through a river. After waiting for a while since launch and somewhat keeping an eye on the game, I was shocked to see the sheer amount of positive reviews for the game (and the bad takes from negative reviews from people who played like, 1 hour of the game that took me nearly 15 to finish.) I decided to take a chance on the game, to get myself out of the rut of playing my usual 3-4 games I do. I bought a copy for my best friend and I for their birthday after casually mentioning it here and there. I wasn’t too pleased with Origin integration (side note, ♥♥♥♥ game launchers, stop making us launch from 2 separate things!) but I knew it was just a necessary minor inconvenience in order to play.Let me tell you, the reviews do not lie about how fantastic this game is. From the first moments you can move around you feel how fluid the 3D platforming is, coupled with the beautiful graphics and genuinely fun gameplay. I was actually impressed from the first level of the game. It was such a simple idea turned into this adorable, fun and quirky adventure between this couple trying to fix their broken relationship. The various game elements that shift every chapter to add constant variety without feeling overwhelming having to adapt to how you face new challenges. Level design is so creative and fun that every new area just kept me filled with awe as I constantly wondered how they could possibly top the previous area. I could talk more about the story, gameplay, levels, concepts all day but I would be afraid of spoiler territory for folks who are questioning whether or not to get this. It’s hard for me to remember the last time I had my face light up in surprise or like, genuine fun over experiencing a game. The memories you have with the person you play with could go on and on. There are many games that influence this, because in art we’re always informed by the things we’re inspired by; but few actually are able to mold the medium to create something so compelling and fun. It was an experience from front to back that was so much fun and I’m happy I got to experience it with someone."

A game focused around co-op with a good story, where you need to help each other out to get further all while being able to see each other's screen. So naturally we got hyped as soon we heard about It Takes Two.So ever since the trailer I’ve been keeping an eye on this game, and recently me and a friend finally had some time to start it. From the beginning we were instantly blown away. You follow the story of Cody and May. They get shrunk down and need to find a way to get back to their normal human size. As you get shrunk down, everyday stuff like a book, a closet or a bed suddenly become huge, and this is where for me personally the magic lies in the story/environments of It Takes Two.Gameplay feels great. Movement is really well done, interaction with objects is good and during the game you get a wide variety of weapons and abilities. The game mixes combat, platforming, racing and much more really well. And not only mechanics change, perspective also changes. From third person, to 2D, to top-down. Everything is blended together perfectly. Never once during the game I felt like mechanics became boring.The story of It Takes Two is also really well done. It’s interesting, entertaining, has humor and the further you get, the more you start to actually live with the characters, and understand them.Environments are definitely the strength of It Takes Two. As I said above you walk around in everyday scenarios such as a garden, a bedroom, a childrens playroom etc. The twist is, because you’re so small all these environments get a complete other dynamic. Suddenly you’re spending tens of minutes just to climb a bed, that small garden with plants becomes its own world where squirrels are bigger than you, you become friends with spiders and that small pond becomes a real challenge to cross. Not only are environments interesting, original and well thought through, they’re also filled with easter eggs, minigames and fun little interactions. I highly recommend taking a minute and exploring every corner of a map. You’ll find so many small interactions and details that make you smile. This has to be one of the most detailed games I’ve ever played.Ambiance wise this game is amazing. It has beautiful graphics, environments are jam packed with details and music/sound effects are excellent. From the main music, to character voices to small details like walking over a piano and actually hearing each key have its own tone. Props to the developers for the amount of detail.For me, It Takes Two is one of the best, if not the best game I’ve played in the last few years. I enjoyed every bit of it and played from beginning till the end with a big smile on my face. I encountered only 1 bug(visual one) and the game is actually quite long for the amount of content you have. It took me and my friend 15 hours. I recommend everyone who likes co-op games to buy this. Especially because whether you play local or online, only 1 person needs to buy this. The other person can either join through local play or the free friend pass. This is a game I will remember for a lifetime."

It has had to be the game of the year to me so far. It is really amazing and breathtaking.There are few such excellent two-player co-screen games on the market. I’ve played  which is also published by EA before and it is a great co-op game too with a refreshing gameplay and a dramatic story. Until this year,  refreshes players’ perception once again. It has richer interactive content and much greater gameplay.The two protagonists, May and Cody, are a couple with a rift in their relationship. When the couple was about to divorce, their daughter wished that their parents would not be separated, which triggered the power of application to allow the souls of their parents to be attached to a pair of dolls that are made of wood and clay. Shocked, they could only temporarily form a wartime alliance in order to recover their bodies, and stumbled into a big adventure.With bright colors and cute character modeling, the overall plot tone of the game is relaxed and cheerful. However, part of the plot in the game also exposes the utilitarianism and selfishness in the adult world. For example, the first BOSS vacuum cleaner lost its sanity under the promise that the husband and wife would repair it again and again, and turned into a monster. Finally, the eye-catching violent execution method is just like the 18 prohibition inserted in a children’s picture book which makes the scalp numb.The difficulty design of the game is generally relatively friendly, and the condition for failure is that both characters must fall into a state of disability. When one player is in a state of being unable to move, click the button continuously to fill the ""heart"" in the center of the screen and it will appear on the battlefield again. Even if both of the players fail, don’t’ worry too much. The game has many save points and will not bring severe punishments that will require a long run from the start once you fail.The settings of each level are just right. From the beginning to the end, all the content will not be told to you in a moment. Basically, it guides us step by step, and when we reach the right opportunity, we begin to freely explore the pattern we are looking for. We will gradually learn a lesson from exploration and adventures.Each level will have different gameplay and different props. Basically, it needs two people to coordinate at the same time to use it. Players can also use their own props to spoof each other, which is really interesting.The decryption aspect is also considered part of this game. The overall difficulty is not very difficult. It can be researched with a little thought. Every location needs time to explore and research to get through.The game itself also has a lot of challenges and a certain degree of difficulty, which adds more fun to this game. There are many different mini-games in different levels. If two people find the mini-game, they will start the game. Of course most of the games require a pair of fast hands.There will be a boss battle in every level, and every boss’s style of play is painstakingly designed. I personally think that the battle is more repetitive, but in fact it is not very boring. Many of them require two coordinated operations. The overall difficulty is not very high, but it also tests the game operation ability of two players.I hope there will be more similar games on the market."

We couldn't believe some of the things we saw (Cutie). The absolute horror, dear gawd....we will never forget lol. I haven't played a co-op game this clever since ""A Way Out"". The mechanics stay fresh as they keep changing, and they are implemented in really fun and imaginative ways. Ways I've never seen before. Sometimes we stopped moving forward just to have fun goofing around and enjoying whatever mechanic was being implemented at the time. There are mini games littered throughout that are all a blast to play (at least once), and they let you take a break from working together for some friendly competition/feud building.The controls are responsive, and the graphics are pretty damn good especially if you have the hardware for it. We had a lot of laughs with the characters and the writing, and the voice acting was spot on. Everything feels top notch. I do have small gripes though. First is with the audio. It's happened probably 3 or 4 times during our 16hr playthrough. Sometimes the audio would go out and never return, or go out and return when the sequence changed, then go out again when the sequence changed again. The only fix for this was a hard restart. We've also had UE4 crashes, and even a game breaking bug that we fixed by restarting and doing the sequence over like 3 times. While most of the experience was smooth, it DID happen enough to start slightly getting under our skin at certain points.As a package though I'd still recommend this game to couples or people in long term relationships. It's a great co-op game period, but I think couples will definitely get the most out of it. If your relationship is currently on the rocks due to games like Overcooked, this game will have you sailing off into the sunset again.

Also, allowing a free friend pass to play with a friend, amazing!I loved A Way Out and I love this. Really, this game has raised the bar and as long as they keep making them, people like myself who love these will keep buying them, really it is a work of art to play and experience a well written story!Graphics: The graphics of the game are pretty unique and visually gorgeous to look at, really. There are some great effects that really set the bar to something awesome. There are lots of little detailing in the game that makes it amazing from sparks to glowing effects etc etcAudio: The audio of the game from the voice acting to the sound effects, it's all spot on really good to listen too, the audio alone is a masterpiece.Controls: Super easy to pickup, change your keys and get used too with very easy character control.Gameplay and everything else: The game is a 2 player co-op puzzle solving master peice. Each level is completely different from the last and it builds upon a story of a young girl who's parent are divorcing and her tears basically turn you into the puppets, there is where I will leave it with no spoilers, but you go through basically trying to rebuild your relationship with a Mexican book of love, why is he Mexican? I do not know but it's amusing.The puzzles in the game are unique and all over the place, each map, zone and area changes to completely new every time so when you are going through, you do not get the feeling it's rinse and repeat, it's all different style of puzzles every part of the map, plus you get some mini-games along the way to find and compete against your friend, which makes the game enjoyable.Overall, the story, art style, sound, gameplay is just amazing and one hell of a great purchase for anyone looking to play something different.You can be zipping along a zip line to running for your life to solving a puzzle to defeating a boss, to sucking the eyes out of a hoover... I laughed so much because it was dark but appealing to my humour to beating a monkey boss with a gun, FUN.Would I recommend the game? 100% Yes, the game is worth full price and discounting this game is an insult because it's just superb and deserves the positive scoring it's got all over the place.My only issue is in the trailer you can see the top down spell and warrior scene, I would love that as a full style Diablo game, which would be awesome!"

Its gameplay is 100% dependent on each other as both players need to rely on one another to accomplish tasks and complete levels (each player has to be fairly competent since one can't carry the other throughout the entire game), a lesson that both protagonists need to learn in the game's narrative. I found the abrasive engineer wife x whiney nature-lover husband dynamic unrealistic, which I feel is the biggest flaw with this game, but they're both annoying [together] and no doubt serve to drive the point home about their marital conflict and toxicity within their coupling. Dr. Hakim also gets pretty grating as the over-the-top talking book but at least his heart's in the right place. The daughter character, who sets this whole adventure in motion, is probably the most sympathetic character of the lot and maybe even the most relatable for many. Gameplay wise there's a plethora of diverse mechanics and genre styles including both 2D and 3D platforming, race and escape sections, third-person shooting, and lots of puzzles. You'll never get bored or tired because there's so much variety and no section ever overstays its welcome. This is one of those games that'll have you smiling from ear-to-ear and get you right in your nostalgia feels. Take a pass on the couples therapy and buy this for a one-time fee of $40 (or less), it'll save you tons of psychiatry bills in the long-run...and if you can't complete this game together, then you might be better off apart.

On the surface, it looks like a normal third-person platformer and that's what it is for the most part but it definitely isn't all the game is offering.The game has a great variety of sections. A great selection of sections you can select.There are chapters where the game plays like a third-person shooter. You and your friend each get a gun with unique abilities that you use to shoot down enemies and get through obstacles. There's also a lot of puzzle-solving, side-scrolling, fighting, racing, all kinds of platforming (they get really creative with platforming sections), and even a ""Diablo-like"" hack 'n' slash chapter where you and your friend play as a wizard and a knight. In this hack 'n' slash chapter you both have different abilities and the entire chapter is in an isometric view.There are also a bunch of mini-games to be found. In mini-games, you compete against each other in various challenges such as ice skating, target shooting, snowball fighting, etc.Mini-games are really fun and a great way to breathe from the oh-so chaotic and over-the-top fast-paced campaign.I say chaotic and fast-paced and the game is all that but it's also pretty casual and fun so don't be frightened by those scary words. It Takes Two is a great game for both ""gaming veterans"" and people who are new to gaming.From time to time you also end up in these big sandbox areas. You can explore around in those areas freely and exploring them is extremely rewarding and satisfying. You can stumble upon easter eggs, secret platforming sections, find previously mentioned mini-games and just discover both cute and funny stuff to interact with. 99% of the achievements are earned by exploring so be aware of that if you care about achievements. Completing the campaign gets you only one achievement out of 20!What about the story? Is it any good?The short answer to those questions is YES.The story is quite simple and pretty straightforward but it's also a pretty good story.It's funny, heartwarming, and even a bit traumatic at times. Poor Cutie - Those who know, know.You play as Cody and May. A married couple is about to divorce each other. You both go to take a nap after another one of your married couple's fights and you wake up as dolls.In order to get back to your real human bodies, you have to reignite the passion for each other, and to do that you have to work together. COLLABORATION is the keyword.The characters are well written, the humor is top-notch and never feels forced, and overall just great casual and family-friendly fun. It Takes Two is a breath of fresh air in terms of storytelling and combat alike.Definitely worth the full price not to mention only one person needs to buy the game and your friends can just download the free friend pass to play with you.There's also split-screen co-op which I used to play this gem of a game with my girlfriend and it was a truly pleasant experience. I know some people think your PC has to run two games at once when playing games in split-screen but that isn't true. Ran perfectly fine in 1440p, everything maxed out at 120fps.It's a great game to play with your friends but I'd say you definitely should play it with your girlfriend/boyfriend."

Their marriage is on the rocks and they are planning on getting a divorce. When your young daughter Rose hears of this, she runs off and begs for her parents to stay together and when she sheds her tears on two dolls, Cody and May consciousness are transported into the dolls. A book Rose owns named Dr. Hakim is your guide into exploring the crazy world around you while you try to save your marriage. The story of It Takes Two is absolutely delightful and is filled to the brim with plenty of magical moments and crazy set pieces that just create a one of a kind experience. The writing is top notch and the banter between the two leads is great and hilarious as they bicker constantly. There's plenty of laugh out loud moments as well and with how crazy the story gets at times, you will certainly going to crack up at the antics of the characters. Graphics:Graphically It Takes Two is a really brilliant looking game. You go through plenty of different environments and all of them feel incredibly alive to the point where taking some time off and exploring your surroundings just to take all of it in is just amazing. Going through winter wonderlands, toy sets, outer space and the wilderness is just amazing and some of the environments in the game are absolutely stunning.The design of Cody and May is also incredibly simplistic yet quite charming. They definitely look like something a kid would make out of spare parts and play with them, with some rough edges on them. Other NPC's you encounter through the game are also really unique and you visit plenty of environments through the game and their inhabitants differ in each location you visit to match the themes of the area, with tons of attention to detail. Audio:The audio design of It Takes Two is also incredibly top notch. The voice acting is incredible across the board and every single actor nails their characters. It's filled to the brim with charm and emotion that makes the experience that much more enjoyable when playing. The music is also incredibly charming, from relaxing tracks to awesome intense tracks during the more action packed moments of the game. Not to mention there's an entire chapter themed after music which has some of the best music in the game. Gameplay:Back when A Way Out came out, Josef Farres stated in interviews that the game would never have the same activity twice in a row, so in each level you would always do something new. I was shocked that this statement was true and It Takes Two takes that idea to an even new extreme. On the surface level It Takes Two is a 3D Platformer where you and your friend need to work together as a team to make it through the dangerous environments as you try to restore your marriage. You do plenty of jumping on platforms, however each level takes it up a notch and introduces a new gameplay element to keep things fresh from level to level. For example in one level the main two characters get two different tools with Cody getting a nail which he throw and make a platform for May to use, while May gets a hammer that allows you to destroy items and allows you to swing on the before mentioned nails. Once the level is done you get an entirely new set of mechanics like weapons, or super powers and that changes gameplay in major ways.Some of these moments are just purely amazing and you need to see them yourself to actually believe that yes that actually did just happen. Each chapter just gets increasingly more amazing and honestly that's where I will stop as not to spoil the amazing surprises this game has hidden for you to find.Now to break up the tedium of the story you can find plenty of other thing around the world like spots where you can interact with things like cameras, a painting canvas and a printer, etch a sketch and plenty of other things. One thing that was pretty popular in A Way Out was the competition mini games. Every so often Leo and Vincent will come across a friendly competition to take a break of them escaping from police. Cody and May also find these things scattered around the world. There's around 25 mini games you can find throughout the entire game and some of these are just tons of fun. One of these games me and my teammate found ourselves going back to even after finishing the game it was just that much fun and we had tons of fun competing against each other. However a few of these aren't that great, but that's like 2 mini games out of 25.Verdict:It Takes Two is pure and simple a borderline masterpiece. It's an amazing game that sparked so much joy and fun that most games wish they could do. If you have a friend or family member to tag along for the ride the experience is one of a kind and I have no trouble recommending it. Apart from minor technical hiccups like frame drops in certain areas, this game is pretty much perfect in my eyes and worth the money. Josef, wherever you take us next in your next crazy adventure, I will be there Day 1. Final Rating:10/10Pros:+ Incredibly charming and funny story+ Visuals are stunning+ Great audio design+ Each level is tons of fun and adds new mechanics to keep things fresh+ Mini games provide a nice palette cleanser+ Adding a pro just for that one easter eggCons:N/AIf you liked this review please consider following our groups and curator pages at  and"

They bicker and argue and have started to drift apart. Deciding enough is enough they agree to divorce.Their daughter Rose is upset that they are unhappy and feels a little neglected. To replace the love she is missing, she plays with a couple of dolls that she has made in her parent’s image. One day, after a particularly bad argument that she overhears, she confides in her dolls once again. A tear of sadness drops onto the dolls which magically transporting her parents’ life essence into them. Enter Dr Hakim, the book of love. He is tasked to remind Cody and May why they fell in love and sends them on a series of adventures reminiscing good times and rectifying the problems in their relationship.Cody and May must find a way back into their real bodies and maybe fix their relationship along the way.Its gameplay is incredibly varied and the story is wonderfully conceived. Presentation is top drawer with superbly drawn characters and environments, and flawless voice acting which is full of emotion. The main characters are incredibly likeable, especially Dr Hakim who is absolutely hilarious with his stereotypical Spanish flair and over exuberance. He will have you constantly laughing at his antics.Cody and May are portrayed quite sympathetically with their ongoing marital issues. The relationship problems are revealed in quite an adult fashion with an array of emotions acted surprisingly well. The game cleverly uses these relationship moments to drive the gameplay, and their trials and tribulations are played out in a wide variety of genres.The gameplay is so diverse. Almost every single genre of action gaming is covered, and it is all done well. The only criticism I would give is that sometimes platforming can be made more difficult by poor depth perception. There is not always a shadow to gauge character’s landings on jumps. If you die, it is not long before you are back in the game and starting roughly in the same place you died. This can sometimes behave erratically though. On a couple of occasions, I bypassed puzzles completely because I died and respawned next to my playing partner, circumventing my part of the puzzle.It's a great co-op experience. I think voice chat is essential however. It would be very difficult to play this effectively without verbal communication. The game is not easy but it certainly isn’t difficult either. I thought it was challenging in places but mostly you should be able to complete whatever the game throws at you without too much hassle. It Takes Two is designed to flow. It is constantly moving you along and it never feels frustrating. Its main objective is to make you have fun and that involves giving you a helpful hand whenever possible. You will die a lot, but respawns are generous and any progress gained is continued where you left off. The actual gameplay can be difficult and quite frantic but the inclusion of these benefits means you’ll complete tasks eventually and keep moving forward. This creates a cleverly paced game and manages to keep it fresh and varied throughout.Gameplay revolves around the story of Cody and May’s relationship.Dr Hakim, Book of love, is in charge and sets the couple tasks to try and rekindle their marriage and remind them why they fell in love.He introduces the level in a hilarious fashion. Typically, you have to make it to a certain point on the map by using your abilities and performing platforming elements. The special abilities are always changing depending on your environment. For example, Dr Hakim suggests that passion has been lost in your relationship. Cody used to love gardening so one level is set in your garden. The abilities revolve around the scene too, so Cody can control plants whilst May can water plants so that they grow for Cody to climb. You are constantly working together in true co-op fashion. Each level follows a different theme with new abilities to master. The abilities will always complement each other and ensure that you need to work as a team to complete your goals.Some abilities remain constant however. The couple can always run and perform double jumps and dashes. These are useful to navigate larger jumps and avoid enemies during boss fight scenes.The levels are incredibly well designed and integrate into the story perfectly. There are so many nice touches and small details that make all the difference. It’s fun just to go around the levels pressing buttons to see what they do or interact with objects. It usually results in something funny happening. It’s up to you how long you spend in each level though. The path is usually obvious so you can either mess around or just get on with it.The game should take between eleven and fifteen hours to complete depending on how much you interact with the levels. There are numerous achievements which will also add time but you’ll probably need a guide as they are not obvious to get.The game is so much fun that you could easily play it again and not get bored. The visuals are superb.Characters are very well drawn and feel incredibly life like.The environments are imaginative and cleverly designed around a theme. They look gorgeous and are very detailed.Voice acting is astounding. The characters emotional range is quite impressive, from moments of personal reflection to jokes and japes. It all sounds realistic and entertaining.Special effect noises are also amazing."

The fun gameplay can only be complemented by its brilliant level design which as a whole is a pallete for the senses. Whether it's the wacky thrills or moments of serene melancholy. Whatever it was, the game design intends to make the player feel certain emotions to outstanding effect. It's detailed in places where it doesn't have to be and the fact that the devs went the extra mile for a game of this genre, shows how much heart and soul was poured into this. It takes two is a tale of self realization and reconciliation. It's the stuff of what hopes and dreams are made of."

I got this game through EA Play to play with my girlfriend and both me and her are absolutely loving the experience so far. The mini-games are goofy and fun, the puzzles are good, relatively ""easy"" but not too easy either where you just zoom through everything, but not too hard either where you end up getting frustrated. When you die, you do not feel like you are punished either, which massively helps the game being an overall smooth and fun experience. As far as visuals go, the world is BEAUTIFUL and with a mind like mine that is capable of appreciating a very child-like enviroment, will leave you in awe at times. Visually this is a beautiful game, no ifs or buts. Also I applaud EA - not every day you hear someone say that - for having the friend's pass, where only one person needs to buy it in order to play it with a friend or loved one. This system is brilliant and should be present in more games. Without a doubt my favourite co-op game!

The amount of effort and PASSION, put into this game, it must have took a lot of COLLABORATION. Not full asking price, one of you don't even need to own the game to play with a friend. This takes A Way Out, and perfects it. We've been missing games like this, let alone co-op games like this.

The story is simple but meaningful. It's about working together to solve problems that arise, and it emphasizes the importance of dedicating both the time and the effort that are necessary in order to nurture and maintain a loving, strong and healthy relationship. When you really care about someone, it is entirely worth it and rewarding to do so, even though it's not always easy... because life, itself, is not always easy or predictable.  The main characters are a couple named May and Cody who are going through a divorce. Their daughter, Rose, is devastated by this and desperate to get them back together. She makes a wish on a book and her parents get transformed into small wooden dolls that she made to represent them. They are thrust into a magical world where they encounter The Book of Love AkA Dr. Hakim, the flamboyant, mustachioed deuteragonist with a Spanish accent who is determined to repair their relationship. They need to get through a series of challenges so they can return to their human form.  The world is colourful and absolutely gorgeous, the puzzles are perfectly balanced in terms of difficulty (not too easy but not too hard), the bosses are tough, the mini games are entertaining, and the dialogue sometimes makes me laugh because it's so cute and comical. Also, there's so much to explore and so many toys to play with that it often makes me feel like a little kid in the world's biggest playroom. Honestly? I can't recommend it enough. It has become one of my favourite gaming experiences in many ways, and I'm not at all surprised that it has won several awards."

First I thought that the game will be boring but it is not at all what I expected. The story, gameplay, art style, mini games, puzzles, music and soundtracks are unique. And I bought the full game because it is so good and fun to play.The story is about a young girl named  who's parents ( and ) are divorcing and her tears basically turn you into the puppets. You'll need to trying to find answers and rebuild your  :P.The gameplay is pure 2 player co-op puzzles solving and each level is completely different from the last and unique boss battles. There are so many different puzzles and every level requires different types of thinking. And there are also different mini games to compete with each other.The graphics in this game is pretty unique and visually gorgeous to look at, really. The art style is amazing and the environments in this game are very beautiful.The music and soundtracks in this game are unique too.For me, it is a masterpiece, GOTY and amazing story telling co-op game. And I found the lovely heart-warming relationship of  and  in this game. I absolute recommend for players who like to play games in story telling co-op. And if you own the game and your friend don't own, your friend can play and fun together with free Friend's Pass. I believe that everyone should play this amazing game at least once in their life. Go and grab your friend and get ready to fun play this game together ;DAnd thank you very much to my friend who invited me to play this amazing story telling co-op game together.Thank You :)"

Is really hard to find anything wrong with the game on this department.Gameplay: about 15-20 hours of mostly 3D gameplay, plus extras for mini games and achievements. Co-op only, and best played with voice chat. Only one player requires a copy, if playing online. Puzzles and maps are very easy, assuming both players know what they are doing, yet lots of fun. The optional mini games, plus some of the tools and puzzles the game offers, certainly adds a bit of fun PvP mechanic in the game. That being said, once finished, the game has very little replayability factor.Story: for a game that describes itself in the Steam store as ""a universal tale of relationships"", this game does not delve deep into this theme, not surprising given the younger audience of the game. That being said, those that do not mind a cheesy and humorous story that invariably ends with a happy note will like the game quite a bit.Music: it is good, not the strongest suit of the game in my opinion, but still enjoyable, and fits the gameplay and the story well. Which may be good as it does not detract much from the superb voice acting that is present throughout the game.Kid friendly? The game certainly is made very easy to play, likely with a younger audience in mind - that being said, beware of inuendo and mature themes.Summary: a fun and great game to play with family and friends. Just beware that it might be rather short, and for the grown-ups out there, on the easy side. 9/10."

Having played through it with the wife I can say we enjoyed it both and also both thought it overstayed its welcome about 75% into the game. Playing through it once will take around 10 hours. For this price that’s incredibly long for a co-op game and believe me when I say it tries to keep things fresh all the way through, with new gameplay mechanics and levels. And it always succeeds. Except when you get an item that you don’t really like to use, or just doesn’t seem so fun. My wife frequently got the better/cooler weapon. Now, the game splits the gameplay evenly, so you both get to use your weapon/gadget as much as the other person, just in different ways. And as I mentioned it really takes two. You can’t proceed without the help of the other.Besides the story oriented puzzle platformer gameplay there are also plenty of mini-games to be found and enjoyed, The variety of gameplay here is exceptional and the controls are simple enough that they can be played and enjoyed by anyone. But if you’re the more experienced gamer between you and co-op partner then you’re usually at an unfair advantage. And that makes these games a little less fun unfortunately since they’re competitively oriented and not co-operative like the rest of the gameplay.The graphics and animations are top notch. The characters move lifelike, both in human and doll form and all of the environments look detailed and are made with a lot of love.The voice acting is also stellar, with the exception of the daughter who sounds like an adult trying to imitate a kid. I loved the voice of the ‘Book of Love’.As I mentioned the game became a bit tedious for us near the end, when we had to collect several pages. These segments went on a little too long for our taste. But that’s personal, of course, I’m sure there are tons of people out there who enjoyed it all the way through.So if you’re looking for the ultimate co-op game look no further: It Takes Two is one of the best puzzle/action platformers there is. There’s a ton of variety in gameplay and a whole lot of mini-games. You won’t be bored! At least.,, not for a while."

Their young daughter, who is watching it all from the sidelines, tries to fix their marriage by asking a magic book for help. Through her request, the parents are turned into dolls and must work together to return to human form. She helps them with this, and basically just gives them advice and introduces humorous elements with her character although some may be annoyed by her manner, the very magic book that is Dr. Hakim. Special attention must be paid to the gameplay. This one is so very accepting that practically every moment we can do something different. As many as 25 different mini-games have been included in the game, which perfectly fill the time while passing the game. It is impossible to get bored in this game, because something is happening all the time. Compared to Hazelight's previous game 'A Way Out' we get much more interaction, the game is longer and in my opinion more interesting, although it is a completely different game atmosphere. It is worth mentioning that we play on splitscreen, so we can watch the other player's movements all the time.It is also worth focusing on the game world. Here, as with the gameplay, we cannot get bored. Every now and then we land in a new location, which are closed, but have a lot of interactive elements. On top of this, the bosses fit perfectly into the surroundings and can sometimes make things difficult. While we're on the subject of the game world, it's worth noting the graphics, which, although cartoonish, look excellent. On top of that, the dubbing is very good and the overall sound design changes depending on the locationI'm sure It Takes Two is the best co-op game I've played, right next to Portal 2. It has all the qualities a good co-op game should have. It doesn't get boring, it's not long, it's cheap if you decide to buy EA Play, but also the usual price is worth paying for this masterpiece. Especially the 96% positive reviews attest to how good this game is. It is impossible not to have fun with this game."

Things are constantly changing so even ADHD players can get through this.  Like Mario levels, new gimmicks or mechanics are introduced, used a bit, and then thrown away before they have time to get too stale.  Very creative scenarios always cropping up.  My only complaint is that the difficulty is overall pretty low, auto-aim is too generous (an option to turn it off would be great), etc.  It'd be great to have a hard mode or at least some extra-challenging post-credits content to try to do, to really push your teamwork to its limit.Overall a strong 8/10 despite those issues for me, and the best co-op experience to date."

The platforming is tight, the environments are nice and it's fun to have such a co-op focused game. I cannot recommend it though, because while it's fun in hand, the story and characters dragged it straight down. Cody and May are shallow, uninteresting people and bad parents. I can't think of a real redeeming quality between the two of them. May is a... breadwinner? Cody... likes plants? They're not kind or caring in the slightest, tearing through essentially all new toys in their way. I don't remember a point where either of them took any responsibility for their problems. The book is annoying. The child is sad, but also annoying. I couldn't get behind any of them.As for the story, I understand that divorce is hard, but the writing in this game is just so flippant. The big idiot book's solution is just ""work it out"" basically. There was no subtlety or nuance to the self-centeredness of the parents. None of the humor landed for me. Also the legendary elephant sequence felt bad. I've never been so close to quitting a game just because it felt bad.It's a mechanically fun game. I genuinely enjoyed jumping around and playing mini games and getting my brother killed while he was trying to platform, but most everything that surrounds and encompasses those moments makes playing this game a slog. Leave this one alone."

It makes failing at a jump hardly a setback, but this game is supposed to be on the easy side. Most puzzle mechanics are very well done, they felt very satisfying to learn how to use and play with. The mechanics are used just enough to showcase just about any unique ability or advantage they offer, and didn't lack in the number of ways could be used. Overall my experience with the game was very good and I would recommend to anyone who wants a mostly relaxed platformer, with a few intense parts sprinkled in, along with a decent story.

Although the puzzles weren't very complex and the deaths were more forgiving, you can clearly see that the game is centered around HAVING FUN. And boy was the co-op gameplay so so fun. The minigames were a great addition, and I love that you could go off and get distracted by something as simple as taking photographs for 10 whole minutes.

While the thought to force a co-op game may seem strange at first, it is the best concept ever.  In the game you play as Rose's parents who are about to divorce.  Rose cries on two dolls that look like her parents, and the parents turn into the dolls.  The story is led and narrated by a very annoying book that tries to make the parents fall in love with each other again as if he is their therapist.  There are about 6 worlds to go through and each one consists of multiple levels.  Each area offers a different gameplay mechanic where you must work together to pass each level.The voice acting, animations, graphics, and just about everything about this game is great.  Not only do each level offer different game mechanics, but you also play different types of games within the game.  In some areas it plays like a 2D scroller, or another part you play like an isometric RPG, or in another area it resembles Mario Kart, but they all play very well even though they are almost individual games.  Since you are two players, the game is littered with random side games for you to play that has nothing to do with the storyline.  They have a chess board, a slot car game, and so much more just for you to play and have fun and compete against each other.  It is absolutely a blast because there's always something new that you are doing.While the game has a serious tone for the story of two adults thinking of divorcing, the game just doesn't take itself seriously at all, and it is just hilarious.  The script is hilarious, the action is hilarious, it is absolutely great.  For example, in the Mario Kart section, Cody, the father, says, this reminds me of something, but never says what it is.  The Book of Love narrator is annoying, but even the characters in the game are annoyed with him.I'm sure I've said it before, but truthfully it is just fun.  This is what video games are all about....having fun together.  This is a masterpiece, can't wait to see what else comes out from HazeLight."

We agree this one is the one of the best ever. In short, we absolutely loved this game. Although split-screen is quite possibly the worst for a PC gamer, it was easy to overlook/get used to, and what came from it was a delightfully charming, witty, and fun game. The well-told story weaved around tons of new and interesting levels, with brilliant and beautiful level design mixed with interesting mechanics for each section of the game that allowed each player to play a little bit differently, and you each get to solve problems using new tools. We both agreed that it was a wonderful and beautiful game, and although it wasn't difficult at all we both absolutely adore the game. The boss fights to me were screaming ""raid mechanics"" but the mess-ups were very forgiving throughout the entirety of the game which allowed us to never get stuck through any part of the game for very long and for the game to flow naturally as you uncovered more of the story. I will probably forever make my GF laugh by saying CO-LA-BO-RA-TIONNNNN. Turns out we only unlocked 16/24 minigames, so we'll have a reason to play it again and also swap roles so we can try the other half. I was pleasantly happy with the entire game, and would recommend it to anyone. The friend-pass allowed my GF to play the game without owning it, and that is an amazingly cool concept. It makes total sense with the game being split screen 95% of the time. Bravo game with great writing, fantastic gameplay and graphics, and a very enjoyable experience that we won't soon forget for a long while. I know many will compare this to portal 2, but portal 2 is puzzle solving, whereas this is so much more condusive to relationship building - just like the story. 14.5hrs and a wonderful week of smiles, laughter, and solving puzzles together made for a great experience. Would recommend to any two people who enjoy gaming together."

It has a soul, something that is increasingly difficult to find outside of indie games.Without spoiling much the game is a multitude of genres but mostly a puzzle platformer, new mechanics are added each chapter to keep things fresh, the two different characters also get differing abilities, so its worth playing at least twice to experience everything.While the mechanics are not too deep and the puzzles aren't the hardest, they are always satisfying and clever, in the 11 hour run I have not been bored in a single scene or thought something dragged on too much or was frustrating.Later levels open up for some optional exploration, which is something I rarely do, but felt compelled to find all the neat secrets and easter eggs.Graphically speaking the game is just top notch, it is just beautiful. The human models seem a bit off but you rarely see those. The real stars to me were the enviroments, there is just so much to see and all of it is unique.In conclusion, buy this game and invite a friend with you, in a rare show of good thinking, the game requires only one person to buy the game, the other person downloads the full game for free and can join and play through the entire game. Think of it as inviting a friend over to play at your house when you were younger. If they cant run the game, Parsec or Steam play together is also a decent option if your connection allows it.Thank you for reading my review, I do not usually do them, if it has gotten someone to give this game a try, I consider it a worthy time investment :)."

I bought the damn game.  Why are you trying to con me into more crap?!  Manipulative, money grabbing salesmen.  I currently can't play the game.  My kids are begging for it.  But because EA decided to change the launcher around, delete Origin from my computer and use themselves as the launcher, none of it works.

But after seeing the reviews and some gameplay, I decided to take a leap of faith and purchase it.Right off the bat, the gameplay was extremely fun, unique and really really smooth. Visually, the game is outstanding and the world keeps looking better and better as you proceed. Sound design and music were great too, especially towards the later parts of the game. The mechanics and gameplay are easy to pick up and the puzzles aren't that hard either so this makes it perfect for gamers of any sort, even if you don't have much experience with them previously! Plus the mini games really help to change things up for a bit and have some friendly competition with your buddy!The ""Friend's Pass"" really sold the game for me because I was able to play the game with 2 other friends separately and all of us enjoyed it. In the end, while the price of the game might seem quite high to many people, I can say that it was 100% worth it for what you get. We played it casually and took about 14 hours to finish the main story as well as the mini games. And you can always just buy the game and split the price between your friends if that makes it more appealing to purchase it! Highly recommended! This game is a must play for all!"

Bunch of mini-games and gimmicks to enjoy. Also puzzles that involve both players are well designed, well thought, and challenging at the same time.Story : Sweet, cute, warm, and engaging. The story line is based on family, surrounding a beautiful house with lovely areas. Becoming little dolls lets you see your house, your family, and your loved ones from a much smaller perspective, and allows you to see these ordinary items with a much more meaningful way. The story tries to tell you a story that can happen in any of our real-life, and intends to let us know how to fix it. Truly a fun and amazing story.Optimization: First, I just want to point out that the only disappointing part is definitely origin. Sometimes I just couldn't log in, or I couldn't open the friend list. Other than this, the controls are really smooth, player camera is great, transitions and interactables are well-rounded, and I hardly found any bug. Really well polished.Art style and music: Nothing to complain about.

The puzzles were challenging but not frustrating, and the variety kept things fresh and exciting. We felt a real sense of accomplishment after each puzzle we solved, and the boss battles were a real thrill.In short, if you want a game that will bring you and your partner closer together through laughter and teamwork, then ""It Takes Two"" is a must-play.

The devs added in lots of little things you can play around with and the game feels so full of stuff to be able to do thats optional from the main story, but still on the main path.

Trapped in a fantasy world where the unpredictable hides around every corner, they are reluctantly challenged with saving their fractured relationship.The story is straightforward and there is no complexity in it, the goal of the game is to restore the relationship. But the events that happen around you may teach you more about the characters and different aspects of their lives and the cause of the main problem and why some things in their relationship were torn and marginalized. And do not forget the ""Wise"" book, which gives a beautiful effect in the game, the story, and the beautiful and funny discussion between them.The game in terms of control is - without hesitation - above excellent. The diversity in the game is very large and not boring, and this diversity is not only limited to abilities... but also in the map, the world, and also in the fights. The game is not complete without cooperation to solve puzzles. Few games with this genre contain this amount of diversity and abilities. There are also side challenges that are quite fun (fun only if the person next to you knows how to play).The game is not complete without the graphics and sounds, and the performance here is second to none. The diversity here is unparalleled. You will see a quiet and noisy world and you will see the life that stems from them as well as the hidden sides in them.- There are some mentions of other games in their game ;)- The game is narrative, and as usual, these games are linear.- You can play with your friend through the Friend Pass feature even if you don't own the game.- This game is available on EA play.

I'm glad to say that one of the strong points of this game is...well, gameplay. The co-op gameplay is always evolving through every stage, and you will have to solve and play multiple puzzles, platforming challenges and well...basically a bit of everything. I mean it. Every stage is crafted to give you a new surprise fun mechanic to work with.Difficulty level is just right to not be mindless but it keeps frustration very low. And the experience is different depending on which character you are choosing so keep that in mind too!Levels are designed with a lot of care (it shows) and there is a lot of side content to find through the journey, and little details and things that can be interacted with just for fun, put there just to satisfy your curiosity or do silly things with your partner.It also has minigames that you can find semi-hidden in levels that can put some fun competition into the gameplay, and they are all quite different!Visually, it can be quite stunning and there lots, lots of incredible looking stages and pieces through the whole experience, and the main doll characters look super detailed too, which combined with the gameplay and store, makes this game feel like some kind of Pixar movie in the best of ways.Controls and camera tend to be as good as it can get in 3D platformers (They are never perfect, that's just how it is) and in general, it just tends to feel super responsive, tight and fun to use (Played with a controller, partner played with keyboard and he was fine with it too)Music and sound are great too and there are some very memorable music, specially towards the end of the game (No spoilers though :) )Overall, I just can't recommend this game enough if you have a good friend, fiancee, partner, whatever you want to play with. It's an incredible, super fun cooperative journey like you have never seen before and it makes me super happy that it got the GOTY award because there is nothing like it, and you can tell the team that worked in it put love and passion into it above anything. ♥♥♥♥ THE OSCARS"

At times we weren't sure whether the game was leaning toward childish or mature but it seems like it was the golden middle.

This piece of junk is infamous, and has been a reason why I've never bought EA games for 10 years now. My girlfriend offered that we play this game, and as she rarely plays, I was excited to try. Until I learnt the game was edited by EA games, one of the most disliked editor in the world. And there are good reasons for this. So you have to install Origin and create a f***** origin account to play. But the integration with Steam is not smooth for everyone. For my girlfriend, it has been a nightmare. Origin would launch, but not linked to steam. And the account creation process has been a mess. Asking for stupid ""Recaptcha-style"" puzzle such as ""find the set of dices which sum is 14"", 4 times in a row, in limited time. This is completely insane. A game is supposed to put you in a mood of excitement and relaxation. We lost an evening configuring this piece of creepy, invasive, attention-seeking, extraordinarily unreliable, frustration building f***** pile of sh**** junkware. Frankly EA, you suck so much I would feel an immense relieve if one day you were dismantled."

Typically there aren't many games that do cooperative campaigns well, but I was absolutely BLOWN away by this game. It features 15-20 hours of genuine cooperative engaging enjoyable gameplay, that feels like it was designed to do what it's doing, which it was, meaning the execution is done exceptionally. In the game, you play as either May or Cody, which are married, and have a kid named Rose. May and Cody are seeking a divorce, after some time of being emotionally disconnected from one another. They tell Rose this, and she seeks to find a way to fix it. The ""Book of Love"" by Dr. Hakim, transports May and Cody to the shadow realm, (not really) but it's a place where they attempt to tend and re-kindle their relationship. The game's mechanics are amazing, smooth, I experienced little to no bugs when playing with my friend, and the soundtrack is AMAZING. There's also a lot of little video game references from other fun video games. Good job, Hazelight!"

This game has a stunning level design, a good story line (not my cup of tea however, still very good).Dr. Hakim appearance will trigger your anticipation as with his arrival, new game mechanics are always introduced.The visual design of all elements are wonderfully crafted.The environments are imaginative and cleverly designed.Only noticed one particular bug during the whole gameplay. As i was playing with friend, he was invisible on my side of the screen in the garden section.Worth every penny.If all the puzzle are solved quickly then it will take about 10h during your first walkthrough. However, the average is set to 12-16h, so if you take in all the mini-games and take longer with puzzle solving.It's pretty lovely to play with your partner, but if you're playing with your bro, it will still be pretty lovely, just consider that there's a 50% chance of you guys dating.From my experience, no grinding was involved.Honestly, this game is highly optimized, impressively so. So i'd say a carrot or a potato from the supermarket should get this going. All the jokes aside, check the PC requirements, they're not much.Honestly, i will want to point the target audience to all ages, however, i think i will be pointing it to adults, as i've never felt so bad about an elephant doll and a girls tears so much. Note: There's a whole bunch of references to other games and movies, like the lion king, a way out, Mario, +++.The variety introduced was a vital piece as it lead to the lack of repetivity in the game. So, VERY GOOD. In one game, i felt like a played soo many games.As said, this coop game is worth EVERY PENNY. Can go from good to eargasm!I'd like to thank the developer and publishers for this wonderful game, the experience that was offered will most likely never be forgotten. I would like to congratulate everyone involved as this game was simple, ""AMAZING"".Thank you very much (Except for the elephant, that wasn't cool)."

The art is exceptional, the level desing is superb. Some levels truly will leave you in awe and joy! I believe this game will be a great experience for anyone in the family and to be fair, even if the writing is not very deep might still inspire some important conversations with your kids about what it means to be a family for you. Which is really cool.  Looking back, I think I started this game with some kind of expectation, as everyone was praising it so much, so maybe that's why I got so picky about how it's written.

It makes you reflect on your own life and relationships with your close ones as the story goes along, and if you're giving it your all to make them work, like you once had.By having the friends pass, only one of you needs to actually own the game, it cuts the cost in half €20 per head which isn't bad for the amount of hours you play and you can play it again but reversed characters so you get to experience the game in a different shape, with different tools. So far I got 13 hours of the game, if I rerun it again it would probably be another 13 or more by exploring every single corner the game has for us.THE GAME GETS 10/10. SOLID ALL THE WAY THROUGH.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As we played together I will attach my boyfriends review just below as it's only fair given the game takes two ;)It takes two is more of a journey than a video game. You share a vibrant and wondrous experience with someone special, and are both left with a rich memory. The closest description I could give you is being in a pixar movie. The game is a combination of 3D platformer, problem solver, exploration, isometric rpg -- all weaved together amongst the backdrop of a touching story line. The voice acting and animation are brilliant, the humour is conveyed exceptionally well. As a product it demonstrates the future of interactive entertainment experience: a beautiful compound of video game and movie -- not too cut-scene heavy, not too punishing either. Post credits I was left with the same feeling when walking out of the cinema: readjusting to the banality of everyday life.Such a great experience, I not only look forward to playing it again with flipped roles, but to whatever Hazelight create next."

That nostalgic split screen style was refreshing in A Way Out, the game was decent although it didn't push the boundaries too much in the story and gameplay departments. It Takes Two, on the other hand felt more refined, more developed and in general, a total improvement on their craft leading to a more memorable and amazing experience. The overarching story revolves around Cody and May, who you play as, going through a tough time in their relationship and are revealing to their daughter, Rose, they are planning on splitting up. Rose becomes upset and through the power of magical tears, Cody and May embody their daughter's dolls and encounter the Book of Love (Dr. Hakim) who is determined to rekindle their relationship with the help of COLLABORATION.It is definitely a story that is more geared towards couples, but that's not to say it can't be enjoyed by people who aren't in a relationship. I played this with a friend and we still had a great time. The characters that are introduced are interesting, the humour and back and forth between Cody/May and Dr. Hakim is amusing. Overall it's a fun, lighthearted and entertaining time excluding that one dark, out of place moment that made us both feel uncomfortable.At the core, the game is a puzzle platformer while the puzzles themselves aren't overly difficult the game shines in the ever-changing outstanding gameplay. In every new area Cody and May receive new weapons/gadgets, and with them entirely new mechanics. Learning how these tools worked each time made it constantly feel fresh, and half the fun was figuring out how to troll the other with them. Along with the huge amount of variety in genres and settings makes for an incredible experience from start to finish. It'll be a third-person shooter, then a top-down dungeon crawler, then a fighting game, then a rhythm game. Each genre never overstays it's welcome and switches up before it gets too dull. The minigames have a lot of variety as well, and are a nice detour that promotes that competitive fun banter between players. Boss battles are fun and creative, and again vary in their mechanics usually incorporating the mechanics you learnt throughout each level.Graphically the game looks magnificent and has a Pixar-esque style, the animations are well-done, the different set pieces and cinematic scenes are awe-inspiring. The level design is well thought-out and immersive. The split screen really helps the other player see what they are doing, and makes it convenient to convey to each other on how to solve puzzles.The voice acting was decent. Music was fine, there were only a couple of moments that were memorable or exciting but it never nailed it to the point where I found myself checking out the soundtrack, like I had done with other games. The rest of the sound design is great, there is a high level of work that has gone into producing fitting sounds for all the different mechanics, bosses, enemies and levels.Hazelight seem to have found their niche and have put a lot of passion into this. A fantastic co-op adventure game, and I'm excited to see where they'll take us next. If you are even somewhat interested in this, you NEED to experience this game. The friend pass makes it even easier so grab your partner, your friend, a random on the internet, just get anyone! And I just can't wait for my second playthrough when I actually get a significant other and we inevitably get into arguments."

There was just something charming about it and then have heard that Hazelight Studios was behind it? The people behind a way out? The game that is probably the thing that saved my friendship with my best friend? I had to buy it, I didn't have any real expectations. Though, it did take me a bit of convincing to pre-order it myself. Though, I knew without a doubt without that trailer in January...I wouldn't have thought otherwise about that game. To tell you the truth, I was kinda expecting it to be a bit of a disappointment and kinda dull at times (maybe hitting the same story beats of a way out) like A Way Out. Then I also heard about how you'd end up playing the game on steam and I was afraid of Steam's Remote play. I was afraid that the experience would completely ruined.However, my fears were unfounded as we later found out that the entire experience had a friend's pass just like a way out. I finished the game the day it came out on stream, and I have a lot of opinions about it.I think its a 10/10 game straight out of the gate because of the level design and how they use every single ability to the fullest they can per level. It was balanced, it was clean, it was corny as hell but lovable, and it was overall a much funner game in contrast to A Way Out which had its strong moments. This blew the hell out of it with its vibrant colors, simple tutorials, amazing settings and world building, and simple and fun puzzles. Everything flowed smoothly and there's times we didn't even know we had just done the main story, we thought we were just exploring. It was a really unexpectedly smooth experience. You'd be able to play this game with anyone, the level designs are all extremely diverse. They're all a unique experience and the characters just don't stay the same. Each Level truly shows how they affect them, and how they become more and more attracted to each other. I will say that the collision is weird at times, we were only lagged out once in the game due to EA's server (you have to sign into origin to play this game), and doesn't really have as much choice as a way out did. Its a beautiful game to play on a weekend with somebody, though I definitely don't recommend somebody playing the full 10 hours of this game. Its short, but its better than most games with its 40 dollar asking price and only you have to buy it in order to play with your friends. I definitely recommend this game and it will DEFINITELY stay in my heart for a while just like a way out did."

The latter is relevant since you will need an EA/Origin Account to play the game and to invite a friend to play even if you buy the game on Steam. The game tells the story of May and Cody, a married couple about to get divorced who are transformed into dolls made of wood and clay by a strange book their daughter Rose found. May and Cody are forced to work together over the course of various levels, getting to know each other and themselves better again bit by bit. You will play with a split screen almost all of the time, which for me took some getting used to. Other than that the gameplay was a lot of fun. The movement mechanics are very nice, I was happy that I was able to use two of my favourite platformer abilities right from the start, Double Jump and Dash, which makes for fun and fast-paced gameplay. During the different levels you will temporarily get new abilities as well. Most of the time you will play a platformer game, but there might be some surprises along the way. In our 15 hours of playtime, It Takes Two never got boring!In fact, it was so much fun that I would easily list this game among my favourite multiplayer/co-op games. I was pretty certain of that very early on and still the game managed to get even better over and over again. The levels are incredibly detailed and lovingly made, and even though the game itself is quite linear, there is so much to explore and discover. But not all of it is fun. Expect to be annoyed a lot by the book that got May and Cody into this mess. Also expect to almost hate the character you’re playing from time to time and to do things you absolutely don’t want to do - unless you don’t have a heart (no judgement here). However, those are but minor drawbacks that still contribute to the overall great experience."

You have the main story that you can follow, but if you like to explore your environments there is a lot of things to interact with and even mini games! It was fun having little bouts of competition and collaboration between sections of the story with the person I played it through within each of the worlds. If you are looking for a chill and enjoyable game with a +1 then I would HIGHLY recommend this title!

The game is good, like really good— the story is good, it is long and enjoyable, and the emotions you feel are good.... but the game is insanely glitchy and hard to play long-distance wise, no matter how good or bad your internet is. My boyfriend and I got this game from a recommendation and we were starting to enjoy it but the problems started to happen during the plushie octopus and explosive ducks fight, our screens would show different things and it was a never ending cycle of lag and the video game just not working at all. I tried talking to origins and origins help to aid us in the problem but they were not able to do anything, even though the problem is THEIR game servers (which is what they told me). We did not play for two months and I even tried to get a refund, was not able to. We eventually beat the stage in person, thankfully, but the problem is supposedly still not fixed with other bosses and or mini bosses and it is VERY disappointing because we like the game a lot. It is an extremely common problem that pulls you emotionally from the game and is frustrating. If you're thinking of getting it just be cautious."

If you remotely like co-op, this game is a must play. It's not the most mechanically challenging game but that doesn't mean it's devoid of challenge, the game is more forgiving when it comes to mistakes and is more about having fun with a friend.There are quite a few fun minigames you can play in between levels and there are enough creative ideas in the levels themselves that it was a joy going through them. The levels and their locations are varied and full of little details waiting to be discovered. A lot of care was put into making the locations fun to explore aesthetically and mechanically; Movement is fluid enough that it makes getting from one point to the next relatively painless although it can get a bit finicky at times with ledge grabs, grapple points, and climbable walls.True co-op games are rare these days and as someone who loves them, it's nice to see one with obvious passion behind it. I hope this means the future is a little brighter for games like this and it's easily my favorite game to come out this year so far."

So, I guess it's a good thing that Josef Fares and the talented folks at Hazelight decided to release another pure co-op game that expands upon the foundation laid by  called  And I'm happy to report that  is an incredibly entertaining experience that is a significant improvement over its prison break predecessor that surprised me in more ways than one.While I think most people are going to compare this game's visual style to something out of a Pixar film, I would say this game feels a lot closer to something like  It's a delight, with so much variety in the environments considering that the story is basically contained to one house. The game also did an excellent job of not being too overwhelming with color, which on top of being paired with great character designs (especially in regards to the playable characters), made everything visually distinct enough that you could tell who was supposed to interact with what without getting in the way of the style that the game was going for. While I did play this game with slightly messy settings because I was streaming it, I could tell that this game is an absolute looker in terms of its style and environments, so the game absolutely succeeded in this regard.As I said before,  expands on basically all of the concepts laid by its predecessor. While it is still largely a puzzle platformer, one of the game's biggest strengths is in its variety, as it would switch up the genre very frequently. The parts of the game where I was witnessing my partner take on a boss structured like Street Fighter, or where we were tearing through a castle using fire and ice powers like a Diablo game were my absolute favorite parts. They didn't overstay their welcome, and were always a great way to change the pace as soon as the platforming/puzzle segments started to feel dull. Both characters had ample opportunities to shine, and I didn't feel like the power-ups were skewed in favor of one character at any point. While the game's on the easier side, I still found it incredibly engaging and didn't mind the difficulty since the game was meant to be accessible to as many people as possible. The boss fights were also very fun, and never felt mindless to beat since they all had different mechanics that felt like a proper assessment of your skills with whatever tool you're using. In terms of a pure co-op experience, this is arguably as good as it gets. It's balanced, engaging, and a constant delight from start to finish. I have nothing to negative to say here.Where the gameplay was near perfect in execution, this game's biggest weakness is its story. The game tries to foreshadow a few things, (for example: ) but ultimately get disregarded as soon as they move on to the next setting. I also feel like the game was too lighthearted tonally, and should've leaned more into its Pixar-esque appearance by suddenly changing the tone to something heavier in order to drive home the game's themes and sticking to that tone for more than one scene. While I did like the characters, and the game was genuinely pretty funny, I thought they were the only redeeming qualities in a story that felt like an excuse to throw the players into different situations, when it had plenty of potential to expand upon its themes using player interaction. The story is funny and entertaining, but its unwillingess to take itself seriously makes it disappointingly shallow overall.Not much to talk about here. The voice acting wasn't particularly remarkable, and there were a handful of moments that took me out of the game, but it wasn't noticeably bad. The music is also serviceable, though I'd say it is of a higher quality than the voice acting overall, outside of the final song which I found rather underwhelming. The sound design also works well enough, though again I'd say it's nothing to write home about. Overall, it's fine, though it's nothing I'll be talking about years from now. In terms of value, I'd say it's worth it at full price just for the reason that  But even then, I'd still say it's worth it simply because you'll remember your time with it because of how it constantly finds ways to reinvent itself. Sure, the story isn't anything to write home about, but it's still very memorable just for how good the gameplay is. You're not going to play it more than once most likely, but it's definitely fun enough to warrant doing another playthrough with someone else if you wanted to. is an absolutely amazing co-op experience with a story that holds it back from being an all-time great. But even then, the story isn't going to significantly ruin your experience because the way the gameplay constantly finds ways to keep you engaged definitely makes up for this to a degree. If you have someone to play this with, it is absolutely worth your money just to help these types of short, story-driven co-op games become more commonplace. It's not the ""perfect co-op game"", but it comes quite close. I loved my time with this game and I cannot wait to see what Hazelight does next.  - 9.5/10 - 10/10 - 5.0/10 - 6.0/10 - 9.0/10+ Incredible gameplay variety+ Beautiful environments+ Humorous writing+ Well-paced+ Only needs to be purchased once to play with a friend- Shallow story and themes- Tonal issues"

It Takes Two is the kind of game that does a lot of things, and for the most part, does it well. Coming from the same developers of the co-op-only game A Way Out, It Takes Two takes that familiar brand into a more gameplay-oriented experience.The game at its core is a 3D platformer and builds on top of that by throwing a variety of different gameplay concepts and scenarios built around the co-op experience.There's a lot of enjoyable platforming sections, and while going through them, you and your friend will be occupied as well with a different gimmick through each chapter of the game. Such gimmicks come in a mixture of different combat methods such as having one player cover enemies and obstacles with a flammable sap that the other player can detonate with their own unique fire projectile.During sections where it takes a focus on puzzles instead, you get different gimmicks such as the player navigating through an obstacle while another uses a device or ability to help the other player get through things. I found myself just enjoying spitballing ideas and figuring things out with my friends, and on the times we got stuck, it's less on the game being obtuse and just more on us just having moments of hilarious stupidity, which is its own kind of fun.Optional activities also are peppered throughout the game, with various competitive minigames and moments of exploration to serve as breathers between chapters. If you loved goofing off and playing minigames such as Connect Four in A Way Out, It Takes Two amplifies that idea further in this game.The game keeps this pacing mostly consistent throughout, and you'll never be doing the same thing twice. However, it does feel like the ideas start to falter towards the end, where the new gimmicks start just feeling like less interesting variations of what you were doing a few hours earlier. The game could have merged and cut out a few things to make the experience tighter and make the last hour less of a slog. Still, for the most part, there's hardly a dull moment throughout the game thanks to just the sheer variety it offers throughout the hours.Visually, the game looks fantastic. The environment variety alone is great, but the details put into them really show how much work is poured into the game. From experiencing daily household areas as miniature toys to beautiful snowy mountains, green gardens, and even really abstract spaces, it consistently manages to look really good.The narrative itself unfortunately isn't as compelling as A Way Out, and at best you might find the dialogue passable with a few chuckle-worthy moments, and at worst annoying. Nevertheless, the premise does serve its purpose as a vehicle for the scenarios you go through the game, and it does have a few notable moments, which I won't spoil, but I can say that it's both hilarious and horrifying and can guarantee that it will elicit a reaction.It isn't a deal-breaker but it would have been interesting to see if they minimized the plot further and just focused on the gameplay parts, as I feel like it is enough to carry the game, and taking out the story won't really impact the main enjoyment of the gameplay itself.I personally played this twice with two different friends, with the playthrough months apart to keep my experience somewhat fresh, and absolutely enjoyed both playthroughs and had fun rediscovering solutions to the game, alongside finding new stuff I didn't come across on my initial playthrough. It isn't the easiest game to do full replays with considering its long length, though the option for chapter selections and jumping through minigames instantly is a nice way to do bite-sized revisits.All in all, It Takes Two is a really enjoyable experience, and there is a lot of fun stuff to go through even on just a single playthrough. Like the neat thing with A Way Out, only one of you needs a copy to play the game together. If you're in the mood for a fun co-op experience, It Takes Two will provide a solid experience."

I could leave it at that, give the game a positve review and go on with my life, but I won't. I want to convey just how good this game is and how much fun my best friend and I had playing it. So this could be a little long.I first saw this game in a trailer last year and immediately thought to myself: ""We need to play this!"" Especially since the previous game of Hazelight ""A Way Out"" brought us many great hours of fun. But when I saw that ""It takes two"" classified itself as a Platformer, I was scared, because I knew that genre wasn't really my friends favorite. Nevertheless we decided to at least play the demo on release. I'm so glad we did. The demo alone was about half an hour to an hour long. (Probably an hour since we just messed around at every opportunity) The first thing we both noticed was, that the game looks gorgeous. The graphics had a particular style between realism and fantasy. Especially later levels really look magical, but I don't want to talk about them too much. You should really try to go into this as blind as possible. To be surprised is half the fun in this game. The second thing we noticed was, that the controls were really tight and snappy. The characters were really nice to control and misinputs were a rarity and entirely our fault, when they happend. With that said, we made our way through the demo, which was the entire first level and at the end of it we were both sold. We didn't know what else to expect of the game. The first level was pretty simple with straightforward mechanics and simple puzzels. When we continued to the second level, we hoped the game could at least stay at this level of quality. OH BOI were we wrong. The game gets continuously better, the longer you play it. Every new level we started, we said to each other: ""I can't wait to see what's next!"" And a few times in every level we laughed out of pure joy and yelled: ""This is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome!!!"" Normally you'd expect a game to have highs and lows, but ""It takes two"" was almost constantly high. With some exceptions. One part in particular just was heartwrenching to go trough. Those who played it will know what I mean, when I say Elephant. Just terrible. But just in a Story-sense. It won't impact my feelings of the game overall. The other aspect, that was a little bit disappoiting for me was the Ending. I won't spoil it, of course. What I can say though was that it just came to suddenly. We didn't even notice that we played the final level. It was just lacking that sense of finale, but that's just my opinion and maybe you see it differently. With that said, I absolutely recommend this game to everyone who wants to spend a good time with their loved ones. With the whole Friend's Pass thing you don't even need to buy it twice, so 40 Bucks is definitely worth this spectacle of a game. ""It takes two"" set a new bar for COOP-Games for me and I can't wait to see what Hazelight will be working on next. Like I said, this game was really special. Thanks for this great ride!"

The game mechanics in this game is beyond my expectations. At first, I found it irritating because of the split screen that the game uses, but later on, I was more amazed. The perfect sync between me and my friend was an easy alternative when trying to explain where to navigate. The story is so far more than good. It might even teach us a thing or two about what we might take for granted. So many real-life memories bubble while playing this game.Considering buying it? Then do it!

Непревзойденное кооперативное приключение про женатую пару на грани развода, которая превращается в пару маленьких кукол. А грандиозное приключение призвано скрепить их почти разрушенный брак.Основные места действия - дом наших протагонистов и их задний двор, на которые нам придется взглянуть под другим углом, и не только ввиду небольшого роста героев.Ведь с перспективы наших зачарованных героев и окружающий их мир будет таким же магическим: оживший пылесос, который хочет отомстить за то, что о нем забыли, заменив новенькой моделью, или война белок и ос, которая напоминает классические боевики 90-х, и многое другое, что не раз удивит вас.В нашем большом походе к счастливому браку нам будет помогать Доктор Хаким - Книга Любви, хотя он предпочитает называть себя Книгой Мудрости (да, буквально говорящая книга).По большей части он создает нам проблемы тогда, когда мы не создаем их себе сами. Но его конечная цель - сплотить парочку и научить их решать проблемы вместе, в какой-то момент даже начнется подобие настоящей терапии.Истории в их играх никогда не были на первом месте, но на этом и не делается акцент, так что без зазрения совести его простоту можно проигнорировать. История служит лишь площадкой для веселых испытаний, которые вы преодолеваете с вашим партнером, но все же почерк их первой мрачной игры, про Братьев, местами прослеживается, например, когда мы серфим по внутренностям мертвого кита. Да, порой игра способна преподнести “недетские” сюрпризы, заметно перегибая в жестокости. Но таких моментов за всю игру наберется штук 5-6.Игру намеренно сделали излишне казуальной, в ней даже нет привычной смерти. Если хотя бы один из двух игроков жив, то второй возродится незамедлительно, а погибнуть одновременно - это нужно постараться.Это сделано для того, чтобы привлечь аудиторию, которая далека от мира видеоигр.Но самое захватывающее в It Takes Two - это разнообразие геймплея. Буквально каждые 10-15 минут игра предлагает новые механики, многие из которых достойны отдельной игры.И тем печальнее, что они настолько скоротечны.Сама же игра имеет продолжительность примерно в 10-15 часов, что достаточно много. Определить жанр у It Takes Two даже еще сложнее, чем у предыдущей игры авторов, A Way Out.Если у A Way Out скелет геймплея составлял, по сути, квест с решением задач, то It Takes Two - это скорее платформер с решением головоломок. На самом деле, очень грустно расставаться с этой игрой. Ты понимаешь, что это игра штучной выделки. И при этом реиграбельна, как минимум еще один раз, из-за наличия двух героев с разными способностями, но важно понимать, что сами по себе их способности ничего не стоят. Они обязательно дополняют друг друга. На этом в целом построена вся игра. Вы не можете быть единоличником, это не та кооперативная игра.Оба игрока зависят друг от друга. Взаимовыручка - главный двигатель как геймплея, так и основного сюжетного мотива.Эту игру больше воспринимаешь как игровую площадку, которая возвращает в детство, нежели что-то современное и привычное.Но часто меняются не только механики, но и сами локации. От простой детской комнаты до сувенирного снежного шара. Или сад на заднем дворе, который напоминает атмосферу Grounded, и многое другое.В игре нет коллектблсов, поэтому локации попросту незачем досконально изучать, к сожалению или к счастью решит для себя каждый сам, ведь их наличие могло бы затормозить повествование игры, излишне отвлекая игроков. А с другой стороны, кто-то бы так и так их игнорировал. Но зато по локациям разбросано огромное количество мини-игр. Какие-то хорошие, какие-то скучные, но с задачей они справляются: задержать вас немного подольше в этой замечательной игре, и при этом они ни сколько не портят общую динамику.А вот уровень интерактивности с объектами не впечатляет. Если вспомнить, то в тех же Братьях наши герои постоянно могли взаимодействовать с чем-то внесюжетным. И у каждого персонажа была своя реакция и анимация на это.В A Way Out это повторили и заметно приумножили.В It Takes Two таких моментов можно по пальцам сосчитать, но не будем записывать это в недостатки. Просто хочется хоть за что-то поругать эту игру.Эта игра подойдет абсолютно каждому, даже тем, кто не увлекается видеоиграми. Это отличная игра про семейные ценности и важность взаимоотношений. И такая игра прекрасно проявит себя на семейных посиделках.Вопрос звучит скорее так: ""А кому ее вообще можно не рекомендовать?"".Наверно, тем, кого не привлекает атмосфера детских мультфильмов. Сюжет здесь максимально прост, как и наши протагонисты. Каких-то интересных твистов здесь можно не ждать, а финал очевиден, даже если вы просто прочитали описание завязки, и это действительно может оттолкнуть кого-то.Но ведь угодить всем все равно не выйдет."

Performance wise, it ran fantastic. There are huge problems with getting origin setup though, and you will have to finagle using the touch screen and onscreen keyboard. I recommend getting whoever you are playing with (hopefully not on Steam Deck) to invite you and having them added on origin prior to playing, or you will have A LOT of problems. Once you get over this hurdle, the game has no issues on the Steam Deck.The game itself is honestly incredibly overrated. I had low expectations considering their previous game A Way Out was a mediocre, completely on rails, forgettable experience. This game is vastly improved in that regard, with a lot control and more variety to the game play. The story, is pretty insulting and likely unrealistic to anyone who has to experience divorce in any way. All of the dialogue is pointless, and frankly annoying. The two main characters are unlikable psychopaths. At one point they in full agreement decided to destroy their daughter's favorite toy, while the toy begged for their life, and forcing her to cry with no evidence that this will even assist them.The coop is OK. In general, one person will be having more fun than the other since both have two different ""powers"" in every section of the game, but one is always more entertaining and important than the other. There's a chuckle or two hidden in here, and you can get competitive with the basic side mini-game, but it's just an OK game all around. Get it on sale or play it on game pass if you're bored, but this is not a children's game at all."

One time you could be platforming and puzzle solving another you would be dungeon crawling or playing a third-person action game. There is even a time where it turns into a Tekken duel with the other player steering while one fights on the wings.My girlfriend does not play many games outside of animal crossing or Stardew valley. However, the game introduces a simple and consistent control scheme throughout the game even through the different “game modes” that appeared. It is amazing for non-gamers and played even better when played with a loving and communicative part. (communication plays a key-role as you will see early on)Overall, the music, art, story, and characters all carry a whimsical nature and aesthetic to it. Bombastic bedroom designs, an awesome clocktower boss fight and a wacky saw-style work shed you will never see the same thing twice. The entire tone is very “Disney-like” whimsical, light-hearted, and warm (minus this whole part with an elephant, my god that was horrible)."

This game is crammed with diverse content: every area looks different, plays differently, and has different pacing and challenges. And toys! There is so much stuff here to just fool around with, without you having to worry about how it connects to the story or progress or anything else.  wants you to have fun, to dazzle you with spectacle, awe you with its grand scope as well as attention to detail, and for you to already miss it when the end credits roll (after ~20 hours).Difficulty level is casual to medium, making it accessible to most gamers, though I suspect that complete newbs might find some of it challenging. There's a bit of fast reflex boss combat here, a bit of confusing 3D platforming there, and intentional coordination challenges. But that's why it takes two: an experienced gamer can team up with a newb and help them learn how to, well, play video games.So much stuff! Lots of little homages to classic video games. Lots of silly characters. Majestic environments. Soaring music. Special effects. I can't think of a single moment that was boring or tedious. That said, if I must really dig deep to complain about something, there were  a few areas where affordances weren't very clear or controls were a bit wonky. But, here's the thing: the price of death is small. So, go ahead and try something crazy. Worst case you die, best you die in a hilarious way.There's a story to it, too. It's rather skin-deep, but perhaps it could be meaningful to certain couples dealing with relationship trouble. Everybody else: don't worry about it. It's just a proverbial carrot dangled in front the proverbial donkey that keeps the action going. This is not a story-driven game, but an experience-driven game.Fun, fun, fun. Get a friend and play.

It has more charm than most games I've played in my life and definitely doesn't lack in other departments.  The minigames range from fresh spins on puzzles I've seen in other games to completely new ideas I've not really seen explored.  The puzzles are difficult enough to keep you interested but give enough context to figure them out.  I found myself needing to finish the game but saddened that it was over.  The overall tone and visuals of the game make me nostalgic for something that doesn't exist.  The game does a fantastic job of making you feel small but not helpless.  The fact that it only requires you to own one copy while a friend can use the Friend's Pass to play it for free really drives home the fact that it takes two and is intended to be experienced in such a way.  The characters play relatively the same yet take advantage of different mechanics to solve the numerous puzzles, sometimes even splitting apart to tackle different elements.  Boss fights are fair, yet punishing.  Comedy is present, yet doesn't beat you over the head.  You grow together as friends and really learn what it means to COLLABORATE.  This game has permanently become a staple of games I have recommended to people and will continue to do so.  10 Hip Gyrations out of 10."

I've never struggled to play something so much. We were on the verge of tears. I cannot stress how deeply unpleasant this sequence is.And the worst part is, the game just forgets you ever did it. The next few levels are once again whimsical adventures in colourful landscapes and we just never talk about the literal elephant in the room ever again.

It introduces new mechanics in each area which is good - but it never goes past the most basic implementation on how to use these mechanics.  I'd expect each area to ease you into new mechanics with some simple uses and then ramp up to more interesting, challenging, and satisfying uses... but it just does the basic stuff and then moves on.The zones do have a lot of cool visuals - but the shallow story, characters, and gameplay means they are rarely used well, and then we move on quickly.I'll also never forgive this game for the elephant.Thumbs down on this game.

It tells an engaging and humorous story with both heartfelt and serious moments. It is easily my favorite game from 2021 and the fact that I went through the campaign twice is a testament to its replayability and the amount of fun to be had in the game. You and a friend or loved one play as either Cody or May, a husband and wife going through a divorce. Because of this their daughter Rose makes a wish and cries on a so called ""Book of Love"" turning Cody and May into a clay and wooden doll respectively. They both then go on a journey through about seven main locations with a ton of subsections and worlds to explore. The game takes you through gorgeously crafted environments such as  all experienced through the perspective of a small bug. It Takes Two is about Cody and May's shared journey to heal their broken relationship. Along the way they meet tons of fun characters and unique bosses that are full of life. One of the main ones is Dr. Hakim. He is sort of an antagonist because he's putting them through all of these challenges, but he's also a big source of comic relief, albeit the main characters provide a lot of that comedy already. The game has a heavy dependence on cutscenes to articulate the story but it handles them well. And throughout the adventure it switches between real life and the shrunken down magical world.  The stunning and richly crafted settings that you traverse throughout the game are home to tons of fun minigames to take part in during moments of downtime. There is also a nice level of achievement hunting to be done from finding a ton of special areas and interacting with the world. The levels are further fleshed out by the music which is nothing to write home about but really fits well with all of the locations you explore, furthering the experience as a whole. The main component of this game is its expertly integrated co-op experienced through a split screen. Experiencing the game with a friend or partner brings a whole other level of fun to the experience and it's extremely cool that they made it so that only one person had to buy the game and the other could just join with the friend's pass. The other feature or selling point that truly makes this fantastical adventure stand out is all of the incredibly implemented mechanics differing from level to level and region to region. Each player has a unique item or ability depending on the level that helps them work together to solve puzzles which are seamlessly integrated with fun platforming. The fact that Cody and May have separate abilities makes it fun to play as one character first and then as the other because you get a different experience each time. The amazingly designed stages integrate 2D platforming with 3D and 2.5D.  The only real complaints I have are that Origin was a pain to set up and it was extremely difficult to find my friend initially. The other complaint was that the game wouldn't output audio through my headphones so I had to listen to it through my speakers. Other than that the game's stellar writing, gorgeous environments, entertaining minigames, mix of puzzles and platforming and the memorable characters all make this an easy recommendation leading to a resounding ""WHY HAVEN'T YOU PLAYED THIS YET?!"""

It stays fresh the whole way through. I want to see more games like this have a 'friend pass' so only one of you needs to buy it. I thought from watching the trailer I had a good grasp of what this game had to give but there was so much more to experience. I played on PC with a controller whilst my friend used keyboard and mouse, they each had their pro's and con's.Achievements: The only downside to the friends pass is that achievements will only trigger for the person who owns the full game so it could be hard to convince a friend who's used a pass to replay to unlock everything. I don't see this as an issue however as it's so good if you have the full version you'll no doubt end up playing with more than one person who wants to experience this masterpiece of a game!"

Her name is Kiara, she was absolutely amazing. I loved her so much even with our ups and downs we still managed to be with each other for 2 years and I have to say, it was the best 2 years of my life. I loved her with my heart and soul but I guess that couldn't keep us together. It was at 8th grade where we broke up and I felt so devastated. I couldn't keep my head up especially with covid-19 quarantine (among)st (us). It was terrible but thankfully with the work of God himself, he brought her back to me, not as a partner but as a friend. Unfortunately I couldn't win her back because she already in the arms of another man. A 7-foot frame, but I swear this man had rats along his back. His name was Bruno, we don't talk about him. All I have to say was he was a terrible dude and I know I was much better. They ended up breaking up.This is where this game gets involved.Current day: It's winter break and I go along to meet my sisters and I come back home with a bit of money. I saw the game was on sale for $20 less, which was my selling point. I had bought the game to bond with her more and thought it would be a super fun time. I told her about this game in advance when I saw it and bought the game for us to play when I got back from my mini trip. I was only gonna be about 3 days gone and she said she was fine waiting for me to get back. Sad stuff, turns out she told another dude about the game and he bought it to play with her when they both knew that I had bought the game to play with her first. I get back from my trip and the first thing I see on her discord status when I get on my computer, is ""Currently Playing: It Takes Two Friends Pass."" I was furious! I had just bought this game to play with her but she went on to play with someone else. I didn't know what to do and went off on her. She completely turned the tables and blamed it on me. I was flabbergasted. I couldn't believe she had done such atrocity. I blocked her instantly out of my fury. I didn't know what to do and I was heartbroken.There I was sitting alone in the dark. Not being able to comprehend what happened. It was just me, my bright ass pc (Ryzen 5900x, 3080 TI, 64 GBS 3600 MHZ Ram, NZXT Kraken Z63 AIO and NZXT AER RGB Fans that I all got for Christmas in a Lian Li O11 Dynamic XL computer case BTW) and It Takes Two which I had no one to play with. It was a sad day for me until I talked to my friend about the situation. He had offered to play the game with me and I was rambunctious, and ecstatic of his offering. I instantly accepted his offer and started playing with him, I realized I didn't need to play with that woman that had did me dirty and I could have fun in other ways.In conclusion, this game is actually pretty good and holds up pretty well. It even holds a special place in my heart because of all this.Thanks for reading my review on It Takes Two :) Edit:I am now playing this game with my new girlfriend and I have never been more happier in my life. She is everything to me and I'm glad I got to play this with her, I no longer have any regrets for buying this game because playing this with her made her so happy and seeing her happy makes me happy."

My girlfriend and I played it together, and I can't tell you how much we both loved playing this together. Every moment, every level, every mini-game and every little detail was absolutely astounding. This was hands down the best game that I've ever played, ever. I have THOUSANDS of hours on multiple games that I've played on steam; however, this game was definitely the most meaningful and loving game that I've ever played. I cried a lot for the ending, and I hope in the future we all can see more from this wonderful team that created this game.I will also say, this is the first time I made sure to look at every name in the credits of any game that I've ever played. I just can't express enough of how much this game really meant to me. This was amazing in every single way. Thank you so much to the developers and every person who helped create this absolute masterpiece. Amazing job, and thank you very much for the work y'all put into this.I seriously can't express how much I appreciate the work that went into this game. Every level was something unique and seriously astounding in the detail and level design that went into this. We had fun EVERY.SINGLE.MINUTE that my girlfriend and I played together.THANK YOU SO MUCH to this entire team! I guarantee this entire gaming community that has experienced this masterpiece loves the heck out of you guys for this beautiful work!"

I bought the game without knowing if I was going to play it. This game is multiplayer only, and to me, most of the people I know of that loves video games lives on other countries, on other time zones and they are busy as well. This is the life I choose, this is my passion, and it is a lonely one. But this game has something to say about that: if you buy it then you get a friend’s pass and the second player plays for free…Now, that was something… but i was still out to find the second player, I had to…  and this proved to be challenging, unsurprisingly, but in the end I managed.When I finally got to play with my good friend, I was glad I did. One of the best things about It takes two, comparing it to other multiplayer games is that it is not really competitive as in “I have to kill the other player” but it is more of a collaboration… (if you play the game you will know what that really means) But deeper meaning aside, it is just that: a truly co-op experience between two players. And I mean that: you will laugh, you will cry, you will scream in ecstasy… and you may also agonize… probably putting your “real world” relationship to the test… This game really needs you to communicate one way or the other with your partner, or your friend or whoever is the other person you are playing with.This game shows emotions through the mechanics you play with on different levels.While playing I experienced once again what is it to play with someone that you are in great synchro with, someone that playing with is like flowing effortlessly and joyously even without spoken words… I also played with friends on other time zones and have a great time while doing it. And finally I also played with someone where gameplay was not always in synchro and where communication was not always flowing effortlessly and was even challenging… but funny enough, this was also a time were communication was key, and through communication we had a great time and many laughs while trying to advance and failing and then succeeding (but mostly failing!). This led me to have one of the best times I had in games with a friend since forever.All this while in the middle of a pandemic, where going to someone’s house was not possible… so that made this experience all the more significant. And in all honesty, in a way it made it even more easy and accessible since I didn’t have to physically go to my friend’s house each time we wanted to play.It reminded me once again, on how far video games have come as a way to express yourself and share experiences with others. This was above everything else, a fun game, with so much variety in it: different levels with different mechanics,  each one having their own distinct theme and mood, feeling almost like a new game each time and still managing to keep it all as a one full cohesive experience with endearing main characters and some surprisingly emotional moments."

It's gorgeous, it's funny, and my partner and I have had an absolute blast with it so far.  You can tell this has been authored with love.  At first I thought the split-screen was unnecessary given we were playing on separate PCs over the internet - but it quickly became important, whilst talking on discord, to be able to see what the other player was doing and give them advice.Additionally the fact that only one of you needs to own the game, and your partner/friend can just use the Friends' pass edition is another cherry on an already well-iced cake.I guess the only way I could not recommend the game, is if you literally have zero friends.

They constantly keep changing the way you play and introducing new concepts and mechanics so the game really doesn't get old.- Varied environments - Every level is entirely different. Surroundings, movement, weapons, everything changes.- Graphics - Overall the game is visually impressive. Some specific scenes are breathtaking.- Coordination - Unlike other coop games, you really can't solo this one. You need to work together to beat it.- Story - The concept is quite simple, but this game really shows you it is all about the journey. You get to learn more about the characters and how they got to where they are as you play.Cons:- Needs Origin launcher.It looks expensive, but it is definitely worth the money. We got two copies and have no regrets. Not even halfway through the game yet, but really enjoying it."

So the aim of the game is to complete all the obstacles to get back to your real body. The story behind the game is really nice and in some instances it can feel close to home as I am sure everyone knows someone in a broken home. Visually the game is incredible. The art-style is really beautiful and you can see all the effort that went into making this game. The music and sounds in the game is really fitting to all the circumstances and situations you are in. All the characters have their own stories and their own personalities show in everything you do. Throughout the game you get to know each character better.Overall I think everyone needs to play this game. It is extremely fun and I am sure that it would help a lot of relationships and get you to think a little further.

Incredibly fun to play, whilst you work together to overcome obstacles, you can also go head to head against the other player in minigames scattered throughout the world of It Takes Two.The story is where the game has its roots, but the gameplay mechanics and puzzles is where the game really shines. You play as parents of a little daughter called Rose and about to get a divorce. But, due to a final wish from Rose, you are given a chance to change that by working on your marriage. To fix it, the marriage does require 2 people to work on the relationship. It takes two to fix problems. It takes two to overcome obstacles. It takes two.Highly recommend this game!!"

A lot of the areas you get to explore are very detailed and fun to explore.Cons:- Forced split screen that serves no purpose 90% of the time. It's a tragedy really, since the environments are so well crafted and imaginative but you can only ever see a small sliver at a time due to the forced split screen. This could have been a really cool mechanic that no other game has attempted, but instead it was a massive hindrance.- Boring. Most of the ""co-op"" was pulling levers at the same time. The mechanics you see in the trailer all pretty much feel the same once you boil them down, and most of them feel quite repetitive after the first five minutes in a level.- Forced writing, bad dialogue, and annoying unfunny characters. The game's plot is so contrived, it's almost insulting. I honestly have a hard time believing the writers had any personal experience with divorcees due to how cliche and uninteresting the story was. On top of that, the characters are annoying as can be - constantly throwing shade at each other and really ruining a lot of the fun moments. These people are NOT easy to root for either. At one point, they even brutally  in order to make their daughter cry, then show absolutely zero remorse for their actions (the game doesn't give you a choice not to , by the way). Most importantly, by the end of the story the main characters still have not had any real self reflection or character growth.- May tells you exactly what to do. All. The. Time. She'll ruin even the most obvious puzzles IMMEDIATELY because she opens her obnoxious pie hole to spell it out for you. ""Pull that lever, Cody! Get the key, Cody! Put the key in the hole, Cody!""- Between some of the crude humor sprinkled in, the game's theme, and the absolutely brain dead puzzles, I seriously can't tell who the intended audience is. It's definitely not meant for kids - or is it? A majority of the puzzles take absolutely zero brain power, but the game itself has a fair amount of adult themes that would be lost on a kid. Playing with a friend can get awkward, but I definitely wouldn't want to play this with a significant other. So if it isn't for kids, it isn't for friends, and it isn't for couples, then who is it targeted towards?Overall, this game was a decent experience, but it's definitely not worth the $40 asking price."

I played this exclusively with one other person, and I played as May.To be totally fair, I understand why this game is as popular as it is.  It's got incredible mechanics, there are times where they throw the visual style and take it to gorgeous extremes.  It also never gets dull, as the game is constantly throwing new mechanics at you and swapping out the old ones roughly around the time where they outstay their welcome.  It does a little too much handholding on the controls for my tastes(yes, for the 100th time, I know F grapples objects), but given the amount of mechanics that this game throws at you, I can totally understand why they decided to tell the players what button does what every time any interaction comes up.  The variety of the minigames is also really good and pretty well paced out to give you a break from the campaign nature of the game of going from point A to point B.Now, for the minor downsides.  You need to make an EA account to play this, that does annoy me.  But it's an EA game, so whatever, I got over it.  I initially had some issues launching the game at all, but apparently something went wrong with the initial installation.  Uninstalling and reinstalling the game got around that issues and the two of us had very few technical issues throughout the rest of the game.  As for some of the sections.  I don't understand what control scheme you are supposed to use for this.  Both me and my friend used KBM, which I feel really served us well in the shooter portions of this, but some of the isometric and top down sections really did not suit themselves to the KBM control scheme.  There were portions where I had to hold down W and tap D to really get the correct average direction to not fall of bridges, not to mention the dash had really weird angles to try and land on the correct platform.  My partner also appeared to be having similar problems with the teleporting mechanic, but I can't comment too much on that because I didn't play Cody(and I'm not planning on going back to this to do so).All of that would be fine, and the upsides far outweigh what I've posted so far.  The issue is the story.  Oh boy the story is... how do I put this?  You know that meme that was going around where people would constantly say ""Better love story than Twilight""?  Well, I can't make any comparisons to Twilight, never saw it you see.  But you could take every one of those memes and put the text ""Better love story than It Takes Two"" and it would absolutely be correct.The story was kind of ""meh"" at the start.  Ok, two people who are getting divorced get Isekai'd into dolls and basically a world created by their past mistakes.  We have a weird ""antagonist""(although not really?  This game doesn't have a true antagonist, which is another problem in of itself) of a book that has them going through challenges to get them back together for love or whatever.  They go through and try to figure out how to return to normal.  For some reason Cody ""figures out"" that since Rose's(their daughter) tears caused them to go into this world, they must be the key to get them back, so they run off and try to get their daughter to cry on them so that they can go back to normal.  It's a really weird leap of logic and the characters honestly have no reason to assume that this is true.  Spoilers from this point on.Then they get to the castle level.  Rose has a toy castle that they get to, and they decide the the best way to get Rose to cry is to kill the queen of the castle.  Queen Cutie, Rose's toy elephant.  They go up to the elephant, and brutally destroy her, limbs ripping off and Cutie begging for her life.  This goes on for maybe... 2 minutes or more?  All with both players needing to press buttons to continue the sequence.  May and Cody are horrific people for doing this, and even if the rest of the story would have been tolerable, it is all soured by the fact that THIS is the first thing that they agreed they should do.  They did comment that they felt like horrible people, but neither of them even remotely thought ""Hey, maybe we shouldn't be doing this?"" and that speaks volumes of their characters.  Shocker, Rose's tears don't work, and they are stuck as dolls.  They deserve it.And then they go to therapy.  It's whatever, probably would be pretty decent if it wasn't completely overshadowed by the previous scene.  It ultimately boils down to Cody and Rose need to find their passion or whatever.  It's from this point that I will take a break from what is going on to our two ""protagonists"", and describe how Rose has been seeing all of this.  Everything has basically been life as normal for Rose, she's more or less been left all on her own and trying to deal with the fact that her parents are getting divorced.  Her age is never stated I don't think, but she's like 10 maybe?  Her parents bodies are still in the house, but they are just kinda sleeping for Rose, she's got no idea any of this magic stuff is happening to her parents.  She goes to her dad and he's just sitting upright at his desk, just sitting there with his eyes closed.  She tells her dad about the book she's gotten and she thinks it would help the marriage.  Her dad doesn't respond(for reasons obvious to the players) and Rose eventually leave, but what really stands out to me is that Rose never left the entrance of the room to go and actually see him.  This all happened with Rose talking to her dad from the doorway.  She eventually leaves the room, but she never approaches her dad.  She also does the same thing with her mom as her mom is sleeping on the couch.  Rose leaves her alone because her mom must ""have that headache again"".  She does approach her mom to play her favorite song when she finds the vinyl recorder up in the attic, but Rose takes a look at what is going on(and has been going on since almost the start of the game) and makes the conclusion that she is the cause of the divorce and runs away from home.  Like what?  Ok, I can understand that she's not entirely thinking clearly because her parents told her that they are getting divorced, but shortly after that, both of your parents completely stop responding to the outside world, and she doesn't consider that they might be sick or injured?  She has conversations with them were they(from her POV) are *completely* ignoring her and have gone catatonic, and she doesn't think that something is horribly wrong with them?  The only way that I would believe that to be true would be if she has been neglected for a very, VERY long time.  And that just makes me consider that it might be better if she were to run away to a friend's house or something.  At least then she might be able to get some help.  Just utterly heartbreaking how this implies what's been going on before the game even started.Returning to Rose and Cody(what? did you think my complaints about the story were done yet? Almost) they are going through therapy, slowly learning to get along again, but the real kicker for me is the final cutscene.  It is revealed(or at least HEAVILY implied) that the only way that Cody and May could possibly get back to normal is to kiss.  I will be honest, I was furious with the game after that scene.  I know somebody who was in an abusive relationship.  Like a real life threatening situation she was in.  So what, somebody like that is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the situation that this game brings up?  Honestly, if some people go through this scenario, the right call could EASILY be to stay that way, and run from your abuser never to return.  Once you make it even a few houses over, you would never be found by your so called ""partner"", and the abuser would effectively be dead in the real world, never to prey on anyone else.It's a real shame.  To have such fantastic visuals and mechanics linked to such an abysmally bad story.  This game is the worst tragedy I have ever seen in every way."
549,56,Gamer Gaming,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mlgpr0l33th4x/,3,,1,12.6,"Posted: April 7, 2021",476,0,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/3d333bac75c9eb2047c897aee8d786e4d456a3c1.jpg,"It Takes Two is larger-than-life director Josef Fares' third outing, taking the co-op-focused adventure engine of his previous game, A Way Out, but ditching the po-faced action movie pretensions that made it unintentionally funny, in favour of hyperactive fantasy spectacle that players can easily engage with on the same emotional wavelength. As before, anyone can download It Takes Two for free, and play it with anyone who buys the full game and invites them.The game starts with the central duo, May and Cody, mentioning their upcoming divorce during an argument. Unfortunately, their daughter witnesses the whole thing, and her sadness kick-starts the ""magical 12-hour couples' therapy adventure"" stage, which will be familiar to anyone who has undergone divorce proceedings before. May and Cody spend most of the game as strange little voodoo dolls their daughter made, solving puzzles and fighting household objects while searching for a way back to their world. They're frankly bullied into this by a magical Hispanic marriage guidance book called Doctor Hakim, who won't leave them in peace until their relationship is fixed. His design and accent will be seared into your mind if you've seen the trailer, but I didn't find him quite as funny and engaging as the trailer promised. In fact, he can't outshine Josef Fares himself, who for our money would have been the best character for this role.May and Cody themselves are difficult characters to write, caught between being disillusioned former lovers and stand-ins for the presumably-friendly players. The writers resolve this by making them readily cooperative throughout, taking a little time to bicker during cutscenes, but working towards ""destructive"" objectives in the hope of just returning home quickly, before Hakim pushes them into more ""constructive"" activities that might actually repair their relationship. The drama peaks at an expertly executed, unbearable scene halfway through, even more powerful than A Way Out's grand twist. From there it's a fairly uncomplicated journey down to a simple but heartwarming ending, but the excellent art and gameplay pulled us all the way to the end even when the story didn't.May and Cody are likeable enough characters but It Takes Two will really be remembered for its level design. It's a whirlwind tour of beautiful, fun environments, including a perilous giant workshop, a grand cardboard fortress and a time-twisting clock tower. In every area you can expect some combination of chase sequences (Cody is pretty much always driving, if you like that), combat (with plenty of fun bosses), rail-grind sections, platforming sections, QTEs, well-hinted puzzles, 1v1 minigames, Easter eggs and smaller attractions where you can have a little break. There's often a section where gameplay will shift in reference to another game, but the default is acrobatic third-person platforming that heavily reminded us of NieR: Automata (by no means a complaint).Each location is a magical version of some area of May and Cody's home, so it holds some significance to their lives, though if you're expecting deep environmental storytelling you won't quite get that, as the characters tend to exposit the meaning behind everything. This is a good choice really, as you have two cameras on screen and are communicating with your partner, so we always got what was going on even when our attention was a bit divided.  Every location comes with its own pair of complementary abilities, which are fun enough to use for the game to be worth replaying later from the other character's point of view. You could make whole games out of each environment and pair of abilities, but I presume Fares gets bored and wants to move on every 90 minutes, so everything changes up again. The levels and abilities are so varied, and often so exotic that we weren't sure whether the artists or the programmers had more work to do, but the game is visually gorgeous and technically brilliant from start to finish.This is the kind of game you'd want to play with a friend or loved one, and it's likely one of you won't be a gamer. The game is relaxed and forgiving enough for non-gamers, though not a good first game - from the start, it assumes some gaming competency which might be best acquired without the pressure of your partner waiting for you to get your act together. The awkward design of some bosses and action sequences had us wipe out a few times even though we're pretty experienced, weakening some of the spectacle, but at least you can be sure you'll be challenged at points. It's also not for young children, despite looking like a Pixar movie.It's rare for EA to invest in something with this much heart; this much creativity; this pricing scheme. This triumph for Hazelight Studios gives me the impression that some part of EA is still motivated by games, not just money - surely if it can do that, it's worth checking out. Our average score for this game was 95%."

Engaging level design, thematic maps, interesting puzzle mechanics, and a two-player system that feels like it requires two people to complete. There are too many two-player games where it's one player leading the charge while the other lags behind as deadweight. This isn't one of them.However, for as intuitive and fun the gameplay itself is, the story is absolutely miserable. Someone called it the ""divorce speed run,"" and I wish I could say that's what happens in the end. Cody and May, the two main characters, are terrible for each other. They emerge from their trials the same toxic people that they went in as. They use and manipulate every side character they meet along the way for their own gains, no matter the cost. There's also this constant mood shift between, ""We're going to die!"" and ""We can't die! Get in there!"" It's conveniently scary when the story wants it to be. Since you can't die, there's no real urgency to the game; no real risk. I wish I could recommend this game. I played this to the finish with my SO and it left us both feeling empty. I want more two player games that utilize interesting systems. But I don't want the story to suffer for it."

A young girl mourning the news that her parents are planning to divorce prays to a Book of Love to make her parents friends again. Her tears take her parents' consciousnesses into two dolls that must work together to find a way to become human.  Along the way, they rediscover what attracted them together, learn what came between them in their marriage, and realize the other person brings something unique and special to the family relationship. At its core, It Takes Two is not a game for children, but rather a deep emotional discussion about love, relationships, family dynamics, and raising children, all expertly woven together into a fantastic adventure that continues to bring new challenges and mechanics to the players.The developers somehow managed to merge a superb narrative with highly varied and fun gameplay such that neither takes second stage to the other.  Each area presents the characters with new unique yet compatible abilities, requiring them to collaborate to overcome obstacles and enemies they face along the way. The world is filled with detail to give the feeling that you really are doll-sized creatures exploring your own backyard, play room, attic, and more.  Also spread throughout the world are 25 mini games included for no other purpose than to give a short competitive diversion. These are fun to find, fun to play, and show that little bit of extra effort the developers put into the game to make every bit of it fun.The game is never too difficult to proceed and never too challenging to feel hopeless. The characters have infinite lives and a great checkpoint system that never requires you to repeat significant parts of any level. I believe gamers of all skill levels would find this game tremendously fun."

But you can easily go past that and just enjoy the ride.- A bit short maybe (around 10-15h depending on how much you explore).

Following the game's two protagonists is very entertaining, listening to their squabbles and dialogue enrich their characters, to the point where I begin to connect with them through their journey to reconnect.

Luckily, It Takes Two comes with a free friend's pass; which means that only one person has to purchase a copy of the game. The adventure delivers a story beginning that most of us have come to know either now or during childhood, given the 40-50% current divorce rate in America: one of two parents in a struggling marriage. The narrative is directed by The game is enticing for multiple reasons; those being the fact that game experiences can a lot of the be times better-enjoyed w/ friends or family, plus, I'm sure more than a couple of us have had wistful desires for our parents to reunite after witnessing constant fighting & the lengthy processes of divorce & custody battles. In this game, you can finally fix that impossible issue. You and your friend take on the roles of May & Cody, the parents of your daughter named Rose, and you suddenly appear in your backyard shed, with much smaller perspectives than before; coming to the realization that you both have shrunk to inhuman sizes. This epiphany is followed by a hysterical freakout from the two, and then the plan of getting out of this situation and back into your regular bodies. The very first level  By now, you & whoever you're playing w/ have to learn to work together efficiently to take on the challenges, optional minigames, & eventual boss fights of each level, this one being about navigating through your abandoned shed & defeating your old vacuum cleaner & toolbox.  You then comb through the dusty ant-infested corners of your forgotten shed, learning to put forth coincided efforts for traversing through each menial challenge with whatever new objects or weapons you're given (this time being a hammerhead and a nail shooter), finally coming to the conclusion: defeating the divided section's boss levels. The next chapter takes you to the tree in your front yard, tasking you with becoming military operatives for the squirrels, who are in an ongoing feud with the wasps. May is given a bazooka & Cody receives a sap gun, & when both weapons are combined, you have the ability to make things explode, which is how you're expected to defeat the wasps. I'm sure all of us at one point have wanted to commit genocide against pesky bugs, & this section allows you to do just that. Even though every chapter has similar elements, there are always new and imaginative ways to go about proceeding with your missions.  Each area, whether it be the shed, pillow fort, literal cosmos, or your child's room; is made with tons of scrutiny & thought, not only with the beautiful & sometimes nearly photorealistic graphics, but also the unique level design & clever mechanics of helping each other triumph through. Nothing ever feels overdone, & you're given ample opportunities to just release stress and have fun whether that be through sliding on massive slides, steering airplane maneuvers, sailing through seemingly ""treacherous"" waters, riding on hallucinogenic catfish, rhinoceros beetles, fluffy bees, frogs, dinosaurs, and just about anything else you can possibly imagine. In addition to this, the game is also littered with amusing references to both Hazelight's previous games and other things like Street Fighter & Dungeons & Dragons, for example. The third segment contains your journey through Rose's room, which has you reliving childhood dreams by passing through a colorful pillow fort and ultimately flying to space to fight an astronaut baboon. The controls often invert depending on what you're currently doing, but luckily this circumstance, nor any of the puzzles or boss fights ever feel too bewildering or impossible to figure out, especially when you have the essence of collaborative teamwork. The only thing I'd really warn you of is the possibly seizure-inducing kaleidoscope part, but the difficulty remains intriguingly challenging whilst at the same time manageable. After your stint on the messy floors of Rose's room,  Dr. Hakim returns to harass you (which he does basically throughout the entire game) by forcing the couple to make it through three challenges, the main themes being collaboration, attraction, & passion.The 1st part, collaboration, brings you to the guttural insides of your household wooden clock; which incorporates a Victorian era, Steampunk-esque village, farmlands, & the only actually difficult area in the game (a platforming puzzle aptly named Hell tower.) When you finish this place, the next segment shrinks you even smaller to the correct size for being inside a snow globe. You trudge through arctic depths where you swim in extremely deep waters equaling only the Mariana Trench itself, which I'd say for people w/ thalassophobia to take caution in only because of the creepy sea creatures that live below. But this level isn't all impending doom, you're also able to explore the lively and adorable holiday village where After freezing through the ice & snow, the last area of the game guides you to Overall, the game takes about 16 hours to complete and it is appropriate for any situation, whether that be two friends undergoing an entertaining encounter together, or a broken couple looking for a profound experience full of metaphorical reasoning to stay together. It Takes Two deserves the outpour of overwhelmingly positive reviews, and it truly builds on A Way Out's strengths. 10/10."

The level design, atmosphere, mechanics, puzzles and minigames are all outstanding and blend together incredibly well. It's a lot of fun.Some people may not like occasional forced split-screen perspective even while playing online, but it is done well and doesn't feel intrusive at all. The variety in tools per chapter and how Cody and May's unique abilities work together to solve the puzzles leaves you looking at the other player's screen occasionally to see what's going on - it's like each of you are playing a different game sometimes.The two main characters are just sort of.. dumb and childish sometimes. It's funny for sure, and can make sense considering the absurdity of the situation, but it's a bit of a whiplash between their lightheartedness and the heavy, sometimes dark overlying story. Perhaps this will change further into the game, though.So far there's been a trend in some of the chapters - pick Cody if you want to drive or maneuver vehicles and pick May if you want the shooting or fighting. They both swap roles frequently but this has been the overall feeling I've had.10/10 Co-op adventure puzzle game"

This review is based on both mine and her impressions of the first two hours of play.Our first issue was that we didn't like the main characters. My friend in particular was very annoyed at the sheer vitriol they have for each other. To paraphrase her: ""This is a point where anything but a divorce is just cruelty to everyone involved."" Like, wow, I saw my fair share of toxic families, but these guys are on a different level. Cody and Rose hate each other with a primordial passion of a thousand suns, and constantly (and I do mean constantly) nag and insult each other. And Mr Book, the guy who's supposed to make the player characters come together, is pushy and not charming at all.But hey, if the game's fun to play, we can just suffer through the cutscenes until things hopefully get better. Yeah? Well, it was quite well thought and diverse, I'll give it that. You constantly get new toys to play with and they're used and reused in interesting and creative ways. That said, I rarely felt like I'm having actual fun there. It was almost like Simon Says: figuring out what is the intended way to proceed, and then doing it in tandem with your partner. We've played a lot of coop games over the years and didn't have a lot of fun here. And finally, the biggest thing - the tone issues. The game presents itself as kid friendly. Little girl making a wish to a magical book to keep their parents together. And surely enough, that's how it starts out...And then suddenly you have to do a God of War-style execution on a boss as they What in the unholiest of hyucks is that? Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with brutality or viscera (to an extent): DOOM 2016 is my jam, I just beat , and I stomped the crap out of the necromorphs in Dead Space. But here this level of violence not only came out of nowhere, it completely clashed against the general tone of the game. And that's not all: later on you get locked by squirrels in a murder room, where you were expected to be killed by wasps - but instead you respawn, and die over and over again (in a cutscene). Also, for some reason there's a torture minigame - one of you gets locked in a jar, while the other one can press buttons to make the other die in horrible ways.What sort of starfish blue and orange morality is this? Oh, the game's made in Sweden? Are you guys okay? Or maybe I've been the starfish all along, considering I've never heard any complaints about what I just wrote.The game's quite pretty, that's for sure - and has this distinct aesthetic that's sure to draw people in. If I had to guess, the popularity of this game comes from the fact that it has this AA/AAA level of production values, and there aren't a lot of coop games of that magnitude. Also, it's published by EA, which grants it massive reach and some top shelf marketing. But the okay-ish gameplay, annoying writing and horrifying tonal issues completely negate any and all goodwill I've had for this game.I'll give it one thing: it improved my relationship by showing me that both me and my partner are sensitive to the same things. But it also revealed to me just how desensitised people are to acts of cruelty. Hope that helps."

I can think of dozens of games across many genres that let me and a friend conquer objectives together, but more often than not, that experience really just feels expanded by another player instead of entirely redefined. I miss games where I really had to connect and rely on another player. The shared critical thinking  gave us in its puzzles that were duplicated in scale, the terrifying shared stakes and antics of , even the  games nail that feeling of cooperation and deliver some really fond memories with a friend. That’s why I’m so impressed by how  has nailed the feel of the co-op game.  is built around cooperation, and it does such a good job of nailing this feel that it makes me yearn for more games like it. While I didn’t think it had the best story or a solid delivery on its themes, what  does offer is a memorable platformer with constantly innovative gameplay, a great cooperational feel, and most importantly, copious amounts of fun. It's absolutely insane just how much gameplay variety  has packed into such a linear adventure. I love the willingness to try so many ideas to  shake up the gameplay, whether you’re unlocking a new way to move, additional environmental gadgets or entering what feels like a completely different game. It all feels so enjoyably seamless thanks to each mechanic's simplicity, allowing you to constantly encounter new ideas without getting overwhelmed. The toybox of mechanics is encapsulated in a very fun platforming system that bridges most of the game together, this alone feels like it could’ve made for a good game, so everything else feels like an incredible bonus.The best part of the constant shakeups was the player's unique abilities. Cody and May have a different central power in every chapter that always feels like such a natural extension of the character. These powers allow each player to bring a unique perspective to the table, but their real beauty in how they integrate with each other. The narrative theming of each power reflected in Cody and May’s cooperation  made for great puzzles and platforming, accompanied by an awesome feeling of progression within each level.On some occasions however, these mechanics did start to feel like they were stretched a bit thin. The tree and clock tower levels especially felt like they may have relied on their mechanics for just a bit too long, as their mechanics really didn’t have enough varied uses to justify the length.This game ended up looking so much better than I anticipated. Each world you visit is simply gorgeous, the bright colour palette really sells the toy-like world, but the texture detail on every object is pretty insane. I really love how each environment had its own feel, I can point to any moment from this game and tell you which chapter it came from due to the vastly different colour palettes and camera angles dedicated to differing aesthetics. The way they all relate to the house together is an awesome touch. It’s pretty obvious for the first couple levels, but getting transported into imagination-fueled interpretations of ordinary household locales felt whimsical, and always kept me guessing as to what world would be next. These worlds are just so well fleshed out too. All of them are more than serviceable for gameplay, but the amount of cute distractions along the way were so fun. There's plenty of minigames implemented across the levels for some friendly competitions, but the silly distractions such as the paint canvas or a very chaotic Etch a Sketch provided some wonderful moments. These were usually scattered across the game, but finding one of those massive hub worlds full of pointless content was always a massive rush, as I knew there’d be tons of diversions to get lost in. I do wish each world shared a bit more connection though. There's a linearity to them to begin with & they often connect to the story events, but they end up feeling so singular at times that it feels like this game could be completely rearranged with minimal impact. It's not a big issue, but I do feel that some of the emotional heights of areas lacked an emotional and thematic punch since they felt so detached from the rest of the game. Unfortunately I often struggled to find the central theme of fixing the relationship very appealing. Credit where credits due, the cast here is amazing. Cody and May have phenomenal voice acting, the dialogue isn’t always great, but the delivery lets you understand their characters immediately. All the minor household objects turned sentient made for some great levity and fun over the narrative too, they were vital to the narrative tone.However, I really struggled to buy the conflict between Cody and May. Some of their issues felt far too basic to be the basis for a divorce at times, most of the arguments felt far too simplistic, it seemed like they’d never communicated about their issues, which didn’t really make sense with the characters actions. A lot of these conflicts felt unresolved over the narrative too, it feels like most issues were skipped or forgotten, while the “resolutions” provided were very hard to buy. I feel like this is a very basic plot tackling a theme that's far too complex for its content, and I don’t think it resulted in a very healthy portrayal of a relationship.The story is all under the guise of Dr.Hakim, a very flawed character which I ultimately enjoyed. On one hand, he's outright hilarious, although I’m unsure to what extent that’s intentional. His dialogue is just so chaotic and strange, a lot of his appearances brought joy in their complete absurdity, but most of the humour just came from how extra his performance felt. On the other hand though, he’s not a strong catalyst for the narrative. Many of his appearances to the couple felt annoying and bloated with repetitive information, and his structure of the narrative is quite bizarre. It feels like you’re accomplishing nothing for the first half of this game, but as soon as the second half starts to get a good rhythm, the narrative reaches its conclusion at an alarmingly abrupt rate. While I think he worked for the fun of the game, he needed a lot more depth to carry the narrative and it’s execution.Favourite Moment:  deserves to be remembered for its celebration of cooperation, a fond gameplay style near and dear to many hearts. The fact that only one player needs to purchase this game means at it's current price makes it a brilliantly valued game. I can’t say the story’s particularly worth the investment, yet I cannot recommend this game enough based on it’s pure deliverance of a fantastic co-op experience."

From travelling through white water rapids, to being kidnapped by giant squirrels, the story and game-play never gets old or ceases to amaze. Just for some background; at it's core, It Takes Two is a story-driven, 2-player co-op puzzle game, with game-play that genuinely never stops changing. The main game is split into 'chapters' where each chapter let's you play around and solve puzzles with different gadgets. As well as sometimes throwing completely different types of games at you ranging from street fighter to rhythm game. Even without the story, if you enjoy puzzle games, this will be a blast, and a lot of fun. The story however, ties it all together so well that it just blends it into one amazing masterpiece!With a single play-through time of about 12 hours- The game managing to stay new and fresh throughout- And a great story to tie it all together, this game is Absolutely Brilliant!"

It Takes Two is a super casual game, but it's extremely varied and much longer than I thought it was going to be. The puzzles and challenges are fun, accessible, quick to pickup and the game at times forces you to work together, in such a way that it never seems like one player has more fun or a more interesting task than the other. The variety of gadgets you get along the way is also another highlight, you always get something different to your partner, and these tools usually require you to work together again.There are times you're against each other too, in the minigames you find along the way; some better than others, but there is a full version of chess, races, shooting type games - the usual sort of mini-game fare.The story/plot is pretty simple but centers around the reasonably grown-up topic of divorce... I found that, because the game is so long, with so many sentimental moments, I actually found myself getting invested in Cody and May's future. Maybe I'm getting old and soft, but there are sections of the game that are purposely made into sort of 'profound' type moments, where you'll be flying through an amazing place or running away from something and the point is that you should be just enjoying these moments together - there is no real challenge or threat - these were just cool, memorable moments for you and whoever you're playing with to enjoy. You don't see that often in video games, to be honest, I've only experienced this a handful of times in many, many years of gaming.Visually the whole style of the game looks amazing, with lots of highly detailed, interesting fun characters you meet along your journey. The detail on the main characters in particular is fantastic.There are various chapters to the game that are all entirely different, and each of the environments are interesting and detailed. They usually have something to interact with for no other reason other than to mess around or get hidden achievements etc so in certain areas you end up exploring and procrastinating.In summary, It Takes Two is a unique coop game, that sticks to a coop style throughout - it works really well and I'd say this was a rare gem of a game. If you have a close friend or family member that'd play through this one with you - do it."

I played with my partner and we have decent gaming experience.  We still fell down random holes, but the platforming wasn't difficult at all.  However, I have a few issues with the game.1) It's too long. While it was fun initially, the game peaks in chapter 5(? or 6, the wizard level).  We played the last 4 chapters just to finish the game.  The last chapter is especially anticlimactic, and doesn't compare to the excitement from chapter 5.2) The abilities are repetitive.  I think the developers intentionally gave the female character the more aggressive abilities and the male character the supportive abilities in the teamwork.  While I appreciate the sentiment (as I do usually support in other games), it was tiring for both of us to be supporting and waiting for the female to do all the jumping by chapter 6.3) The narrative on divorce is (???)4) Cutie.  I am traumatized forever.Would still recommend as the game is well made and pretty unique.  It's super beginner friendly and probably more exciting for pairs that don't game so often."

Each section had new weapons, controls are tight and rewarding, and puzzles aren't too hard or too easy. CONSYou get to play as a husband and wife who are nasty to each other and always putting the other down. They constantly make side comments throughout the game insulting the other. They are completely unlikable and I honestly would prefer it if they didn't speak. I dropped a ball during a task on accident and the other character said ""Hey, butterfingers pay attention"" automatically. They just have insults ready to go! There is a magic book that is kinda annoying that is driving the plot and always around.Spoiler AND THE REASON I STOPPED PLAYINGYour characters assume they need to get their daughter to cry to reverse their curse. They don't ask the magic book and just assume the best course of action is to destroy her favorite toy to make her cry. One of her other toys tries to stop them because he says he's her protector but you blow him up. You get into the castle, get thrown in jail, and break out and kill any guards in your way. Then, you drag this cute sentient elephant that sounds like a little girl over to the side of a tower to throw her off. She screams and cries the whole time asking why you can't be friends, asking what she did wrong, and pleading with them to let her go and she would hug them and make them cookies. You rip her arm and her ear off in the process of dragging her and, ignoring her screams, throw her on over the edge.The parents then dance and laugh while their daughter cries and find out that that isn't how to break the curse. Nope! Didn't have to do any of the crazy malicious things they did."

There are so many, and they're so different. Even if you don't like one as much, you'll like the other and you'll wondering what next power your characters will get. I played as May and I liked most of mine.Then, there's the second best part of the game, which are the characters. I love how much of a badass May is and how gentle Cody is. You can tell by their interactions that they know each other very well and know how to pick on one another lol So seeing the two of them together through the game was really enjoyable. If I may say, I thought the ending was a bit rushed and I wish there was one more ""mission"" before it. The whole game is beautiful and I liked the story, but I felt like there was a small part of it missing at the end of the game. Still, I guess this is a solid 8/10 game for me. I had lots of fun playing with my boyfriend as my counterpart (and although the game was about a couple making amends, me and him fought many times at a few points lol Simply magical) and it was, overall, an experience I'll treasure!"

Its near perfect! The grapchis are amazing, sweet and playful. The gameplay is creative, casual and everchanging. The story is deep, powerful and heartwarmning. I played the game with an Xbox One controller and the controls were on point! This game really is worth every single penny and that says a lot with the current price-tag, but you can get it at a heavy discount at times.Downsides with this game? I don't like that it can be hard to figure out when there is a checkpoint, so the gameplay will be saved, plus the fact that you can't just save manually. Also not a big fan of the whole needing an EA account and that it is not possible to find a Player Two in-game. Its a bit sad, that they haven't implimented that.Stuff worth knowing besides above info? You can play with a friend via Friend's Pass, but one of you need the full game. Only the person with the full game version will unlock achievements. If both players own the full game, both players will unlock achievements simultaneously.All achievements are super easy, as is the whole game. A very relaxing, causal gameplay with lots of elements to keep you interested and entertained for hours!"

Amazing texture work, lighting and 3d models.Gameplay wise it's a fairly simple platform action puzzler, with strong emphasis on teamwork. But even though the mechanics never get very complicated, they constantly change throughout the game, as the two characters get new abilities that synergize together.I didn't do my homework in regards to the story, so the subject of divorce hit a little too close to home.

They swiftly cut-out any issues with this as only one person needs to purchase the game, while the other can install the ""Friend Pass"" and be invited to play with no extra cost. Amazing! The game itself is excellent with so many concepts and ideas utilized to create a fantastic co-op experience. As usual with Hazelight, you'll play upwards of 4-5 different genres of games within this story. From 3rd person action-adventure, to fighting game, to hack-and-slash, to rpg, to top-down, etc. etc. There's no shortness of fun and exciting new ways to keep you playing. This game is a bit longer then Hazelight's previous development; A Way Out, which is certainly welcome. Especially because the game never feels like it is taking too long or putting in little effort...

Yes, its fair to say that its so much better if you play it with a close friend, someone who you've played games with and you know they'll enjoy this style as well.

The devs really poured their heart and soul into the story, the levels and the design. Every new level had something different to do and just when you thought the mechanics would carry over to the next level, new mechanics were introduced that made the game a million times more fun than it had been moments ago.The game requires two people (obviously) and the person you choose to play with really needs to be willing to work with you rather than against you. There needs to be a lot of communication between the two of you for the game to work, but once you get it, you're smoothly sailing. I've never played a game that I enjoyed so much and would HIGHLY recommend this for anyone looking to play with a friend/sibling/parent/SO or anything else - it does in fact.. take two."

Still, the basics remain the same: One player has to buy the game, the other one can use the ""friend pass"" download to play for free. And a second player is absolutely as this game simply can't be played alone; don't expect an option for an AI-controlled partner or something similar. A last heads-up: there's also no option for online-matchmaking, so you'll have to find your coop-partner by yourself.So, what can you expect after finding a coop partner and setting the game up? A surprisingly long story campaign with a lot of variety that'll have the two of you cooperate in ways you never thought about. Seriously, the biggest surprise I had with this game was probably the amount of time it lasted.  lists playtimes between 11 and 14 hours and this matches with how long it took us to beat the game. What's even more amazing is that the game rarely felt like it's getting stale despite its length, the overwhelming majority of the time always offered a new spin on things.And I mean that in more ways than one: From the gameplay to the settings or locations, this game is just bursting with ideas. To not take away any surprise, I unfortunately can't go into detail here, but the featured screenshots should already provide a small glimpse at what's waiting for you. Most of the game feels like a wild theme park ride that moves on just in time when things are about to become predictable. The abilities the two protagonists, May and Cody, can use also change at about the same pace. Sometimes each player controls one part of a magnet, sometimes each of you has a hammer while the other one has a set of nails and so on. Some of these abilities are more standard - like just having a different set of ""guns"" - but many are entirely unique and used accordingly.And when I say used, I mean used to traverse areas, solve puzzles and so on. Think  but constantly switching the environment and tools. Sometimes a player needs to clear obstacles for another, sometimes the two of you fight together, sometimes you just play discoverable minigames together - ranging from stuff like chess to more exciting ones like Whack-a-Mole (one player being the whacker, one the mole). This does require the players to show off various gaming skills, from aiming to platforming to beating rhythm games.This variety should not pose a problem even for less experienced players: The difficulty isn't high and there are a lot of checkpoints. Boss battles, etc. also only reset when both players die and offer a quick respawn. The game is very forgiving in that regard. However, some parts do require a tighter cooperation between both players. For example, one player might need to cross a huge gap by themselves. The only way to get across is by jumping across a few platforms. These platforms can only be moved by the second player, who constantly has to adjust their positions - or the jumping player might fall down the gap. In a case like this, it's impossible for the jumping player to offer any ingame assistance to the other player. Reloading checkpoints, etc. are not going to help either. The player controlling the platforms has to perform the required actions or the game won't continue. In cases like these, it might be preferable to play the game using local coop, so players can offer each other ""real life"" help.Moving on from the gameplay, let's talk plot. To keep the whole experience together, a Pixar-like story serves as the rail for the gameplay train to move on, featuring four main and a large amount of side characters. It's not a tense, more gritty experience like , it feels more like a playable Disney movie for the whole family. The message isn't particularly complex and story developments are predictable in some parts, but it features great moments that'll make both, the ingame protagonists and you + your coop-partner feel amazed. This is a game that you two might not talk that much about in regard to the general plot afterwards - but you'll definitely talk about some characters or setpieces or minigames you lost/won against the other.Lastly, I have to mention the graphics. The game offers great looking visuals, which is even more impressive considering just how many different places you are going to visit. Again, no further details because of spoilers, but expect some ""wow!"" moments - not only because of the used Unreal Engine 4 but because of the amazingly creative designs and setpieces. This game might not break any boundaries for videogame graphics in general but it's still a treat to look at.To conclude,  is an extremely enjoyable coop experience that offers a huge amount of variety despite it's length. It offers some great moments, locations and characters which are certainly going to get both, you and your partner, talking. Sometimes a few chapters stay a little too long and the overall story might not be somewhat predictable and not the deepest - but the overall experience is still amazing and definitely a must-play coop game."

I had this problem earlier on in the story line but It went away on reopening the game. (The issue that I ""Can't connect to EA servers"" even though my network is strong and everything else on my end looks fine)Until this issue is fixed I can't say I recommend, as I don't want someone else to spend money only to not be able to progress any further than a certain point in the game.

Story-wise it kept me wanting to play it, I was driven to keep playing so I could get to the end! Along the way were fun mini-games, hilarious easter eggs/references, and almost a showcase of every genre you could expect; like a testament to the skill of the developers.

Thankfully you don't both need to buy the game, if one of you owns It Takes Two then the other can download a free version of the game and join you through that. It's mainly a platformer game, but it switches between a ton of different genres throughout its run. Game length is anywhere from 8-14 hours, my partner and I did a 100% run and that took us a total of 11.8 hours. The story is very light-hearted with quite a bit of adult humor thrown in there, the game also does have some genuine dark moments. Every chapter in the game has it's own gimmick that you need to deal with till the end of the chapter. Overall I'd say nearly every chapter is relatively fun! Sadly the last chapter is the only chapter in the game that didn't entertain my lover and I. The last chapter feels rather rushed, but the mediocre chapter is followed up by a touching finale in the form of multiple cutscenes. My lover and I both agreed that it's roughly an 8/10 game. I'd recommend playing it in small bursts of 1-3 hours at a time and just taking it slow."

I constantly found myself with a huge stupid smile on my face, just absolute shocked at how much joy I was getting out of it. Not only is this one of the most beautiful polished games I have ever played, but it also unlocked a child-like sense of wonder and amazement in me that I hadn't felt in such a long time. The co-op mechanics are brilliant with an incredibly rich diversity of different mechanics and puzzles. There's just so much incredible technology and small details poured into every inch of this game.It took me a long time to find someone willing to finish it all the way through with me, and I did everything in my power to avoid spoiling myself to anything prior to completing it. If you have not played this game, play it through to the end without revealing any of it to yourself. The experience is that much better if you play it blind. I am so happy to have finally completed this, and I just want to give my sincerest thanks to everyone who made this game happen. It was an incredible heartwarming experience and I can't imagine anything else out there topping it."

It's creative, beautiful, there's more special abilities and mechanics the further you go, the dialogue and story in this game is both sad and funny. And finally, the minigames you find in levels are freaking hilariously fun! I do hope they'll be either a sequel or some other game in the future to be just as fun as this."

Origin, which is very unstable was forced not only to me who bought this game but also to the person I played this with. So the whole 'Friend's Pass' thing makes 0️⃣ sense. And even when I made everything as needed for it to work, it didn't. Boooo EA, boo forever! There were also plenty of places on the map the characters got stuck but that's a minor issue.The thing that is special in this game is all about the gameplay elements that are constantly introduced, similar to how Nintendo does in 'Super Mario' games. They are unfortunately sometimes too short for a player to enjoy but the diversity of them makes up for that. You can catch yourself asking ""Oh, what now?!"" during the play, and that's a good thing here as it keeps it fresh and inviting. I would rave about the graphic but with the GPU prices, I'm stuck with the gtx 10xx that had a hard time keeping up with this game even at low settings. But I've seen it played on max settings on better PCs and it's gorgeous! So the co-op aspect, gameplay mechanics, and great overall graphics definitely check out. What didn't check out are the characters that I simply could NOT stand. I recall calling their daughter Sméagol every time she would pop up and do some dumb thing... Like Jeniffer... gurl, your parents are in a coma (probably) and you're running away from home, tf(?)! The same goes for the parents and Hakim. Lawd, I felt like they all deserved a ♥♥♥♥♥ slap! NOT Cutie III, Queen of the Magic Castle. Oh no, she didn't deserve a thing we were forced to do to her.In the end, it somehow felt underwhelming. The cheesy story met with the heavy subject didn't help. I legit sat there when the rushed end just happened and felt let down with the anticlimatic vibe. Still, would I play it again for the joy of the gameplay and the art? You betcha! There are tons of fun mini-games to explore and 'It Takes Two' is, despite all the issues one of the best couch co-op games in recent years."

Well deserved Game of the Year. Let me first preface this with saying this is not a game meant for kids. Concepts like divorce and the effects it has on children is not for the faint of heart. The infamous ""elephant scene"" is viewed to be dark and turned a number of people away from recommending this game to others, but in my opinion those individuals overlooked the bigger picture of what the scene was meant to offer in terms of the story and the player's views on the overall narrative. That's not what I'm going to make as the topic of my review however. You can find a more in depth explanation on a 30 minute YouTube video essay or something like that.That aside, the game has a well-written narrative backed by incredibly unique game-play. Every level feels different from the previous and offers an experience not found in many other games being developed in recent times. I don't want to spoil anything in particular. So, to say the least, It Takes Two succeeds in offering a unique spin on the Platformer genre not found in other games developed in recent times.Level design is generally linear and easy to play through. I can't say I struggled with the game or really had any frustrating moments, although some parts did require a bit of finesse to get through. Overall very intuitive and easy to get a hang of alongside some small mini-games thrown here and there to compete with whoever you're playing with. They don't do anything to the story, just offers something random and fun to do every now and then. It Takes Two succeeds in all aspects of a co-op game. It is possible to play through one sitting, although it would be a very long sitting, with an average of 12-14 hours to complete. I guarantee whoever you're playing with whether it's a friend or a significant other that you'll have a joyful experience and take something away from it at the end."

All-in-all, a very greatly made game and very enjoyable solo or with a friend.Only issues I have about this, is the signing in to play (Why make it so difficult to log-in or play the game even though it's available on Steam? Not to mention the creating of an account with both Origin and EA -.- ). This took a long time to set up initially and we ended up giving up the first time around trying to sort things out so we could play. Tried again the next day, and everything seemed to work much better. If this game could be made available through steam and only steam (no extra game launchers or accounts needed), it would make it much more easier for the player their self to enjoy getting into it better. Other than that, a wonderful game and enjoyable to play throughout it~!"

But no worrries you get a friend pass for a person you would like to invite to play, so only one person needs to buy the game! Luckily I played with a great person who also didn't want to rush the game. We both didn't have time to play often, so we played once a week at times. And to confuse ourselves a little more we switched the characters each time we played again - it was funny to get used to one side of the screen again. I liked that there were lots of details in the game and you could tell there is a lot of love behind the game design. Storywise it was really interesting and well transmitted. ,,It takes two"" became a sentence I frequently used with the person I played with to joke about something and it actually relates to good situations. Various jump 'n runs, 1v1's against each other, boss fights or solving small puzzles made everything more enjoyable. BUT of course it also helps strengthen a relationship. I was not too close with a friend when we started playing, but because it also needs communication, patience and sometimes a lot of patience ;) - it definitely helps in that way. Especially at the end of the game we took enough time to finish it. The 3d chess game was lots of fun, so we ended up playing it for some hours. One short moment of respect to a particular character:Rest in peace cute little elephant.Overall:I recommend this game to everyone who likes good puzzles, to play with a friend, to have a great time, to play mini-games and listen to a talking book with a neat accent."

It gives you opportunity to look at many things from a different perspective. There are many fun minigames you can play, and compete with your friends. The main story is actually very deep and serious. This game gives you something to think about, it gives you lots of challenges to overcome together with your game- partner, but at the same time is very fun to play. At least  I had lots of fun. I enjoyed this game to the last second of its gameplay. Thank you for this masterpiece. I hope, that there will be similar games to this in the future!"

Diverse gameplay, minigames, and challenges presented in each chapter. I love all the little nuances.As seen in the trailer, there is a spider section and it's somewhat time consuming (not terribly long but also not a short hop). If you can, I recommend playing this section with someone else or taking/giving the controller to the other player.Unfortunately my SO has bad arachnophobia and since we played online, we pushed through and it soured the whole level/game night. I haven't encountered any other possible triggers in regards to phobias specifically and if there were, it seemed short lived.There is a possible seizure trigger in a section of  It is exactly what it sounds like. The last section of the game is also rather trippy.It would've been nice to skip these sections if possible as neither contained much to the overall story. It was just game mechanics that were used once and never again.(I put spoilers just in case but I also kept it rather vague.)But I was intrigued by the fun mechanics and gameplay more than anything as opposed to the story. Despite all that was said above, it really is a solid and fun game for anyone looking for a story-driven co-op game. There unfortunately aren't many games out there like this so if you've got a friend or a loved one to play with, I highly recommend giving this a shot.I do wish there were more easter eggs.

They are easy to learn, the pace at which they change, the originality of them, EVERYTHING is exceptionnally well done !Few things to note:  - My friend's game (the Friend Pass) took 2-3 minutes to starts for some reason.  - The game force the split screen, which I personally liked, to explore and view his PoV or just to collaborate.  - Our highscore in the baseball game is 40, you know, just sayin'  - The entire game took  hours to complete (if that matters to you)I usually never leave a review, but It Takes Two is just surreal, the easiest 10/10 I ever gave !"

Don't get it to play with your kids.Visually speaking the game is one of the best I've seen. There is great understanding of color, composition and visual story telling that is very much felt throughout the game. The game plays mechanically as well as it looks visually. The puzzles are fun and creative and characters feel agile and responsive. Playing the characters feels like playing Mario to me personally.However. This game is *not* for kids, despite its PG12 rating. 98% of the game is absolutely kid friendly and genuinely lovely but the other 2% is completely out of place unnecessary cruelty.There is a scene in this game that ruined the game for me due to how cruel it was. Without spoilers, if you are sensitive to cruelty / torture then don't get the game. Mild spoiler on the scene:  . This specific scene in all honesty pissed me off so much because I never signed up to this. This game is rated PG12 and if you're sensitive to this sort of stuff it can be a little traumatizing. Of course your experience will vary but I for one think this scene alone should've took the game to 16-18+.  I am a 23 year old grown man and this was too much for me.This is such an absolute shame because it puts this big red stain on an otherwise absolute masterpiece. Seriously, who greenlit that scene? Did no one in the development team think it was completely out of place and unnecessary?Despite this genuinely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scene, I can't say the game is bad. 98% of the game is a masterpiece, the other 2% is abhorrent and completely unnecessary."

There is an impressive amount of content (even if you don't choose to find all the minigames and secret areas), and throughout the whole experience there are new mechanics and gameplay types introduced constantly.  No mechanic ever overstays its welcome (though I will admit some stages occasionally feel like they go on a bit too long), and thanks to the immense variety, I think anyone can find something to get excited about.There are some glitches and softlocks occasionally, plus you need to invite friends through Origin rather than through Steam, but outside of that I can't think of much to say negatively about It Takes Two.  If I had to complain about something, it's that the character development is pretty nonexistent for a lot of the game (and the main characters just come off like bad people) until a point where everything suddenly changes; it feels almost insincere when they start improving.If you've got a friend or a partner or just anyone who you'd be interested in playing co-op games with, this is a STRONG recommendation.

The levels are well paced and the puzzles are good.*Different game mechanics for each “chapter” you enter. In one level May could have a hammer-grapple and next she could have a match launcher that explodes on impact.*Lots of Minigames; each mini game was very fun to play and I'm pretty sure there are 25 mini games total.*The Bosses are all unique and relatively easy to beat.*Dr. Hakim’s Book of Love saying “The Book of Love”.*Trippy Level design; I have no idea what drug the devs were taking but in the game, the best way I can describe it is “Honey, the kids are acid tripping AND i accidently shrunk them”. An example is you get transported to a pillow fort, it instantly transforms into a full functioning castle with people living in it. It's very trippy and I love it.* WE KILLED CUTIE!!!*Lots of stuff to explore and interact with; Surprisingly there’s stuff to do besides the story. Throughout the level, you will come across mini games, people to interact with, and smaller stuff to play with like an enlarged etch sketch.*Absolutely no in-game glitches that we came across! *Voice acting was great. *Awesome Platforming levels and action scenes.*Devs truly put their heart and soul into this game. I cannot exclaim the amount of detail they put into each and every level. Lots of creativity!What It Takes Two did Wrong/Bad:*Almost every cutscene jittered and was lower quality than the actual game graphics. Normally the cutscenes are supposed to look better than the gameplay, but it was quite the opposite.*May and Cody constantly bickering; I know that they are fighting and don’t love each other, but at times it got quite annoying hearing them fight all the time.*May’s voice actor; Don’t get me wrong, the voice actor is talented. But May’s voice was so annoying and whiny. *One Liners...*Dr. Hakim’s Book of Love's entire character was cringy and unpleasant to the eye.*CO-OP partner felt that they dragged the game out a little too much at the end.To be perfectly honest with you, there’s parts of this game that my CO-OP partner and I made 18+. All I’m going to say is the Sap Cannon XD. This CO-OP platforming game, filled to the brim with creative ideas and unique gameplay mechanics had me constantly entertained. I got this game for $30 and I highly recommend getting it while there's a sale. (Because saving money is nice)"

First off I completely lost my savegame and had to download some guy's online in order to get back to where I left off. Also, there's a glitch I experienced in the first level where you fill a roomba-style vaccum cleaning bag with red beads. The hitbox didn't line up for either of my controllers or keyboard. Eventually restarting enough fixed it I guess?"

It Takes Two is a MASTERPIECE of story telling and game design. It keeps the player focused and interested by always introducing new gameplay mechanics that never overstay their welcome but sometimes never stay as long as you like. The Mini games encourage the players to explore the environments which are stunning in their own right. Cody and May are very well voiced and come off as real people. I promise you this game will not let you down.

Difficulty: It takes two is not a difficult game, but if you and your friend don't cooperate the game will be hard and difficult.Soundtrack : the soundtrack was good but not Uncharted level soundtracks.Playtime: if you really get attached, you finish this games in a day or two.Game play: I got a and hand of the controls really fast.i highly recommend this game."

It is casual, it is quirky, it is fun, it has never ending variation of game mechanics, the voice acting is exceptional, the puzzles are creative and fun. It has great keyboard and mouse as well as controller support.... Simply fantastic, and I hope it becomes a game the people look back on as one of the most memorable games of the times for it's focus on building a co-op focused game from the ground up. 6 hours down with my partner who is playing for free, replay ability to get the achievements - 100% worth it."

I personally love games like this and games you can play with a friend. Me and my friend were eager to play this game since it's the same studio that made ""A Way Out"", and we both loved that game. So we bought the game on launch. We hade high expectations of the game and me and my friend can say it did not disappoint.I could probably talk all day about how great this games is, but I won't. The game overall is great and if you and a friend are thinking about getting it, do it. Plus, one of you can buy it and then you can split the money between both of you, because only one needs to buy it, because of the firend pass.The story is great, lovely in fact. You'll play Cody and May, parents of a child. They are going through with a divorce, and the child Rose is sad about that. Cody and Mays spririts are transported in to these dolls that Rose has made. The story is really about them getting out of the dolls and back in to their own bodys. And to get out to their own bodys they have to take some sort of relationship counseling from a book, called Dr. Hakim. At first I thought he would be annoying with his humor and such, but it was acually kinda funny, plus the accent is a great touch and makes it so much funnier and better. In the beginning of the game Cody and May don't really like each other that much, they are annoyed of each other. So in the beginning of the game the dialog between the two is kind of fun because they roast each other. As they start to work together and communicate with each other, the dialog gets more humble, and they start opening up and talking about why their marriage isn't working. It's lovley to see their relationship develop through out the game.Gameplay wise, I can't find anything negative really. Some parts aren't as great as others, but they are still good don't get me wrong. You and your friend will decide which character you want to play, Cody or May. I played May trough out the game. Anyway, you'll play different part of, I guess you can call them stages, and on every stage Cody and May will have new and different abillites. In the first stage, Cody will have the ability to throw nails, and May have a hammer she can use. And on the next stage the abillities will be diffrent and so on. May and Codys abillities do work together so to complete most of the pussles you have to make use of each other and work together. This means that your experiance of playing the game will be a lot diffrent depending on which character you are playing. This opens up great for playing the game another time, maybe with someone else or with the same person again.I love the abillities and they aren't boring or something I can say I have seen before in a game. New and unique.I could go deeper in to gameplay but I would be writing forever becuase so much of the game is great. You can find stuff that's related to ""A Way Out"" in the games. I like that, it's nice to be reminded of a great game.So, my recommendation is buy it, it's worth every little penny. It's totally worth it for full price. Me and my friend could have payed more for it, becuase it was that good. For the great times you'll have playing this game, it's worth full price, if not more."

Really brought back what games used to be. A fun and crazy adventure where at each turn you don't know what will happen next. It's been ages since my number one slot for games has been over-thrown, but It Takes Two easily claimed it. 10/10. I believe everyone should experience this game. It has literally, everything."

Compared to a way out this is as good if not better, but with more content that took longer to complete. I also loved all of the different game mechanics they added making small references to different games along the way! I strongly reccomend you play this game!"
