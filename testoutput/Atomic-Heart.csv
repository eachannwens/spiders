2,1,Tamaster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tho545454/,"2,132",36,1,33.8,Posted: 13 March,919,51,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/0e6d01dedd8b5a966fa0808a22bdbaf8332dd085.jpg,"In an alternate timeline, the USSR has become a technological powerhouse after WW2, with breakthroughs in fields such as nanotechnology, AI and energy manipulation that far surpass those of our present-day world. Affirming itself as the leading world power, it builds the utopian symbol-city of Chelomey, and nears the launch of Kollektiv 2.0, a worldwide neural network merging man and machine to an unprecedented degree. Agent P-3, the protagonist, attends the ceremony, but things take a horribly wrong turn.The narrative shines the most in its indirect form, through the visual clues and remains from events transpired before, while it proves mediocre in both lore files, dialogues and cutscenes. The worst offender is your musclehead alter-ego, which not only has the intellectual capacity of a broken treadmill, but is also a ceaseless discharge of cringe, with puns and lines that make Leon from RE4 seem like Socrates. The events are predictable, moral dilemmas get sidetracked, and the classic rushed exposition dump near the end comes as the last nail in this atomic coffin.The world is divided between linear and open-world areas, the latter becoming available only several hours later. The sprawl of facilities, complexes and residential areas comprising the freely roamed, although a few may be inaccessible until a specific story point is reached. In both instances, minutely exploring with the aid of your Scanner tool to highlight loot and other important things, will be paramount to accumulate crafting supplies, blueprints and useful consumables, while also discovering files and secret areas from time to time. It’s satisfying and enjoyable to traverse the world by foot or car - no fast travel so make sure you search accurately. Save points are placed regularly, allowing you to use them unlimited times. The main difference between closed and open-world areas is the enemy presence, much more massive outside, featuring reinforcements and an alarm level system, although your foes can be temporarily disabled by destroying a certain facility.With firearms, improvised melee tools and polymer-based powers at his disposal, P-3 is a living arsenal. Your limited, upgradable inventory can hold a generous amount of ammo, weapons and consumables to keep you alive in a fight, while powers and abilities only have cooldowns, no other resource than time is required. Energy is used instead to power certain weapons, and is gained passively, with consumables or by striking foes in melee. A dodge system allows you to avoid melee and ranged hits, while defensive upgrades and medkits do the rest. Enemies range from simple humanoid bots to mechanical horrors with many weapons and moves, and dangerous mutants worthy of STALKER’s Zone. Mini and proper bosses are uncommon sights, giving you fights that won’t prove too tough especially later on, due to your arsenal becoming way too powerful, same for your skills, granting you simply too many advantages for these fights to be as ‘epic’ as they should be. Unless you get caught in an insta-kill QTE - those are crap.AI-powered fridges, sometimes considerably more horny than expected, will be at your service to craft all sorts of consumables, ammo and upgrade both your weapons and P-3’s abilities -provided you have the needed materials, blueprints and XP, all looted from the world and enemies. These upgrades will add secondary fire modes to guns, improve their stats, specialize them to damage other robots or organics, and upgrade all of your abilities to be stronger, faster, and last longer.In general, provided you loot thoroughly, you will never run out of anything and be in far excess of materials to make all the ammo, health kits and other stuff you may need. It has to be noted that scrapping weapons or abilities returns 100% of their materials, so that you can try different ones and spice up the gameplay, a good choice that however hinders the replay value, since you can “have it all” in the same playthrough this way.Both linear and open sections feature a generous quantity of puzzles, that range from logic-based locks, to timing sequences, beam redirections, and more than a few unique ones with their own mechanics. None of them is very complex, and they’re accessible even to those who aren’t familiar with the puzzle genre. Testing Grounds (dungeons) are the main secondary content, awarding unique upgrades for weapons and requiring some extra effort to unlock."

I thought this was gonna be some serious sci-fi hardcore survivor game based around a story, but instead got a sci-fi fever dream. Atomic Heart seems to take inspiration from a lot of familiar titles like Fallout for it's world design, a mix of Bioshock and Dead Island for its game play and freaking Looney Tunes for it's story.  This game's story is probably the most psychotic thing I've had to experience in the past 10 years. The gameplay is a tier above basic FPS, allowing you to use as many weapons as you can carry with 3 alternate special powers that try to work in tandem with one another. The games default difficulty could be hard enough to justify all that, I typically just used my best one and had so much ammo for every gun I settled for just blasting. My biggest gripe with this game overall was it's dialogue in English. Specifically in English, cause there are parts of this game where the translation feels like it was totally 1 to 1 with its original language, creating these very rushed feeling cut scenes with dialogue cutting itself off, almost as if 2 people couldn't talk at the same time. It was just awkward overall. As for the dialogue content, I think a lot of people will be split on this but the main character in English and some other characters are very colorful I'd say. A lot of what the main character says or does is very wacky and his glove companion don't really seem to mesh well with him. It's like if a high ranking officer in the military acted like a neurodivergent teen that watches My Little Pony on his adventures with his milquetoast robot butler. On the other hand, I think the main character made more fun, he's just largely immature. Also the PC version was insanely smooth for a Denuvo user, only thing that was suspicious was how long the loading elevators were. But I kept 144 in the open world very consistently with no stuttering. I even tried to get a whole village to attack me and it barely dropped.8/10 - Would let NORA kill me"

The music is excellent, it's a mix of Russian music, electro and metal making the universe even more immersive in this world full of technology and robots.The story is also very good, you will want to go on to understand what is going on, there is a lot of lore on terminals that you will find throughout the adventure. The cinematics are also very good despite a rather average lip-sync if you don't play in Russian. The character is also very pleasant to play with a humor similar to that of Wolfenstein/Fallout.As for the gameplay, the fights are pretty cool, your glove gives you access to different powers in addition to your weapons. You will be able to modify all your weaponry as well as these powers throughout the adventure in secure areas by finding loot. The bosses are also very pleasant to face, with excellent music made by Mick Gordon (Doom, Wolfenstein..). There are also the puzzles that I personally loved to do, they are not numerous and are renewed in each zone which makes them all very enjoyable.One of the only negative point for me is the ""open world"" which could have been avoided. You will be at some point in the game in quite open areas (like in metro exodus) where you can find plans of sights or magazines to improve your weapons. The problem is that the driving of the vehicles is quite bad and that there are too many enemies in my opinion, fortunately this represents 15% of the game which is not too disturbing.In conclusion, Atomic heart is a very good FPS like we haven't had in a long time, it knows how to innovate in its universe as well as in its gameplay and has its own identity. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a very good single player FPS with a good story and an excellent universe, you will spend a very cool twenty hours. And yes for once the game is well optimized."

Very repetitive, a lot of highs, a lot of lows, messy pacing, but enough interesting things to keep you going. Paints both communism and capitalism as bad if you cared about that. There's actually quite a bit of robot girls.Beat the game on normal in a little over 13 hours. See literally no reason to replay unless I want to just look at stuff. You can easily extend this time by really exploring the overworld. If you find value or enjoyment in the overworld gameplay loop, then you'll probably enjoy going through it. I however, did not find value.The good:- The music is definitely the highlight. At its best its really good and exciting, at its worst its still interesting. Which is better than forgettable imo- Very well optimized. I had very steady frames and only encountered a single glitch that required a restart. But that only happened once and I was jumping in a spot I wan't meant to.- Great setting and visuals- Story is decent, nothing mindblowing. There are a few things that don't make sense, but there is still setup and payoff within the narrative- I felt the difficulty was fine throughout. I was never on autopilot when in combat and would still find myself making mistakes and dying. There are certain perks that are a must have and you definitely feel the progression. I found myself wanting to avoid combat near the start, but not at all near the end.- I liked every side character/robot. There was a certain red robot that I wish had more screen time. It was fun whenever I saw it. I've seen that some people HATED this character, but I personally like it. - There is a mission/dungeon with what I thought was a 10/10 subplot in the readable records and audio recordings.- Very small and isolated moments throughout the I absolutely loved. Like some character interaction or world building moments. The bad:- Probably the biggest issue: pacing pacing pacing. It made no sense. They tried to do what Bioshock Infinite did with seeing columbia all nice and pretty and happy before things go wrong, except not as well both thematically and in execution. You sit through what is basically an interactive cut scene with really on-the-nose exposition and a lot of NPCs going ""wow, it sure is amazing that we have such amazing science in [city name] thanks to [name] and their [invention] that recently came out."" After this you, you arrive in the open world to go to the first mission/dungeon. I then spent 4 hours on this first mission. Then back to the open world for 10 minutes to get to the next story mission. Then another 2-3 hours on that. Then everything gets shorter on average afterwards. The first half of the game has so many puzzles that you would think it was a puzzle game first before a FPS, but then the last half of the game has literally no puzzles so idk. Its a mess.- The game has an ""open world"" tag, but is only ""open world"" in that there is an overworld that you can explore (kinda). However, there isn't really anything to do other than collect weapon blueprints and kill robots. The overworld only stands as a set piece to get from story mission to story mission. I spent maybe an 1.5 hours total in the overworld, and I was really trying to find interesting things to do. There was a point in which I wanted to travel to get an upgrade for a weapon only to find that the entire section of the map was cut off and I had to progress through the story to open it. There wasn't even any indication that it opened when it did. And by the time it did, I didn't need the upgrade. The combat cycle for the overworld can just be ignored. There are sometimes just too many enemies in a given location. Like, you will scan the area and there's 30 things on your screen with lines connecting them and then they just keep adding more and more as you progress through the story. - There are lines of dialog that are just bad. Not even like ""oh that could have been better"". More like ""I wish i didn't have to listen to that"". You kinda get used to it though. Or maybe it just improved a bit over the course of the game- Voice acting is good, but the direction is often terrible. The MC will say a line and deliver it well, but in a tone and inflection that does not fit the situation at all. I found this happening a lot. I'm told the Russian VA is the best option.- Unbelievably repetitive. Very little enemy variety. Only (one)? dead soldier model. You will spend hours collecting things to put into other things to open doors and then open some variation of three lock types on a door to again collect things to open another door and then talk to an unmoving dead body. Each time you fight some amount of the 6 or so enemy types. (eidt:I looked this up, there are 9 normal types. 3 have variants. The rest are boss types. You see one type way more than the rest). The game also tries to be cute with it by having the MC say something sarcastic like ""Wow, another lock on the door. Who would have seen that coming?"", or ""Yeah, of course I have to go collect more capsules. What else could it have possibly been?"". As though that makes this type of game design excusable. - The first boss fight blew my mind away. Like probably the best moment of the game. Then all other boss fights are boring.EDIT:lmao people got heated in the comments, which is fine. At the end of the day, it is a negative review for something they may have enjoyed. In regards to my point on the price of the game; It's not a matter of being able to afford it, but rather that the game is simply not worth full price. If you are ok with paying $60 for 10-12 hours of content, go for it. If you can find it cheaper, you should probably do that instead. If the asking price was lower, it would arguably decrease quality expectations and the game's issues would be more excusable. But instead, they want a AAA price so I will expect AAA quality and will judge it so. My other criticisms still stand, regardless of the price. I don't hate the game, I just don't recommend it as it currently is. Also I've never bought any COD of FIFA games. I don't know where that point's coming form. Cheers"

Making satisfying slash.+ Interesting story and world building.+ Grandma with Rocket Launcher.Grey (?):? Alot of ""camera"" everywhere. alerting nearby enemy to you when spotted.? Ammo management on guns.? No running. Probably later on in game.. maybe??? No photo mode.? English dub is cheesy. Dude likes to jokes alot.Cons (-):- Fight is frustrating with alot of enemy surrounding you.- Very slow climbing speed.- No saving everywhere. Only auto save and save spot.- No FoV slider. edit: FoV addedThe game is totally worth full price knowing the game is not made by AAA studio but has quality of it. Great performance on day 1 is very surprising on 2023 where game are filled with performance issues."

In the same way Bioshock Infinite made commentary with the star-eyed patriotic citizens of Columbia, all of the civilians here loves communism and its leaders that do no wrong.The USSR leads the technological race with wonderful advancements that will never go south. Until they do.Then the game's other similarities shine. There's exploration, audio diaries, frantic combat with an array of weaponry, left handed magic/plasmid/tech stuff, a story of intrigue and so on.Atomic heart wears its inspirations on its sleeve, but it definitely brings new things to the table too.Primarily, the number one selling point in my opinion, the absolutely unnerving robots and machines.It's a lovely conglomeration of soviet-era amusement park aesthetics with 50s sci-fi tech, and I loved seeing all of the creative designs as I progressed throughout the game. All of the designs feel authentic, and are animated beautifully. And once enemies start attacking, their sheer speed and weight is genuinely scary to go up against.Combat feels really good. Not only do enemy attacks get my adrenaline going, but the weapons you use, feel and sound so meaty. The core combat loop will also have you dodging frequently as you fight. You are not that mobile, and can’t sprint, so you need to time your dodges well. Additionally, you’ve got your glove that can cast certain abilities that will hinder your enemies. I didn’t find them as interesting as the plasmids in Bioshock, but they do give you a few more tools to spice things up overall.Your weapons and glove all have plenty of upgrades you can choose from as well, which allow you to play around with different playstyles. It’s nice that you can also get refunds for everything you upgrade, which encourages experimentation even further.Exploration is slightly weaker in my opinion. I did enjoy the quick-looting gimmick the game has, where you can just hold the interact button to suck up everything in front of you to speed up the process. But some of the environments aren’t that interesting to look at. And I enjoyed the outdoors areas less. Although the atmosphere is nice, I found that trudging around got a bit tedious at times, especially because of the horribly annoying camera system.There are tons of these things littered outside, and if you get caught by one, it will raise the alarm and spawn an enemy. If you’re seen fighting that enemy on the camera, even more enemies will be spawned. You kill them, or the camera, and then these little annoying drones come out and repair the camera and enemies. And sometimes it feels like an endless cycle.Even if you don’t get detected by any cameras, it gets tiresome to make your way forward and have to constantly stop and shoot all of these cameras and drones. I found the game way more enjoyable in the semi-linear indoors sections. But overall, I love the overtly patriotic setting the game takes place in.Let’s talk about the story. I enjoyed the overarching story and lore, but the main character is a bit insufferable.First off, he’s definitely the character that’s voiced the worst in the game. He's good and bad depending on the scene, which leads me to believe it’s more of a problem with the direction the actor got. Either way, his emotions and intonations are all over the place. Sometimes he’s cheerful when talking to a dead body, and other times he’s perplexed by the simplest concept explained to him. In general his dialogue pacing is off. Sometimes he rambles, sometimes he talks too quickly, and he’s just a bit of a weirdo in general.The worst part of all though, is he’s just a bit of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It’s like the writers wanted him to be a cool 90s first person shooter protagonist like Duke Nukem, but without any of the likeable characteristics. No funny puns or one liners, just pure… bitchiness. He’s just always being a ♥♥♥♥♥ to everyone, even though he at the same time, tries to act like a tough soldier. It really annoyed me throughout my playthrough.Well actually, I lied, he’s got one one-liner. For some weird reason, he loves repeating the most bizarre catch-phrase I’ve ever heard in my life. “Crispy critters”. It’s his go-to exclamation for any situation he’s in, and feels quite forced.Also, everyone including the protagonist sound American or British, for some reason, which I found very strange.A frequent annoyance I ran into, was that I found myself progressing too fast for the game many times, which would then interrupt the dialogue I was listening to. It happened so much that I had to end up stopping in my tracks everytime exposition cropped up, which I’m sure you can understand broke the flow.In conclusion, the game’s dialogue & protagonist are a bit of a weak point for me, but the world’s story is intriguing enough to keep going. That goes without even mentioning the fantastic enemy designs, great combat and kick-ass soundtrack. If you enjoy games like Bioshock, Prey, Half-Life, Wolfenstein New Order and so on, then I’m sure you will enjoy your time in Atomic Heart. As a nice bonus, it runs butter smooth! A rarity in modern times."

And for good reason. This game is inherently political, but has been in development prior to the current ongoing war in Ukraine and thus, viewing it the lens of the war itself is not entirely appropriate. The USSR was a pariah to the West in the Cold War as the West's adversary and thus, many of the politics of the Cold War are merely relevant today and the game itself is not attempting to make a modern commentary on this specific conflict as some have accused of it.Also, the purchasing of this game is not actively moving the frontline in Bakhmut forwards or backwards. Stop falling for sensational, yellow journalism that only wishes to further draw ethnic lines between human beings. We live in a time of great tragedy, but this game is not Russian or Soviet propaganda. If anything, like most works from the Post-Soviet world, it was developed by Post-Soviet individuals with unique ethnic, cultural and religious identities who compose a larger identity than what a mere word to denote a nationality can possibly describe. If you feel guilty about purchasing the game, pick up the Ukrainian made STALKER games, Metro games and pre-order STALKER 2. You won't regret them, as they are some of the best games ever made.Note, I am slightly biased to this game as I know some people who were commissioned to provide models to the game during its intense and hard development.What is so interesting about this game's story, is that while it certainly has tropes that dominate Eastern European games and also tropes popularized in larger FPS games such as one of the Call of Dutys (I won't say which, to avoid spoilers), the meaning of these tropes elevate the game beyond it being a mere spectacle. The developers previously made this setting as a literal VR playground and while the environments are gorgeous and interesting, while the setting itself is an inspired spectacle (and its the BEST OPTIMIZED GAME that looks as GOOD as it does in the last 5 years EASILY) but its ultimate meaning is rather great.And many will find the story unremarkable, largely because they have seen these character motivations and story beats as mere entertainment tropes to expand story telling, but for many Post-Soviet individuals, these themes were very real. Idealism, the 'Dictatorship of Science', the idea of losing free will in favour of being secure, safe and protected, as long as you follow the status quo... the idea that happiness was obligatory and not a unique, crafted and personal feeling. The game remarkably has healthy and strong critiques of Communism and Capitalism.The game's setting has a lot of parallels to the current AI scape in art as well, making us question if progress is necessarily good if it completely replaces humans. Robots that are sexualized ballet dancers with combat capabilities further explain this commodification of human heroes. Ballet dancers were glorified and romanticized figures in the Soviet world of art and theater, a prominent part of its cultural-combat against the 'degenerate' values of the western world that quickly began to see entertainment as a commodity and not an intellectual value.The commodification actually best represent the ultimate flaws of the primary social ideologies that continuously hinder and entrap humanity form its own evolution. Technology replaces art, effort and humanity, at the cost of convenience. But the philanthropic, friendly face of this technology, of this dictatorial, despot of scientific achievements without restraint - is inherently politically aligned to the Cold War tragic connection to imperialism and militant competition from both sides of the Iron Curtain. In other words, 'progress' is merely an aesthetic, the ultimate motivation of some of humanity's greatest achievements in the last century is to be the 'winner', the 'ruler'. Competition between humans has brought forth amazing innovations and inventions, but eventually, when human's lose their free will, their purpose in life, they too become a product, a commodity. For some, the ideal of a peaceful future is to deny humanity itself and to restrict free will, to live in illusion. Slavery with extra steps, in other words. The game, if anything, is harshly critical of human nature and is quick to poke holes in the concept that any state can be inherently good, as long as it is ran by humans.In a way, it brings up the question: is Communism an impractical ideology, because it can never be achieved because humanity fails it continually - for humanity constantly fails itself? Or is it that, Communism can only be achieved without the human element itself and at that point, when do we give up our humanity in favour of a harmonious society? When do we choose to become slaves? This in turn, comes back to a theological question that we find often in Christianity: is the existence of evil and free will the one thing that gives our fragile lives nobility, for otherwise, we are merely slaves and servants? In the end, when it comes to choosing one lesser evil over the other, the only way to 'win' is to somehow pick neither. But we do not live in such a world, nor does Atomic Heart take place in one.The game has its short comings, but as a proper AAA game from Russia, it is entirely competent, boldly interesting and the cutscenes... some of the cutscenes really emphasize the absolute film-like beauty of shot framing and spectacular visuals that feels genuinely artistic, compared to many of its contemporaries. One great benefit about Eastern European games is that they aren't made for everyone, many people who are not well-read will fail to see how truly deep the themes can be - even if the story itself is lacking. These sort of games require an open heart to empathize with what we disagree with and approach what we fear the most.That being said, the localization from its native Russian is more or less, completely accurate... except for the protagonist, whose english lines and dialogue is absolutely deplorable. And it shows why Russian protagonists work best as in Russian protagonists in a Russian speaking story. The mood, the delivery, the dialogue is significantly superior and still holds onto the absurdity (the english localization coins the catch phrase 'Crispy Critters!' in favour of the much more appropriate, Soviet-era, childish cure of '♥♥♥♥♥♥' pies!') that actually matches the protagonist very well.Many seem to dislike the protagonist and I believe that is because of how the localization department aimed him. However, play the game in Russian and while you will miss a lot of dialogue if you are not fluent in its comprehension (there is an absurd amount of spoken dialogue, to the point its one of my only complaints, this game has a lot to say and sometimes it really needs to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and let the player play without waiting for a conversation to end. This is ultimate a left over fact from its original concept as a more open world game, rather than an open-ended environment-level based, primarily more linear game it ended up becoming in later stages of development) The character's childish ways come to make sense and also, ironically, represent the WW2 veteran of the Soviet era very well. An entirely capable man who lost his decency, manners, politeness and concept of 'maturity' along with his youth and childhood, during the terrible war."
48,6,Oi,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198275281641/,76,4,1,33.7,Posted: February 28,276,9,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/7652036ab709b5928478c1d58bed41c1c0b6dbfa.jpg,"Atomic Heart is a stunning-looking game in atompunk art style mixed with Soviet Aesthetic. It is quite fun, but as the studio’s debut title, it is flawed and has some utterly weird design choices that do no good to the experience, hence I have mixed feeling.People refer this game as Russian Bioshock, but their gameplay similarity stops at both can shoot and use abilities. Atomic Heart is not an immersive sim either, where players are given various tools and means to approach objectives as they like. It is an RPG shooter like Fallout and STALKER but with a tuned down open world, featuring resource gathering, puzzle solving and half-melee-half-shooting combat. Looting for upgrades feels satisfying, with one of the best looting mechanics and animations in gaming history, and the puzzles are innovative making it my favorite part of the game. Combat, however, has something desired to be improved.As melee charges up powerful energy weapons, players are motivated to mix melee and shooting as well as abilities to gain leeway in combat. These three are well integrated together, creating a fun and relatively innovative combat loop. But on the downside, while shooting feels crispy and it is good that melee weapons offer different heavy attack modes, melee just feels average. The lack of FOV slider also makes melee disoriented sometimes, as default FOV is uncomfortable. Besides, elemental attack is applicable to weapons, but I really don’t see the use of it as weapons are already powerful enough without it (perhaps more useful at hard difficulty). With it being unnecessary, Polymer Jet (shoot out substance that enhances elemental effects) also becomes a useless ability.The open sequence is the worst part of the game (from underground facility to getting out of the village). It is extremely overwhelming, throwing lots of stuff at you without properly explaining, while MC and the AI (Charles) keep talking and talking in your ears nonstop. It exposes lots of problems the game has:Furthermore, as frequently as the game needs you to use scanning vision, it is very cumbersome that objects don’t stay highlighted for a while after exiting the vision, to the point it actually affects the gameplay flow. I also think it is inappropriate to put nonlinear session at the start because players can easily get overwhelmed, whereas the ending session is mostly linear and straightforward when it was supposed to be more challenging. The two should be switched.The biggest issue I have with the game is the open world. After players are first introduced to the open world, it is natural to explore around. However, this starting place has the highest enemy density of the whole game, and at this point of the game, players are underpowered. As a result, this little exploration turns into players getting slaughtered over and over, like the game gives you a massive middle finger for not following the waypoint.But it doesn’t stop there. Hyper-aggressive enemies are everywhere throughout the world, despite not being as dense as the starting village. Gun blazing or stealth won’t work, as crouch walking is so slow that stealth is completely situational, and fighting them is basically fighting a losing battle. Since repair drones come in no time to revive fallen enemies, fighting just gets you more and more enemies. Therefore, your best approach is to run past everything, or deactivate robots in one area using a set approach, which the game only tells you how after you somehow do it once. This design (the more you fight, the more you fight against) is definitely realistic, but it is quite bizarre for gameplay to implement such a mechanic, as it severely disincentives players from exploring the world, whereas the game was supposed to encourage players to do so. The poorly designed map system won’t help either.This also brings an issue to difficulty setting. I originally played the game at hard, but in the open world it is easy to get killed by accident losing all the loot and progress, so I switched to normal difficulty. But at normal, combat is way too easy using adrenaline, as I walked over every boss fight without a scratch. The experience is pretty broken and I really think the game should do some rebalancing.For the story, due to cultural differences and lost-in-translation problems, I don’t think it conveys exactly what the writers intended. Still, I am not a fan of the story, since it is predictable and just a matter to see how. It also has an obnoxious plot twist so that players can share hatred towards antagonist with MC. The main casts are very underwhelming as well. Charles is probably the best of the bunch as the collected one, and MC sounds like a stupid 15-year-old cringe lord whose edginess is off the chart. Though it has a story reason and his character develops as the story goes, it doesn’t make him likeable. The story was also supposed to show how MC and Charles form a bond through fighting together, but you won’t feel it at all (but it is important for the plot). Additionally, English voice acting is not good, and cinematics have scene connection issues. In several scenes, some characters just jump in or out quite abruptly without proper transition. The final cutscene also has a plot twist caused by MC’s strange action, which I find very bizarre and unbelievable.What I do really like are things outside the main story. Nora the Repair Shop and Tereshkora at the museum are funny and interesting characters. Sub-plots show lots of issues this supposed-to utopia has, as sarcasm, alarm and revelation to many social problems in real life. I also enjoy the world they built. It is believable, detailed and full of backstory. Plus, though many tracks are too heavy metal for me, it is applaudable that the game has such a big selection of music. It is very unfortunate that some design choices are not mainline and many execution details did not get smoothed out, making the game not as good as it could.Overall, I don’t think Atomic Heart is bad, but it definitely can feel like a mess sometimes. There are things to enjoy but also things that are rough and infuriating, but I do recommend giving it a try (or later, 4 DLCs are coming) if you don’t mind imperfection and love to dip your toe in new thing."

Feel free to scroll down to the conclusion and score given to the game! :)Have you ever been dropkicked by a robot? Well, search no more because that is an everyday occurrence in the glorious future of Atomic Heart. A new IP that oozes personality with its art direction set in the futuristic Soviet Union, the title has been a project I have been looking forward to for a long time. Games like Fallout have not been magical in a while, and Bioshock is a distant memory of the past. Still, Atomic Heart is here to rectify the lack of a utopia gone wrong.The title is entertaining; enemies create pressure by being incredibly dangerous when they spot you. They can cut, burn, melt, and even kick you in the face. The player will get familiar with the foes quickly as it takes knowing them to take them down effectively. The guns all pack a punch and are fun to shoot; you can mix them with cartridges that give them elements such as fire or electricity and tinker them to your taste. The game allows you to refund all weapons and abilities you purchase so that you can explore and change your build whenever you please by giving you 100% of your resources back.There are also abilities one can obtain and use. Still, these were more valuable trinkets, such as levitating enemies temporarily or freezing them in ice. Only the guns will open your way into the depths of robotic hell. Some firearms, such as railguns or bazookas, are comedically giant. There is a tactical aspect to Atomic Heart, as some enemies will take meager damage unless a specific element hurts them, and your arsenal will dictate how well you do against certain foes.The main protagonist of the game,  Sergei Nechaev, is a war veteran that serves professor Sechenov as they try to avoid a catastrophe. The character controls could be more precise, with Platforming being the most prominent issue. Sometimes the jump input won't register on some sections. At other times, the objects one needs to use to advance seem in battle, with the controls requiring precise movement but failing. In addition, enemies can overwhelm the player if they are on the ground after an attack. It becomes frustrating as you die with no escape.On a more positive note, the map design is out of a dream in this title. The open world is full of facilities to explore in search of effective weapons blueprints; there are dungeons to discover with exciting mechanics, platforming challenges, and much more! The whole thing is a beautiful craft that begs to be scoured. The only bad point is that some environments could have been more convenient. Sometimes you can grab a shortcut over some clifts or rocks and find yourself stuck, but that is a rare occurrence. I only suffered three times in the whole 14 hours of experience.The visuals are crisp; a lot of detail and care are delivered to how the enemies and locations look. From terrible morgues to colorful hills and futuristic installations, the landscape players will gaze upon varies. Enemies are given another layer of importance in terms of ammunition and weapons. Not fighting enemies will save you ammo, but destroying them will allow you to upgrade your weapons as you take their components. It stops the player in their tracks as they ask themselves if they should not avoid the confrontation but take it for future gain and rewards stealth with some extra bullets!The sound design is boom static with loud explosions, guns that pack a punch, and enemies going feral on the screen. They can howl like an animal or greet you before attempting to terminate you. The music reminded me of DOOM music in some areas of the game, and it just edges you to unleash your rage and destroy these robots! (Mick Gordon from DOOM did some of the soundtrack pieces!)In terms of replayability, Atomic Heart only offers a little. You can still explore the open world after the story, but I didn't notice a new game plus option, nor is there any reason to revisit the story. A run and done deal unless you fancy yourself a completionist.The game suffers from bugs, particularly ones that forced me to return to the main menu and redo some game sections. While it was rare, it broke the pacing, and one can tell the title could have used some more patches to help fix the stability of the experience. leaves a bittersweet taste in my mouth; it is a game with many little problems that bug me as I play, but in the end, it is an experience I enjoy. Clunky character control and some bugs that ruin the pacing a bit cannot come closer to a title that is charismatic in its personality and originality. A vibrant FPS with great gameplay, big guns to blow robots with, and strategic options in approaching foes with the correct arsenal, it follows a daring devil style in which you go all out in every fight! Is it worth picking up? Only a few games have such an art direction, and Atomic Heart certainly brings something new.9/10  AMAZINGIf you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck!"

Set in a clever and immersive alternative-history world that is brought to life by its exquisite visuals and an outstanding soundtrack that enhances the already entertaining combat. However, exploration lacks excitement and feels tedious at times, and the narrative often becomes incoherent while also being plagued by inconsistency in game design choices. Despite these setbacks, Atomic Heart is still undoubtedly thrilling and enjoyable. It remains a game that shows the developer's creative vision and passion for the project. If you can look past its flaws and inconsistencies, you will find an engaging and challenging experience that offers a unique blend of genres and gameplay mechanics.Set in an alternate reality in the 1950s, where the Soviet Union has developed advanced technology and lives in a utopian world where humans and robots coexist. A new robot-control system is about to launch, but a tragic accident occurs and disrupts it. Mutants, terrifying machines, and powerful robots suddenly rebel and kill everyone in sight. Only P-3 and his experimental power glove Charles can stop them while uncovering the truth behind the disastrous launch and whatever else they might unveil on the way.While the concept and setting of the story are intriguing and have a lot of potential, it, unfortunately, falls short in execution. It starts strong with an engaging and tense atmosphere, but as the story progresses, it becomes increasingly silly and nonsensical. Certain characters have unique moments but are not well-written enough to be truly memorable and often rely on exaggerated actions or quirks to stand out. Nevertheless, the story definitely has its moments, and the witty humor can occasionally land. However, it requires a lot of suspension of disbelief to remotely enjoy it becauseit can be stupid.At its core, Atomic Heart is a first-person shooter that blends aspects of action, horror, puzzles, and exploration into a wacky and flawed but fun experience. Gunplay is intense and dynamic, with a visceral and explosive feel that keeps you engaged. Combat is fast-paced and frenetic, keeping you on your toes as you face a range of unique opponents, from giant machines to mutants and superpowered robots each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It has a diverse selection of weapons and abilities, each providing a satisfying experience with unique playstyles and strategies. Additionally, you can upgrade and add modifiers to weapons for additional elemental effects, allowing for even more customization and adaptability in combat.With the help of your experimental power glove, you can scan the area for loot and examine enemies to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy in question.Rest areas are scattered throughout the environments and serve as places you save and craft weapons, ammo, and consumables. They also provide opportunities to upgrade abilities and weaponry. Looting is crucial as it is required to unlock recipes, craft, and upgrade. Collect items from enemies, chests, and the environment using telekinesis. This intuitive mechanic makes looting a surprisingly enjoyable aspect of the game. Despite looting being satisfying, the exploration aspect of Atomic Heart is not due to the bland open world with repetitive enemy types scattered all over it and frustrating repair robots, making it a tedious chore to traverse between hubs. However, exploration within the four hubs is much more enjoyable and rewarding.Puzzles are surprisingly enjoyable, offering challenges varying in style and complexity, especially the hidden dungeons. Puzzles not only add an extra layer of excitement and accomplishment, but they usually feel creative and fun while not slowing you down too much to feel like a drag which is much appreciated.Atomic Heart boasts an artistic and stunning take on Cold War-era architecture with a futuristic spin that is a fresh breath of air. Whether you explore a run-down industrial building or a modern, high-tech lab, each location always presents a unique visual treat, bringing the game world to life, be it because of a sense of dread or awe that it creates.The attention to detail in the character models truly is impressive. They are beautifully rendered, with realistic facial expressions, while equipped with neat steam-punk-inspired equipment. The robots and various other enemies have detailed designs that are excellently animated and remarkably designed as well.The weaponry is as deadly as visually stunning because of excellent designs ranging from futuristic firearms, gadgets, and various superb abilities that the experimental power glove offers. Not only are the weapons impressive, but they also evolve with each upgrade, resulting in increasingly stylish designs.While the sound effects of weapons and enemies are impactful and audibly sound great, the dialogue can be hit or miss. The voice actors themselves do justice to their roles. It is just that the script they are working with is incredibly inconsistent and often nonsensical, which can detract from the overall immersion. However, if you find humor in the quirky dialogue and do not mind a bit of absurdity, this might not be an issue for you, and you may even find the game's unique writing style entertaining.The soundtrack composed by Mick Gordon is incredible. It features a mix of classic Soviet-era songs and modern tracks that blend phonk, rock, and techno influences. Whether it is during an intense boss fight or a stroll through the environment, the well-made score always enhances the moment.Atomic Heart on a PC with an i7-9700K, 24GB of RAM, RTX 2080 Ti, and through an ultrawide monitor, with high-maximum settings, resulted in consistent 60 FPS, and I did not encounter any significant framerate or optimization issues except the horrible FOV because of ultrawide.It is important to note that there is a lack of accessibility settings, promised features such as Ray-Tracing, and basic features such as a FOV slider, separate languages for subtitles, achievements not tracking properly, and various other things. Mundfish has stated that they are actively listening and plan to continue updating Atomic Heart and fixing it.As for the experience on the Steam Deck, it honestly is astonishing how well it runs. At 800p and low presets settings (make sure to set ""Hard Drive Speed"" to SSD), it can maintain 60 FPS relatively consistently, but with dips in open-world sections. However, with Refresh Rate and Frame Limit set to 45 results in an incredibly consistent and smooth experience that allows for ~2.6 hours of continuous playing and draws ~12-21W while sitting at ~66-79C degrees. Subtitles are, however, hard to read but not impossible. Atomic Heart's imperfections aside, it offers a refreshing and thrilling experience, setting it apart from other games in the genre with its unique approach. It has excellent visuals, frenetic fun action, and enjoyable puzzles backed by an astonishing soundtrack. While it may not be perfect, it is still worth playing for its creative vision and ambition."

You’ get a resource, called Neuropolymer, from defeated enemies that you can use to upgrade your skills and character upgrades✔️ : There are tons of buildings, bodies, chests and hidden bunkers for you to loot, and they are packed with with new weapons, gun attachments and other resources that you can use to upgrade your gear.✔️ : The enemy variety is pretty big, you’ll encounter all sorts of weird Soviet Union technology and experiments, from spider-like drones to flower mutants. Most of the bosses are great and unique, and they are tough to beat at Armageddon difficulty (hard), like the infamous twins. ✔️ ; The world combines elements of 1950s Soviet architecture and design with advanced technology and sci-fi elements. It’s a shame that ray tracing isn’t in the game yet, but it will come soon.✔️ ; It is a mix of electronic and orchestral music, some songs are composed by THE Mick Gordon (mainly boss themes). There are also Phonk song like Komarova, which is very catchy.✔️ : buttery smooth 60 FPS at 1080p, no issues to report.❌ : The story is very predictable and it is similar to the first BioShock. As for the protagonist, It’s not that he is cringe, the voice actor did a good job even though he does say some stupid lines every once in a while, it’s that he and his AI-glove companion never shut the f up, they talk like all the damn time.Overall, Atomic Heart's visuals, gunplay, explorations and enemies are a major part of what makes the game so distinctive and awesome, which is why I highly recommend it. If only they had an option to set the chat frequency to “Minimal” like in Forspoken."

Atomic Heart attempts to reinvent what games like Prey and Bioshock did in a new environment and setting. But did their formula start the reaction they were hoping for or did the experiment blow up in their faces?You play as Agent P-3, a special operations soldier, in the employ of an influential scientist in the USSR, Dr Dimitry Sechenov. Having just arrived in Chelomey, the capital city of this fictional region of floating islands in Russia, things quickly get out of hand when the robots everyone relies on get switched to combat mode and begin to kill indiscriminately.Agent P-3 gets ordered to bring the man who has done this heinous deed to heel by any means necessary, and thus his journey across this newly war-torn region begins. Fighting both organic monsters and deadly machines, P-3 will have to master a series of weapons and abilities to come out alive and hopefully find an answer to why this all started in the first place.For the most part, Atomic Heart has the potential to be a pretty decent story experience. The bones of something substantial and remarkable are there just beneath the surface. Unfortunately, however, this is never acknowledged and rapidly stagnates in its cumbersome dialogue and tedious event cycles. If you push through the seemingly endless sexual innuendos, and corny one-liners, you will discover there is very little else to experience here. The pacing is terrible, and the amount of missing context is confusing. If you were hoping this to be your story-driven experience of the year, you're probably best skipping this one.The best part of this title, hands down, is the combat. There are very few feelings more intoxicating than bringing a giant mace down on the head of a robot enemy and having their shell cave in before your eyes. There is a minor variety of weapons to choose from, such as maces and axes, both one and two-handed. In addition to the melee weapons, we have the more common implements of warfare, such as the Kalash, Makarov and the tantamount bringer of destruction, the Shotgun.With all that said, the unfortunate downfall of this paradigm is that the ""powers"" P-3 unlocks throughout his development remain underwhelming until they have a substantial investment from the player. The ""Shok"" skill at the beginning of the game is extremely weak and provides little reason to use it beyond taking down the miscreant flying robot before a reload.As I mentioned above, Atomic Heart is technically an open-world experience, and it could be the interpretation based on map scale. However, from a player's perspective, you will begin to notice red laser barricades all over the place that bar you from freely exploring. So, essentially you will have the illusion of open-world exploration from the safety of a linear experience.While we are speaking of maps, the one implemented here, while visually detailed and impressive to scroll over, is fundamentally useless as you can't set waypoints or zoom in enough to use it when exploring towns.The puzzles in Atomic Heart are pretty fun! They test your aptitude, ability to think under pressure, and how you process information in your environment. The ""testing grounds"" are particularly entertaining situations as they are built purely to do this to you and act, for the most part, as puzzle dungeons for you to complete. Easily one of the best parts of the Atomic Heart journey.My last point is more of a peeve than anything else, and while it is an annoying bug, it doesn't fundamentally change the gameplay experience. The achievements for Atomic Heart are fundamentally ""broken"" as many will not tally their objectives, and others will be impossible due to missing or poorly designed mechanics.From a purely visual standpoint, Atomic Heart is above many in design and presentation, and it stands as one of the most breathtaking gaming experiences I've ever had the opportunity to enjoy. The general ambience with how the trees sway and the subtle way the grass ripples with each gust of wind is sublime. It's also true of the finer textures, old and worn rails have visible paint peeling away, the makeshift guns you create have scratches and scuffs on their surface, and cables are frayed and worn. The attention to detail is immense.The audio doesn't quite hit the same mark., The voice acting is pretty subpar, the general audio ambience feels generic, and dialogue is interrupted by things and doesn't continue afterwards, which leaves plenty of conversational blanks.With Atomic Heart set to Ultra settings and running at 2560 x 1440, I had minimal framerate drops below 60 FPS. There was a substantial quantity of bugs in the game, such as; textural and gameplay issues.🟧 Achievements are broken and are impossible to 100% complete at this stage.🟨 Visual quality drops greatly in the latter portion of the game, and the number of graphical tears and missing textures increases exorbitantly.RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 42%)CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 21%)GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 47%)I wanted to love this game so much. I gave it many chances to impress me, and the experience failed to meet my expectations every time. The game isn't bad, it's just bland in nearly every facet of its creation, and that's why it will be unmemorable. The voice acting is poor, the jokes are crude and dry, and the overall gameplay loop is unsatisfying. If you are still keen to play Atomic Heart, wait for a steep enough sale to negate the sting of the purchase."

Weapons look and feel fantastic, bordering Call of duty levels of gunplay. Everything you would expect from Bioshock is mostly here, like looting for upgrade materials, powering up powers, identifying weaknesses to optimize damage, the only thing missing is a big daddy-like robot wandering around the open world. Music is really damn good, which doesn't surprise me considering they got Mick Gordon to compose the music.But with each positive comes a negative, although to be clear the negatives don't outweigh the positives in any way, but maybe a sequel can clean them up.Remember when i said Bioshock made by horny devs? Im not exaggerating when i say that, the twin robots are obvisouly the biggest (and best) example, but you get sexually assaulted by a vending machine, the robots dry hump each other, and you'll find several areas FILLED with mannequins placed in every conceivable sex position. A pro or a con depending on who you are, but we all agree them twins are STACKED.The game is very confused on what it wants to be for the first 4-5 hours. It starts as a linear survival game, enemies hit like trucks and your ammo and weapons are limited. Then it wants to be a slightly bigger exploration game, focusing on exploring a large area and finding materials and upgrade schematics. THEN it goes full blown open world, with new mechanics that don't really work or are VERY lack luster, like driving and the threat level mechanic. If the game started and ended with a clear vision, it would have benefited the end product DRAMATICALLY.Gunplay as mentioned is solid, shooting robots and people are satisfying regardless of weapon choice. The issue is, the enemy variety never promotes anything other than shooting, even when enemies are resistant to bullets, you get SO MUCH AMMO that even with a 90% damage reduction to bullets, i still managed to kill them with half my total ammo left. Certain upgrade trees benefit more towards flesh enemies or metal ones, but every enemy can be demolished with a shotgun to the face, regardless of damage focus. The powers in particular are either useless or broken, and its not like Plasmids where you can have several, you only get 3 unlockable ones and one mandatory power. Again, a shotgun solves most problems.Last but not least, YOU HAVE MICK ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GORDON! USE HIM! I swear to god, i forgot he was even a composer until i heard a random BANGER song come out of nowhere. Not for a boss, but for a random section in the game. Could be bugged for me, but i would have really liked more Comrade Gordon.Atomic Heart is a fantastic game with some flaws, but all in all, its a great Bioshock-like that hopefully a sequel can make even better. $60 is 100% earned, on sale is a massive steal."

Overall really enjoyed the game (I haven't completed it fully while writing the review, but I have received enough of gameplay experience and emotions) and the combat mechanics. You are allowed to reset your skills/disassemble weapons, that gives you chance to test out different builds. I'm playing on medium difficulty, the game might seem a bit tough in the very beginning, when you meet your first enemies, but you quickly get used to controling and start feeling the charecter and damage you deal/get.However, there's one disadvantage worth mentioning: bad parkour mechanics. Even the ability to quickly dash in the direction of your movement doesn't really help climbing certain locations you'd like to get to. Despite the fact, the main hero is quite strong man with military background, at times it's ridiculous, how you can't grab on the edge of that box 1,5 meters high and climb on it. Another possible disadvantage (not for me though, I like this kinda stuff) might be necessity for looting (you need materials for upgrading and crafting), while constantly spamming your scanner to see whether your left something behind or not.Even though, the game was just released (at the time of this review only 3 days passed, no big patches were released), it runs quite smoothly on ultra settings (at least on my RTX 3070Ti), only random lags and drops of FPS may occur at 0,1% lows. I'd recommend this game, but you may need to wait for a while, once all possible glitches/visual bugs/lags will be fixed and the promised DLCs will be finally out. Not all people may think that the price is fair, therefore you better wait for a discount, however, I didn't really regret any cent I've spent on this game (I bought Gold Edition)."

The story execution is mid at best, the english voice acting is rough and the gameplay is repetitive. Outside of its premise and visuals, there's nothing special to it. Get it on sale if you really want it. If you really want to get this game, get it on sale because it's definitely not worth the full price. The score and the art direction is nice, but it falls short on everything else. While the premise is interesting, the story is poorly executed and there's no feeling of resolution to either endings (if anything, the endings, for me, knocked the game down to a 4/10 at best). The game entirely relies on near incessant info dumping to convey its story and its world, and it does very little to make Atomic Heart's universe feel more alive or immersive. It gets tiring fast both on account of the amount of information being thrown at you and the english voice acting. Said voice acting is  middle of the road. Conversations feel stiff and unnatural, which I guess does go with the characters— they all feel rather bland. The main character only stands out because of how annoying he comes off across. Outside of that, he very much just feels like your generic action shooter protagonist. The gameplay gets boring and repetitive fast. Most of the game involves searching and retrieving something, with a few different puzzles and some combat in-between. There's very little variation in the puzzles and while they do show up here and there, it's definitely not enough for this game to have the puzzle tag attached to it. The combat is fairly alright, but again, very run of the mill at best. At worst, it gets annoying when there are repair robots in the area, and even worse when facing the Plyush type enemies, which become repetitive bosses in a few sections. There are few boss fights in the game, but none of them feel particularly fun or rewarding. And for a game claiming to be open world, exploring doesn't feel rewarding either. Outside of the testing grounds, there's no real incentive to explore, except maybe a few computers where you can read some emails. All in all, Atomic Heart had a lot of potential, but it fell short on too many aspects for me to recommend the game at that price point (or frankly, at all). Once the novelty of its visuals wear off, it very quickly starts feeling exhausting. It's especially disappointing, for me. I don't usually write reviews, but this was one of the games I was most looking forward to. My mistake was coming in with high expectations, something that felt justified with all the positive reviews. I should have lowered said expectations, because for a full-priced game, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. While it has its highs, it also has a lot of lows which, for me, really outweighed the good. Again, for a game selling at an AAA game price, its quality doesn't reflect that. If you're willing to buy the game at full price, all the more power to you, but nothing in Atomic Heart justifies that price point."

Wait for a sale if you dont have gamepass. Game is worth on a surface level. This is a prime example of an awesome vision with not so great execution. Unfortunately you will see a lot of the reviews praising it for having robot mommies and nothing else... The game has an awesome atmosphere that is CONSTANTLY cut into with the annoying protagonist with the atrocious writing. the first two hours are non stop unlocking doors  and doing very simple but tedious puzzles ( all while the protagonist makes duke nukem jokes to nintendo power glove ) eventually when you finish what seems like a 2 hour tutorial you are let ""free"" in what seems to be an open world. That is where the game immediately died for me. You soon realize the game is going to be just frustrating to play to the point that you can not explore the mysterious and creative world, for example; there are cameras that will spot you. If spotted you now have to run and hide or kill robots. the robots are all extremely frustrating to fight and jump all around the screen which you cant even keep track of due to no FOV slider in the game. Then, If you kill robots during this there is a GTA wanted level that spawns more robots. THEN, if you shoot the camera a robot will come and repair it. So there is no clearing out the area to explore, there will ALWAYS be enemies which sounds cool until almost every enemy is really irritating to deal with ( especially with 55 POV ). This game would of been incredible if they leaned into the mysterious and extremely unique atmosphere but instead they added dialogue that was just really a bummer to hear. Its not even to the point where it can be ignored. the protagonist and the glove talk SO much that while im doing something the dialogue would get cut off by OTHER dialogue because i started doing something else that they had to talk about. The worst part is there are moments where you go, ""wow this is cool"" only to have to deal with almost everything about the game being irritating. EDIT 15 HOURS IN:Used another program to Fix my FOV problem and tried the Russian voice actor.FOV slider made the game Much MUCH more enjoyable for me but it was another software i had to downloadRussian voice actor was way better. (less anime effect) but they talk so much and very quickly while the subtitles are small and out of the way that i could not keep up with it while solving puzzles or hectic combat. I know I'm a Boomer and, learn to READ ect. But its actually a skill issue for me i guess.The game has warmed up to me in a lot of ways. I've been going around and collecting blueprints and exploring while dipping in and out of the main story, but there is still glaring issues. As I've been playing i continually  have moment where i go WOW that is cool. unfortunately I ask ""why?"" even more. the WORST offender is the repair bots and cameras still. No they are not everywhere and, yes they can be disabled but once disabled they get repaired AGAIN. There are moments of combat on the over world, where i have to tell myself to just stop shooting the robots because they will just send more of these little repair bots over to repair what i just killed. its not hard, just frustrating and irritating more so than fun. But man when it is fun it kinda kicks ass. Its unfortunate that i really only find myself thinking that occasionally. Exploration is actually cool and there are some neat things to figure out and I've found myself enjoying it quite a bit. A very odd way of explaining it so far is the game seems over designed. It seems like its not sure what it wants its core gameplay Wants to be. i feel like the devs had something really awesome a while ago and kept adding more and more unneeded structure. If you actually pay attention to what is happening, you realize that you are running around solving Creative but mundane puzzles. See a few enemies. Dispatch them Them and repeat...But then there is the off chance where you are BLASTING robots and flinging them into the air, while you get dropkicked and the music is POPPING TF OFF. You are absolutely grooving to it while SPLOOGING HOT ELECTRIC GOO from your Nintendo power glove. Then it ends and you ask why there isn't more of that in the game. Will add more maybe when im done if i care still"

In the process, you can watch.- Beautifully designed sci-fi robots - Never before has a vending machine been so friendly to me xo xo- Grinding is possible and can help when you are stuckCon:- Open world rather unnecessary than worth exploring- Collectibles and upgrades are scattered all over the world, which is not very accessible- No quick travel points- You can't use waymarkers.- Always a huge pile of enemies in front of some paths.Conclusion:In my opinion a very good shooter that Mundfish has delivered, it can join the Bioshock games 1 to 1, no matter if it's design or music everything goes in the same gloomy/dystopian direction. For me an absolute feast. It's challenging but not overwhelming, at times you feel more on the run than fighting, once the enemies have sounded the alarm you have to take your feet in your hands. Which was always fun for me. As for the story, I can only say (without spoiling) that it's about the Soviet Union planning the next ""big"" leap with the help of new technology, and then everything turns out differently than you would expect. From my side a clear recommendation for this game, for every Bioshock fan a must!"

But to be frank, Atomic Heart looked absolutely insanely good in the trailers, so I have been waiting for it to come out for years. In the end, you can all guess that Atomic Heart was unfortunately a huge letdown. Poor me, he had no idea what was coming in the next 20 hours. The first hour of the game was amazing. I thought I was playing a Game of the Year contender; the atmosphere, reminiscent of Bioshock Infinite's Columbia, was even better in Atomic Heart's prologue. The art direction and attention to detail were all top-notch and I really enjoyed it.This is the part where things start going downhill. After that impressive 1 hour introductory section, we are sent to an underground bunker. In this bunker, we are given 4 hours of fetch quest style missions. We are asked to collect 4 canisters each from the far side of this bunker. Throughout this mission, we are sent to 4 distinct lab-style places which have great art direction, but they are so drastically different from each other that it is a little bit immersion-breaking. This also applies to the enemy visual design, tons of robots everywhere, and 2 minutes later, clickers from The Last of Us. What? This part of the game also has ridiculously terrible pacing and level design. You fight the same 2 enemies all the time. There are tons of mandatory badly placed and designed puzzles. It all feels so weird, I can't explain it any further, you have to experience it for yourselves. These ""puzzles"" are only put there to take your time and are so tedious that even the developer team acknowledges it and thus the character complains about these puzzles several times. Dear Mundfish, just so you know, accepting your poor level design does not let you get away with it. I will criticize it nevertheless. After that, the player is given access to the open world, where you are expected to travel through point A to point B up until the finale. There are some dungeons to explore but they are not even comparable to the well designed ones in Botw or Elden Ring either. So, to get to point B, you can hop into a car. This car explodes after 1 minor hit, so the most convenient way to travel is to walk. Wait until you get spotted by one of the many cameras. To shut down the cameras, you have to climb these Far Cry style towers and turn them off. Even If you don't get spotted by a camera, there are so many robots patrolling around, one of them surely will see you. These enemies have terrible AI. Sometimes they will notice you from miles away, and sometimes they won't see you when you are just in front of them. Stealth system also does not work because of this AI issue. Regardless of how, you will get noticed, and then they will send endless waves of the same group of enemies rushing at you to deplete all your inventory. Which makes engaging them pointless. Their behavior during combat is also strangely stupid. Sometimes they won't telegraph their attacks but just rush on you in a second. You don't get accurate feedback on when you are hit and from where you got the hit. All of these issues with the open world combat balance and enemy placement issues and simply the fact that it is not fun to play, led me to do something I have never done in an open-world game before. Skip the fights and rush to the next mission. It's truly saddening that they have forced me to do that. The map system is horrendous. There are no minimap markers, so you can't mark the next mission and follow a trail, or place a marker and expect it to appear on your compass. This will result in you having to view the minimap every 30 seconds to check if you are on the right track. Another horrible design choice. The enemy variety is also extremely low. They literally showed us all enemy types and almost all bosses in the trailers (even though I only watched one or two trailers on purpose to not spoil it). So do not expect to be shocked by anything in this game. The boss fights themselves are mediocre (by FPS standards maybe a bit better). Still very similar bosses with their attack patterns and how they feel in terms of encouraging you to change your playstyle.Do you remember when I praised the huge art effort inside dungeons, in the overworld it is the opposite. The outdoors have little character and are full of reused assets. You are not motivated by the game to explore because there are no points of interest in the map, also exploring the map does not fit within the narrative, because each minute you spend exploring the map, people will continue to be murdered by the attack. For example in Hogwarts Legacy, they handled this situation way better. In that game, lets say you went on a main mission with Professor Fig. After that, he says that he needs time to investigate on what you had just found about, then, he advices you to focus on your classes and spend time around until he has come back. Things should have been similar here in Atomic Heart. Terrible storytelling with a pretty easy to guess scenario, combined with cliche characters and cringe dialogue full of Marvel jokes. Everything is overly sexualized. It becomes annoying at some point. I can honestly say that I hated the narrative.I think the gameplay mechanics are bland and generic. Who thought that it would be fun to play with standard World War II weapons in a futuristic technological utopia? The only weapon that differs slightly is the energy weapon, which feels like a water gun. The hit reaction of the weapons is okay, but the enemies are too bullet spongy, it is not fun after some time. Melee combat works better since there are some aesthetically pleasing dismemberment physics and animations. The abilites feel okay, but all these mechanics combined do not result into a good game feel due to the many issues I have explained earlier.There are issues with sound design as well. Too many sound effects are missing. I feel like the game is lacking a layer of sound. The music in Atomic Heart is just okay. I liked one or two Russian songs, but the rest are meh. They fall far below Mick Gordon's DOOM music, even though he is the composer for Atomic Heart as well. Atomic Heart was a game that had infinite potential, but was ruined by extremely flawed execution in level design, pacing, writing, balance, open world design, repetitive and simply not fun gameplay and almost in every other category that I mentioned above. It will remain as my greatest disappointment for some time.Follow My Curator Page:"

You can climb, grab, and vault but apart from a few areas where you absolutely need it you never want to depend on it because for some reason it works on some specially marked areas and some random edges of the random stuff on the map. Not every ledge is a ledge you can grab.You can drive cars in this game but it's the exact same car everywhere and there are only a few paths to drive it. You can use your elemental abilities to electrocute or freeze stuff but it's mostly unnecessary or totally coincidental because the game never lets you do anything with it the elements -again apart from a few areas where you absolutely need it-.Training grounds are just a good idea repeated but randomized each time again and again 8 times.The open world is there for some reason but there is almost nothing about it is fun. I'm not talking about endless respawns or something that triggered me within the open world. There is absolutely nothing to do in the open world other than looting some containers scattered around.  The game introduces you to tons of mechanics about the open world and almost never does anything about it. The save system is just bad, it's obvious that the developers wanted the game to feel more like ""Bioshock-y"" but the first Bioshock game was released 16 years ago. I never had any issues with the save system at all but the requirement to find a spot to save your game feels very very dated today.The story is plain bad, I'm not talking about the cheesy/cringe-ass protagonist, I'm talking about the story itself. I'm extremely done with this story, I've played, watched, and read the almost exact story within different settings more than 10 times each. I wasn't exactly expecting a mind-blowing story or anything.Weapons were just meh. I played the entire game almost exclusively with Shotgun and Melee weapons and upgraded Mass Telekinesis to the max. Almost every combat was a cakewalk for trash mobs and bosses just took some time. There are many ranged weapons but almost everything rushes to your face and there is almost no reason to use ranged weapons.I leveled up almost all abilities to some extent but never actually needed them.The entire game feels like some ideas stitched together and thrown out before us to play.Testing grounds feel like shrines from Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild but badly done.Open World feels like pulled straight out of the Far Cry / Assassin's Creed series but badly done.Gameplay feels like the mishmash of Bioshock and Doom 2016 but quite badly done.Above all else the soundtrack is phenomenal.This is definitely not a 60$ game, if you are interested wait for a 50% or at least for a minimum 33% discount if you ask me."

The game also boasts impressive graphics, with realistic lighting effects and detailed character models. The combat system in the game is based on a mix of melee and ranged attacks, with a variety of weapons available to the player.Another unique aspect of Atomic Heart is its story, which is heavily influenced by Soviet-era science fiction and horror. The game's plot is filled with mystery and intrigue, as you will uncover the secrets of the research facility and the strange creatures that inhabit it. The game also features a variety of side quests and NPCs, which add depth and complexity to the game's world.Overall, Atomic Heart is great game with a lot of unique features and interesting gameplay mechanics. While it may not be the best game for everyone, it certainly has a lot to offer and is worth checking out for fans of science fiction and retro-futuristic aesthetics. I personally love the game and i feel like the devs truly delivered on what was promised and most reviewers don't understand that this was not meant to be a triple A game but a project that truly delivered!"

From the moment this game starts it honestly has Bioshock Infinite vibes. The setting is on a floating Russian city with even an Andrew Ryan esque figure running the show. Which makes sense since the devs literally said Bioshock was a heavy inspiration. Graphically this game is gorgeous in motion. So long as you can ignore the same two soldier models which are constantly recycled. That being said the machines are where this game shines. Each machine is honestly entrancing in the way they move. Almost like living works breathing works of art. Its almost a shame to blow them up....but you gotta do what you gotta do to survive.....crispy critters.Gameplay wise this game struggles a bit. From the get go I had to turn down the sensitivity and the screen motion as honestly it was making me sick. Melee combat feels good and I like the abilities you can use as they mirror plasmids to a degree. Though gunplay feels off slightly and aiming down sights feels weird. Not sure if im the only one who feels this way. The puzzles are interesting but frequently left me scratching my head....inevitably Id figure them out but sometimes frustration took me out of the experience. The weapon crafting/upgrade system is fine...though alot of the weapons feel....well not good. I feel I relied heavily on my abilities and a shotgun. Because literally everything else felt useless. Story wise this game shines as well. Its weird....its campy at times....I love it. Each character you run into is at some level of insanity which sells the plot. I also loved how you could delve into the lore of the game just to add extra info to how everything went down. All in all I really enjoyed the game. I felt like it took its inspiration of Bioshock and literally made it its own. The gameplay could use a little refining but all in all its solid. I felt this game was overly ambitious at times. Like the developers had alot of really cool ideas but just werent able to implement them properly. Closing this game is a bizarre thrill ride through a Russian utopia gone wrong. If you like Bioshock you'll feel right at home. Ill give this crispy critter a solid 8/10. I look forward to Mundfish games in the future.

The mimicry of Bioshock's world-building and weaponry I can handle, but they somehow haven't elaborated at all on the game design that was common in 2012 AAA games.- No FOV slider. Guys. Developer comment: ""It doesn't need one because the default FOV of 85 is higher than most games"". Have the developers played an FPS game on a PC in the last 8 years? Or do they just play on their 80 inch Samsungs from 15 feet away? It just makes no sense and the developer comment doesn't clear anything up.- Forced mouse acceleration. - Some animations are locked at less than 60fps and it's super distracting, which is a shame because the animations are really nice.- There are voice logs everywhere. ""Press G to listen"". This was stupid 10 years ago and it's even more stupid now. The main characters are talking non-stop at the beginning, and you pick up a 30-second audio log every couple of rooms. There's no time to listen to them unless you just stand and stare at a wall! This is the sort of thing you pick up on and fix  in early development of the level layout. Do they think their customers will walk extremely slowly through their game with their jaw on the floor in admiration of the art and graphics? Is that how they instructed their QA playtesters to play the game???- The dialogue is just bad. I'm reminded of a proverb that warns against swearing unnecessarily, because there's always a better word or phrase to express a strong emotion. Well, get ready to hear every character - ESPECIALLY the protagonist - screaming ""f*ck!"" every time their heart rate goes over 80bpm because I guess the writers didn't have anything better for them to say.- The protagonist speaks like a side character in a Ubisoft open-world sport game. If you know what I'm talking about then you know.- The kind of combat in this game doesn't appeal to me to start with, but on top of that, it's one of the worst examples of its kind. It plays like an immersive sim, with awkward melee combat and no way to move quickly (except for an awful dash that takes 3 seconds to cooldown with no indicator when it's ready), but is really determined to be an action FPS like Bioshock. If Prey (2017) does a better job at combat than your action FPS then you have a serious problem.Great art and a good looking environment. I was surprisied by the Royksopp music during the intro, I love that band and I thought it was neat. 1 point for the Mick Gordon music that I didn't get to listen to but I'm sure is really excellent. 0 points for everything else. Bit of a waste of time. Play Bioshock Infinite or Prey 2017 instead."

I really wanted to like this one, but there were a few major issues that prevented it from shining. The world feels shallow, very limited enemy variety and samey environments. The endlessly respawning enemies in the open world make exploration more of a stressful chore than something to enjoy. Multitudes of small bugs, from enemies spawning inside objects to the player getting stuck on walls. Still, it might be fun to just beeline it through the more linear main story bits, if not for the protagonist.  More specifically, his dialog. Swearing in no way shape or form bothers me, but this guy just doesn't stop. It's like listening to a eight year old who just heard someone say ""♥♥♥♥"" for the first time trying to sound cool by shotgunning it into their sentences with no regard as to whether or not it makes sense. And even without the random cursing the guy just comes across as an unlikable moron.

Not hiding my joy that a game inspired by BioShock and Fallout is being created, I started to follow every possible news dedicated to this title. The waiting time for a full-fledged game has finally come to an end, so that at the end of February I was able to sit in front of the PC and immerse myself in the Soviet alternative reality. The question is, was it worth it? The alternative reality in which we will fight refers to the 50s of the XX century.  We’ll play as Sergei Nechaev, a KGB agent for special tasks, whose objective will be to explore the territory of Complex 3826 in order to determine why all robots suddenly began to attack defenseless people. At the very beginning, of course, we get acquainted with the new reality that surrounds us, which significantly differs from what we know from history books. First of all, World War II ends completely different, and the development of technology occurs much faster than in our reality. In the Soviet Union, the Internet, voice messages, the aforementioned robots and modernized weapons have already appeared, which significantly beats the quality of what other countries in the world have. The world in ""Atomic Heart"" is very fabulous and certainly the style of the whole environment deserves praise, because thanks to it the reviewed title is so unique. In the Complex 3826 we will come across many abstract things that will cause surprise, shock, confusion, and sometimes even will make us laugh (I’m looking at you Nora). The most important raw material in the complex is the polymer, thanks to which various models of civilian or combat robots could be created, and the communication system that will be the main plot motif in the game, Kollektiv 2.0. This polymer is also responsible for creating very strange elements of the environment, which during combat or further sightseeing can be useful and help in achieving the objectives. Thanks to these elements the world seems to be taken out of some fever dream, especially the Limbo reality. However, despite the innovative style, the world seems to be empty, because many locations will simply be filled with robots with which we will simply have to fight against... I have the impression that most of the attractions of the open world have been removed at the expense of fighting opponents. Although my appetite for searching every nook and cranny has not been saturated, fighting the enemy is a masterpiece. The game resembles the Russian version of “Doom” in this respect. The range of various weapons, from melee weapons to firearms, through the use of various techniques of fighting with various opponents forces us to frequently change tactics. The fight with the most standard robots, i.e. WOWAs, will look completely different in narrow corridors and in open space. The fight with flying robots, known as “bees”, also gives satisfaction when, after an intense fight with a horde of mustachioed machines, the “bee” squadron will be halted, and repairing the fallen mechanical companions will be impossible. There are of course more types of robots, not to mention very demanding BOSSES, which will require a completely different, more thoughtful approach. And the fight is not only about robots, but also mutated plants or polymer mutants that can terrify.The game in its specificity is very good, but before the premiere, the devs from Mundfish Studio swore that in ""Atomic Heart"" there will be things that will seem controversial to some fans, while for others attractive. Of course, we are talking about erotic elements, because ""Atomic Heart"" is filled to the brim with them. From the famous ballerinas, to the notoriously appearing poses of various robots, through even installations that insinuate sexual intercourse. Not to mention... perverted fridge, the mentioned Nora. For me, as a person with a distance, this type of thing is funny and sometimes it really built a pretty cool aura, but building marketing on primitive desires will not necessarily have a positive effect on the reception of the game. Especially the promises of a six-hour cutscene with ballerinas, one-on-one. These weren't the only controversies that caught the eye for ""Atomic Heart."" The most publicized cases were the origin of Mundfish members and their links with the Kremlin, Putin, Gazprom, etc. As a reminder, the game  began to be created in 2018, and initial projects began  around 2008. In the Russian Federation, most of such large projects must count on financial support from public institutions in order to move forward. Gaijin Entertainment did it, so did Mundfish. The policy of the Russian Federation is not identical to the views of the members of Mundfish, and the financial leash imposed on the neck of developers prevents the expression of their true thoughts. The truth is that Mundfish was supposed to make a game and sell it. So they did. The controversy resulting from the placement of the game on the VK Play service and links with the Russian government seems to be a witch-hunt, not a substantive source of criticism. If Mundfish were really going to work against the so-called ""collective West,"" Microsoft and Sony wouldn't spend a single dollar on the game. Of course, I did not list everything, because there is more... The truth is that it was much easier to spit on a Russian studio because of its origin than to objectively face the information and form your own opinion. And YES, there are memes from the Runet in the game. They had the right to do so. Interestingly, during the witch-hunt, everyone forgot about the scandal from 2019, when ""Call of Duty"" attributed war crimes committed by the US Army to the army of the Russian Federation. No, I am not defending Russian policy. I only look objectively at what the media report, and the media like to beat the Russians, especially after the already famous February 24, 2022. All in all, the game is astonishing. Graphics, audio (Mick Gordon), musica (На недельку, до второго, Я уеду в Комарово) and gameplay. Mundfish did a great job and for its debut, the game is a huge success. I hope that the upcoming DLC will enrich the open world with a much larger number of things to discover, and the studio itself will make many more games as good as Agent Nechaev's campaign. - Great gameplay- Unusual design- Excellent sound- Fantastic Mick Gordon music and phonk versions of Soviet hits- Dynamic combat- Enjoyable storyline- Pervy fridge- Weak open world- Sometimes repetitive- No six-hour ballerina scene"

I don't know where or how they chose their English voice actors, but my god its terrible. Most of the dialogue is extremely cringy with overused 1 liners like, ""crispy critters"". -Powers are subpar and extremely underwhelming in effectiveness-Enemies are basic bullet sponges-Movement is extremely clunky. Repeatedly get stuck on objects in game for no reason with some items having invisible walls that extend past the actual objects visual boundaries. The design of the fixed FOV and speed of some enemy attacks (some of which have horrible framerates) make for a jarring experience where it is hard to keep track of the position of multiple attacking enemies. Either they need to speed up the player speed and/or add in sprint, or they need to drastically reduce the dash cooldown with more dash uses stored. The player freedom regarding movement just does not match the flow of the game. -Upgrade paths are okay, The 3 basic guns you get at the beginning offer all that is really needed and there's no real incentive to really craft new weapons. -Puzzles are a big letdown. My god are they extremely simple and tedious. Most of the time the shoddy UI and design of the puzzles make for annoying experience rather than an interesting one. -Story is okay. Nothing mindblowing. All in all, its just okay. I really stress that this game is NOT WORTH 60 BUCKS. I really hate it when the community leaves positive reviews as if a game really deserves the full price it is charging. People really need to take the time to understand that recommending a game should include whether or not the price tag is justified. A game can still be serviceable without deserving price tag that comes along with it. This game is a perfect example of that."

The result is a strange, endearing, and mostly well-made atompunk FPS with RPG and exploration elements. Some aspects are clunkier than others, but the game generally succeeds in what it sets out to accomplish.In Atomic Heart, the Soviet Union has revolutionized transportation, robotics, and communication using an organic technology called ""polymer."" On the day that the USSR's ""Collective"" initiative is set to launch, the worker robots in its main scientific facility go berserk and begin killing lab personnel and other civilians. As Major P-3, a close assistant to the facility's lead scientist, you're tasked with ending the robots' rampage and uncovering the source of their altered behaviors. Along the way, P-3 battles against plant mutants, numerous kinds of robots, and other bizarre creatures made by the facility. Investigating the attacks uncovers hard truths behind the ""utopia"" created by the USSR, from sleazy political maneuvering to dark secrets that threaten the future of Soviet science.Combat in Atomic Heart reminds me of a mix of Bioshock Infinite and Resident Evil: Village, which is admittedly a strange comparison. Your backpack allows you to carry a limited number of supplies and weapons, but you can decide what to put in it, whether it's a ton of medical supplies or some guns/ammo/vodka bottles. While your right hand uses guns and melee weapons, your left hand can use special abilities given by CHAR-LES, the AI assistant within P-3's glove. You can continue to shoot or attack while creating a polymer shield or levitating objects, which hampers speed/accuracy but allows you to stay on the offensive. Broken robots, dead mutants, and storage units can be scavenged for supplies - some of which can be used to upgrade your abilities or build new items/weapons. Enemies are pretty ruthless and will put up a serious fight, especially in the early game. They will alternate between ranged and close-range attacks, use telegraphed special attacks to knock you down, or even fly out of your attacks ranges. Without the right abilities to soften up enemies or exploit their weaknesses, they will end up being tanky and shrugging off a lot of initial attacks. Fortunately, the game paces itself slowly at first, only throwing one or two robots at a time. The first complex you explore sets up the robot and mutant enemies while showcasing mechanics like customization, electronic lockpicking, ability upgrades, and scanning the environment for supplies.When you're introduced to the exploration elements 3-4 hours in, though, there is a sharp difficulty spike. Enemies are much more frequent in the ""open world"" segments, and robots will be reinforced by repair drones that will bring them back to life, albeit without any parts to scavenge. Picking fights in this state can be disastrous, especially since you can never stop the repair drones from coming to help other robots. Mutants can be permanently killed, though, making them a much more satisfying enemy to fight in the open sections. My advice would be upgrade the SHOK ability to the ""chain lightening"" power as soon as possible, since it stuns robots and is effective at downing repair drones.Robot enemies have a ton of variety when it comes to their designs and tactics, from the usual humanoid robots to stumpy lumberjack robots with sawblades for heads. The damage you deal is reflected on their models, like scorch marks from SHOK attacks and paint being chipped off from repeated gunshots and melee strikes. It's satisfying to go ham and absolutely tear them apart with explosives, full-power axe swings, and point-blank shotgun blasts. The game's arsenal is limited to 12 weapons, but each one stands out with its own strengths. I enjoyed how melee weapons remained relevant throughout the game, since they restore energy weapons' batteries on hits and can punch through energy shields.The mutants are also a fun faction to fight, even if they aren't as prominent as the robots. Their behavior and tactics are much more animalistic, rushing you without regard for their safety or launching disgusting projectiles at you. Defeating them hinges on tracking down and destroying their hives, followed by eliminating the infected humans and plant mutants still active in the area. They don't take damage as visibly as the robots, but they still can explode and get gibbed on death. Both factions are used exclusively in some areas, keeping you from getting too used to them or bored with one or the other.I enjoyed Atomic Heart, but it has some notable flaws that should be brought up. Some of the robot enemies are downright frustrating to fight, especially when they've been rebuilt and no longer offer any scavenging rewards. The sawblade robots and artillery ones have small hitboxes and spam knockdown attacks too frequently. The game is too generous with the repair drones in the open world areas, where you'll feel like no progress is made after a squad of robots gets rebuilt moments after you leave them. You can drive around in marked cars in these areas, but I didn't really enjoy the controls for driving and just ran around on foot (to be fair, this also gave me more chances to scrounge up resources, and the destinations aren't too far apart in-game). A few bosses have Quick Time Events that will instantly kill you regardless of your health or their health, and this as unsatisfying and frustrating as it sounds.Some mechanics in Atomic Heart also seem unrefined, pointless, or unused after a certain point. The game teaches you about opening certain doors with SHOK...which you never do after leaving the first complex. There's a parkour system for climbing around obstacles and platforming, but it is only used in 4 or 5 sequences throughout the game. Bonus ""testing grounds"" scattered throughout the map offer exclusive weapon parts and rewards for completing their puzzles, but I made it through the story and stomped most late-game threats without ever visiting a single one. NORA, the red upgrade station that's unhealthily attracted to P-3, rarely talks between the first open-world segment and the buildup to the final boss battle. It feels like there were some changes in the game's main features during development, and these earlier parts of it weren't altered to reflect the new priorities.It took me around 23 hours to beat Atomic Heart, and that includes some grinding I did to heavily upgrade my SHOK ability before the hedgehog robot boss. The game lasts long enough to hold your interest, but it also bows out before it overstays its welcome. The two endings leave room for a sequel or DLC expansion, but they are mostly satisfying and wrap up the events of the storyline. The game will take a pretty good PC to run, but you can squeeze out some more frames per second by going to Atomic Heart's AppData folder and cranking its settings down. It's a shame the game doesn't let you lower its resolution...Atomic Heart is a wild, chaotic ride of an FPS game. It's not perfect, but it's fun and tells a story that will keep you on your toes with each new development. The length is also appropriate without feeling bloated. I would recommend it, but I would recommend making sure your computer can run it before buying it. I had to do a lot of adjustments on my end to make it semi-playable, and I still faced lag spikes at times. The overall concept is novel and the soundtrack has some standout tracks like ""Starry Summer."" In the end, I was willing to look past its flaws and enjoy what the game had to offer."

The Gameplay Mainly is in underground labs and Facilities, Each level of the game has puzzles rooms and mechanics need to be solved, it's simple but very fun and engaging.Difficulty wise, it's a nightmare if you play it on hard and kids game if you play it on easy, in general It has a great aggressive combat system and stubborn enemies, If you master your weapons and abilities well nothing can stop you. sadly it's only 13 weapon, 5 abilities only, Yet the combos you can do with are amazing and very Satisfying. JUST DON'T PLAY IT ON EASY.Also it has some cool and new features like-New looting system, Press F To pull\loot everything.-Cute and classic cartoon Demonstrations for your abilities, Which i enjoyed a lot.-You can dismantle and re craft anything at anytime without losing any resources,which very useful if you need to change your build from time to time,-And you can drive a car.You play as P-3 a perfect loyal employ Who got lost after the robots Apocalypse and starts questioning the world around him, what's right and wrong and who to follow. The story start interesting, then becomes kinda boring and then booom, Fast build up, Shocking, dramatic and sad events, which changed my mind on the story and left me very excited for the next Dlcs, Can't say much about the story, don't want to spoil it on you.The characters and dialogues are good, Very political and serious and sometimes sexual, but mostly funny.Be aware that some very critical story facts and infos are buried between the lines, you must not skip any side dialogues with your glove, if you want to fully understand everything.Audio quality is goodThe OSTs on the other hand are remarkable and a piece of art, I'd give it 10\10.Some background tones are extremely repetitive and will probably drives you crazy, no joking, like the fridge music for example, where you upgrade your gear and craft stuff, it's nice music i swear but once you hear it 200 times it becomes the last thing you want to hear, And that tone.... no normal human can listen to it more than 3 times, but you keep coming to upgrade, and yes you can't mute it. i hope they fix it soon cause i'm sure many people will suffer from it. (Not to mention the Surveillance camera noise)Runs like butterI use 3080 | 5800, all settings on Atomic (MAX) @3440X1440Avg fps180 | highest 300, Many people doubt this game so hard, some even bet it would be badly optimized (based on nothing obviously) but it turned out it's one of the most optimized games DAY ONE!This game is featurestic, hypred, atmospheric, and full of life, The environment is nicely detailed and very organised, Graphics are beautiful and so on. cut scenes animation was sadly mostly cheap, and some underground areas are not good as the outer world.ــــــــــــــــــــــــIf you suffer from motion sickness you should stay away from this game, Until they optimize the FOV and add FOV settings, however you can lower the shake intensity from Gameplay settings to 0.2 and you can install Flawless ultrawide software and enable FOV fixer, this will help you a lot, otherwise you will quit the game.ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــI Strongly recommend itIt's a unique journey and something we didn't experienced before Great world, Great story, Great Gameplay and are optimized, fairly priced (40$ in my region), +40 hours of playtime ""depends on your play style and the difficulty"". You can't go wrong with this gameunless you hate the Russian accent or the soviet era, and perhaps lootingcause you must loot non stop in this game, and some people don't like that at all."

This game has let me down so much. You find yourself doing ""Find the key"" fetch quests over and over while doing tedious puzzles that are not a challenge just there to take your time. It becomes insulting when after playing this game over 12 hours I am hard pressed to think of anything i have done that was not just trying to open a damn door! On top of that when it isn't open a door it is find the parts of something so that then you can go open a door! The character in game even spends 40% of all dialogue he has complaining and joking with his glove about these damn locks and puzzles. I kept playing this because I was waiting for it to get better only to find that it was just tedious to play. The voice lines are just weird and go from cursing non stop to saying crispy critters as an exclamation only to then say and i quote ""Crispy ♥♥♥♥♥♥'... where's the ♥♥♥♥-ass way out of here?! Underground or something?!"" Voice lines seem hard scripted to areas so if you are talking to your glove and keep walking sometimes you just stop talking mid sentence. Other times if you do the same thing twice the voice lines will start over like you never said them before. Some of the things in the game look cool but quickly start to just run together. enemies just all feel the same with slight variation and they added a mechanic to the mix of everything you kill causes repair bots to swarm the area and build it back over and over and over. I care about that much less but it still just makes even exploring the world feel like a chore. If you have to have this game wait until it is 75% off"

So I already have a chip on my shoulder about that mess, but I'll stick with factual game issues. Also, I've beaten the game, took me 17.5 hours and about 2-5 hours was me wandering around to see the sights. Or farming components.1. Storyline- It was mehh at best. You didn't have to pay attention to know what was going on, and the twists could be seen a mile away. Was it different? A little, but not by much. It's a story old as time, and I'll leave it at that.2. Combat- It was prevalent, sure, but it was lackluster. You can swap out any of the firearms, and not notice the difference. For example, I used the shotgun and pistol almost the entire game. The only time I swapped was because I had more ammo for one gun than the other. And I didn't notice a difference in combat. The melee weapons were almost the same. They all had about the same swing speed, approximate damage, and upgrades. The only difference were the ""special"" attacks, which you had to unlock in optional ""Proving Grounds"". Dodge was useful, but janky, sometimes it works, sometimes you get hit anyway. It's not quite ""polished"" to use their own phrase.  Side Note- Use a controller, Keyboard/Mouse is hard sometimes in combat.3. Sexualization- Where do I start? Ignoring the massive amounts of ""Twins"" lust, the game feels like it's shoving it in your face without reason. The door lock shapes? Come on. The BDSM crafting station? Really? It feels like it was unneeded. Like I get, use sex to sell, but this just felt tacky instead of the ""subtlety"" they were shooting for.4. Stealth- There isn't any. They say you can stealth the game, and if you have nothing else to do that day, maybe you can. But spending 30 mins, to approach a location, to be spotted by a camera behind a house across the street, just makes it useless. The bots constantly replenish themselves, so it's a slog sometimes, and there's no silenced weapons in the game. So shooting out the camera alerts the bots nearby, making it kind of useless.Also, as a founder, I have to point out, there should be almost no graphical errors, or physics issues, after literally 3 years of ""polishing"". That's all I'll say about founder gripes, but I know I'm not alone in that frustration.Overall it's a 5/10. Not bad, but not ground breaking. A good way to kill a dozen hours, but not for 60$. Maybe wait for a sale."

I assume the devs will eventually add the option to change this.The pacing of the story (in the intro atleast) is very fast and is not cohesive. One minute you are doing something, the very next second you are being introduced to a character which then is gone within 10 seconds. The combat (Melee part) feels very unpolished. I've gotten stuck in-between enemies multi time, if you get stun locked, you will just die and have to restart that section again. The main characters dialogue is very bad.

Russian citizens.- This games has been in development since 2017, well before the Russian Invasion of Ukrainian of 2022. The Russo-Ukrainian war however, beginning in 2014. - Not all Citizens reflect the political thoughts of government of the country they're from.- Yes, the shady backing of the game by GEM Capital & Tencent should be noted.- AND yes, Mundfish did not comment  on the war but did comment on their stance.With this knowledge in mind, we have to remember the developers cannot speak out against the war directly because of the consequences that come with doing so. If they aren't affected by it directly, their families will likely be next.The majority of American Companies do not want to invest in a Russian company at this time. And those who have have previously done so are curtaining their operations leaving a Russian company to receive investment from another Russian company (GEM / ex-Gazprom) & international companies (Gaijin / Tencent) not based in America. They have been left with no choice.People have been waiting to play this game since 2017 when the teaser for this game first dropped. We as consumers of this should not harass or try to condemn citizens for things out of their control.Still with all of this information included, there is no definitive information that says, funds from this game are going to fund the war.====================Now let me offer a possible solution  funding a war is the uttermost concern but you still want to play this game: OR .And if you already bought the game and heard about the controversy after racking up a few hours past the refund window, support Ukrainian developers. Buy one of their games. Donate to Ukrainian fund. I already bought S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 as a result. If I am completely wrong with what have observed / concluded from doing my research, then do what you can do make things right. I'll be doing the same.=====================With this being said, I'm having fun with the game. I'm not 100% satisfied but I am at least enjoying it. The protagonist and his glove do talk a lot though... and I mean, A LOT."

A good, but not without flaws immersive-sim, that takes huge inspiration from Bioshock and other similar games. 👍 +Great atmosphere and visuals+Awesome soundtrack+Gun combat is satisfying👎-Extremely janky overall-AI and general difficulty is poor-Puzzle mechanics are uninspired and easyYou play as a mysterious agent P-3 tasked with finding out and stopping a scientist that is trying to sabotage to release of Kollektiv 2.0 which essentially allows humans to communicate with one another wirelessly and control their robots as well just with their minds. This all happens in an alternate Soviet society where human evolution has peaked thanks to a famous scientist named Sechenov. As you arrive at the main facility where the new technology is being developed, things go bad and the AI robots go berserk attacking all humans on sight. Alongside you, there is an AI called Char-les who is attached to your glove which offers more insight into what's going on around you. Without going deeper into spoiler territory, all I can say is, weird things start to keep happening around you, more and more stuff starts to make less sense, and you start to question what is even going on anymore. It's pretty standard for immersive sims, you've seen it in Bioshock, you've seen it in Prey and similar twists are bound to shock you, more or less, here as well and yes, overall the story is good. The main problem with how the devs chose to convey the story compared to Bioshock or Prey, is that it was annoying as hell. Most of the lore is found on computers with a ton of emails dumped in your face overwhelmingly. Moreover, your AI partner and yourself talk NONSTOP, so much that it ruined immersion every single 5 minutes, without exaggerating. Char-les and your character never shut up and they feel the need to explain everything, every detail, and dump a ton of information in your ears. Story rating: 8/10The gameplay is a bit of a mixed bag sad to report. It gets its inspirations correctly and even uses them adequately, but it also tries some not-so-good things which not only makes the game annoying at times, but it also wastes a lot of your time. For starters the shooting is great, no doubt about it, the shotgun which in my opinion should be the main weapon at all times in these games feels great and punchy, but so do the other weapons. Shooting robots and other things is fun, but it does get a bit stale towards the end mostly due to the game being very easy even on the highest difficulty. Sadly the difficulty problems are also obvious in boss fights which are basically just HP sponges and as much as the devs tried to give them cool attacks and patterns you should avoid, it was still, a huge cake-walk. The game also has a crafting system which is your main source of getting weapons, ammo, and upgrades. Exploration is important due to this because crafting and upgrading can be demanding. You also have access to certain skills and powers, much like Bioshock, but on a more weaker/useless scale. For example, you can get the shock ability which does exactly as you imagine it. Very useful vs almost everything in the game, but lacks mechanics like you used to shock water in Bioshock and whatnot. The other major part of the game is the exploration and the puzzles. They're very weak sadly. Instead of making a huge facility or a place that easily connects all the main zones to one another as Prey did, the devs opted to make a large open map that you'll have to drive or run through from one facility to another, basically padding the game for no reason. Between the main areas and the optional ones, there is nothing worth exploring or doing, no unique or interesting event or story-related aspects, nothing. The optional areas are the puzzle parts of the game where you can obtain parts for your weapon upgrades. They offer almost no challenge, and they practically repeat over and over, shock the wall open up some platforms, and keep walking forward. Most of them don't even have enemies, essentially making them walking sim zones.  Huge potential here, but they bit more than they could chew with half the gameplay being satisfying and the other half feeling just kinda meh. Gameplay rating: 7.5/10The audio design is great, but for a lot of people it's not going to be great as I've seen a lot of complaints, and that is mostly due to the English voice acting. I will admit, Char-les and P3 are incredibly annoying because they essentially talk way too much than they should, but P3 is also generally a douchebag. A lot of people hated him, but I actually enjoyed his dumb ramblings. I genuinely laughed quite often at the two arguing and talking. Everyone else also does a fine job, the horny upgrade machine, Sechenov, etc. I had no issues with the English VO. The music is fantastic though, it's mostly Russian songs remixed into hardcore metal or electronic stuff that fits incredibly well with the combat and atmosphere. As for the sound effects and everything else related to them, they are all great as well, with no issues whatsoever. Audio rating: 8/10We're at the start of the next-gen with games finally not releasing on old consoles anymore and just like the start of the previous gen when PS4 was released a lot of PC ports were abysmal. The same thing is happening now as well, with a lot of PC ports having huge stutters, VRAM requirements, and just being overall bad. Atomic Heart, on the other hand, runs incredibly well on PC. The visuals the game offers and the performance cost ratio is crazy. They did a miracle considering this is their first big game. Every location is visually breathtaking and the Sovietshock design of the game works great.Speaking of visuals the game uses baked lighting and it looks insane and it's proof that with patience and talent, artists can still make games look crazy even without stapling some badly unoptimized RT effects. The level design also has signs of brilliance but as I mentioned before, they tried something new that didn't really work out well imo, but the main zones you do explore are great even if a bit too linear. Performance wise as I said runs great and smooth, only had a few crashes and a small number of annoying bugs where I kept getting stuck in the ground which forced me to reload. Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 8.5/10If you're a fan of games like Bioshock or Prey, there's no reason not to buy Atomic Heart. Runs great, looks great, and the combat is fun. There's a ton of room for improvement, but I am confident they can pull an amazing sequel if they want to."

Combat feels weird, easy mode is freeze everything and axe spin, but it makes combat boring. Stealth is way too slow to be really engaging and determining line of sight of enemies is difficult as they don't have clear line of sight. Sometimes things can be hidden behind, and other things can't, but then you can be out in the open and not agro nearby enemies. It feels extremely inconsistent, dodging is the same way. Dodging seems to give you some either randomly left or right directional impulse that may have to do with floor slant, but it never feels like you dodge straight forward.Platforming is a little off, it's close to good, but not quite there, lots and LOTS of invisible walls, especially once you get outside. Jumping feels a bit anemic, and the telekinesis control is annoyingly short ranged and rather finicky for the amount of puzzles that require it. Loot collecting is fun, walk into a room and proceed to hoover tons of gear, quite satisfying and lots of upgrades and sidegrades to a decent variety of weapons. Though I literally haven't needed to craft anything beyond the mandatory progression pieces. Axe, shotgun, and electro pistol are carrying quite well with shok and frostbite, and goo spray being a rarely used third option.The game does look pretty and runs well on my computer which I built a couple years ago, the setting is really, really cool, though sometimes a bit absurd, and there is some forced comedy in the writing. I'm just glad not every damn crafting station is as lusty as a select few. The character calls this out too, seriously, you're calling out flaws in the game, in the game, that doesn't mean it's good or funny, it means it's flawed and instead of making it better, you called it out and played it for laughs instead of engagement.Lastly bugs. Had one crash, got stuck floating between a table and chair and couldn't progress, and softlocked hedgie on my second go at him with freeze which caused him to slowdown by a factor of about 100, but because of that, he wouldn't progress to the damage phase, chip damaged him with the electro pistol to 50%, and got then it locked at the scripted midpoint event.TL;DRInteresting and cool world to explore, but exploration and gameplay loses fun after you're looping through the same puzzles multiple times, just to achieve a tiny bit of progress to get locked multiple repeating puzzles again.Update:This is now three times where the character has complained about the annoyance of puzzles."

It was actually optimized and I experienced only a few crashes. Of course, it was also missing raytracing, achievements were bugged, and it had *no* FOV slider, but whatever - that's a minor detail (note: that was sarcasm). Despite missing an integral QoL feature, it actually worked on launch and didn't otherwise play like a beta. Or worse, an alpha. The core experience was well polished, even if it was missing some bells and whistles, which is more than some other AAA games can say. Given that this was the first game from a startup studio, and the tail end of development occurred during an impressive sanction regime against the host country, I'm of the opinion that AAA studios are now out of excuses.Visuals are rock solid. I thought I'd have to make it ugly to run on my 1080ti. I was wrong. It's still on fairly high settings, and it looks AND runs great.Music is solid. The remixes of old soviet songs are nice, and of course they snagged Mick Gordon, so naturally all his tracks are amazing. I'm stoked for the next portion of the soundtrack.The gameplay isn't super innovative, but if you like Bioshock or Prey (2017), and you like scrounging, you'll definitely like what this game brings to the table. It's in the same vein as the Shock series, but with better gunplay. Being honest, I barely used the abilities, and I feel they could do more interesting things with them. Hopefully in the DLC they'll add some neat new  . I will add that the Zvezdochka is probably the most viscerally satisfying weapon in the entire game. I never knew that I wanted to watch my enemies be torn to shreds by angry flying buzz saws. The only real criticism I have is that I wish there was a way to disable Hives for at least like 5 minutes or something, so I could comfortably scrounge around. I understand the desire to keep the pressure up on the player, but dispatching an endless stream of Pchelas is both easy and tedious to deal with, and if you want to do anything on the surface, it's necessary. I never felt afraid of them, and I never felt like I ought to escape an area because I drew too much heat. Then again, I was also playing on normal difficulty. Oh, and also, the puzzles eventually became kinda tedious. Especially the ones where you just drag a ball through a tube.And now for a long winded analysis of a story which nobody cares about.I'm really not sure what to make of the story, but I'll say that it does some things well and other things not so well. It actually managed to surprise me, which doesn't happen often, and it provided adequate foreshadowing for the surprise (provided you read the logs), so that's neat. The voice acting in English is hit or miss. The overall message is kinda hard to suss out. It doesn't glorify communism or the USSR  - I mean, you're exploring evil science labs, you're killing the horrible machines/abominations which were built/birthed there, you're learning about ghoulish experiments done to prisoners, and everyone has a social credit score which is tabulated using data from insane levels of state surveillance. The Major has pretty understandable misgivings about what he sees, and slowly finds it indefensible. If I had to try and extract a message from this story, it would probably go something like this. It doesn't matter how miraculous your technology is, or how noble your ambitions are. At the end of the day, your dream of utopia will be reduced to a nightmare by the callous, misanthropic, self serving nature of humans. You can try to build people heaven and they will turn it into hell, and you may very well help them do it. All that being said, the Major is very much a caricature of the Soviet Man, and while later in the game he had a moment where he grasped some nuance during a discussion of international relations, he's very much a fan of both communism and the Soviets. While I am of the general opinion that communists do not have human rights, this is a videogame and I do not care about an imaginary person's opinions.Honestly, I think that the regime is more like an aesthetic, story wise, because no real critique is made on it nor is a case made for it. Think about how Bioshock went after Objectivism, how it pointed out the unique ways Rand's philosophy would incentivize systemic dysfunction. Atomic Heart *didn't* do that with communism. It also didn't *advocate* for communism. Paranoia, opacity, poor delegation of authority, conniving backstabbing nonsense, leaders whose power is inversely proportional to their empathy - those are human failings, not failings which emerge from systemic incentives. What I see in the game is yet another soulless authoritarian bureaucracy, but with communist trappings. It wouldn't feel out of place in a cyberpunk setting, provided you gave it corporate trappings. I think there's a missed opportunity for something insightful, but I doubt *real* political analysis would fly given the current political climate in the Russian federation. So I'll let it slide.Despite this analysis taking up the longest part of my review, I'd say I've encountered much worse stories, and much better. It's decidedly mid."

This review is based up game progress shortly following the defeat of Hedgie.The game is unique in a number of ways. The art style is great. The idea of AI controlled Soviet Union is fascinating to me and the game does a fantastic job of presenting this visually. The graphics are stunning, from the Soviet-era design of the robots to the environmental settings which facilitate them. The blend of art direction, visuals and unique take on music forms a great immersive experience, at least initially. The game runs like a dream and evidently a lot of work as gone into this specifically. No game in the last 5 years comes close to its combination of visual fidelity and performance. It's apparent a lot of passion has been poured into the game, but not equally into all areas, which is this games shortfall.You're dropped into the world of Atomic Heart where AI is portrayed as a positive influence in an advanced bustling world of soviet tech. The game does a good job of portraying a vision of what could be a promising story line which is ultimately, never explored. A couple hours in and the facade of a friendly AI ecosystem is revealed - everything goes to ♥♥♥♥ and the AI is against you. In this period of the game, there are mechanics to learn, an environment to explore and the excitement of the game is maintained well. However, after that, things start to die off rather rapidly.After the first 8 or so hours, you start to realise a story doesn't really exist - more of a mash up of a series of events which barely relate to one another. The game becomes quite repetitive. You sense something is out of place with the game when you encounter Zina - a cool and strangely different take on a ""Hero"" NPC, though doesn't fit well into the game (a British OAP masterful in CQC, high up in a Russian robot masterplan). The game doesn't elaborate on her role or story enough to want to learn more. Another NPC you meet is NORA. I didn't expect my first proper interaction with a robot to involve being touched inappropriately by robot tentacles for a solid minute, especially not from a vending machine, but here we are. She is immediately infatuated with your character (P-3) and from that point on, serves you as a Store and Upgrade station for your characters weapons and abilities. Although, an interesting take on robot portrayal, a sexualised encounter wasn't really needed, just to facilitate the introduction of a game mechanic. The encounter felt completely out of place and signalled a worrying lack of game design direction.In terms of mechanics, the game does a bad to mediocre job. Combat flows OK (excluding the harshly timed dodge QTE's window) in the first few hours of the game where the number of enemies fought at once is minimal (around 3 max). Later the combo of more enemy types and larger encounters show the combat systems weaknesses - Grouped enemies aren't coordinated and larger fights are overwhelming. Dodge QTE's are constant and the timing is unaccounted for (You'll succeed in a dodge QTE, but take a hit afterwards as another dodge QTE started from another enemy before you can respond). A minimal amount of puzzles are present in the game but are required to be completed to progress further. Due to this, they feel very limited in terms of scope and depth and give no sense of accomplishment. The same applies to linear exploration mechanics such as looting and lock picking - they provide no meaningful incentive for the player to pursue them as little to no loot or collectable items are present in the game.Exploration and its related mechanics such as stealth and AI NPC behaviours don't blend well. Stealth does not exist - You're either being hunted down by all robots in the area, or none know of your presence with no inbetween. More frustratingly, you have no idea whether you're about to be spotted or are perfectly hidden - the absence of feedback loops here really ruins gameplay. AI also have an overly complex management system and the game does a terrible job at explaining this. The games movement system for the player is bad at best - You have no control of in-air movement, which feels necessary given the restricted field of view. Working out which objects in the world are traversable feels like guesswork, most of the time. The whole process of fighting enemies in open world scenarios is both tedious and frustrating in such a way, I'd rather edge crawl areas to bypass enemy encounters. This combined with a lack of incentives to explore the world was a killer for me - No secondary objectives, no side-story or side-quests, interactable NPC's and no functional environments except those present for the linear story. Then only positive takeaway here is good job at showing soviet AI tech experiments, forcible injected into the worlds landscape.One of the last sections of the game I played was the Hog 7 Hedgie Boss fight. The whole fight would have been an overwhelmingly positive experience, but felt ruined by the games movement system. The lack of a sprint mechanic effectively ruins the encounter experience, as you can't escape the close-combat swipes which tears down health. Ironically, dodging it's ranged attack was easy. It felt like I had zero control of my survivability in the fight with the exception of spamming healing items to survive. At this stage in the game I stopped playing as the world became uninteresting with little direction of story and meaning and the break down of mechanics was clear. The game at this point no longer felt fun. Ultimately, the game struggles to decide if it wants to be linear or open-world and consequently does a bad job at both, with the mechanics and story being a clear demonstration of this. At times it feels either overly ambitious or under-developed with to much effort went into making things look pretty (which they undoubtedly are). Given the enjoyment in the first few hours, it feels like a linear world would fit this game best. It feels like the world of Atomic Heart has a lot to give in terms of story and it's characters, but this is never developed upon or explored on an interesting level. In the wider view of this being a Studios first game, it's a solid attempt, but falls short in to many areas."

I even grab most of the upgrades for the weapons to make it more enjoyable, but the upgrades, especially for the AK47, doesn't change its mechanics at all, unlike the upgrades for the normal pistol, melee weapon, and the energy pistol. The normal pistol can charge its shots when aimed, the buzz saw melee can have flying blades with its special attack, and the energy pistol has an EMP function that can stunt robots, which is fun and useful. But the AK47 upgrades were just stats and an element canister, and almost every weapon has a slot for an element canister. There are even cool looking guns that got taken out of the final release.Secondly, the game being an open world doesn't do any justice, yes, it's fun to go around and explore, but you can have the same fun in BioShock 1 without an open world. Atomic Heart doesn't even have a fast travel system, the only way of transportation is to find the same red car, where it could explode if you run over just a tiny amount of robots, unlike Far Cry 3 which is set in an open world where you can drive many types of cars you find along the way and run over enemies many times without it exploding. But in Atomic Heart, when I see a car that I want to drive but realize is not driverable, it ruins the immersion too.Thirdly, the powers, the only one that I felt really useful was kinetic, where you could lift multiple enemies up in the air and slam them down, compared to ice, which I had maxed out and wasn't useful at all because freezing a single enemy takes too long, by then the other enemies would already be attacking you or stunning you.Lastly, there are enemies that I was interested in fighting, but it turns out they were only for show, which is disappointing. I even wanted to fight that weird yeti with an apple on his head in the trailer, but you don't even fight against it and many more enemies. Overall, Atomic Heart became bland and repetitive, and the story felt rushed, the pricing of the game its not worth, wait till discount like 40% to 60% off."

I bought this game because of two reasons. I was interested about the world that the developers have created and what kind of story it would tell me. In regards to the  it is something else, it's different and I love it. Atomic Heart's world is full of bizarre things and occurrences and it doesn't shy away from subjects that are considered somewhat taboo. For example the sexually (under)toned robots. When it comes to the art style and the visual design of said world, it is simultaneously grandiose and pragmatic. Grandiose as any totalitarian government tends to orient, and pragmatic in the little villages where you can see cows and pigs herding. There is a lot of attention to detail. My first playthrough took me about 35 hours just because of the sheer amount of interesting things to see, and the dialogue. In regards to dialogue there is a lot of it, and I refuse to listen poorly dubbed pretend to be Russian. Only way to play this game is with original audio and subtitles. So that led me to stand still and focusing on the dialogue every time the characters had a conversation. As I'm writing this, the subtitles need some work, sometimes disappearing way too fast or not appearing at all. This is somewhat rare and I don't feel like I've missed anything.  itself is good and entertaining and the plot surprised me and that is a big plus. It feels exiting every time I'm wrong with my presumptions about the characters and their motives. P-3 (main character) on the other hand felt like a broken record, but when I thought about it so he should be. He is supposed to be loyal to the man who saved him. Only problem is that I didn't see that happening, I don't know how good of a father figure Sechenov is to P-3, so I just have to try to keep in mind that this is a father and son relationship. All and all I enjoyed most of the conversations and did my best to talk to as many ""NPCs"" as possible.  is solid. It is fun and engaging. Melee weapons have the oomph, guns are fun to use, ammo is readily available. It is so well balanced that I feel like this is the first game ever, where i don't have to choose between minmaxing either guns or melee. Both are just as viable. Progression is standard, you upgrade your weapons and character's abilities. In order to do that you need resources which are gained by looting. Looting itself is created in a way that isn't tedious but satisfying. There are a lot of puzzles and they are good ones. Sometimes they are bit easier, with couple of ones I had to use my head. There are testing facilities, which are optional and mainly consist of puzzles, but by solving these you unlock nice upgrades for your weapons.  is wide ranged and awesome. From Mick Gordon's metal riffs to classical, from russian schlager to east european club tunes. It all fits in and has even an explanation, why it is there.   are few. The subtitle problem which was mentioned before. Achievement's are somewhat buggy and cars break down way too easily in my opinion. Also if you are trying to ram something with a car that is about to charge you, the car loses... Sometimes P-3 gets stuck in the geometry. It was annoying at launch, but got fixed fast. As a final verdict, I could easily recommend this game. Play with native voice overs, since they sound a lot better."

I'm well acquainted with slav jank. I love games like Pathologic and S.T.A.L.K.E.R., both of which are buggy barely finished messes that are still in my top 10 favorite games of all time. Why? Because they have heart, like this game. Pun intended. Also, like those games, this one was clearly far too ambitious for a first time dev studio which explains the bizarre design decisions and jank. Don't be fooled. This is a AA game being sold as a AAA game. I've had the game crash once. I've gotten stuck on geometry multiple times. The map will suddenly stop working. Atomic Heart is simultaneously a technical achievement and a technical mess. The performance, at launch, was shockingly smooth at max settings 4K resolution. No hitches and my frame rate stayed above 90. Given AAA releases like Hogwarts Legacy still have horrendous performance with awfully implemented ray tracing, that's impressive. The game is beautiful. Easily one of the best looking games to ever come out on a technical and especially artistic level. It's a Soviet nightmare brought to life with some of the smoothest animations I've ever seen. I put it above Machine Games' Wolfenstein titles in art design. Speaking of, this game reminds me most of Wolfenstein instead of Bioshock. They even have Mick Gordon going hard on the fantastic soundtrack. Don't be deceived. This is NOT an ""immersive sim"" despite the obvious ""451"" reference in the boring, linear intro sequence that felt ripped right out of Bioshock Infinite. This game has a poor start, but gets going when you get into your first underground complex.I started loving the game once I dropped the Bioshock expectations and looked at it as more of a boomer shooter like Wolfenstein. Think about it. It heavily emphasizes stealth. Instead of an advanced Nazi society, it's Soviet. The tone is extremely campy with a B-movie action hero dropping catch phrases like ""crispy critters"". There's no weapon limit. There are numerous AWESOME bosses and the combat is high octane and fast paced. This game doesn't take itself seriously at all and I love it. Major Comrade's voice acting is as corny as can be and it worked for me. Charles is genuinely well voice acted and bounces off of our hero's no-bs attitude really well with his professional attitude. The dialogue between them is compelling. The world building is the highlight of the game's writing even if the main story is nothing special. Reading emails on terminals, listening to audio logs, and literally conversing with corpses all flesh out the world in a more substantive manner than constant cutscenes ever could.The gameplay is a huge mix of styles that make for a mixed bag that's more fun than frustrating. The gunplay is damn good. All of the reload animations look incredible and the weapons sound and handle extremely well. There aren't a ton of guns, but the deep customization that modifies the look and feel of each gun with numerous customizable melee weapons AND abilities like telekinesis, shock, frostbite, etc. AND elemental cartridges for every weapon, give the combat a lot of depth. The platforming sections were honestly really fun. It's no Mirror's Edge, but it works. The puzzles could be challenging at times and I liked the creativity of them. Each underground level was very well designed and I must give praise to the awesome enemy variety. Each design is distinct and extremely well animated. When you're getting swarmed, combat can get intense. Unlike 90% of other self-proclaimed ""RPG's"", this game's skill trees do make a massive difference and get me excited to unlock a new skill whenever I visit NORA, the horny vending machine. I'm not joking.However, the open world is pointless and full of undercooked ideas. The camera system has so much potential for Deus Ex style hacking, but all you ever do is open a door sometimes to access this game's take on dungeons called Testing Grounds. There are cars and by cars, I mean that one red model you barely come across that handles like melted ass and breaks fast af. There was very little thought put into the design of the sandbox. They should've focused on just having more levels instead. Also, the stealth is about as basic as can be and is arguably worse than Wolfenstein. Cameras can be easily shocked or outright destroyed with little consequence. Yes, they can get repaired, along with every other enemy, but you'll be long gone before that happens. Escaping high alert status is extremely easy. On top of all of that, the loot in this game is waaaaaaay too plentiful. There's no reason my storage should have dozens of healing items. Either decrease the amount of loot or add more enemies to levels. For whatever reason, you will go through 75% of one of the Testing Grounds doing puzzles, looting, and platforming and not come across a single enemy. Why? This is an FPS isn't it? Also, the save system is hot trash. If you're just going to put a save room every 3 steps, why even have it? Just give us a basic save feature we can access from the pause menu.That really is the core issue with Atomic Heart. It tries to do too much with too little. If they honed in on their strengths, we could be looking at an instant classic, but like S.T.A.L.K.E.R., instead we have a cult classic. This is a game I love, IN SPITE of its issues, NOT because of them. There's just nothing else like it out right now and hopefully, it can escape from Bioshock's shadow. As it stands, I had a great time with this strange, addictive, funny game and I look forward to whatever they make next. While I do recommend it, I say it's best to get it at $50 instead where it should've been priced. Like I said, this isn't a AAA game. It doesn't have that level of polish.My final arbitrary score: 7.5/10"

But this game is actually a very mixed bags of eurojank, terrible and even off-putting writing and overall just bad game structure and design. From the beginning you can tell that the game doesn't have anywhere near the finess, the maturity and the class of Bioshock: all NPCs female models have the same face, there are 3 NPCs with neurodevice exactly the same, audio lines are messy and super-imposed, set-dressing and decoration is really inegal, and will the city in the beginning is a nice sight which makes you realize there's no FOV slider whatsoever, you start realizing how terrible writing is really terrible and unfortunately is everything I dislike about modern Russian culture: outdated bad tasted couch potato bros. The fridge scene could've been fun but instead they weren't with a very tasteless lines, and that's where I actually starting disliking the game and seeing for what it is: a badly designed, redundant, janky, unsophisticated mess in one of the most promising, interesting world building since Bioshock, but nowhere near and I mean miles below the latter.In fact passed the intro, the game started to bore me and feel repetitive very quickly, so I don't recommend buying the game and instead waiting for it to be really cheap to play the first tencile of the game after which point it falls to all it's shortcoming and dialogues continue to become annoying."

There is only a handful of powers and half of them either feel weak against enemies or are useless entirely. The guns, melees, and weapon crafting is fun, but once again, it feels like they added the bare minimum amount of weapons to put in the game. In my opinion, the main character is insufferable and doesn't really redeem himself later in the game, i wish there was a mute button for him and i didn't pay attention to the story because i skipped everything he said when it gave me the chance. The game presents a way to be stealthy in this game buts its pointless, the only way to do that is to get behind every single enemy and press F. Halfway through the game, there is this an open world map you crash into and it was most fun part, it had a good bit of dungeons to go through and all sorts of puzzles and rewards, but shortly after that it got back to being a straight through closed world, which felt weird. The robots are very creative and fun to fight, i just wish the bosses were more than a one-time fight. The game's story was odd but the world looked incredible, the whole ""Limbo"" thing felt pretty forced into the story so i didn't care much for it.Overall, the game-play is fun, but everything else in it was mid.

To start off... Powers do little to nothing, robots constantly respawn, enemies are bullet sponges and the boss fights are super repetitive. The story is all over the place, the main character and glove are insufferable and talk entirely too much, the open world is very narrow and annoying to traverse. Right when the story begins to pick up, and we learn the backstory of the main character, the game leaves us with two terrible endings that make the entire journey feel meaningless. The premise and world were so well designed, its such a shame everything else just failed to prop it up. I really hope to see some better games from this studio because they have the potential to make something great."

Being a huge Bioshock fan, this game instantly got my attention, and for a few months i've been eagerly waiting for its release, preordering and everything, only to be met with respawning, bullet sponge enemies, incredibly poor dialogue, boring puzzles that the game makes fun of itself (that doesn't make it endearing, you just acknowledge your own poor level design) and horndog npcs. The gameplay was lackluster and the only few things I found entertaining was the beautiful environments, animations, and enemy design. Game peaked at the Hedgie boss imo, that was actually really fun and was a huge step in the right direction. I never found the mouse acceleration to be a huge issue, actually didnt even notice it was on until I read other negative reviews. Kinda worth it if you pick it up on sale 80% off, otherwise a waste of my hard earned 60$.edit: I just want to clarify that I absolutely think that this game studio could make a killer game. We need more studios with creative ideas, and I don't want any negative reviews to ruin their motivation to perfect something so close to complete"

I do realize that this game has a fairly mixed response, but the majority of the top reviews for this game are along the lines of ""Awooga, commie mommy robo dommy yes please step on me"", which doesn't really say very much about the game.The robot asses, excuse me, assets, are great, and I can definitely appreciate that the dev team was horny for robots and let it show. That being said, the game that you have to play to see those sexy robots is pretty lacking in some areas. I will be the first to admit that I tend to focus rather hard on one or two systems in a game and try to push those to the limits of their effectiveness, so in games where you are presented with a large menu of options for tackling obstacles, I usually end up lacking in combat effectiveness by the end of the game. In Atomic Heart, I tried to pay a lot of attention to the weapon and upgrade system, and I constantly felt like I was behind the ball in terms of combat power. It always felt like I didn't have enough resources, or that I wasn't stretching those resources effectively. One caveat to that is that I did consistently forget to upgrade my character, however the character upgrades for the most part did not seem to be giving me the large jumps in power that one might expect. I got most of the health upgrades, and still felt like the enemies were chewing through my life bar, mainly because one of the ways that Atomic Heart tries to ""challenge"" the player is by sheer numbers. I could try to just write my frustration out here, but instead I think an anecdote will work better. Towards the end of what I played of the game I had just beaten a boss that had drained my resources rather significantly. I was pretty low on heals and ammo, and I had just gotten the item I needed to bring back to the hub of that zone. At this point, I had to backtrack to the hub, where they spawned 5 of the white shirt robots, 2 of the black shirt robots and 3 of the flying enemies, not even 5 seconds after I had finished a boss fight with no real opportunity to recharge, save or acquire any kind of replenishing of my resources. Keep in mind that these enemies were spawned in an area I had also previously cleared. Twice.So I died there, and then had to redo both the boss fight, as well as the fight after it with the same amount of limited resources. Beating my head against the wall got me through it, but just barely, and I was very close to having screwed myself with a bad checkpoint. There were a lot of areas like this where I felt as though I was hamstrung between either spending my materials to craft the ammo and heals that I wasn't finding out in the world (not for lack of trying) or upgrading my weapons to be more effective and use less ammo and heals. Here is where I will fully admit that it is entirely possible that I wasn't engaging with the systems as much as I could have, or possibly that I wasn't doing it properly, but I definitely was making the most of what I did find, using the deconstruct menu to get rid of things I wasn't using, to acquire as much as I could towards making and upgrading the weapons to be effective. Beyond the general frustration with the gameplay, I do think that a majority of the time spent not fighting is not great in this game either. The extraordinarily strong setting with the dystopian world that you are dropped into can only do so much heavy lifting, and even though everything looked great, and was stylistically appropriate for the setting, I ran into a lot of issues with readability as a game. The enemies tend to blend into the environment anytime that you are outside. A lot of the puzzle elements blend into the floors or walls. I am colorblind so take this with a grain of salt, but it is an issue I ran into.Also while moving around the world, the same problem appears with the game just throwing boatloads of enemies at you. There are cameras that can see you and send out an alert to spawn more enemies, these cameras are white and blend in with the background the same as enemies do, so basically every time you are walking around, unless you spend the whole time in the environment scanning mode, you are bound to set off one of the cameras and waste a bunch of time and ammo.Now, the story. Initially I thought the dialogue had to be making fun of how video game protagonists never shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, the script and dialogue seemed to be self aware. However.I think there were 2 separate teams writing this game, though. The team that took the time to write out genuinely funny, interesting sections that left me wanting to sit there listening to the dialogue more, and the team that was responsible for annoying the ♥♥♥♥ out of the player. It was really impressive the sheer volume of dialogue in the game, but all of those words written out and recorded are a waste because most of them are conveyed to you as you are doing other things you have to focus on. The dialogue comes mostly while you are doing platforming or puzzles or even during combat.  Imagine in GOW 2018, if Mimir was explaining very important lore to you while you were in the middle of fighting off hordes of enemies. That is what happens in this game. The glove that your main character talks to so much has whole conversations with you during the middle of events that require your full attention. By the almost 10th hour I played where I finally quit, it occurred to me that I didn't really know the main characters name, or any of the names for that matter. The plot in general might have been very interesting if I could actually follow what they were saying all of the time, but most of the plot important information was at points where I had to choose to continue playing the game, or stop moving completely to sit there and listen for 3 minutes to what they're saying THEN keep playing the game. There was no good balance struck for this at any point, and in general, I as well as most of the people watching me stream the game couldn't really get much of a handle on what was going on at any given point in time. I feel that if given time and money again, this dev team most definitely has the capability of making a genuinely good game. There was so many elements of this that were great, but the parts of the game that left me feeling unsatisfied added up to be more than the parts that were impressive, and the overall package of Atomic Heart ended up being a disappointment. The shine on the first few hours of the game wore off rather quickly once you get out of the beginning area. In their next project, I hope that they maintain their creativity, both in stylistic choice and world building, and please god hire Mick Gordon to do the soundtrack again because he absolutely killed it.There was one or two genuinely jaw dropping moments to this game, and I hope that Mundfish takes the genuine criticism that they are receiving and puts its all towards their next game, they are on the cusp of something fantastic. Also keep the hot robots, I think everyone can agree, we all love the hot robots. Edit: I just wanna add something here at the end that I think says more than anything else I said in the review. After I quit out of Atomic Heart I decided to keep streaming and just play something else, so I started up Hitman 3 and was messing around in their Freelancer mode. I was immediately in a better mood and having fun. That's the important part that I didn't mention in this review. It just wasn't that fun. Thanks for reading."

AH is a  lengthy, tough, and awesome looking shooter that has the player facing off with elaborate 1950’s inspired enemies both biological and robotic. However, after reading some other reviews, I can agree that AH has a lot of different ideas that developers tried to cram into one game that did not meld completely. PROS: * The soundtrack and music is awesome. Russian pop/techno interjected into big battles seemed strange at first but works well. *Art style of the robots and island was fantastic and showed the “1950’s era edge” well.  Boss fights were challenging and fair. * The story was nothing new to the genre, but added a little twist in the end that I thought was clever.CONS: * I like some puzzles, but this game has a OVER ABUNDANCE of door, floor rotation, and magnet-gravity puzzles. The game had a habit of building up battle momentum and then slamming a puzzle in front of you. It killed the adrenaline and momentum. The puzzles involving moving the “ball keys” with telekinesis was brain numbing and time wasting. *The protagonist of the story has NO RUSSIAN ACCENT AT ALL. He’s just a loudmouth that sounds like he came from mid-west US. I was confused as to why he could not have had SOME resemblance of an accent in an all-Russian game. Metro did it well. Why couldn’t AH? * The addition of more special abilities may have added a bit more to the combat. As is, there is only a shock, freeze, telekinetic ability. Telekinesis felt sloppy and unreliable.  I found myself forgetting I had these and focused on using mainly guns and shock."

Melee in particular felt clunky, with how long it takes to charge up a heavy hit only to deal a minuscule amounts of extra damage in fights where robots zoom around and shoot homing missiles etc at you.Bosses were pretty fun though and to me the highlights of my playthrough, though i noticed compared to the first major boss in the big arena, the rest seemed pretty easy by comparison and didn't pose nearly as much of a threat.Do i recommend the game? Eeeh, again the bosses were pretty fun and some of the soundtrack is going to stick with me for a while, certain areas were also genuinely pretty to look at and experience, but those alone didn't stop the game from feeling like a bit of the same ol slog by the end, especially when i got hit with the endings. So no, i personally don't recommend Atomic Heart.

A little jank here and there, with some bizarrely bad writing and acting in places, but wow, the visuals, art style, lore, satisfying combat and sense of progression are great. Performance on PC is also unbelievably smooth.Every area feels unique, and seeing new environments with amazing art and lighting is a treat. The game plays kinda like Bioshock; taking place in a deteriorating retro-futuristic utopia - the period art-deco environments, with lots of underwater and sky-floating definitely evoke a lot of Rapture / Columbia vibes. In terms of gameplay, you have elements / plasmids on your left hand and can use guns with the right. There are larger 'miniboss' enemies like Big Daddies that have specific weaknesses and resistances, and you can loot all corpses and containers in the environments for a ton of crafting materials and supplies. If you like exploring alternate-history worlds with sci-fi elements, this is gold.Scavenging the environment and defeated enemies will yield crafting components that you can use to upgrade your skill tree, which has things like extra health, chain lighting for your shock-glove, more inventory capacity, etc. Then there's also weapon upgrades which can alter how the weapon handles and also change the visuals considerably. You can spec weapons so they deal more damage to robots, or organic enemies, etc. There are also 'element' capsules that you can screw into the weapons to add extra fire / electric damage, etc. Plenty to play and experiment with.The first 4-5 hours are pretty linear and introductory, and then the game opens up quite a bit, with lots of optional side areas (with decent challenges and puzzles) The 'challenge' / testing facilities all have unique puzzles and encounters, which lead to weapon upgrades. Finding and completing these has been very fun and rewarding.The boss fights are really cool and intense - and the soundtrack is extremely good. Mick Gordon (of DOOM fame) knocks it out of the park with very heart-pounding tracks. The music also smoothly changes as you enter combat and clear areas of enemies.Animation quality is absolutely stellar. All the robots and characters move with so much detail and personality that they're a joy to watch. The cutscenes and other in-game interactions your character has with the environment are exceptionally detailed and cinematic. Performance is smooth as butter, even on my ageing PC (i7 6700K which is 8 years old) and a 2080 Super with 32gb DDR4 RAM. I have the game maxed out on Ultra at 2560x1440 and in most areas it's a solid 144fps (with some dips down to the 80's in the open-world areas.) It also has ZERO shader stuttering, unlike every other Unreal Engine 4 game I've played in the last few years. I'm shocked at how well made this is. There's a quick 1-2 minute shader compile while you fiddle with the settings menu, and then it's smooth-sailing.There are some negatives, which I can kinda look past, since things overall get better after the intro. The opening hour or so is basically an unskippable auto-scroller that really shows you the world. The intro is filled with walking / talking sections where you slowly ride a boat, slowly ride an elevator, slowly ride a car, slowly converse with several plot characters, etc. And some missions involve some tedious fetch-quest stuff. Though thankfully the action between these is great.The first few hours feature some  cringe dialogue. Over-bearing sexual innuendos, tons of unneccessary inflammatory dialogue that makes the main character unlikeable, and some very odd voice direction at times. Though the wackiness of it has made it an entertaining curiosity so far. I never know what's going to happen next, or how characters will react! In fairness, there's also a lot of good dialogue, and some has genuinely made me laugh, with some fun meta commentary on the world of gaming.Overall, if you can look past some of the writing and occasional bugs, there's a lot to like here. As a huge fan of Prey, Bioshock and Half Life, I'm having a blast with this."

The fights are what gets me. The combat feels so damn squishy and unfun so far. Super-slow wind-up attacks against fairly fast bots. It teaches you a dodge mechanic, but that  works in the short ""robot-red power attack"" window. Aside from that, it's just keep moving and poking. But, really!? Quick-time events as the main combat mechanic!? STOP WITH THE QUICK-TIME EVENTS!The combat gets less squishy through upgrades... then the game changes mechanics on you and makes it squishy again. It's almost worth it to just mash the attack key, tank the damage, and consume your health-packs. (No matter what you do, you're going to spend every fight running away while drinking health potions). Despite all that, I was really starting to enjoy the game, and the upgrades when... WHAM! Ultra-squishy combat with quick-time events added in! That's right, once you're finally upgraded enough to start using skill in fights, the game throws a whole new enemy at you... One that's faster than you, with repeated heavy-attacks (so you  avoid getting 1/2 health hits and being knocked down), and a special attack... an unavoidable grab attack. This isn't just any grab attack... this is one you can't avoid or escape, except by completing a series of four rapid and random quick-time events. One fail = instant death. You have to pass two sets of these special quick-time attacks to defeat this enemy. ...and just like that, you lost me. Bye. Not coming back. ♥♥♥♥ you, your quick-time laziness, and your forgetting the rule of fun.P.S.: This one is especially painful for me, because it is  then effed up the combat mechanics. And that's it, that's really the only problem with the game. Very few bugs, smooth gameplay, great world and story... but quick-time and squishyness everywhere."

Game runs well although given its recent release there some bugs. nothing Major or game breaking or that cant be solved with a simple restart. However especially toward the end some very minor textures would turn into clown vomit and prompt a restart. Game-play wise the game felt EXTREMELY fun to play especially as you progressed in the upgrade tree and EARNED an OP feel. One of my favorite things to do was to use TK and destroy everything nearby. On the flip side, there was one aspect I'm still not sure of how I feel about and that is the enemy respawn. I mean sure you can disable it by overloading, but once you do so you trapped in that area as lasers lock you in and sometimes don't turn back off after the 15 mins it takes to come back up. Apart from all that, I will dare say that through and through playing this felt like the first time I ever played BIOSHOCK while still being different enough that it would be remembered as its own game with unique mechanics instead of a clone. The game was very forgiving and encouraging of you switching up or trying new play-styles too which should be given massive kudos for.Story wise, it was pretty thorough and straight forward so I can't complain. Plenty of witty lines and caught myself chuckling rather than rolling my eyes. Was kind of worried if the game was just going to turn into communist propaganda and was rather glad it did no such thing and highlighted the flaws of ideology mostly without bias. In summary, to anyone who wished Bioshock had a straightforward plot and more of a fun approach instead of serious, you'll have enjoy playing this. I'd pay 60-70 for this but given Inflation rates and the attempt of a reset by the WEF and the Brandon administration, I wholeheartedly vibe with those who would wait until it comes down to a solid $45"

The positive reviews I see are something to the effect of ""Wow Bioshock Infinite meets Wolfenstein!"" or ""SovietShock!"" and ignore anything about the actual game it self. Cons: - The first thing I noticed during the opening cutscenes was that when I panned to either side as far as I could go it would push my camera back to the center an inch, or so, if I wasn't actively pushing it that direction. Why? Let me look at my surroundings. - The voice acting is trash. It has no emotion and doesn't match what's going on in the actual scene or moment in the game. It has some Tommy Wiseau in The Room level editing where voice lines are almost on top of each other before the other character has really even finished speaking. Along with the bad voice acting/editing is the bad sound design. There were often times where there was sound just straight up missing or mismatched. The part where Granny fires the rocket launcher the sound was basically just not there.. Felt like an alpha build of the game which is sad considering this part took place in under the first hour of the game. I thought maybe the voice acting would take a back seat to the other features of the game but no. The main character and his sentient glove talk nonstop. The dialogue is real  - It's buggy. One of the very first enemies comes through a door which I attacked, and then he got stuck behind the door. I could attack and kill him, but I couldn't loot him. The door never opened again. Some enemies flash on screen before actually showing up and are attackable.  - The looting. The looting is the most tedious thing about this game. It's marketed as an easy ""continue to hold F and and you vacuum everything up"" when in reality you have to hold F in very specific spots, and for long enough, or it doesn't count if you've looted it entirely and you miss items. There's also entirely too many objects to loot which adds to the tediousness.  - Batman detective mode. The radar mode helps slightly with making sure you loot everything but it's super inconsistent. Certain items are visible super far away and some not; some visible around corners and some not. Felt like I was constantly pulling it up, and when I didn't I would pull it up to find I missed a single metal crouton in a single pencil drawer in a room full of 50 different lootable filing cabinets. - Combat isn't great. The responsiveness of the dodge and light attack seem to work well. But the first upgrade you get is a whirlwind heavy attack. Takes a long time to complete, spins your vision, and you can be hit while finishing the long attack time. I'm sure it works ok with upgraded versions of the freeze and shield, but why bother when you can light attack, dodge without getting dizzy.  - Platforming. Feels like the most tacked on aspect of the game. The game doesn't explain at all how to move while climbing walls and pipes. I just moved my mouse and character around until eventually my character awkwardly put out his arm and then I knew ""oh ok now its time for me to jump"". A lot of the time you jump and miss. Instead of falling all the way down you get caught on an weird part of the geometry like a crack in the cement wall that clearly isn't meant to be stood upon. - Horny fridge? Why? Just why? I guess it fits with the terrible writing. Pros: Runs well, looks nice, and the environments are well done. That's it. That's literally all of it.Normally don't write reviews but this is genuinely one of the worst games I've played to date. Felt worth saying something against all of the ""positive"" reviews that don't actually say anything about the game. All of this in under two hours of game play. Refunded it."

It may be missing some features in terms of customizability for the ""PC version"" which you may need to third party routes to obtain. (FOV being one of them) its refreshing to have a game finally launch and actually be playable without any major issues whatsoever. At worst you may experience a minor hiccup during a transitional cutscene which arguably doesn't detract from the overall gameplay. Mostly everyone is saying this is Soviet Bioshock, and that's in the absolute best way possible. With plenty of customization options for builds and weaponry. Thankfully enough you can experiment however you choose as you are free to re-spec your ability points when you want to without restriction. Pros +- Graphically solid- Fun Combat- Varying areas- Multiple Types of Enemies- Multiple Powers/Weapons- Fairly good Story (Thus far its been good)- Phenomenal world building from the start (advisable to read the lore if that interests you.)Cons -- English VO can be a bit off in terms on inflection and delivery. - Fairly Linear, much like Bioshock 1. (This isn't the worst thing by far and the pace has been held well. I would have liked more of this world to explore in each area)- Strafing is particularly slow. It feels clunky due to this in the movement department, but you are supplemented with a quick charging dodge. So this was probably by design. This has so far been such a solid recommend and it feels so close to bioshock that it might as well exist in the same universe."

I wish I could learn more about the story through the world, but I have to listen to so much talking and banter and it's exhausting. The worst of this is the first encounter with the weapon upgrade terminal. While I'm trying to learn how to upgrade my stuff, the characters just won't stop talking! I actually quit the game because I couldn't stand having a ""horny fridge"" endlessly go on about ""shoving my sword"" into it. But alas, I came back, switched the voice acting to Russian, and kept playing, but it's then when I figured it out: the game just isn't fun. The visuals are beautiful, but it's too much. There's so much detail that it's distracting and this must have an effect on the animations because enemies are moving at 10 frames from 20 ft away with the highest animation settings settings (everything else was on medium). Plus the obvious saturation of fetch quests in the earliest bit of game, I think I have a good idea what this game is going to be like going forward. The combat is fine. I was excited for this (since 2018), but it seems like they really missed the mark on a lot of things. I'll keep trying to play it, but it's exhausting. This game is just exhausting."

NPCs just need something to hate for whatever reason. Back in the days they burned books, now they try to cancel anything that doesn't fit into their narratives.With this being said, the actual review:This game is a masterfully crafted story filled with few, but well-developed characters backed by rich retro-futuristic setting which somewhat reminds of Strugatsky's Noon Universe and has tons of nostalgic content for those who were born in USSR or spent their childhood in post-soviet countries in 90's. I love Mick Gordon's take on the iconic songs from that era.I won't get into details about the story, but Some aspects of game design are questionable, such as open world mechanics (or their absence) and clunky inventory system. Endless streams of enemies, ""special"" car physics and damage model, and lack of fast travel make open-world exploration rather tedious.As of now, there are some bugs, but nothing game-breaking:Upgrades sometimes disappear when you move weapons to stash and back, some achievements that are based on Steam statistics are getting reset (counters for found collectibles, completed polygons, etc.), occasional crashes and the car that gets launched into space when you pass over the bump."

It was totally absurd, the main character and the ai glove on his hand would get out of character, it was good.After that it wasn't good.  I finished it because I didn't want to let this game beat me.  The main character is annoying.  The combat was too difficult on hard at the beginning then too simple when you upgraded your guns.  You hear the word ""polymer"" once per sentence.The story is a take on the Singularity, will the Soviet Communist Singularity be good or should it be stopped?  The writers gave you everything you need to figure out what's really going with subtle foreshadowing that is always with you from the beginning.  It's intuitively easy to figure this out inbetween the characters constantly reviewing how their utopian soviet society works, blackouts, misdirection, cryptic dialog, innumerable audio & text logs, and side characters who's actions are guided by being mad or uninformed.  (The dissonance of having the utopia narrative  explained to you by placid robot voices while seeing unethical medical experiments and dead mutilated human corpses strung up everywhere made up for some of that.)The delivery of the narrative is very high concept and it doesn't deliver.  Maybe the devs were distracted by making  happen.  Nine foot tall chrome and brass robot ladies perform an intense ballet ritual where they shake and shudder with the effort of penetrating each other's mercury filled insides to extract keys(?) which release a pulsating humanoid goo entity that subsumes a human corpse to upload it's dead mind into some form of cybernetic afterlife.  There's also a very long   sequence where you're chasing an antagonist through a theatre full of locked doors and you get to listen to the antagonist use the PA system to announce how nobody appreciated them and that you suck.The narrative really falls apart at the end.  So no.  will not play again.  I bought this because the graphics looked nice and I was up for some of that."

Overall great game with great combat engaging story and awe inspiring visuals. Runs well too.some of my other thoughts:The open world is cool and interesting but don't expect it to be too sophisticated. It mostly serves as a way to transition between different parts of the story. Its fun just to drive between locations in a moskvich while listening to the radio. Although you can always walk too.I felt the game was heavily inspired by the tomb raider reboots and how they approach open worlds and dungeons. Combat I felt was influenced by souls style games. The abilities were inspired by rage 2. Melee combat feels very satisfying and rewarding. The game gives you enough room to experiment with whatever style you want to do. You can easily respec your character in whatever way you want.I just wish there was a new game plus mode, I guess they'll add that later though.Story is good and feels engaging, characters are intriguing, talking to dead people gets old quick though.Soundtrack really enhances the gameplay and visuals, very good.I only had one crash in my entire play time.

Yes, yes, the voice for babushka Zina is actually suitable.+ An interesting story, the plot is passed in one breath. *SPOILER* thought out to such trifles as music from the future.+ Hardcore game, or rather the strength of even simple ""Vovchick"" makes casual players cry.+ Large variation of weapons and skills.+ Quite interesting ""side quests"" that help the game interact with the game world, although it may seem to someone that it is bring - give it. This is an RPG game.+ Twin robots.+ There are no stupid Western agendas of the 21st century in this game.+ There is humor with different overtones. 18+ game.Cons:- The main character has a hairstyle that is not typical for 1955 in the USSR - this makes the look at the character not entirely authentic.- Bosses are actually quite easy.- **** Pie"" - the protagonist's redundancy.- Manual saves are already too much, sometimes they can roll back the game progress by 30 minutes back, due to the oversight of the player who *died*.For Mundfish's first game, this is a very good result.

A world that engulf's you into its past and makes you curious on what there is in it. But I would also like to share that I became very disappointed in their story telling..--- Overall a decent game, don't go into this thinking it's the best of the best. Keep your bar at an average level and with an open mind. You will find it interesting. If you plan to give the game a shot then please do buy the base version as the premiums are not worth it in my opinion, or see if it goes on sale. ---If I could give this review a mixed yes/no I would, but sadly there isn't an option for that. This game can be beaten in the story very quickly if you do not spend time with the little things or stop to read information. The design of the robots and the level of detail graphically are amazing, the scenery, the locations are as well. Story wise is where things get complicated. I see the dream they wished to achieve, I just wish they would have played more into their story.--- Spoiler warning!!! If you do not care about spoilers read on ahead! ---I am very disappointing with the story when it comes to choice. There were only two times ""choice"" really ""mattered"" in this game or even appeared. Honestly the ""choices"" didn't even let you choose. The story starts to fall into place as the option of choice and free will are now under control of another and no longer your own later in the game. It is a nice story that can portray a villain who thinks they see the greater good and are doing good for everyone around them. And although some of the plot twists in the ending were nice, I felt the lack of ""choice"" to be out of place. With a game that claims there are two endings, there is sadly only one. And while I appreciate playing on the illusion of ""choice"", if they could have portrayed that more and played more into the illusion of it instead of just at the end, I would be ok with the game's endings, or I should say, ending. In the morality of the choices, there is a spot for your own sake if what you did was right, but it doesn't matter. I would have rather played a linear story than giving the option of the two choice that play to the same one. If you were curious if there is a good ending, there isn't. It's bad or bad, which in turn story wise, become the same ending regardless. Either let the villain get the desired goal sooner, or delay it a short while till he get's it. All the same, he gets it regardless. While I do like the typical twist of the hero losing and the villain wins as our ending, please don't claim there is a choice or make one if you aren't going to play into it more. One choice at the end that lead to the same linear one feels like all my previous game play didn't matter. If you cut the price in half for this game, as well as just making it all facilities and none of the open world exploration, then made the gameplay even shorter, it would have had a better taste in everyone's mouth in my opinion. Please don't get me wrong, the amazing battle music, the robots in size, the puzzles were all in great fun. I would just have rather cut out most if not all the walking nonsense and surface exploration for more facilities, harder puzzles, and a richer story. Still an experience of a game that I partially enjoyed none the less, just see some wasted potential in a game that could have been even more amazing."

I enjoyed the first 4 hours but the writing and gameplay quickly fell off during my 2nd session.The playable character while occasionally funny, is mostly insufferable. The few other characters I got to hear and interact with were great! It just sucks that the character I spent the most time with, I wanted to punch into oblivion. He sounds like an edgy middle school-er.The combat intro to the game also took way too long. I was underground for 6 hours before I was finally able to see the surface again. I was taking my time looking through things but I was not taking too long, ya know? The whole segment needed to end hours earlier and I ended up running through the final 2 hours I was down there as fast as I could. Potentially missing things but just wanting to move on. The re-intro to the outside world was also a big letdown. I took two steps outside, got spotted and bodied constantly until rushing into the woods to hide and progress the story. While the high surveillance in the world makes sense from a story perspective, it was not a fun re-entry to the world. Enemies also seemed to spot me with no line of sight. In a large bush, completely covered? Too bad, enemy see's you, level 2 threat acquired. Foliage seems to not cover you at all to most enemies. Which just sucks in comparison to many other games on the market that seem to have that system nailed down with no issues. Do the robot's see with heat vision? When did they tell me that? Did they ever?The game seems to have a lot going for it! The story was super interesting during the first 2 hours but it just took too long to keep it going. Art direction is fantastic, I loved looking at the game. Atmosphere is on-point. I was anxious and definitely got a Bioshock feel in some area's.Overall, I just don't have the time to suffer through this game to wait for it to get better."

If you're like me, I need a high FOV for my games or I'll actually feel sick. I have a bit of motion sickness. Right now, the game doesn't have an FOV slider. The game is way too zoomed in for me so I actually can't continue playing it until they patch it in (which I think they are in the future)2. The dialogue for the protagonist is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad that it's really taking me out of the game world. Every 5 seconds it's just him cursing or making some unfunny quip or joke or being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or saying how awesome technology and russia is. I like the dialogue for everyone else though (except the fridge which actually makes me cringe). I tried setting the game's audio to Russian audio, and I do believe it helped a little. However, I don't know if this is intended but the characters sometime talk super fast and can begin speaking the literal microsecond another's dialogue stops. It's really weird.  The reason I set my language back to English is because during a lock-picking minigame I was learning for the first time (which is also timed), the protag and the glove just ♥♥♥♥ out dialogue to eachother in Russian. I couldn't read the subtitles because I was trying to focus on the lockpicking minigame in front of my face so I don't know what they really said. I assume this will happen a couple of times throughout my playthrough so I changed it back to English after that.I think the gameplay is pretty good and the graphics/artstyle are stellar. If you ignore my 2 points above then you'll likely enjoy this game. I'll be returning to it after an FOV slider is patched in to give an honest review of the game itself"

Visually the game can look pretty good, I like the artistic direction, otherwise? Not so much.Voice acting is awful, god I don't think I've hated a protag from any game more than I hate P3. Sound effects are.. Not that great either, sometimes they're extremely muffled and the general quality is pretty bland.Gameplay wise combat is relatively basic, it's not very interesting and for the most part I just start leaning on the guns more, which are.. Okay. Feels like there's no reason to use anything but the shotgun, I get either one shell, one handgun bullet, or one assault rifle round? I think I know who's the winner of that contest. They talk about Stealth/Sneaking about, but that's not really something they put any care into. There's no perks or a lot of benefit to crouching around, most enemies will still see you from their normal distances and you can still sneak kill by just walking up to them. Bug riddled, even after the hotfixes there are still quite a few that are either downright annoying or at times game breaking. I was trying to progress through a facility, only to find that the door was bugged and refused to open until I reloaded a save. Hotfixes have helped with some other issues like certain resources not dropping but there's still some obvious ones. Enemies get this.. Blob-like appearance when you're in scanning mode, and sometimes that sticks after you leave it, feels like you're getting chased by some stop-motion playdough monster. Sometimes I see enemies in the distance T-posing as well.They also found it ideal to have climbing and jumping puzzles/mechanics but also made them EXTREMELY slow and inconsistent at times. A lot of times I slide off of things I should mantle, other times it takes me ages to climb a pipe and jump to a ledge just to very slowly shimmy a centimetre or a two at a time. This goes for a lot of the movement, you're not very fast, and the game opens up eventually where you can cross a lot of space and you can take cars but the footwork you put in for exploration is.. A lot with NO SPRINT available to you.So many issues with this game I was hoping would be a great addition, my boyfriend does enjoy it so.. At least there's that? Not a complete waste."

If what you want from this game is to enjoy a world with stellar visual presentation, fantastic animation work, a well optimised PC version with very few bugs, and gameplay that is actually close to what the trailers all implied, then you will find it in the final game. However,  other aspects in its narrative and some general gameplay design choices only mean I can recommend it once the game is heavily on sale. It's an enjoyable game, but not without problems that come close to spoiling the experience.As most can tell you,  is visually incredible and a setting that I haven't been as keen to explore since the days of . The details of the world as you explore the 50s inspired aesthetic colliding with impossible technology that borders on supernatural with the monsters and mutants of the Facility seem like they would clash, but they actually meld together to create something believable. All of the robot designs (and yes, of course the Twins) are really imaginative and cool, especially with some of them harking back to decades-old thinking about what the future could look like in a way that's almost nostalgic.What's even more impressive is that  visuals are actually comparable and sometimes nearly identical to what we saw in pre-release materials. Usually in games like this, the visual quality will always suffer heavy cuts and downgrades, but  appears to have compromised barely any of it in both art direction and graphical fidelity. It also helps that the game can be run on maximum settings on systems well below the minimum specs and still push really high framerates.The actual gameplay when exploring the different complexes within the Facility is also solid, if a bit formulaic. Following on from the earlier  example, the game wears this sort of gameplay loop proudly on its sleeve. You'll be fighting waves of different enemies and utilising numerous abilities to take them down while scouring the environments for upgrade materials, ammo, and lore with logs and computer terminals, all of which function satisfyingly. Looting things is streamlined with a simple button press to harvest all of the components available and the melee combat in particular is appropriately heavy and enjoyable. The gunplay is a little more clunky, with the speed of the enemies and low FOV making it hard to keep track of more than a few at a time, and the stealth feels like its too difficult to really make builds around, but it gets the job done.The sound design of the game is also top notch. Even putting aside the musical genius of Mick Gordon and the clever use of Soviet-era music both in original and remixed form, all of the created sounds for the technology of  is astounding. Each robotic movement, machinery input, weapon and glove ability, all of it comes together to really enhance the immersion of the world no matter what current complex you're exploring.However, while  is a breath of fresh air in high-profile games where the presentation, stability and art direction are actually intact, functioning and high quality, the game still suffers from some quite drastic problems in other areas.By now, I think many players can agree that while the setting and premise of  is compelling and intriguing, the story behind it is  lacklustre and not very well told. Much of the exposition of the world is very awkward and clunky, usually boiling down to P-3 asking a question and then Charles responding with a very lengthy explanation rather than allowing us to discover these answers more organically with environmental design, other NPCs, or even just more concise logs that can't easily be missed. The story's pacing is also very poor, with long stretches of the game not pushing the narrative forward in the uninteresting open world and then suddenly dumping a ton of important details all at once to nearly be overwhelming. The story tries to keep up intrigue by throwing in curveballs of who to trust and the nature of allegiances to different people and systems, but interactions between characters in these moments feel incredibly rushed and somehow edited down to be too short with the dialogue.The dialogue itself is almost wince-inducing in multiple ways. The English voice acting itself is fine for what the script is giving the actors, but some of these lines don't even feel like they were revised in terms of placement before being recorded. The speed that words are spoken at almost come across like two unrelated takes were hurriedly stitched together in audio editing software without any natural pauses for almost every single character in the game, and some of the placement of important details (such as  ) just lose all their importance as a result.Of particular note, P-3 is a deeply unlikable protagonist, switching nearly maniacally between states of angry, brooding, caring, heroic, insulting or rude, but never settling on any one thing for more than 10 seconds. His constant need to swear in nearly every line makes him feel like he's trying too hard to be edgy and serious, as if this is what the developers think game characters should be, and this is unfortunately a problem with the rest of the cast too. It got to a point of being so obnoxious, that I experimented playing with Russian audio to match the setting, only switching back when it became clear I was reading more than taking in the details.The gameplay itself also has some massive pitfalls, mostly in the nature of the open world, the upgrade systems and the enemy difficulty. The open world feels like an afterthought. There's not much really in it except the robots roaming the world (of which the reward to fight them isn't worth the cost) and there's nothing to compel me to explore the optional areas apart from gun mods. The upgrade system itself is also way too strict and costly, to the point where I was only really using two abilities and 3 weapons at any given time because the investment to get more and experiment was just too steep combined with the cost of replenishing supplies for what I had. And even despite how you can beat the game using that little in your inventory, the enemies themselves are nothing but massive bullet sponges that move at speeds that are hard to track with the low FOV, sometimes to an unfair degree. It doesn't feel like I'm utilising the game's systems to overcome a challenge because no matter what I used, they all still took forever to die no matter the firepower. presentation and world is the main saving grace of the game and the gameplay itself when in the complexes and  the open world make it a mostly enjoyable experience. Although the story is very poorly written in both dialogue and structure, and there are some quirks to some of the systems that only get more egregious over time, the game still feels like it was a fun time because of how strong the good parts were. This is a game of very high highs and rather disappointing lows that come together in a package that is worth your time, but only when the asking price lowers a fair amount. Overall, pretty decent."

However, despite these minor issues, the game is terrific! It reminds me of a Half-Life, Doom cross over maybe that's a bad comparison, but that's just me.

First of, don't try to venture outside of the main paths (roads), or you'll likely run into a terrain bug that will get your character stuck, with now way of getting out of it except loading the last save. This kills the exploration. Then, speaking of saves, the area where you save are not safe zones and enemies can attack/clip though walls and stun lock you until you die. This means that you can litteraly brike your entire playthrough if you save at the wrong moment. Lastly, I had minibosses chase me accross multiple areas, go back out of the map and litterally spawn back on top of me a few minutes later. If you combine all of this, it just makes you wonder why you are wasting your time."

You have special abilities that are pretty standard but are implemented well. Once I got this weapon and fully upgraded it, I was pretty much on easy mode for the rest of the game. The Zvezdochka is so ♥♥♥♥ OP, I was finishing the boss fights in less than 4 mins. By far the best weapon in the game.-- Music and sound in this game is for the most part, exceptional. The gun sounds are well done and I just honestly wish they used the incredible soundtrack more often, when the beat drops on these classical Russian songs it just really fires you up.-- Graphics are very good, and the game is super optimized and runs smooth as butter. Was very surprised I could handle running this game in 4k (RTX 2070).-- Only encountered a few bugs, nothing that was too infuriating.-- Some of the enemy designs are pretty wicked, just wish they had more enemy types. The boss fights are definitely the most enjoyable fights. Cons:-- The dialogue in this game is subpar, the voice acting was alright I guess but the dialogue just ruins anything they say. Especially the main character and his glove, nonstop talking about useless stuff that I honestly never paid attention to. The worst one is the main characters signature ""phrase"". I finish the game and at the very end the only thing this guy can say is his classic catch phrase: . This guy is a Soviet military agent, why is he saying ?? Was the really the final choice?-- Story was meh. Pretty standard plot, the ""twist"" was pretty predictable and the endings left a bad taste in my mouth.-- Some of the non-combat mechanics can be funky (climbing and driving).Overall it was enjoyable. Gameplay and sound design definitely make this game. If you like Bioshock or Dishonored, you would most likely enjoy this game."

The game is difficult, the game is fun and the game has something a very few people may understand, which is... it reminds me of my own childhood that never actually happened. music from the childhood movies and comedies i watched, curiously familiar architecture that was never built, robots looking like soviet dolls, food reminding of pancakes... it is an experience of something that was never there and it feels like you were there. for some reason.

No crashes, no performance issues, max settings, 1440p and getting well over 80+ FPS.- Graphically pleasing.- Music is absolutely amazing - The pacing felt off. Too many sections where I'm walking/listening to conversation for well over 40 minutes before I was able to start fighting again.- As a ADHD enjoyer, the amount of times there would be several lines of dialog overlapping were too high. - Enemy variety gets stale around the half way point. Boss fights are easy with very few mechanics outside of dodging left or right. - Combat abilities are a bit limited. - Getting stuck on the environment a lot."

In a way feels like a game from the past, and it is a good thing.Second, considering how much of development hell this game went through it is actually shocking how good it is. Throughout the game can definitely see how some parts and mechanics of the game have changed, which does give it a bit of an disjointed feeling, where the game doesn't really know what it actually wants to be.The beginning almost feels like survival horror with stealth elements, but by midpoint of the game you can rampage like its Doom (especially with the combat soundtrack), then you have the puzzle areas (polygons), very linear story, the semi-open world, drivable car,   lock-picking mini-games, the famous 6 hour cut-scene (if you know, you know), pervert fridge etc. But in the end it does manage to hold it all together, even if the seams are showing. - it is really enjoyable, combat is great, enemies actually visibly react to your attacks and can see the damage you are doing. Only real complaint is that sometimes, especially on higher difficulties, enemies can become bullet sponges, which can get annoying and feels lazy for ""higher"" difficulty measurement. The respawning enemies were really annoying at first brought back the bad memories of Far Cry 2. But once I realised that if you shoot down enough repair drones, the enemies will stop respawning for at least 5-10 minutes it became just an inconvenience instead of massive annoyance.  - it really took me by surprise, it is much better than it has any right to be. Makes me sad that the Soundtrack DLC does not actually include all of the tracks that we hear in game. As some tracks, especially from the puzzle sections (Polygons as they are called in the game) are extremely catchy.  - While playing the game really thought the story would be the weakest point of the game, and in a way it is, but it does its job and it does it well, and towards the end of the game, even gets really interesting. Characters in the game are okay, but this is where it feels the most like the story had to change multiple times during development and because of this it just feels like some characters just get barely any time or proper explanation, which can make them quite forgettable. But what really saves the story for me, it is the lore and world building that has been done here, yes there is a lot of reading of PC terminals, but it just adds so much to this game world, which makes me wish that we see more of Atomic Heart in the future (be it Story DLCs or a sequel) .  - (EN) it is passable, the original language is better, but unfortunately subtitles bug out sometimes and since there is a lot of dialogue during combat sequences, too easy to miss out important information. Overall a really good and satisfying game. And I think that is the main point, this game is a , that does not take itself too seriously. It took a lot of ideas from other games, but all of those ideas were meshed really well and by the end made me wish for more story content."

Here's my pros and cons after nearly 80 hours.Pros:1. Polish - Man, it feels good to play a game in 2023 that releases complete and polished from the start that I don't have to wait months for it to be finished. While the game shouldn't necessarily be receiving praise for this (Since it should be the expected minimum when buying a $60 title) I think that, in today's standard, it should be recognized among all of the crap we typically get.2. The world - I haven't played many games that manage to blow me away with the beauty of their environment design, but this game really hit the nail on the head.3. Optimization - With how beautiful this game is, I was fully expecting it to torch my relatively mid level PC build. I was utterly blown away to find I can run this game on Ultra settings and still pull nearly typically 70-90fps while using a GTX 1080 and an AMD Ryzen 5 3600. Without a doubt, this is the most optimized game I think I've ever played to run such a beautiful game so smoothly. Hat's off to them for this one.4. The story - I'll talk about some of the cons of the story (without spoilers of course) in the cons section, but I still think, overall, that the story was largely interesting, had some great plot twists, and was well paced. I was more than intrigued to find out how it ended and I was more than pleased with the initial ending I played. All in all, as far as video game stories go, I'd give the story a solid 8.5/105. The crafting/progression - They have a simple, yet effective way of fathering resources that you then use to craft unique weapons, ammo, consumables, and upgrades for your character's glove abilities and weapons. Blue prints can be found for specific upgrades in sites located all around the map. These sites typically are giant spacial puzzles that get harder in difficulty as you progress through them.6. Puzzles - When I came into this game I wasn't expecting it to be a very prevalent portion of the game, and while it's not anything comparable to something like Portal, it still does have a good amount of spacial puzzles to be solved. The beginning few are just to introduce you to the concept of they work, but they do become a bit more challenging later in the game. I never felt like I wasn't able to not figure them out though. The complexity level is what I would describe as beginner friendly to intermediate.7. Combat - The gun play is smooth and feels good. Utilizing your dash to dodge incoming attacks is a must and enemies are pinged with a red pulse when they are about to do a major attack that needs to be dodged or you will be knocked to the ground. It's a big step up from the mundane combat typically found in most FPS RPGs.Cons:1. Dialogue/Story - While I largely enjoyed the story of the game, and I thought that a vast majority of the voice acting was actually superb for a game being translated from its native language, I just can't get over the translation of the main protagonist's dialogue. It can grow to be a bit tiresome and predictable over the course of the game. I'm not sure if this is due to a bad casting for the lead protagonist's English version, or if it's simply the product of translating the game from Russian to English. I can only Hear ""Crispy Critters"" or him complain about nearly everything in an impatient manner so many times. The story beats can often feel a bit forced to try and tie narrative together, using a lot of exposition to try and help make sure that the player isn't completely lost in the slightly more cerebral parts of the narrative.2. Endings (no spoilers) - There are two endings in this game depending on a final major decision you make. One of them  was superb (luckily for me the initial one I played) and was executed in a manner that truly made the game shine. The other ends the game rather abruptly, doesn't answer many question the player might have at the moment, and largely isn't rewarding in the slightest. It blows my mind how drastically different the payoff of this decision they give 10 seconds to make is. (Option #2 is good, Option #1 was disappointing). I honestly can't believe they were okay with a large portion of players selecting that first option and thinking that's all there was to the game. I don't think it's hard to imagine a player completely despising the story if that's their first and only play through of the ending of the game.3. Traveling - It's a good thing the world is beautiful, because that saves traversing the open world. Cars are frustratingly useless since there is more often than not, something blocking the path that your car will hit. THERE IS NO SPRINTING IN THIS GAME!!! I genuinely believe that this game could have benefited from a dedicated sprint action ontop of the quick dash. Luckily, most of the game is spent underground in the facilities rather than running around the open world, but still... Travelling wasn't the most engaging part of the game.4. Look but don't touch - While the game is breathtakingly beautiful, it does have a bit of a feeling that you're not allowed to interact with it in a manner that you would likely come to expect in a modern RPG. Most of the buildings spread out throughout the open world simply have the same desks/trunks/cabinets to quickly loot through and I feel like they missed a bit of an opportunity to really fill the environment with interesting things like they do with the spacial puzzles in the facilities and testing grounds.5. Repair drones - These little guys just get annoying after a while in the open world. Everything that you kill only stays dead for so long because repair drones will infinitely spawn over and over again to come and repair what you've recently killed. There are some ways to disable the spawning of them in specific areas, however it's usually more work than it's worth. It just becomes tiresome after a while.Personal Cons: These aren't a big deal, just things I found strange that I think are largely fine.1. Saving - I'm personally more of a fan of saving my game anywhere at any time like in a standard Bethesda title, however, they opted for saving checkpoints that you use in game. I found a few times while playing, I wanted to get off at that moment but had to keep playing for another 3-5 minutes to get to a save checkpoint.2. This one's not a big deal at all really, but I found myself struggling as an American to remember a lot of character names throughout the beginning of the game because Russian names are all similar sounding to me. They really do throw a lot of names at you I forgot who was who for a good portion of the game. Luckily the game really begins to hone in on a select few characters in the latter half of the narrative.Final score: 8.5/10 - Great FPS RPG"

They don't make ambitious solo shooters like this anymore.Imagine Bioshock and Wolfenstein in 1950's ""Atom-punk"" Soviet Russia, with clear inspirations and elements from Half-Life 2, Portal, Dishonored 2, and Prey. Enemy designs and environmental visuals are top notch. The game is also very optimized for how stunning it looks: 160-220fps the entire time max settings at 1440p. And to top it off, the soundtrack has Mick Gordon and Geoffrey Day behind the guitars remixing classic famous Russian songs and they're so damn good. Your arsenal consists of iconic 1950's Russian military legacy weapons that you can upgrade with retro-future sci-fi tech that makes your AKM, KS-23, and Makarov look like it came directly from the movie Elysium. Big fan of the aesthetics of mixing advanced tech with old Russian hardware. And your offhand has a glove that is an AI companion named Charles that acts as a ""Bioshock plasmid + HL2 Gravity Gun + Prey Glue Gun"" and is also used for looting containers (shop vac on steroids), throwing objects, solving physics-based puzzles, hacking, and navigating. And I have to say the ""Hedgie"" boss fight was the most visually impressive and intimidating boss fight I've experienced in years and it had no business having the hardest boss soundtrack I've heard since Doom2016. I was laughing at how good it was. My wife even sat down and watched captivated by it. The animation work and design is a spectacle. I am craving to see more of it. Also, the unique series of scientific test chamber areas that had gravity-based Portal-like puzzles and interchangeable rooms and walls like in Dishonored 2's famous Clockwork Mansion were also Chef's Kiss. I did them all and didn't want them to end.However, the game needs a FOV slider (edit: they added 80-110 FOV, and it's the good kind where the weapon viewmodel changes with it), a way to disable the HUD or make it limited/fade away, and improve the timing of the English dialogue. But I understand the game has been fully voiced in like 10 different languages so I forgive it. Overall, the game felt super polished and I'm looking forward to more content and DLC.If you're a Bioshock/Wolfenstein fan, it's a real treat and an easy must play for you. So many unapologetic cheeky callbacks to the Bioshock series, especially near the end. You'll know it when you see it/hear it.Also, NORA > The Twins."

And communication from mundfish over all this years of waiting.As a founder (early backer basically) from the first preorder window of 2018 it became a game of what diden't it go through on. And years of just nothing. and even now it's a chase over minimal aspects and even the promise of getting a key for the right platform can't be delivered either.If you have to play it then get it on gamepass at most and not pay up to 60 or 100. Luckly i only paid 60 for my early bird backer thing that's basically the full package. What a comical world to have to be early bird backer to get the full game.Well let's go in to writingThe well talked about aspect between P3 and charles is no joke just really dull and the strange catch phrase of crispy critters or the russian dub ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pies. Well if you can stand star wars movies or super hero movies then you are gonna love atomic heart. And well that ending. I just have to say this have you played bioshock 1 and infinite.. you will see things from a mile away. They basically took certain parts and just swapped it. But biggest credit i have to give is thisThe game launched in a more playable state then most AAA/AA games of today. (Not bugless though)The hand vaccum aspect is just oddly satisfying and fun to do when you need to loot places and houses fast.That you can refund ability points spent to change up is a god send but at the same time it goes between 2 abilitys that can carry you. one that's middle of the road and shield that's more useless then useful.So this is the best example of waiting for a sale and kind of dlc they will deliver on.As they already have a trackrecord when it was gathering backers that they coulden't deliver on those promises. So who knows what they will do dlc wise. They coulden't even deliver the mick gordon tracks for the soundtrack yet but they will update eventuelly. and on normal without doing these mini quests of exploring these puzzle rooms it's might be 20 at most. But i took extra time and explore things bit more. So you can call it Atomic waiting6/10 but it has moments that leans it to a 7 from time to time.First buyers beware review.

After a healthy 20 hours of gameplay, I'm done with it. My biggest problem with the game is without a doubt the detection system, where if you are spotted on a security camera in the open world, robots spawn on your position and overwhelm you. It feels like an unnecessary punishment in a game that encourages exploration and resource collection. And then, on top of that, when you kill a robot, it doesn't stay dead because a repair robot comes along and fixes it right up. So fights never feel WON. You're always running away from fights instead of winning them. And then there's the puzzles. This game is filled with far too many puzzles. Why, in a game that features traditional Skyrim-style lockpicking are there ALSO doors that have complicated locking mechanisms on them? Just pick one and stick with it. It's completely unnecessary, and makes me not want to explore entire levels because of the hassle of getting from point A to B. Finally, there's the dialogue and the story, which is so wordy (with clumsy, awkward, bad words too) and techno-babbly, it's completely unengaging. And the protagonist is just a complete jerk, all the time, everywhere. I've never liked a protagonist less. I wish he would just shut up. I really wanted to like this game. And I gave it a good run. But I'm just checked out."

I would say Fallout 4 sits at 4.4/5.0 compared to this game)Open world design: 2/5 Okay (maybe I am not into Open World games as much anymore, but it should have been more like the 3rd-5th Far Cry games)Enemy design: Great 4/5 (evokes uncanny emotions, the need to defend yourself, emerge victorious)Enemy variety: Great 4/5 (Terminator-like enemies, liquid metal terminator-like enemies ( >:) ), lawn mowers, refrigerators, vacuum-robots, Mark Zuckerberg)Enemy distribution: 2/5 okay (the game's intention to overwhelm you and make you feel small gets old pretty quickly, especially when you git gud and it doesn't work on you anymore)Stealth mechanics: 1/5 not enjoyable (you can't hide from Communism)Problem solving: Good 3/5 (would be good, like Portal 2's, if not for the too many locked doors)World building: Good 3/5 (mostly in the intro of the game)Story quality: Great 4/5 (was more interested in story than the Open World, bc of main character)Story length: 2/5 Okay (as if they were gonna make it longer but the Kremlin came to the devs and made them stop (joke)Character design: Great 3/5 (well, there are no characters, almost everybody is dead. But at least the guy you play as curses a lot and has a friend and some dead people to talk to)Things I didn't like:>Indoors, every 4th door has a bloody lock puzzle on it that probably takes up 1/6 of my game-play time when I could be kicking doors down giving the character the bad-ass scene he deserves - ruins the otherwise dynamic flow of the game. I'm only referring to door locks. There are environmental puzzles in the game that are enjoyable otherwise.>Enemy design is amazing, but for the love of russian commie god, the enemy distribution mechanics get pretty old after a while. The most I'll say without spoiling is there is a system implemented that has sends new enemies to resurrect (no, not just respawn) fallen enemies  - and the break period between your successful fights and these dudes coming back to life AND having reinforcements to get revenge on your ass is way too short. And if your Overpowered by then? It's still annoying because man oh man, there eventually makes it to where there are A LOT OF ENEMIES IN AN AREA. They will become at the very least angry roadblocks during your open world travel (sometimes they don't despawn!)More on this, this prospect of getting of getting overwhelmed by angry amazon Alexa's no matter how many of them you kill is supposed to incentivize you into 1. not lingering in one local area for too long, go explore other areas2. performing a quasi complex task of shutting down the local area's enemy ""control hub"" (the equivalent of taking out outposts in far cry 3) to free up the territory.The thing is, #2 only lasts for TEN MINUTES. Even worse, shutting down disables puzzle systems needed to unlock dungeon-like structures that contain things you might want later on (on the small chance that the BUG occurs where the area is shut down PERMANENTLY, hooray for you! [unless a dungeon you really want to get into is permanently locked, then YOU'RE F***ED])>The characters are good, but the character acting is great. During cut-scenes, the atmosphere and tone of the story worked really well with what I thought was stellar localized language voice acting and animated expression. The story itself wasn't 4-D chess, but the character acting really carried it forward. I felt like I was going places in the story, witnessing alternate history....which is why I was really angry when the game ended sooner than I expected. For such a high price tag, I really was hoping for a longer ride, but at the end of the rollercoaster, I had to go home.>They tried to implement stealth in the game, but it's virtually non existent because1. This is the USSR in the game, there are cameras everywhere and they catch you in 2 seconds so stealth is not only useless but you have to deal with destroying them constantly in the open world but that doesn't work either because2. the cameras are robots also run by Jeff Bezos of amazon and they get resurrected like everything else3. When they see you they will send even more Roomba iROBOTs to kick your ass or keep you from having a 5 minute break (Jeff Bezos HATES employee breaks)4.  You don't have silenced firearms because you can't afford it because you're Soviet and all your weapons are made out of (combat effective) toaster ovens that your grandparents used to kill Nazis in world war bazinga.If they wanted good open world stealth, they should've taken notes from Far Cry 3 and Metal Gear 5, hell maybe even Skyrim and Fallout series.Things I wish it had:>less locks on doors, even the player character complains about the jarring amount of locks on doors.>More story content and/or expansive DLC - The story itself was was alright, but I really enjoyed the character design, especially the main character (no more spoiler). The voice acting and animated acting was very compelling which is why I was sad when the game suddenly ended, I got off the rollercoaster and had to go home>More character abilities, the ability customization and design was no more sophisticated than Bioshock franchise, however Bioshock was able to implement the interactivity and situational ka-pow to special abilities a little better than this game. The biggest upside however is that you can easily refund your ability points for ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of the cost, allowing you to experiment. (knock knock, keep this in your next game mundfish)>more open world incentive, not going to talk too much on this, though I will say to any prospective players is to explore as much as you want to as early as possible before proceeding through the main story, because if you get into the main story too deep, after a certain mission open world will no longer be in the works for youI will be waiting for a sequel"

Everything else about this gorgeous game was overshadowed by his constant pissy attitude.He wasn't even negative for any reason. He's just naturally a prick. The story includes telling the player that the main character lost all of his memories prior to his recent surgery. At the beginning of the game he's a blank slate and instantly the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Why?Who made the decision to write the character this way? It makes no sense. I was wondering if all of the main character's dialog could be rewritten to be likable or sympathetic, but then there's a cutscene where he picks something up and flips it callously into someone's face. This just doesn't make any sense. People act and react to the main character like he's a normal person. They don't react like people would if a jerk was acting badly in front of them.

No stuttering, no hitching it runs perfectly, just let it build the shader cache 1st before you press play. Also, it's cool that it has an independent SSD optimisation option that you can turn on, damn it loads fast.I am going to keep it real Atomic Heart looks better than most RT games so those complaining it has no RT at launch need a reality check, who cares. When so many are giving Dead Space 2023 a 10/10 review when they don't even mention it's trash performance, random FPS drops, stuttering, hitching and that it is backed by billions, unlimited resources, it's own graphics engine department yet want to point the finger at a small indie shop for not having RT at launch. All I can say is... really dude?????Ignore any hate this is an incredible next gen BioShock game with the most insane visuals and art design that I have seen in a while and the performance is a 10/10. If you like that sort of thing this is 100% the ticket, for the FOV fix just get Flawless Widescreen it already has a profile, so we are all good to go!Update 1 : ok, I have played more.... this is incredible basically it blows any expectations I had and it is starting to feel like a Elden Ring of BioShock in the way Elden Ring blew your mind the first time you played it and the more you played.The game is massively polished, complaining about the RT or HDR makes you look like a clown or you just don't love or appreciate video games any more and that makes me depressed. This is mega high quality and super fresh. The looting like in BioShock is amazing, the game does this insane effect with a sort of force pull, the animation is sort of crazy in the game. Another thing is the sound design, man is it good and easily on the level of Dead Space 2023 which is amazing.I am sort of blown away right now, the first hour is pretty insane and there are so many art peaces and moments that like OMG! The SSD code is insanely fast, and legit optimised unlike other games. Atomic Heart is only a UE4 game and it really is a crazy show case and makes me wonder what UE5.1+ games will be like. The last batch of UE4 have been amazing this is easily right there at the very top.Gameplay feels very smooth and responsive, the melee combat feel perfect and you do have a dodge for combat. That part feels really nice, I know early vids people where concerned, don't be it's ACE.Just go try the game out for your self, I guaranteed you will love it and go OMG! This is a crazy high quality SP FPS and and it totally feels like a mega next gen BioShock which I love so very much!I need to play more, 0 regrets on a 2018 pre order before anyone cared about the game, they did an amazing job!"

The artstyle of this game is relatively coherent, while not completely so. and that is okay, since the facility is not made of one man's work. it's rather the work of multiple geniuses from multiple design bureaus and it makes sense. in contrast to the usual video game portrayal of (post)soviet settings-abandoned villages, decaying machines, rust ridden symbols-Atomic Heart's retrofuturistic style that looks straight out from Technika Molodezhi is very fresh and unique. one slightly disappointing thing is that some of the elements, namely automobiles, are anachronistic for an ingame setting of 1955, but in a world where rapid technological advancement is a thing, I can also give this a pass. I personally think it would be more appropriate to set this game in 60s or even 70s, but developers may have thought that this scale of innovation and changes were only possible in Khrushchev's era, not Brehznev's when its represented by stagnation and hiatus. some of character/weapon design is also done to appeal to modern standards (and possibly, to western audiences) and barely fits to its era. Now I'll be blunt, it's bad. probably the weakest part of this game. Protagonist unironically repeating the same idea across the game from start to end is tiresome, and a large portion of important cutscenes end in a way of either you losing your target or fading out and it gets old. now you will soon learn that he belongs in the special... forces in both ways for a reason but this Major Nachaev, P-3, is certainly not a likable person to deal with, or to play as. ever heard of 5 stages of grief? well this guy only can go through the first two stages before back to square one. but unfortunately protagonist isn't the only problem, and other characters also have similar issues like some characters turning batwhat crazy at the pettiest thing imaginable, other ones dumping every information to the player only at the end. it is simply not paced well and not planned well, it's almost as if when they took notes from the Bioshock Infinite they overdone it, and even took inspiration from the weakest elements of that game and executed it more poorly. in short: don't expect much of a story, the game prioritizes gameplay and visuals if you still haven't noticed.most of the music that's present in the game is already existing classical music or soviet pop songs, often remixed in modern taste. to talk about modern rearranged tracks, ones with the metal vibes on them, Mick's and Geoffrey's, are tastefully done, it feels great when you're listening them in combat, which is times when you'll hear them the most, some of the other synth-y ones such as Biokonstruktor/Olga Voskonyan's song seemed a bit too out of place even for a retro synth fan such as myself. all of the licensed pop songs are anachronistic, developers were aware of this and there is an ingame explanation of these 'futuristic' notes, however. though, I found it not convincing enough.Despite criticized by some people for being a pro-soviet propaganda piece, The game's promotion of the opposite idea will get more evident as the game progresses. problems that were known to be prevalent in the soviet system, such as extreme suppression of individualism, elitization of the CPSU, devaluation of human lives and false promises that were made to the working class are shown directly from ingame dialogue and computer logs and the grand concept of soviet utopia is only relevant during the first 30 or so minutes, after that everything turns to hell and the filth that was hidden under the pretty facade will begin to make its appearance.There were bugs regarding achievements, but they are mostly fixed, mostly. still you'll need to reload your save once or twice in some instances to trigger the cheevos. and if you spam your rushing ability on some tilted surfaces you might find yourself stuck with no way to un-stuck yourself, and there were bugs of world map not displaying due to me still being indoors even though I was already outside, which I solved with save reloading. I experienced 4 crashes(Yes, I counted, throughout the playthrough of approx. thirty hours). when using an english voiceover with russian subtitles, some of them are not synced right and couple of dialogues are impossible to read because they disappear too fast or sometimes don't appear at all. some of the log files remain untranslated and are still in Russian. some animations will be in noticeably lower framerate when playing at a high refresh rate(120Hz/144Hz).Some sections can not be visited again, if you're a completionist then search for every collectible in the area before you progress.Do not scrap the early weapons (Axe/KS-23) and let them rest in your storage if you feel like don't need them, there are reports of early weapons' blueprints not spawning at all even in the late game.While automatic checkpoints are a thing, you shouldn't rely on them since they don't happen that frequently especially when you're doing some side objectives such as the training facilities, save often.Some of the english subtitles favor the Ukrainian spellings over Russian ones, for example 'chicken Kiyv'. I suspect devs, or translators, CTRL+F'd at the last minute and changed some words given the incorrect capitalization.Some of the images shown in the game seems to be generated using the AI image generation tech, I believe this is one of the first instances of the tech directly used in video game development.Despite its weaknesses, this game plays well and runs well, and I definitely had my fun. and considering its Mundfish's first game, and its troubled development history, it's a miracle that this game turned out to be this good. there are four additional DLCs planned in the future, but from the sounds of it they'll be just another minor map expansion with few extra enemies and weapons, consider this game pretty much completed. expect a 20-something hours long experience.8.5/10."

There are roughly about 8 or so enemies you fight a lot of, with a few unique ones scatted here and there for bosses or minibosses. Its pretty standard of attack/shoot and then dodge the enemy's attack. Its a neat idea, although can get pretty jank when the terrain gets involves. Its a little rough to get used to but after a while its pretty easy to learn.Gameplay is basically following quest objectives as you go. Enemies body block you and push you into corners and keep you stuck which is super frustrating. Bosses are pretty fun to fight, although some of them move  too fast. The flying repair bots are super annoying with how many there are. They keep coming until their supply is gone and you can't disable their dispenser even when prompted with you ability to do so, so you have to babysit the bots you killed for 5+ min to make sure the repair bots don't just revive them. (Imo they need a way to disable the way the bots dispense or change how they can respawn enemies.) There are also  enemies that can spread and keep making more enemies ala  that are frustratingly strong and annoying to kill before they can make any more.Story is basic and uninspired. They lore dump you every other area and spoonfeed story elements in case you are a simpleton and can't follow causality to an action. Overall it's incredibly predictable and flat, and the lack of cutscenes that flow coherently just drags it down.Dialog is hilariously bad. The writing and the voice acting is atrocious. The character says his ' catchphrase in every scene it feels like he's trying to advertise a cookie brand or something. The delivery on well over half the lines is disjointed and sloppy and it feels like the VA had no direction or context to the situation so it just comes off as bored and uninterested.Weapons and powers are fun to use, although they feel very underpowered when un-upgraded. It seems to take a few upgrades to make a weapon viable. I ended up using the starting Axe most of the time as one upgraded with the heavy charge attack, it would kill most bots in 1-2 hits, and whittle down bosses fairly quickly. Performance is actually pretty good for me. I played on High and got a consistent 100+ FPS the whole game with a 2080TI.  There seems to be a bug or wonky design choice where characters will talk before they're supposed to, so they interrupt who they're talking to or just talk over them. Not sure if this is a residual part of translation but its pretty jarring.Overall its an alright game. Its pretty pricey right now so I suggest waiting for a sale to get the money's worth. It didn't live up to the hope I had for it but it wasn't the worst game I've played. A NG+ playthrough could be fun if they added it.-Gameplay 7/10Soundtrack 7/10Sound Design 5/10Story 4/10Dialog 2/10UI 8/10Performance 10/10-Overall I'd give it a 7/10 Its fairly average all around. A lot of talent and heart went into it and it shows, although its missing that spark that makes a game fun.Hope I never have to hear Crispy Critters again."

Between happiness, for finally having finished the game and laughter for the way in which his story effectively culminated. The first contact you have is undoubtedly impactful, the clash between a vintage aesthetic and a futuristic world full of robotic carcasses, mixed with vibrant colors and surprisingly strong situations is fascinating, to say the least.Atomic Hearts takes inspiration from other titles like Bioshock, Fallout, or even Wolfenstein and mixes moments where even the world of Super Mario is present? Yes, it is definitely strange. The story begins after the Second World War, when the forces of the Soviet Union were victorious, and with that power, they developed a very advanced robotic technology, which consists of the concept of controlling a robot with the human mind, in order to control the entire world. However, something did not go as expected and the plan went down the drain. It turns out that all the robots created so far began to indiscriminately attack all the humans they found along the way. The player will enter the troubled mind of P-3, an elite soldier tasked with investigating the mysterious cause of this robotic problem.Equipped with an arsenal of creative weapons, P-3 thus holds the fate of humanity in its hands. I confess that my favorite weapons were the Zvezdochka Axe and the Electro pistol, which shoots a kind of electric shots, without the need to use bullets, since it uses energy. The player will also have a glove that is much more than just a decorative element. The glove holds powers, such as magnetic fields that raise enemies, the possibility of creating a shield around you, among others. Without wanting to reveal too much, the glove plays a tremendously important role in the outcome of the story, since in addition to everything I mentioned earlier, it also features its own artificial intelligence and it is with which P-3 will have most of the interactions. Another important mechanic is the possibility that the glove has, when scanning enemies, to present the strengths and weaknesses of each one, thus allowing the player to have a different approach at each moment of action.Although all the weapons have a retro look, their animations are quite catchy and mixed with P-3’s agility and his quick dodges with the simple press of a button, it gives the player a superhero aura. Still, nothing that has not already been seen in other titles.Although the gameplay is one of the main features of this adventure, it can become repetitive and tremendously frustrating. There are times when the character gets trapped between enemies and a wall or an element on the floor, and the premise of having small robots that are always reviving other downed robots over and over again, makes the exploration aspect a somewhat complicated task. There are ways around the situation, such as applying an electrical discharge to the spawners of this specific enemy or waiting for the spawner to effectively stop producing them. The problem is that each spawner scattered across the map can send the robot even over great distances. In this sense, it is not only important to keep an eye on what is happening on the ground, but also to destroy these flying enemies.I confess that I didn’t explore the map more precisely for this reason, which did not allow me to acquire all the available weapons throughout the 17 hours of gameplay. To produce each weapon, apart from the initials, it is necessary to find a blueprint. Later it is possible to assemble, if you have all the necessary elements, in a machine. Regarding upgrades, I felt that putting points on the character was the right option since each weapon upgrade did not present a significant change compared to the other option.The confrontation against Bosses are quite satisfying and sometimes even complicated. The important thing will be to learn the attack pattern and wait for the right moments. Despite my need to replay some combat, there were no behavior changes for movement patterns or random attacks.Unfortunately, the way the dialogue plays out is pretty weak. The way the character interacts with everything around him, the constant repetition of phrases when something bad happens, leaves much to be desired. Even the machine where it’s possible to upgrade the arsenal, named Nora, is a very different machine. It presents itself as a very “excited” machine with a carnal desire, for lack of a better term. At first, it was fun, I even managed to let out a laugh or two, but over time, it becomes an old joke. To make things even more difficult, the presence of elements against Ukraine, records that compare the population of Ukraine to pigs, among others, is at least deplorable…Atomic Heart isn’t necessarily a bad title. It’s as full of positive things as it is of bad things. Combat is fun but becomes frustrating, as are the platforming sections, and so is its entire narrative. The end result for me was a mixed bag of experiences that I still haven’t been able to discern. Even so, it is important to mention that this is the first title from this studio."

Although it wasn't until I saw that the Ukrainian government was calling for it to be banned off digital storefronts that I made up my mind to buy it upon release rather than wait for it to be discounted in a Steam sale. And now after putting a couple hours into it I can safely say that I made the right decision. It's been a  time since I've played a game that is as well optimized as this, let alone one that released on day 1 that way. It's quite refreshing, honestly. The English voice acting on the other hand is quite atrocious... but that turned out to be a blessing in disguise because once I switched the dialogue language under the audio settings to Russian the game instantly became a lot more immersive than it would have been if I had persisted & experienced a Soviet world where everybody spoke English."

You get a lot of ammo, but not unlimited.-Enemies are bullet sponges. even when combining abilities to make enemies more vulnerable they still eat a lot of ammo from most firearms.-Old fashioned save system can cause large amounts of lost progress.

I finished the story with no closure at all, and dull ""oh that's the twist"" turn-about.  The combat is boring and glitches are extensive....and forget about choices.

Heck the dialogue script wasn't a gem and it was just TOO much.Lastly, the soundtrack along with really cool combat moment would have made it feel like a DOOM clone and probably a really good at it, but there wasn't any cool combat moments except for maybe one or two and for which you need to explore one of almost half a dozen Testing Ground (dungeons) which you need to do to unlock weapon parts. These dungeons are made of puzzle time moments and weren't that much complicated but just almost not worth it because of how boring they felt (except for the one or two).TL;DRPros- Character progression (skills/weapons) although not that great.- Some sort of Open world concept where you could drive car (just the 1 model) for traversing.- Cool soundtrack just not rightly timed.- Weapons were decent but could have been better.- Looting method felt really cool the first couple of hours but then just felt kind of a hassle.- Some abilities were cool (actually just Mass Telekinesis).- Story itself was decent.- Cool map overall and concept- Good optimization and stable fps.- Graphics were good overallCons- Miss timed dialogue and story telling.- Voice acting (optimistically) was not horrible but really lacking of situational awareness.- Worst QTEs keybinds.- Puzzles although somewhat easy, weren't fun.- Visual bugs and sometimes crashing didn't help.- You can get stuck easily and cannot escape forcing you to restart on last save.- Most, like 95%, of the combat scenes were really mind numbing.5/10 Just not fun enough."

I've seen game coming from 3A companies that doesn't even work half as good as this, so props to them.(General Conclusion at the bottom)A ""few"" Side notes:Combat:Combat is a lil bit wonky at times, and becomes very stale and samey after a while, its fun enough at the start, as your trying to learn and stuff. but nothing new is really added later on:if you get ganged up upon by a handful of enemies, or if a powerful enemy gets you into a corner, you might as well just reload a save, as you are dead at that point. which i cant say is ""bad game design"" but def not an optimal one.Weapons:as stated above the weapons gets stale after a while, as there aint a ""great"" quantity of weapons to choose from, and most are OK to good at most stuff, but nothing amazing. most require a lot of resources to compete with the others, which i can understand from a RPG perspective, but the amount of resources needed is a bit over the top from what you acquire from playing the game. i see my self as a loot-goblin and tend to search every nook and cranny for loot (which is y it took me nearly 25 hours to complete the game).Story:The story is relatively well written, with a few hick-ups here and there, but that's to be expected. the dialogue is a bit... dry to say at best, some stuff ain't really explained properly most of the time and doesn't give the fulfilment of completing somethingSPOILERS AHEAD:the game has two endings, one ""good/joke"" and one ""bad/main"", both come as a prompt out of nowhere and if your too slow it just picks for you, so be ready. now im not happy about the endings at all, and one makes sense which is the ""Bad/Main"" ending, that one fits in to the narrative and suites the games play-style as well as general lore and feel. the second one is.... as i stated a ""joke"" or at least that's how i see it, as it doesn't fit in at all, and just leaves you looking at your screen in disbelief and wondering where the F*** did that come from. Now i wont divulge the content of the Endings, as that's a bit too much of a spoiler in my opinion. END OF SPOILERMechanics:Mechanics wise the game is well balanced in good and bad decisions. as some work really well and others leave you questioning why it even gave you the option in the first place.in the game your given a power-set not too dissimilar from the Bioshock series, which i think was the point. these work rather well, and give off some funny if not sometimes stupid solutions to some fights or puzzles. the melee mechanics leave a bit to be desired, as it only leads you down one path, as its the only one that works properly at the moment. which is ""power attack"" or ""heavy swing"", which is just as the name implies. I've tried most of the melee weapons except for the ""Snowball"", and most have a pretty even playing field, some have good Speed but low attack and vice versa. but that's sadly all there is too it. as the melee selection is rather small there ain't much.The gun mechanics work much like other games, you aim at something, you shoot a few times, and it dies.Upgrades:You can upgrade both your melee weapons, Guns as well as yourself (that both implying to abilities and general HP and the likes). the upgrades for Guns and Melee are much the same, upgrade damage, Heavy damage, speed, Heavy speed as well as some capsule upgrades allowing you to infuse your current attacks with attributes like fire, ice, electric etc.in terms of Self upgrades, there exists a larger variety than the weapons. you can upgrade your own abilities to match your play-style to a degree. there are the general HP, armour as well as some minor ones like ""laser immunity"" or ""more dodge charges"", your abilities also gets a few upgrades, but ill talk about that in the ""Ability"" section.Abilities:Your given a few choices of abilities, like Low grade telekinesis that lifts enemies allowing you to shoot them unimpeded which with an upgrade crushes them and flings them to the ground, a Frost ray that freezes an enemy in place, allowing you to get that ""perfect"" headshot you always wanted, as well as stuff like Chemical goop that takes on the property of the element you shoot at it, electrify it to stun any enemy stepping into it, freeze it to make enemies slowed down or hit it with some fire to make it burn enemies instead. I've tired most of the abilities, and I've got to say, most are pretty fun. but in the end, all i used was the Frost ray as well as the standard ""Shock"".all abilities can be upgraded with stuff like more damage, wider range, longer duration, lower energy cost and the likes.Map and ascetics:In my opinion the game looks quite pretty, with good graphics, that doesn't ""completely"" tank my PC. the enemies are well designed with attention to detail (in most areas, a few areas on some enemies have no textures, as in its see-though). there are cars in the game, but only 1 red car is actually drive-able, which is a little sad, but not a massive downside, as the map isn't that big, and most of your time is spent in what i call ""dungeons"". the Map layout also makes good sense and leads you in a straight path to follow if your only interested in the story.Enemies:we've got robots in all shapes and sizes, but i don't think and/or feel like there is enough of them in terms of variety. 3 of the main bots in the game is just a repainted, slightly buffed version of one another, but with the same general fighting scheme. the Bosses good and display enough difference to make them challenging, but not enough to make them impossible. However, in my opinion its not a good idea to put the same ""unique"" boss in separate areas with different stats. i enjoyed the bosses i had to think about before fighting, but adding another that's WEAKER than the previous makes it feel like a bore. a good example is the one nicknamed ""Ivy"", after your first boss battle with it(?), you practically find around 3-4 of them in each ""dungeon"" and one is difficult enough with random QTEs and an odd hitbox on top. (there is a bridge where 3-4 of these spawn in rather close proximity, making it VERY hard to pass, unless you lower the difficulty, i just ran past them and prayed for my life)General Conclusion:Question: can i recommend people to buy it?i have two answers, a long and a short one.Short: no, i don't see this game as being worth the money i spent on it.Long: I cant with the right consciousness recommend the game thus far, as there just isn't enough in the game to warrant the 59.99 Euro price tag, i could probably complete the game in less than 3-4 hours if i skipped all the menial stuff and just went for the story (which some people do mind you). as i said, i only took around 25 hours to complete it, while also going around the map and exploring. if the games 4 Upcoming DLCs add enough stuff, or if they update the game with enough content, i might change my review, but as it stands now i cannot recommend spending 59.99 Euro on this game, if your looking for a game like this you can buy ""Biochock: The collection"" for the same price, and get more than 5x the amount of playtime this offers (at time of writing), its also worth a note, that Bioshock VERY often goes on sale its a good buy if you like these kinds of games (just a little recommendation from me :) )You are free to ask in the Comments about stuff if your curious (Though i dont think ill be answering them if you ask a Year from now, as the game might have changed by then)"

Can't do both because ♥♥♥♥ that's why.- at the release day there was (and still isn't) change the size of the conversation fonts- no RTX at launch- - before creating a new weapon you can't compare it with an existing one.- in the inventory you have to put stuff into your global inventory in order to disassemble them.(For those who say ""the dev team is not big enough"" I say these problems could have been solved by experienced game designers.

The game looks gorgeous and runs pretty good on my Lenovo Legion 5 (RTX 2060) too, the right settings can get rid of hiccups and provide a smooth experience. I had no game breaking experience so far, at all. The visuals in this game are breathtaking and are a huge reason why I find this so fun, the gameplay works pretty well, I can enjoy it as a person who got here from games like Deathloop and Dishonored. At moments there can be a steep learning curve (my experience was with medium), but so far not too frustrating. The miniboss fights pull me straight into Doom with their soundtrack, though the game still stands well on its own and doesn't really scream Bethesda imitation, which I appreciate.I just want to say that I'll be playing this a second time later on, but with Russian audio. Maybe this won't be a popular opinion but I would have preferred Russian accents in English to American ones, for better immersion. Though I personally don't find the voices that annoying as some other people do. Character writing is probably the weakest suit of this game, but given that this is Mundfish's first game and the team seems to be pretty small, I can see some improvement in this department in the future. I really want to like the protagonist, it's already a daring endeavor to not write another silent type, which I honestly expected Major Nechaev to be before the game released. The chemistry between him and the glove can be pretty entertaining at times, even though we've probably seen it before. I would classify Atomic Heart as a good game, and I do not regret breaking my many years streak of never preordering games."

The open world aspect seems forced, there's a whole lot to like, but there's a distance to go between those things and it just feels like the majority of the time i'm trying to get to the next place to advance the story or get an upgrade and there's just no interest for me between that game-play loop, or the gameplay itself....I want to say straight out it isn't a bad game in any aspect, there actually is a lot of redeeming qualities it has, i waited with anticipation for it since it was first announced. Its just the gap in between the meaningful parts of the game that has put me off of it, for example, go from A, to B slug it out with the same bots, fight them the same way then collect an item with no story telling value unless its a part of the main quest. I struggled to enjoy the game after i got to the free roam section of the map as it feels like there is too great a pause between the meaningful events in the game and everything is just a collect fest where you just get items too upgrade, but even that felt like a chore. I really, really wanted to like this game, but the 80 bucks i spent i could have brought multiple other games and had more fun, in fact i haven't actually ""wanted"" to play this game again since i last played it which was about a week from ago from this post.This review isn't me just having a ♥♥♥♥♥ as much as it is me telling other people that if you expected this game to be a bio shock/ metro/ stalker hybrid, you'd be very dissatisfied as its no where near those games,Its basically Russian far cry"

At this point the non-existent FoV slider is a crime, and makes the otherwise pretty fun combat truly awful. Also, quick-dodging mechanics in a 1st person with low FoV = ridiculous.- Another infuriating offender is slowing down movement when you strafe, which you need to do to look around because you're locked into the low FoV. And running itself is already slow, so what the f...?- This game also has a pretty bad controller layout by the way.Now in combination with those fun-gameplay-limiting factors and the story, When I entered the open world, I found myself rushing to every main objective because dealing with enemies or areas isn't enjoyable. And 90% of the story so far has been: door is locked, go get the door engine opener, oh no the door engine opener has short circuited go get the canister of oil juice in the break room, oh no the break room is infested by anti-fun objectives...And yea I know its supposed to be part puzzle game, but the puzzles itself are almost always very simple, boring, long for no reason or copy paste, and the way the story blends into them is just kinda lame.TL:DR, in my opinion not worth full price, needs some very important but basic patches, and would love to try to enjoy this game again."

The less you know about it the better, although you should be aware of its pitfalls before buying it. So here's your run-of-the-mill pros and cons list for your pleasure (based on my time with the New Zealand Game Pass): Enemies react to your hits. This has been one of the biggest highlights for me ever since the first gameplay snippet was released. The atmosphere and art direction are amazing. Gunplay is good, although the first guns are a tad bit iffy (lack ""oomph!""). Combat is very reaction-heavy. JuSt LiKe DaRk SoULs (no but seriously it do be like that on higher difficulties). Got a kickass soundtrack by Mick Gordon. You can vault over obstacles. Not much of a plus but it took me a while to figure out so thought I'd mention it. It's got some hysterical dialogue once in a while. The dialogue also becomes stale and annoying at times. It's a 60% bad, 40% good scenario. Either the MC and the glove are being dumb and annoying or hilarious. It's not on a Forspoken level but still enough to make it a negative. X-Ray wallhacks. For loot and puzzles it's fine, just not for enemies as it ruins the whole surprise element. Use with caution. No FOV slider. The FOV is too low for my comfort. Some of the abilities lack a bit of ""oomph!"". A lot of the objects such as bottles can't be destroyed. Important dialogue between the MC and the glove can get cut off if you trigger another dialogue. The game has some crude jokes, e.g. a n@zi joke and the above-mentioned sex fridge. It's not gonna resonate with everyone, but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be. I personally find it hilarious. You'll either love it or hate it, which is reflected in the mixed reviews online. Some enjoy it a lot, others don't. If you're still unsure, watch the reviews by Worth A Buy, ACG, Gman, Skill Up, The Escapist, and GamingBolt to get a better idea of how the game is. You'll see a lot of different opinions.Have fun! :)"

After finishing it, you might be left with a few moments to remember, but nothing worth replaying.The plot is grossly simple, and relied on a very predictable plot twist for surprise and engagement. It was to the point of wondering where the story was actually going while playing, since the characters seemed to be led along by just whoever was speaking at the moment.I had to play with Russian dialogue to make it bearable, although the Russian voice actors did a pretty good job.The combat gets repetitive quick, and there are a few mechanics that are never properly explained and require experimentation to understand despite not being necessary or significantly helpful to advance through the enemies.The guided ""open"" world either acted like eye candy for the background or an obstacle in actually continuing the story.There's also a strange focus on sexual themes in the game that are never really explored past their surface level. It borders on just being eye candy for coomers, I personally didn't really care for it.Regarding the plot, it's distinctively anti-Soviet, as it uses the dialogue and overall plot to explicitly show the downsides of the USSR and its regimes. Although this does clear the air about the game being a Russian propaganda piece, there were a couple moments where the dialogue was so focused on being anti-Soviet that it completely shifted the focus away from the conversation itself and made some sentences stick out like a sore thumb from the conversation.In summary, I wouldn't recommend buying this anywhere near its full price. I feel it would be more appropriate at $20 or $30."

I've been hyping up this game for a long time now, and when I saw there were reviews saying the game was disappointing and plaint bad, I just got scared. Then there were the good reviews which still gave me hope for the product I was purchasing. Let me tell you this, I am almost 5 hours into the game and it is pretty amazing! I love it, and the fighting mechanics are great. Besides that the exploration, powers, sub systems within the game's mechanics, art direction and music, everything is just incredible, you're in for a treat!. If I have to point out a few not-so-polished things of the game, these would be that in some moments the audio from the cutscenes lacks a bit of energy or it doesn't sound as big and punchy as you might be anticipating. I think is the mixing, but maybe they can patch it. This, however, is not very prominent and actually really bad, I'm just nitpicking for the sake of doing it. It won't throw you off the game's world and ambience, it's just that I would've wished it was a bit better executed. The only other thing that I found to not be very good is that sometimes if an enemy corners you on anything, like a shelf or a desk or a wall, you might get stuck and unable to move, so you're basically dead. Yes, I know many will say that being this a shooter and melee based combat game that is pretty bad and concerning, but trust me, it really doesn't happen often, at least not to me, the devs can actually patch it, and finally, I don't think this is enough reason to actually draw from the awesomeness of this game and it's beautiful world. I think I am right to predict that this game will become a modern cult classic and a masterpiece of the genre. Please give this game an opportunity, not many games come out so original and well crafted like this one nowadays, so I fell that we should support the devs."

The game has its pluses, but there are enough minuses, unfortunately for me the latter outweigh Pros: - Well recreated the atmosphere of the USSR, you can see that the development team thought about every detail.- Nice graphicsCons:- The main minus is that the game is very boring. ""Run here, run there, and so 30 hours in a row. The story has absolutely no hooks. I got through the game at 50 percent, and when I was told that I had to run around a huge center again in search of some parts, some robot, I just spit and forget it. - Very annoying constant puzzles, I like to rack my brains. but ♥♥♥♥, not every two minutes!- The music is cool, but it comes on randomly, you don't get epic battles with a cool sound, it starts playing suddenly when you're just walking down the corridors."

The only downside is how the water is barebones it never reacts to your movement.Optimization: 4/5 - It is surprisingly optimized despite their first game but the issues come as soon as you stutter and lag I think it has to do with switching tabs etc.Gameplay: 3/5 - Gameplay is there, it's serviceable but it is also basic and nothing special you would not get any kind of combat similar to games with good combat from Platinum's but it is okay. Challenge is non existent you can play on Armageddon, tediously explore and find almost the same area and that is all you can just complete the game with little use of your weapons (likely melee is your best option if upgraded).Story: 2/5 - Story is not the strongest point on this game, there is no choices that affect the ending and not much to talk about other.Replayability: 2/5 - All achievements, the way the world is presented and a lot of content are there. There is only dungeons you can do (8 of them), linear parts of chapters in story so you can only move forward and follow objectives.Variety: 2/5 - The game lacks what the old game had (Hammer, revolver, few enemies shown since 2017), they are cut but no hope for DLC until they reveal it but otherwise you get only 12 weapons, not a lot of enemy variety other than basics such as mutant (poison, fire, regular).Verdict: Average- Because while the game is likely completed, however the contents from the 2017 version being cut, the god awful story and an average combat that would not take a challenge to learn. However, I would prefer a sale on this game or a discount if you can. There seems to be controversy not from the censored Soviet clip but those are kinds of people who never owned this game or at least not being civil about this game but overall the game is fun. Almost a shame but then again I had anticipated for this since 2017.I would likely give this game a mixed verdict but Steam lacks that feature so I will imagine this as it is.Pros:Art style is superbFirst game from this studio that is almost better than soulless triple a games in the WestFun to playMid:Combat is not the strongestCons:Story is all over the placeAchievements bugStutteringCrashesBy the way this game uses Denuvo"

The game totally reminds you of bioshock, prey and dishonored. It's fun in combat, let's you explore the world and has puzzles that are not too hard but make you think a bit. The weaponry is fun and can be combined in cool ways with your powers if you upgrade your powers enough.The Leveldesign is really well done and provides enough variety to keep you exploring while good soundtracks are playing when you are in heavy combat or exploring an area. This goes from heavy metal, over funky russian 60s pop music to classical opera. Texturequality is top notch and the game looks beautifully. Requirements for the game are not problematic and the game should run on pretty much everything and still look good. Very optimized. I had no issues and bugs. On 4K and max details I had rarely 9 GB VRAM utilized. Missing:- A real fullscreenmode. You can only switch to resolutions higher than your screen (4k in my case) by changing resolution in windows desktop, because the game uses a borderless windowmode, although its called fullscreen ingame. - FSR2. The game only offers DLSS, even including Framegeneration, but only FSR1. Since I played on an AMD RX6900XT, I disabled FSR altogether and played on native 3840x2160. Every setting was on max and I had 95% of the gametime solid 60 fps where I lock my fps anyway. If the FPS went lower in some areas for unknown reasons, which was mostly some few rooms in buildings outside and on the surface, it went to 45 fps for short wile. But those where rare moments and you barely notice them if you have ""Antilag"" enabled in the driver. I did not like: - Glove and Char starting to talk about something storyrelevant when you reach a certain location in a level, which I can't skip.

Overall I am enjoying the game, but there are things that need to be addressed to make it... playable. My chief complaints at this time (with consideration to the game having been freshly released and pre-patches):1)  Map seems to decide to work/not work selectively after going indoors. Exiting the game and booting it up again seems to resolve the issue but is only a temporary fix. 2) Platforming/Parkour seemed to be an afterthought. It is clunky at best when it does work, but unfortunately is bugged out in several sections at its worst.  Seems to be selective; worked fine in  but does not work in some other silly areas like hopping cars/fences, climbing roofs, etc.  3) Achievements are bugged (I've certainly spoken to more than 10/46 dead people towards the Necromancer achievement, and though I have completed 6/8 of the Secret Training Grounds, I am showing that I have only discovered 3/8 of them, etc.). 4) Puzzle-solving is pretty pedestrian, though the game seems to take a tongue-in-cheek approach to this so that may be deliberate (shaped blocks/shaped holes puzzles, etc). 5) SHOK/Freeze/Telekinesis/etc. pays homage to BIoshock's plasmids and the like, but just seems lacking (being able to reallocate skill points between the different Charles abilities without penalty is an appreciated touch though). 6) Combat is nothing noteworthy. Easy-to-learn attack patterns, vulnerability/resistance system, etc. 7) Weapon creation/upgrading is a bit grindy but nothing outrageous.Most of these can easily be forgiven for what the game is but the map thing really needs to be addressed, the platforming should be revamped to be properly functional, and if you are going to include achievements that require tracking a number of kills, locations discovered, etc. that they should work properly. I will gladly recommend the game to others if I see these resolved."

I saw certain mechanics and sensations from games and franchises that I really like, such as Far Cry, Dying Light, Bioshock, and even some Valve games like Half Life and Portal. In short, it seemed like a game made by someone who truly loves games. But the final experience was a bit disappointing. Here are some points about it:The atmospheric construction of Atomic Heart is very good, the world is beautiful, and it arouses curiosity, but there are few mechanics to interact with it, which gives a sense of unfinished business. In addition, the map is limited, generating some almost semi-open areas, which also causes some frustration.The combat in Atomic Heart is challenging, but it can become frustrating since it takes a long time to get sufficiently good weapons to face enemies in a satisfying way. The combat music, which is a highlight of the game, only plays in advanced moments, which is also a bit disappointing. To enjoy a more dynamic and rewarding combat experience, a significant time investment in the game is required.The weapon improvement mechanic is well done but demands a great deal of effort and game time. If it were a little easier to obtain the necessary components, it would be better appreciated. On the other hand, the skill mechanic is interesting, but I think it could be less limited by allowing the use of more skills at the same time to make the combat less challenging.The story of Atomic Heart is interesting, but not particularly genius. The dialogues, especially between the protagonist and the glove, are very poor and forced, making everything overly simplified for the player. Additionally, some dialogues between them in the map do not take into account the progression of the story.The puzzle parts with electromagnets are somewhat boring, even though I generally like puzzle games, this one did not live up to my expectations.Despite this, the game seems to be well optimized, even on the first day of release. However, the ray tracing is not well utilized.In summary, Atomic Heart had a lot of potential, but it may have needed a few more years of development and polishing. It is not a bad experience, but it fell short of the expectations created by the trailers. I would rate it a 7/10."

Особенно на волнах. Потратишь больше ресурсов чем получишь. Там, где нет поселений - в открытом мире нет вообще ничего. И это печально. Осознав это, я просто пробегал его между точками, ничего не исследуя.- Управление транспортом. К нему надо привыкнуть. Мне оно показалось немного деревянным.- Баги с достижениями. Не все работает корректно. Иногда они не засчитывались.Ну и были еще мелкие недоработки, думаю поправят патчами  Игра - очень хорошая. Я буду ждать DLC, буду в числе первых, кто купит предзаказ сиквела (если он будет)Игру делали с любовь и душой. Да, есть недочеты, есть ошибки, но они были и есть у всех. Но очень немногие студии вкладывают любовь и душу в разработку AAA-игр. Потому я не капли не жалею ни денег потраченных на нее, ни времени. И обязательно вернусь в этот мир - позже."

That's not to say it's a bad game, I enjoyed playing it even if the most fun I had was when I stopped taking it seriously.  Visually, stylistically, I loved it; the style is what got me interested in the game to begin with.  Mechanically, I don't have many complaints.  The combat was fun and the movement never really got boring—save for the climbing sections.  I got tired of the looting almost immediately, however.  Every weapon upgrade requires loot, either from killing enemies or looting boxes and drawers and cabinets and desks, and while the process is simple, it feels like I spent a third of my time staring at desks.  The plot is where all of my complaints really come from.  It feels like the plot doesn't start until halfway through the game, so it feels rushed and not very well put together.  The plot isn't BAD, really, I actually found myself interested somewhere between the disappointment of the game's beginning and the disappointment of the game's end, but it isn't a sound narrative.  It often felt like I was missing details, or that the player character had LESS knowledge of the world than I did, which most times was followed up by the game outright TELLING you what the plot was doing.  Take all that and add an ending that had little to no reasonable, logical buildup or foreshadowing and what you get is a disappointing conclusion that doesn't feel good.  There is no way to finish the game in a way that feels like a good, fitting conclusion to the game. Tl;dr  The beginning and end of the game are disappointing, and the plot feels like an afterthought, but it is a visually interesting game.  If you want hot robots and enjoyable combat, it's a decent enough game for that, but if you want an interesting story, I wouldn't spend the money.  Watch someone play it on youtube or something."

I ended up playing to the end, and during that time I went from being bored, to having fun, to feeling like I was finally getting in to the game, only to be crushed in what I can only describe as one of the most disappointing endings I have seen in a game in a long time.To start with, the combat is only mediocre.  The weapon selection is decent and nothing ever really becomes outdated, but the limited enemy variety means that combat becomes stale at times.  The powers range from feeling pointless to feeling overpowered, but often require a lot of upgrading before they even are worth using.  At the beginning of the game, ammo is very limited and you don't have access to decent powers, so combat can be stressful as you try to conserve ammo while still avoiding damage.  By the end, when resources are more plentiful, waves of enemies come at you and are bullet soaks, so it really becomes a question of how quickly you can burn the enemies down while dodging their attacks, and yet, the combat still doesn't feel as fun as some other modern shooters.The story goes from being boring to being outright ridiculous.  I feel as if the writers felt they were being clever in their story telling and that they wanted the end to be this big, exciting revelation, but everything through the story came across as convoluted and the ending just seemed to distill an overly complex situation into simplicity.  I really was rather apathetic about the whole thing.In the end, I enjoyed large chunks of the game, but the lackluster combat and convoluted storytelling just left me blase about the whole situation.  I've chose not to recommend mostly because I don't care enough about the game play or story to want a sequel and I feel that other people should spend their money on a game that is actually satisfying."

Its combat has a great feel to it. For me, melee weapons feel heavy as i like that. the stealth seems to be there but i have not been in a place yet where it is heavenly used or needs to be used. it has skills and abilities you can unlock and you can pretty much choose how you want to unlock them. other than some mandatory skills but it cost you nothing to unlock those.crafting is the same as you progress you collect resources you can use to make some new unlockable weapons or upgrade the ones you already have something i like in games. So far what i have played it is fun and i’m not even anywhere near the start-up of the game like i still feel like i learn new things that you can do.But as i say with most games it's best to play them yourself. I do recommend this game though."

I know a lot of people have issues with the subject matter and comparisons to bioshock, but that's really missing the whole point. Some people have an issue with the robot's hairstyle. If you're one of these people, I can't help you. I'm not sure anyone can.Coming back to the game, I really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I got to experience this. However, if you're not either from the former soviet union or for some reason have a great interest in soviet history, I'm not sure you'll appreciate it the same way. There are A LOT of cultural references, and if you didn't grow up with at least communist parents, I'm not sure you'd ""get it.""And that's important because as much as I enjoyed playing this game, the gameplay per se is not stellar. The enemies are dumb, even for robots. The infinitely respawning enemies can be annoying (though useful for resource farming). The stealth mechanics are nonexistant, but the game throws in a backstab function anyway. The parkour is messy at times (but still rewarding to figure out). The portal-like puzzle sections are all kind of the same.The combat, when it gets down and dirty, is a lot of fun. The chaos, elemental weaknesses, different weapon types, upgrades--it all works well together. The audio work is fantastic. The map and enemies/graphics are flawless. The story? Do you really care? If you do, then actually the story is pretty good. The controls are a bit strange--but once I got used to it it was fine. Coming back to the bioshock comparison--this isn't bioshock. Rather the game it reminds me the most of is Prey (from Arkane, the studio that made Dishonored). There are a lot of similarities, if you've played that before you'll see them. But ultimately, Prey was the better game.Still, there is nothing out there that shows this subject matter in this way, so if you're interested in soviet cold-war-punk and committing mass murder against droids/zombies while rocking out to soviet hardcore remixes, this is your best bet."

The combat is intense and satisfying, the exploration rewarding, the world fascinating, and the music is simply to die for. While the setting is very well executed, the narrative is merely serviceable. Had the narrative focused more heavily on the ideologies (e.g. Scientific Socialism, the authority of the state over the individual, etc.) and philosophical questions (e.g. the nature of consciousness, the morality of utilizing androids/robots as a subservient group, etc.) built into the world of this alternate U.S.S.R., I think that the overarching story would have been more interesting and less relegated to the world of tropes and needless comparisons to other great works of the same genre (e.g. ) that serve only to diminish the story's power and intrigue."

At first sight there's the hyperorganized and roboticized communism 2.0 arc  in an alternate universe Russia which won WW2. Wacky oversexualized crafting machines, talking gloves, a passive agressive protagonist and strange bedfellows and a GrandMother-I-DONT-Want-To-♥♥♥♥-With. But underneath lies a more sinister and esoterical narrative of experimental scientific breakthroughs that grew over the creators's heads and became transcendent, leading to a quite stimulating open end ripe for many theories of how our main protagonist will deal with his own afflictions vs the interests of 'the motherland'.The versatility in this game is astounding. Not only does it provide gameplay elements ranging from frantic Doom--like action mixed with beefed-up BioShock abilities, to portal-style puzzle solving and ""watch dogs"" hacking and scanning, the game also allows you to prepare yourself for big bos fights on a semi open world big floating island with aperture-science-style puzzle centres that provide breaks from the fast paced action. There you'll be able to acquire enough ""lustful abandon"" to upgrade many aspects of your character skills and passive abilities.The soundtrack treats you to a goofy Russian schlager and contemporary music remixfest in dubstep / progressive house / metal and more. The art style might be remeniscent of Bioshock but the semi open world and not in the least the story are unique and quirky enough to give it it's own distinctive vibe."

The melee combat is strange to get used to, but quite fun and responsive once you get a handle on it. The abilities Charles gives you are few in number, but all of them are viable and fun to use, some more than others( Mass Telekinesis is OP). The story is long enough to really sell the world and the environment, but not so long that it drags on and becomes unenjoyable. Story is quite nice, and has some interesting moral implications.Enemy design is fantastic, both visually and from a gameplay standpoint. Some boss fights are fantastic, while some are lackluster. For example, Hedgie, the Twins, and Dewdrop are very fun bosses. However, Belyash and Natasha fall short. Plyusch is fun but overused, by the 3rd or even 4th time fighting it you will be sick and tired of seeing it.The puzzles in the game are brilliant, and perfect for my room-temperature IQ. Some are difficult, but none difficult enough to require me to look up the solution. All are fun and don't last longer than they are welcome, something I quite appreciate as someone who typically isn't very good at puzzles.Admittedly, the game suffers from some pretty bad issues that I feel I should list here. For one, you will get stuck. I got stuck on random bits of environment and was forced to reload at least a dozen separate times. For two, and this could just be a personal issue, but towards the end of the game( Last 3-4 hours), the game would just lock up every now and then, freezing for 10-20 seconds before it fixed itself. I also had a quite annoying bug that made me have to restart an entire save file 7 hours in due to a door not opening when it should have.In summary, Atomic Heart is a fantastic game that I would give a 9/10. It shines in its world design, storytelling, and enemy design. It has its drawbacks, such as lack of weapon/ability choices, and some bad bugs, but I think the gameplay overcomes all the shortcomings there. Worth a pickup, especially since the Devs have plans for 4 DLC in the future."

Apart from one crash the game performs very well. The game is sadly a bit heavy on the looting mechanic where you are expected to constantly scavenge rooms and fallen enemies just to get a random set of items to be able to make your weapons usable. This downside is luckily countered by the other aspects of the game. Good music and sound design with plenty of variety in level design and enemies. The story wasn't ground breaking but I think the execution was good enough to not be bothered by it.

The game has what is commonly referred to as an ""Ubisoft open-world"" design but without many of the basic features that make that low effort design less tedious to explore. The combat feels disjointed and clumsy largely due to every enemy having a straight line dash attack where the end point is far behind you. Stealth might as well not exist. Your character moves so ridiculously slow and enemies can detect you from render distance and once they have they follow you to the ends of the earth. It is better in literally every scenario to either run past or simply melee stunlock them to death. Another problem with combat is that guns/powers all feel more or less identical making any upgrade or change feel meaningless. The plot is awkwardly shambled together as evidenced by the strange jerky transitions during cutscenes, the unnatural dialogues and responses that would often overlap even while fighting enemies, and how it wears its influences so heavily on its sleeve to the point where your character hamfists the word ""rapture"" when describing an underwater view. There's also the problem that many actions are just unnecessarily slow such as climbing, lockpicking, or the excessive strings of QTEs but those are much simpler to fix than many of the larger problems with this game. All of that said, the game isn't bad. It's just incredibly disappointing. I hope the developers can create something much better with what they've started here. In short, get it on sale."

It's just bad enough to push it down though at the price of 95 bux... Get it on sale maybe.This game looked like a creative masterpiece, but what it is, is a complete rip off of BioShock made as raunchy as possible, with the main character dropping F bombs every other word.Seriously, it's not just innuendo; you'll be looking around as if you were watching the hub playing this if anyone walks into the same room. There is a ton of Innuendo as well though, you even stealth kill by inserting your Robo-tenticals just above the robots booty.Unskippable cut scenes, unskippable tutorials, and if you die you go back to the last time you manually saved at a save point. Which makes the more difficult areas extra annoying because of all the things you can't skip. When you actually need an explanation of how something works, lock picking for example, then just no tutorial at all.... Voice lines are unskippable as well, and will over lap each other if you move to far and a new one starts.If you can get past all that, the game play it's self is decent. It is after all basically BioShock, so much so that I don't know how they could make this blatant re-skin and not get sued. So the combat is fantastic. They added a dodge mechanic, and when you hit an enemy it leaves a mark on them where you hit them! You can DeadSpace your way through sending limbs and components flying and it's all very satisfying. At the core, the game play is what makes it good though it is very difficult to get past all the other nonsense.I'll shelve for a while and wait for some updates and hopefully they will fix some of the more annoying things, or modders will. At that point I intent to fully jump in, off stream, and wreck some robots while no one is home. Maybe pick up on sale later, and see if they fix all the unskippable stuff, add the ray tracing they said would be in the game, the HDR, and FOV slider since I had to get a mod to even play it on my monitor the way it is.If you are a wide screen user, use flawlesswidescreen with a dot ORG after it. (or google) That program is a life saver as this game, for some reason, in 2023.... Doesn't have a FOV slider. They say one is comming."

So it doubly hurts that you can't change the VA to russian while keeping english subtitles, especially since the game does a good job of having a sort of in game translation of all the russian text in the environment that I think works very well.Gameplay/Story wise, I think it starts off WAY too fast and WAY too convenient. You go from fighting (or stealthing past) a few robots and then get immediately and conveniently thrusted into cutscenes that feel way too snappy and way too quick. The lack of FOV combined with the first area's setting makes the game feel clunky and very claustrophobic. The combat is alright and the setting is nice, but it just isn't for me I suppose.I guess overall I'd say its and alright game that falls into the category of mediocre but beautiful looking."

The game encourages you to loot everything in sight, but if you do that, you'll find yourself having to go back and forth between your storage, putting in stuff you didn't want to pick up in the first place, and grabbing things you actually did want out of it that were automatically put there because you were out of inventory space. This doesn't sound so bad until you realize that healing items that you pick up will be put into storage if you're out of space, which, if you're low on health and need them right then and there... you're out of luck! There's a perk that increases the inventory space but that doesn't really help. All these issues make for a game that's hard to really enjoy, at least, for long periods of time. I'm only a few hours in and I'm already exhausted from the game.In the end, the game isn't bad. I just don't think it's worth 60 dollars. I'd say 40 dollars at best."

It has a lot of issues, both in it's design and in it's functionality, but it is also a unique, interesting and overall very fun game.First, let me start by listing a few things that might make the game unbearable to play for some people. If any of these things make your blood boil, stay away from it:- The game has LOTS of dialogue, and nothing will stop the characters from delivering their lines (yes, there are entire conversations during intense combat sections). Through at least 60% of the game, some dialogue is being played.- About three quarters of the game's puzzles are either tedious or frustratingly difficult. Most can be bypassed and there aren't a ton, but you will miss out on a lot of things (mostly weapon upgrades and loot) if you don't complete them.- The game has quite a lot of collision issues (eg: getting stuck between two rocks). I've never gotten permanently stuck, but I had to aggressively dodge, jump and move a few times to get unstuck from geometry. At some point you'll start understanding what type of geometry you should try to interact with and what to avoid, but it is frustrating for the first few hours.- The narrative and dialogues aren't the best of the year for sure. I'm not saying it's bad, but if you're the type of person who mostly plays games for good stories, this isn't the game for you.- Horrible platforming. There isn't a ton of it and it's mostly optional, but it's definitely not what makes the game shine.- The game offers very little in terms of accessibility (both design and features), so it's most likely unplayable for anyone with moderate to severe motor, visual, auditive or cognitive disabilities.Now to the good stuff. Atomic Heart does a few things poorly as mentioned above, but it also does some things with absolute brilliance. Here they are:- This game has the best FPS boss fights I've ever experienced. I almost feel bad making the comparison, but this is Dark Souls levels of brilliant boss design: challenging, unique, visually and auditively striking, intimidating and, most importantly, fair. I've seriously never had more fun fighting bosses in an FPS, it's mind-boggling how good they are.- The music in this game is absolutely bonkers. Not only does it have some of the best combat music I've ever heard, but it also has great in-world radio songs and atmospheric music. And it's not only good; it's well used. I'm not going to spoil anything, but this game has the best mix of gameplay and music in a sequence since FarCry 3's Make It Bun Dem mission.- The gameplay is a great mix of old-school and new-gen. No sprinting, plenty of dodging, multiple guns have alternative fire modes, huge emphasis on mixing melee and ranged combat (moreso during the first half as resources are scarce) and fun, varied enemies.- The game has a very well-paced power fantasy. Most games that come out either make you work too hard to feel empowered, or they just make you feel empowered from the very beginning without asking anything of you. Meanwhile, Atomic Heart has a very nice and organic crescendo of Player strength that just feels great.- Brilliant world-building. Like, I can't put it into words because it's so weird and unique, but it's seriously one of the nicest universes I've seen in recent gaming history. It's dark while also being colorful, it's dirty while seeming clean, it's both conservative and progressive at the same time, and it's very weird.- The game runs and looks great. This is something very rare in this era of unoptimized, okay-looking messes, but this game looks extremely good for how little it demands from your hardwareNow, as you might have noticed, I've skipped a few things that are mentioned a lot in other reviews; the protagonist's constant swearing and odd expressions, the weird plot twists, the lore and the intro's dissociation with the rest of the game. I'll be honest; those things don't matter when you do a few things or look at things differently:- Protagonist's swearing and expressions: set the game's VO to Russian. It feels more immersive, you can focus on the dialogue only in contexts that interest you, and Russian people swear all the time in real-life. It seriously makes the whole experience that much better.- Plot twist and lore: As previously mentioned, this game shouldn't be played for it's story. It's not bad, hell it's even pretty good, but targeting this aspect of the title to say whether it's a good game or not is irrelevant when considering everything else it has to offer from a gameplay, pacing and world-building perspective.- Intro feeling disconnected from the rest of the game: It's a tutorial. It's purpose is not to feel like the whole game, but to give you the tools and knowledge to perform as well as expected once the game actually begins. And you know what? It does a great job at it.So, I won't give a grade or anything like that since I believe people should buy games based on their strengths and weaknesses instead of an overall score, but what I can say is if you like immersive sims like Prey, shooters like DOOM, atmospheric experiences like S.T.A.L.K.E.R., or even impressive tech demos like Half-Life 2, this game is definitely for you. See you in Facility 3826, Tovarisch.P.S: Armageddon (Hard) difficulty is highly recommended since it forces you to use all the tools at your disposal. Playing on easier difficulties will likely end up in finding a cheap/easy way to tackle everything instead of using varied tools and strategies."

From its beautiful graphics to its intense combat, this game is a great way to start off 2023. It has a couple of bugs I've noticed throughout my playthrough, but it was an otherwise pleasant experience with a compelling setting and eccentric characters which at certain points made me laugh out loud.""Begone demon!"" Was such a good way to set the mood and the extensive dialogue may be much for some to digest, but I think it added greatly to the characters and the setting. I always was invested in the conversations and small side stories going on throughout the facilities various terminals. Some were deep whereas others were simply people having fun in the workplace. I played in the original Russian audio with English subtitles and highly suggest others to do so as well, the deliveries certainly have more gravitas and it makes certain points in the game more memorable.Overall I think it's worth the buy and one that I recommend to anyone looking for a new setting to venture into and explore."

This game has a wonderful story and I myself did enjoy playing through it however it has many inconsistencies some parts of the game look better than others and some objects dont really look like they are rendered properly. one of the many bugs I experienced while playing was the game freezing this could be due to my PC as its not exactly a powerhouse but its not weak by any means I run a 1660 super/intel i9/and 16 GB of ram I played on medium graphics. the boss fights were hit and miss once again with inconsistencies some were really high quality and amazing others just ''meh'' another big issue with this game  was the writing for the dialogue it sounds like it was written by a teenager and made me cringe at times. Additionally there wasn't too much enemy variety in this game most of the game was just you fighting the same robots with others just barely sprinkled in. You did get to see more during the end however I wish we got to see more earlier on. This game could have benefited massively from another 3 years in development if all of these issues had gotten fixed I would rate this game 8/10. But due to the bugs/quality inconsistency and horrible dialogue I have to give this game a low rating. If you have the extra money and want to you can for sure buy this it had a great story and some moments were really cool. (Also the musics really cool 8/10 for the soundtrack alone)

If you enjoy Bioshock, Prey, Dishonoured, Farcry, or other ""open world"" shooter/RPGs you will probably enjoy this game. Completed playthrough in 18ish hours, exploring maybe 75-80% of the game.THE GOOD:-The graphics are AMAZING, and the engine is well optimised: I am running a mid-range gaming PC (2070 super) and am running it on ULTRA at 60fps.-The world is beautiful: the art direction is absolutely spectacular. The soviet iconography is well designed, the landscape captivating, character models look amazing and are well animated.- The sound design and music are fantastic: Mick Gordon works some of his magic (don't expect DOOM level soundtrack), while real world influence comes in the form of Soviet marches, synth-pop, and classical pieces. Big part of the world-building.-Game-play is a standard RPG-shooter, with some platforming, as well as some interesting puzzles. They are not mind-blowing, nor particularly difficult, but the game felt fresh.-In my entire playthrough (from release day) I encountered NO BUGS, and only had to re-load once, as a result of getting stuck while crouched and getting hung up on the environment (frustrating, but minor).THE BAD:-The voice acting and lines are ATROCIOUS. I started playing the game with native English audio, and it was so bad it detracted from the game. Specifically the acting of  the protagonist. His quips are so bad that I switched the dialogue to Russian halfway through the game, while keeping English subtitles/text, in an effort to stop him from distracting me from the rest of the game. Having the Russian voice audio helped with immersion imo.-Combat isn't particularly difficult, nor engaging (normal difficulty). Many enemies are slower than you, making it easy to kill them from afar, or while backing away. The faster enemies are easily beaten by circle strafing. You are never in short supply of healing, making it easy to win by attrition. Scanning enemies to reveal their weaknesses is slow, and difficult to to do in the fights where it really counts.-Besides crouching to move up behind enemies, there is no stealth system, despite there being a system for stealth kills.-Re-playability isn't great: it is an ""open world"" that you are railroaded through, with multiple endings. I did not see a reason to replay it for the ending I did not get, as it does not add anything additional in terms of game-play-The endings are anti-climatic, and left me feeling disappointed.THE UGLY:-The crafting system is rather banal. Collect loot by killing enemies, or by running around the environment and holding F to loot. It is not inspired, and looting is a chore. Modified weapons look like they're cobbled from trash (technically are), and are out of place in the world.-Weapons don't *feel* good. Some of the melee weapons are nice, but the firearms have no real oomph. The AK in particular sounds nothing like one. Sad.-The ""open world"" is a pain in the ass most of the time. Travel through it is slow, and enemies are an annoyance more than a danger.-The story is meandering and not well fleshed out. It is told through character interactions, as well as found data (recordings and emails). Other games, such as Prey, did this perfectly. Atomic Heart, not so much-Most characters have the personality of a rock.-The menus are quirky, and need refinement. Mousing over something does not display any information about that item.TLDR:A beautiful game that is well-optimised, with an amazing world, game-play that isn't particularly challenging, an interesting story that suffers from poor story telling, terrible voice acting, and some quality of life features that are missing/could be improved on. I would recommend it if you enjoy the games mentioned at the beginning of the review. 8/10"

The art and premise have so much potential. Unfortunately, the endless puzzles get in the way of the story and action, preventing that rare feeling of adrenaline felt from similar FPS games like Bioshock or Prey. In addition, there are so many cameras with countless repair bots that the accomplishment of destroying a legion of enemies becomes almost pointless because they all come back to life in a matter of seconds. Do you need to run all the time? Do you need to stay hidden like a stealth assassin all the time? This is supposed to be an explosive action game but with the mechanics it's not. And don't even get me started with those endings. At least take the time to create one decent ending."

The game is a huge mix of different mechanics so diverse, that it ends up being it's own thing, but we have to admit that it's biggest influence is Bioshock, that is evident, but it is not a bad thing, at all.As a game is solid, fun to play, fast and of course, fun. The enemies and the weapons are on point, the loot mechanic is fun, the weapon upgrade mechanic is really interesting and vast, it reminds you of games like Dead Island, and the energy mechanic is fun in it's implementation. The music is... Oh my dog... Perfect. The Heavy-Metal covers of old Russian Pop Songs are sublime, and the original tracks created by Mick Gordon are, well, created by Mick Gordon, there's not much else to say there.For the 'not that good', well, the open world doesn't really fits in and feels weird, and the story is really not that good, I don't have nothing bad to say about the VA's or the lines, in fact I find them funny, not 'Portal 2' level of funny, but funny enough. My biggest gripe is the ending tho, I think it happens too fast and too out of nowhere, and it feels inconsistent, or out of place, considering all the story that leads up to it.Overall, it's a good game. Leaving any kind of politics aside, I do recommend you buy and play this game, specially if you like games like Bioshock or even Dead Island/Dying Light."

Gameplay is fun and takes from a pool of some of the best mechanics from games all over the board. The protag is an a-hole with character development and quips reminiscent of 80's action heros. The music is fantastic, and another great example by Mick Gordon. At this point, I'm convinced the only reason people hate this game is because of the devs. But I personally don't care, and hope they make another one with P-3."

I was met with beautiful visuals, an extraordinary soundtrack, some of the best first person combat and boss fights I've seen in a while and a very well written and cryptic story. I loved this game from start to finish and will probably be playing it over and over again and even getting all the achievements (which is not something I normally do). However, I do have a few small gripes, and I mean small. For one, as great as the combat is, I found myself getting stuck and pinned against walls a handful of times but even with that I was able to use my mass telekinesis to get the enemies out of my face so I could move to more open space, but it did get pretty annoying and stressful sometimes. As far as ""janky gameplay"" goes thats about it, everything else I have to say is just pure opinion and quality of life changes I'd love to see added to the game. 1) Please add the ability to place waypoints on the map, its not that big of a deal but it would make things a lot more simple so that I'm not opening and closing the map 50 times before I reach my destination so that I know I'm going the right way :)2) I'd love to see this game get a New Game + added in, especially if each ng+ had more and or buffed enemies to spice things up and keep the game infinitely replayable, I can't tell you how much time I'd spend on the game if something like that was added.3) Another mode I'd be hyped for is a boss rush of some kind. The boss fights in this game are absolutely amazing and being able to fight each of them one after the other or even at the same time would be insane and totally awesome. Even something like boss fight time trials would be sweet. This game has so much to offer and such a rich and unforgiving world to throw its players into, and the devs really seem to care about their players. I'm absolutely in love with this game and can't wait to see where Mundfish takes us. Thank you so much for giving me this experience. <3"

I absolutely want to experience everything this game has to offer, and can't wait to do so...however, for PC gamers, this game desperately needs a patch to fix the keybinds. As it is, pushing W for forward causes the player to permanently sprint. There is no jog speed, and definitely no Walk key. Cyberpunk 2077 devs patched a walk key bind in and it absolutely makes strolling through the eye candy of that game a badly needed want for the eye candy of this one.Also needs a proper Sprint key bind ability, and ability to remap the End Conversation key (which is hard-bound to Q).Until the devs release a patch to fix this, I will not be playing the game any further, as it forces me to rush through quiet, slow ambient areas, and unless I'm fighting robots, I def do not want to rush through this beautiful game. (I played to the very first Save Room you find, and stopped there.)But for console gamers who have the stick ability to slow walk...Get this game now! It completely sucked me into it's world just from experiencing the hour long intro level!

A solid first person action RPG that delivers a weird and dangerous soviet era playground full of deadly robots & mutants and comparing it to games like BioShock is something one will naturally do. I’ve been following the game’s development for years now and at one point i even doubted it would see the light of day at all but here we are. It’s not a perfect product and there are some issues but after a rather slow start and once you crafted some nice weapons and have upgraded them you start to have fun very quickly in my opinion. This is the first game by Mundfish and from the second the opening prologue starts you can see the love and details they put into this world immediately. One of the highlights is definitely the upgrade machine „Nora“ who want’s to have sex with you for some reason and seems to be horny all the time. And yes, the twins are….nice too haha. It’s a fantastic game and was worth the price for me. It took me a little over 27 hours to complete the story on normal difficulty. The side content in it's open world next to the main missions consist of testing grounds that are underground puzzle laboratories  where you can find blueprints to unlock upgrades for your arsenal of weapons. And yes there’s a talking glove that kind of never shuts up but that’s ok, and i admit i kind of liked it. He can also be upgraded at „Nora“ to give your elemental powers that extra kick. I’m not going to talk about everything you can do and see in Atomic Heart but i do highly recommend this game not only for the love that was put into it but also for the outstanding collection of licensed music and composed tracks by legends like Mick Gordon which make some of the Boss fights and combat scenes absolutely kick ass. 9/10"

But in the end of a day, I did enjoy the game a lot.So why the negative review? Frankly speaking, it doesn't give a good first impression. The opening segment is too damn long, it drags you around for God knows how much time just to show you the worldbuilding. I admit, it's amazing, the graphics of it are amazing but guys, I've bought the game to shoot things not to watch an interactive benchmark.And speaking of shooting things, I feel like Mundfish tried their best to make the ""shooting"" part at the beginning unfun as hard as they could.First of all in my opinion, weapons and abilities are a bit too nerfed at the beginning, hitting 1 mob robot with a hammer like a million times to destroy it sucks fun out of the game for me. Maybe I'm picky here but honestly there are more creative ways to make the game more challenging in this aspect than just making your enemies bullet (hammer?) sponges, especially when you have all those cool robots around that could show their abilities in more various ways.The game has also a weird fetish for lackluster puzzles and platform segments. Some of those are creative but most of them are a boring chore that just slow your progress down.The open world segments were also just bad. They lacked content to keep me interested in it as a player, I wouldn't mind if they didn't even exist.Voice directing sucks. I've played in both of my languages and in both of versions it felt like the voice actors (talented imo) had to think up how they should perform just from the lines they were reading.Phew that's a lot of complaints, so lemme get to the positives real quickly.As I stated before, graphics and worldbuilding are amazing. In connection with the soundtrack (that absolutely slaps and nails it) they create a great atmosphere of alternative Soviet reality.The story is decent and that is enough to make me interested to finish the game.If you improve your weapons, the shooting is actually fun. It has been too long since I've played a decent slow-paced FPS singleplayer game, so thank you for that. So in short, the game didn't really lift the potential it had but was enjoyable netherless. I have faith that Mundfish will address the issues in (hopefully) next production, with all the love they've poured into this game I'm sure they will make something even better next time.PS.

Fetch quests so bad that even the fetch quests have fetch quests built into them.The genius idea to put the player into an underground bunker for the first 4 hours of the game kills most of the desire to carry on, so that by the time you come out to the great-looking outdoors, you've just about had enough of the game. The guns are a mess concealed behind a pointlessly overcomplicated crafting system. Why is there a crafting system? Why is there a pretence of inventory management? Why is there a pretence of elemental damage system, when everything is a robot? If they took a scalpel to the game's systems and cut about two thirds of it away - it would have made for a better experience.I also get inexplicable motion sickness, even despite them adding an FOV slider (thank you though!). Could be because the character bobs during motion...Anyways, a good game is buried under a pile of unnecessary stuff and I am only playing to see more of that good game."

I loved the size and complexity of the maps and puzzles. However, the protagonist, while not intended as a role model, sets an abysmal example with his constant complaining and outbursts, making him come off as a temperamental teen rather than a trained military officer. The dialogue is unimaginative and repetitive, and the constant banter with the 'glove' gets tiresome quickly. The game's anti-science tone is disappointing. The constant disparagement of scientists and the portrayal of science as evil hubris feels outdated and unproductive. In reality, science and technology have improved our lives in countless ways and should be celebrated and respected.The game's narrative seems to present a critique of both communism and capitalism, but the criticism of capitalism is more explicit. However, the argument against capitalism seems to be a bit of a straw-man, as the game doesn't offer a clear alternative. Rather than presenting a nuanced critique of economic systems, the game appears to aim only to sow discontent without offering any solutions or alternatives. This approach ultimately feels unsatisfying and shallow.While Atomic Heart may have some reasonable mechanics and structure, the game's flaws overshadow these positives. If you're looking for a game that will leave you with a healthier mental attitude, it may be best to look elsewhere."

A smaller studio comes in and does everything the mainstream are trying to do with singleplayer FPS but far better and somehow the critics are saying it's an average game.This game oozes originality; from the story, the setting, the game-play mechanics, the puzzle features and it's overall style, it's just so unique but still feels familiar enough for any casual FPS player to feel comfortable. There is truly no other game like this on the market. This game has definite influences of Prey, Bioshock and many others, but it manages to take influence from others whilst still be incredibly original. I'd recommend this game at full price. Just buy it and see for yourself."

It opens with a very scenic opening that shows you the kind of culture of the world your character is in and allows you to walk around and explore it... at least up until the robots destroy everything in which case at that point everyone's dead so yeah.... make sure you look around before that happens.There's multiple enemies and various ways to combat those enemies as well as a selection of weapons to pick and choose from and pick your choices well because each enemy has it's own weakness. There are some stealth options allowing you to crouch walk behind an enemy and preform a sneak attack which brings up a prompt where you have to mash a certain key on your keyboard in order to be successful in a take down which is annoying to deal with since nobody likes abusing their keyboard. The graphics are very good and I have only encountered two glitches/bugs and one crash during my entire play through of the game which is very good.The game has overcome the problem of never having anything to shoot at in an area you're returning to because you've already killed all the enemies by implementing a repair system that allows drones to repair destroyed robots which adds a more challenging level to the player particularly if you have an objective to complete in the area. There are a number of ways to deal with this by either figuring out how to disable the HAWK rendering all robots in that area to be put in stand by mode for a time or by destroying all robots and all drones to the point where it would take some time to reconstruct the drones and for the drones to then repair all the robots you've destroyed.One thing I really like is how they've put a lot of thought into their puzzles and how they not all the same. There are different locks and different puzzles and they continue to change throughout the game so that they remain interesting instead of becoming a bore to deal with. The developers came up with funny dialogue about the character hating locks that plays though out the game obviously trolling players that hate puzzles and such things.The developers have also obviously thought about how big the map is and as such put in cars so that you don't have to walk everywhere and put in optional testing grounds that you can complete to receive different blueprints and attachments for your various guns.The pros: The game delivered what it promised (Minimum of 30 hours of game play)Good graphicsDiverse ways to play and range of weaponsVery few bugs/glitchesDifferent puzzles that continue to challenge you throughout the gameThe cons:I'm not really a fan of mashing a key on my keyboard repeatedly in rapid succession in order to disable a robot that I've already gone to the bother to sneak up on.Score: 90/100

For context, I'm a huge fan of immersive sims like Bioshock and Prey and games that allow a lot of variation in play styles. I am currently about 5 hours into this game and I am so glad that I took the leap and bought it. The world feels super unique and interesting despite resembling the games that inspired it. It feels like a continuation of the retro tech vibe of games like Bioshock or Fallout, but with its own unique spin. The gameplay is nothing groundbreaking, but the level of customization of weapons and abilities makes it work just enough to accommodate exploring this awesome, detailed world. It's best to go into it understanding that it is not a AAA game, which makes it a little rough around the edges at times, however, it doesn't detract from the overall experience. It lands shockingly well for how ambitious this game is. The main downside is that the protagonist is quippy and completely insufferable. With that said, if you have any curiosity about this game, I recommend giving it a try."

To begin with, the plot is nice but just enough, very good longevity, graphically well done but compared to the pre-launch images and videos the graphic downgrade is evident, bad technical optimization, I have a custom 6900xt with the latest drivers available I play at 1080p 144hz all maxed out, this is the only game in which the gpu reaches unbelievable temperatures and the fans spin at their maximum, in other games such as cyberpunk, doom eternal and the callisto protocol the fans can hardly be heard, this is the only game in which the gpu looks like a helicopter with the gpu hot spot at 100 degrees. I had to activate vertical sync and lower some graphic details to medium with a top-of-the-range 1000€ gpu are you kidding me? Many times I got stuck between various elements of the scenario and had to load a previous save, I haven't seen something like this since the games of 10 years ago. I hated to the point of frustration the endless hordes of enemies in open areas, even if you destroy them all after a few seconds they are endlessly rebuilt again, this greatly discourages exploration which the game pushes you to do. In the internal areas there are TOO MANY puzzles, even if they are not complicated but there are so many and they break the pace of the game too much. In a nutshell I would not even recommend this game to my worst enemy. I say to developers: change jobs."

Premise good on paper, in-line with soviet science-fiction works of the time, and a pretty cool and underused setting in general. And we finally have a game in it. So, where do we begin?The plot is there, and it is very reminiscent of original Bioshock (as is the entire game, but we'll get to that). But the most important things is - robotics are amazing, until they aren't and things go awry. The main problem with the plot is its delivery, and the way it is delivered. Sometimes it looks like the developers had huge ambitions that had to be cut down more or less obvious reasons like gameplay pacing. The game tries to make up for that with opening up the world, and giving you a  chatty companion and almost too much dialogue that sometimes can get cut off if you walk through an area too quickly or happen to have an encounter. But if you can live with that (I know I can, it was kinda hilarious at times though) then you still get terminals in the game world that give you way more background to the events. Overall, it was pretty good and a solid ride, but not without its own issues.I have to give it a separate paragraph, because the world is full of sounds and music for your ears to enjoy, provided you stop and listen for a while instead of bum-rushing through the entire thing like ""I just wanna get it out of my backlog already"". The whirring of the machines, the ambient music in more or less desolate places, the sounds of machinery, the impact sounds - they're carefully done and very enjoyable. Don't feel too powerful, I'd say perfectly accurately depicting their power...maybe except for the KS-23. It's like dev team spent actual time on making sure things sound as they should. And then topped it off with music that will give a huge nostalgia trip for anyone growing up in former Soviet Bloc countries during and after the collapse of USSR, hitting you with likes of Alla Pugacheva and Zemlyane, which might not vibe with younger audiences, but for people born during and right after the collapse would feel like grandma's home during a summer vacation. However there's also entire remixed soundtrack with some of those songs being brought more...up to date, let's call it. And they sound stupid good. It's hard to go back to originals after you hear how good of a job Geoffrey Day did. Same goes for combat pieces done by Mick Gordon, you feel like you absolutely slap. Zero complaints here....until we get to the English dubbing. It's , if not a bit cringe to hear at times. So unless you're a masochist like me and/or want to hear random bits of dialogue around you, be it announcements or dead corpses talking, do yourself a favour and switch to either your own language since dubbing quality is generally good, or play it in line with the setting. Because English dub feels like the developers tried to end this spectacle of audiovisual goodness with a front flip and ended up smacking their face against the floor.The game looks gorgeous, even without RTX (which will be added in a later update), and runs way better than you'd expect out of something looking like that. DLSS is there to help your performance at higher resolutions, but me and my rig managed to run it at 4K, max settings, DLSS set to Quality, and rarely get dips below 80 FPS, let alone 60. It's a smooth and great looking experience, even with the infamous Denuvo being implemented.Facility 3826 is a rather massive location...with most interesting bits of it being underground. Most of the time spent outside will be either random looting for resources or looking for a way to go underground to reach another objective or a testing ground to get your weapon upgrades. It's basically a lot of room you're led around in a linear manner until the end, and only serves as means of commute with no fast travel. This game suffers from the same issue Metro Exodus had, as the closest example - huge open world stuffed into a game with a linear progression, and underdelivering in terms of things to do in said world. You don't even get back to locations once visited, nor game gives you any incentive too. Just get everything done, move on, rinse and repeat until the end of the game.Let's get to the meat and veggies - gameplay. I have to make a comparison to Bioshock here again, because it's that, but with more resource management in terms of upgrading yourself and your weapons (provided you craft them first). Though honestly I can't see the reason why crafting of weapons exists in the game in the first place, it feels like such an afterthought to give players incentive to look around and loot things, but it feels so half-baked that it could be totally cut out. Upgrading itself is fine, but I can hardly warrant having this many kinds of resources for all these weapons and upgrades in order to fulfill basic requirements. I feel like the game would do fine without that, or even cutting it down a bit to just include upgrades and ammo crafting. The biggest saving grace however is the fact that any resources you pour into a certain upgrade path are fully refunded to you, should you pick a different upgrade for the same part of the weapon.The gameplay loop - it's good. Gunplay seems fine, it's not Call of Duty or Battlefield and it's not a main focus, so I can say it is decent, even if weapons fall flat in terms of damage department at first (especially KS-23 shotgun), but as you progress they will get better. Your main tools of trade will be melee weapons, and you've got a decent variety of them - so you'll find your favourite. The enemies even suffer visual damage as fighting, they can be frozen in place with your Polymer mods, slowed down with a shock, and you can combine your skills to deal additional damage. All of them have strong spots and weaknesses that warrant using different weapons or approaches on them. But gameplay itself often boils down to kill ♥♥♥♥, move to new area, kill ♥♥♥♥, rinse and repeat, broken up by occasional lock to bypass with a simple logic game, or an environmental puzzle to solve. These are actually fun and don't overstay their welcome, unlike your slutty upgrade vendor that you have to deal with for the entirety of starting area - it's a fun joke that should be ended sooner, but thankfully it doesn't last too long.But to get to that gameplay you have to get between the zones on the map, and you won't do that on foot, right? Too bad the implementation of cars in this game sucks ass. They feel like cardboard boxes on wheels, break way too easily, their physics seem quirky at best, and you can get randomly launched in the air upon driving over certain enemies, bringing me all the way back to the seesaw glitch in GTA4.Atomic Heart is a game, one surrounded by controversies which I don't want to go into in this review, and is a game of some problems. But it's decent. It's something I recommend playing if you're a Bioshock fan and can deal with a few shortcomings and treat it primarily as a linear experience. Because it's an experience alright. I personally enjoyed this game, and if you want a numerical rating from me..."

Why would you add infinitely respawning robots to repair the robots I just killed 5 seconds ago. let me explore this world you have made. I didn't do any of the side content because of this. Just skipped right passed it.Graphics are great and the robot designs and world environment are fantastic.Story and writing is alright but why does the protagonist have a stupid catchphrase is so obnoxious.Combat is decent but with some downsides. Encounters got boring, especially with the Plyusch. Just melee spam and dodge for like 3 mins. Because you cant block or parry, its all just about spamming left shift which gets boring. Need more glove powers. There are 4 you can change. Bioshock had 12. Decent weapon variety but didn't feel the need to experiment, just upgraded the weapons I had.Music in some parts was good like in the upgrade stations, albeit repetitive, but awful in others. Like some random rock song and then it fades into calm ambient music and then there is 1 enemy and its back to rock in a matter of seconds. Didn't flow at all.Encountered quite a few bugs. The Belyash boss got stuck in a loop half way, got stuck in geometry sometimes and fell through the map. Got stun locked in a corner by 5 enemies as well several times.I don't feel like this was the game they worked on for 5 years at least. I can see the passion in the art direction but the gameplay feels a bit lacklustre. The open world section feels like an after thought and is a pain to get through. Also the protagonist needs to shut up.7/10"

Though the protagonists dialogue isn't for everyone, I find it quite funny at times. The action is quite fun, and the weapons though limited are still fun and entertaining. The skills are quite interesting and the abilities the player can use have applications. There is a lot that can be done in the game and I'm interested in finishing the game. The enemies are not too tough but still provide a good challenge and the first boss I came across (the HOG 7 if I recall) took me a bit to figure out how to handle it properly.The writing isn't the best but it is still passable and interesting, with the dialogue sometimes not being the best. But that is really my only complaint with the game so far, with everything else being quite enjoyable. Some of the human characters are interesting and the conflict seems interesting as well. To me my favorite part is the atmosphere of and the environment with it being science fiction and soviet. A lot of little details were crammed in there and it really adds to the aesthetic of the world. The worldbuilding, though not perfect, is still good.  After completing the game three times I can say that this game is a solid 9/10. Though a lot of issues, the game play, mechanics, story, and more, the game is quite enjoyable and the music sells it. I listen to a lot of Soviet music and they nailed it. This is perfect, the perfect game and I would love to play it again"

Not quite 1/3 way through the story. Appreciate the design choice that recycling items and switching skills give 100% resources back, to allow for experimentation without losing resources. My one complaint is the key binds. If you're not a standard WASD player you're screwed when it comes to driving since not all the functions change when changing the keybinds (like left and right turn). Also cannot have move forward and accelerate as they same key unless its the default W key. Had to find the local settings files and change it there, instead of in-game settings. Hopefully something that'll get patched.  4.5 out 5 for me so far.*Update*After completing the story, I probably will not play it again. I did like the puzzle areas, but the game-play overall got repetitive and easy. With certain skills I was able endlessly stun lock enemies (GOO + Shock).I'd probably still recommend the game but on sale as it's single play through type of game for me."

The only complaints I have would be that the story feels a bit weak, and the main character is not very likable. I suspect maybe his dialogue seems a bit off, as it may directly translated?

This game is clearly inspired by bioshock but does everything worse besides graphical fidelity, but even the art style is worse. The comic-esque dialogue doesn't fit the tone and the main protagonist never shuts up. Also they gives enemies a ton of health and you need to reload all the time. Combat is too much waiting around. At least the dash is kinda cool. Overall I give this a 5.5/10. Wait for it to be 20 euro then it's worth it for the main story, forget the over-world and skip most of the dialogue."

It's clear from every little detail of the game (gorgeous backdrops/scenery, gritty dystopian destruction, sharp combat, unique and interesting characters) that the developers really cared about shipping their exact vision for the game.  It mixes lighthearted, funny, and irreverent scenes into the gameplay to even out the pacing of the game without detracting from the darkness of the dystopian story or the danger that every enemy presents to the player.The behavior of all the characters just feels very believable.  A lot of games will accidentally break immersion by having all the members of the cast be just a little too obsessed with the protagonist.  Atomic Heart doesn't fall into that trap.  Instead, the only people that know who you are are the ones who obviously would (direct supervisor etc).Everyone else treats you as just another passer-by in their lives until you build a rapport with them.  This isn't even something that I typically look for in a game but it was just so... refreshingly immersive.Gameplay-wise I'm loving it.  Every enemy can absolutely knock your teeth out if you're not careful, so each encounter becomes a dance of combat.  You have a quick-dash move to dodge out of the way and enemies will distinctly telegraph their attacks so, once you're familiar, you can quickly read the room and know where you don't want to be in the next half-second.The weapons follow a scavenge-to-upgrade/craft path with an array of melee and ranged weapons, plus a unique twist on scavenging: using your gizmos to vacuum useful items out of every nearby cupboard, corpse, and shelf so you can scratch that itch to fish for every little secret/useful item without pulling you out of the immersion of the game.  Just one of many great little details that show how much thought went into the pacing and feel of this game."

It starts out a bit looking like Infinite, but the gameplay is better. The story and characters are relatively awful, the gameplay is very fun, the graphics are great (read: sex bots), the soundtrack is amazing. I played through it twice. With that said you may be wondering why I'd recommend against this game. I started this review about halfway through the game on my first playthrough, and so far I've had to overcome game breaking bugs about every other session, including in just 15 minutes in one case. Most of these bugs force me to reload the game, which are the ones I'm including here. This game is at best a beta test experiment rushed out to market, sloppily tested and unless you feel like being a beta tester for a game that most likely won't ever be patched, I'd recommend to avoid it, at least until all these bugs have been dealt with. I'll list out the fun progress-halting bugs below. If you are a fellow player who has run into your own share of bugs and you wish to add your own stories, I am enabling comments for you to do just that.1) The most frequent bug, with a workaround as of 1.5 (the most recent patch) has to do with player collision. Just about any time you get wedged into a corner, whether it be from enemy special attacks, climbing, or just an unlucky jump on your part, you'll end up stuck inside an object. At this point you can jump to escape the wall you're in, and while I'm sure situations still exist where you can't escape, I haven't run into any. This was previously the worst bug in the game.2) Similar to the last bug and likely due to the same problems, you are prone to randomly fall through the floor. Reload your game when this happens. I have some screenshots of this phenomenon.3) There are many, many game stopping bugs in the form of the game incorrectly reading the current story progress state and locking you out of the next part of a quest. The one I encountered was when I had been farming resources and I had opened a side area called a testing ground when I noticed the elevator had locked itself again. I tried unlocking it again but this was impossible. One time it was randomly open when I loaded a save but I couldn't interact with the elevator. Finally I reloaded a save that was at least an hour before and made my way back to that spot and wouldn't you know it this time the elevator wasn't bugged. This happened both playthroughs, and affects the elevator in the wheat fields. 4) I've run into a strange bug with the alert level in the game. Reminiscent of GTA's star levels, this game has cameras that have alert level 1, they see you, and 2, they see you fighting back. There is an overworld boss where, if you get alert level 2 right before going to it (this involves climbing on a Hawk) your alert level will permanently be level 2 until you reload the game, save, and reload again. Upon replaying the game I have new appreciation of this bug, since you are invincible in the boss area and can spawn infinite enemies that can't get to you, which makes it by far the most efficient farming method in the game.5) This one was unexpected. I mean they all are, but I haven't seen something quite like this in another game. I was wandering a side area (and for a game that encourages exploration, these side areas seem to be fraught with game ending bugs) and I took a puzzle item known as a Candle out of the area, and into a liquid the game regularly refers to as Polymer, some sort of semi-solid you can swim around in. The polymer forces you to press shift to get out of its sides. Anyway, when I took this candle into the polymer, I found that I couldn't press shift to escape it. Nothing could get me out of it. I tried with no luck to get rid of the candle, but my character seemed to have developed a deep attachment to it and just wouldn't let it go. There are other areas in the game that you have to take candles into polymer, but they don't seem to have the same problem.6) So this one isn't game breaking and partly bug, but mostly poor mechanic explanation. There is a very standard door lock in the game, a slit which your little wires go into. You can pick these locks at the very beginning of the game, though the game doesn't explain this. On PC, the game shows left click as the interact button when you are messing with the lock but shows nothing for ""Rotate"". Apparently this is shown as a stick button for a controller. This misleads one into making any number of assumptions about the rotate function, in my case I assumed that if I held click it would rotate. No, the devs just decided not to explain these locks and left out an icon for mouse movement at the side of ""Rotate"". What you have to do is first ""Rotate"" which moves the wires around, then ""Interact"" with your mouse by clicking and judge how rotated you must be by watching the varying angles of the wire. Your goal is to get the lock horizontal, so you triangulate the position of the wires by clicking until you get the position where it unlocks. You won't see this explanation in the game, and console players appear to have a much better one because when you search this you find many PC gamers frustrated and confused, where console players seem to find it intuitive. Perhaps it translates poorly to PC. Either way it doesn't help that there is no icon for the rotate function. I missed several of these doors, assuming I'd need another ability to unlock them since your glove outright says it can't pick locks, and finally I ran into a locked door impeding story progress where I finally found some explanation regarding this. It doesn't stop your progress outright or corrupt your save at least.7) The game has outright crashed on me.Bugs 8 and 9) These were deleted by the steam editorial review, and I only remember the first one. You can permanently get stuck, or at least have to reload, in testing grounds if a candle gets stuck behind objects and you can no longer interact with it. Not sure why the steam review process removed these from my list, I assume it takes steam too long to review things and I had a second edit that made them lose the first one. I don't remember the other bug so you don't get to know what it was, just that it exists.10) After I finished the testing ground under a bunch of mutants, which is an extremely bugged area, I went back to the elevator entrance to see if I could get some stuff I missed and the elevator no longer existed, the room instead led to an infinite fall into the skybox. I couldn't fix this, I was permanently locked out of that area.11) The area for the testing ground in 10 had me run into another bug, when I did a sneak kill on an enemy my guy became permanently diagonal. At first I thought it was my perspective, but then I noticed I couldn't get through doors or over certain objects."

The fact that the late monetization and trailers featured some hot robot ladies also got a lot more people interested, I'm sure.FIRST IMPRESSION:Starting into the game, you get a first glance at the world and its setting, being introduced to the post-war soviet world and the advance of science. A really pleasant and intriguing introduction. This positive feeling lasts for a while longer while the events of the robot massacres unfold, and you are forced underground to escape.OPEN WORLD:Entering the “open world” is when things first get a little annoying. The open world really just feels like a spaced out, liner path with a few building left and right. It basically just follows one main road that you are forced to go down to complete the story, with the testing grounds and enemies scattered at the side of it for some additional action and resources.TESTING GROUNDS:Speaking of the testing grounds, they leave a lot to be desired. They are put into the game to give you something to do besides follow the story, since the open world has nothing to offer for exploration besides them. They hold upgrades for your weapons, for which you will need to complete different types of puzzles coupled with a few enemies along the way. By few, I mean 3 different puzzle-types that just have a different layout each time. They get repetitive and annoying rather quick, but if you want the upgrades, you will have to suffer through them.GAMEPLAY:However, I was still able to put all this aside because I genuinely enjoyed the gameplay itself. The weapons do feel fun, your abilities are strong but not too powerful, unless you used telekinesis like me and killed 10 enemies just by holding one button. But even here, I wish the game had more diversity. I can accept the amount of different enemies, even if I wish there were more, but the amount of guns was lackluster. Especially since you unlock all the weapons within the first 3 hours. Boss fights also felt underwhelming, since you can either view them as bullet sponges or just kill them within 30 seconds using the rocket launcher (don't blame me, It's just too good). Some bosses will also be reused throughout the game. The cameras and repair bots make staying in areas, “exploration” or longer fights also extremely unfun. Yet even though I named all these negative aspects, I for some reason still found myself enjoying shooting the same enemies and using the same two skills throughout the whole game, but for others it might be more crucial.CHARACTERS:Reading through other reviews, I can see that most of the community agrees that the protagonist is annoying and dumb and really just makes you want to skip his dialogue. While the player itself gets a pretty clear view over the situation and story quite early into the game, the protagonist ignores all of it and rather throws childish neglect and weird phrases all over the place. Unfortunately, all other characters that hold any value for the story suffer the same fate. While not as childish as the protagonist, they are extremely shallow and only seem to be placed in the game to serve the story, resulting in a loss of interest in them and no character development in most of them, with a few exceptions. But even those characters that undergo some development again only do so, to fuel the story and try to make the endings at least somewhat “acceptable” or logical. Their change comes unnatural and forced, with no real  sign of commitment in their beliefs.STORY:As I already mentioned, the story isn't exactly hard to figure out, so you will quickly have a good understanding of what direction the story will take. And while I did have moments during my playthrough in which I questioned the logic or connections of things, I just brushed it off and happily accepted it. Towards the end of the game however, I slowly lost hope in the story that had been build up so far, with my fear being confirmed once I beat the game and looked at both endings. The story, while not perfect and quite predictable, can only be described as rushed or changed last second. The scene that gave me this feeling is the one in which you throw away the box with the two rings, a valuable, important and quite useful item you obtain during the story. In order to understand my thoughts now, it is helpful to have completed the game or seen the endings. Up until the point the protagonist decided to throw away the rings, I believed that they were a key part of stopping the evil plans and getting to actually interact with the oh so popular and much advertised twins. After all, two rings for two robots. Charles even tells the protagonist that these two ring are to be put on robots to make them specifically obey their master. And two very powerful assassin robots in the shape of a human women have just the right figure to wear them, too. So to me, it seems quite obvious that the original idea was for the player to fit the rings on the twin's hands and have them join you. Not only would this make for some fun combat and actually give them a proper function in the story, but it would also appease the player, because who wouldn't like the overly sexual robots as their own bodyguards?But by throwing away the rings, simply because Charles tells the protagonist to do so, this path is completely discarded. Instead, the game seemingly forces a new solution and explanation for them and the path you will continue on. The reveal that you had your mind wiped after being attacked by terrorists and lost your wife in the process is completely out of the blue and feels fully forced. This is the game's way of adding “mystery” and “confusion” to the story, while also explaining why the two twins exist. Not because the studio needed a way to monetize their game, but because your dead wife was also a special operator and ballet dancer, who's skills were programmed into these two robots after she died.....Furthermore, Charles's betrayal seems like another weird and unexplainable twist in character, as it is unfortunately common in this game.To me, it just felt like the original ideas and story were cut during the mentioned moment in which the protagonist throws away the rings. Instead, the game continues with an illogical and rushed story, resulting in two very disappointing endings.CONCLUSION:The gameplay was enjoyable on the surface but once you dive a little deeper and really reflect on it, you will be able to find more negatives than positives, hidden by some nice graphics and a mix of popular tropes and ideas from games like Far cry, Bio Shock ect. The game is not bad, but it is heavily let down by its seemingly change in story towards the end, abandoning all reasoning and established lore. The english voice acting and cutscene also do not add, resulting in cut off dialogue and wonky animations. If you can overlook this however and just need an, unfortunately, simple game with some fun gameplay and good graphics, this game will give you just that. If you care about decent world building and good story however, you will find yourself left with a feeling of emptiness, since you won't find it here."

Generally speaking the game feels very good to play. The experience of piloting your character is tight and responsive (minus a few times I got stuck in an object by jumping too much), the art direction and level design are very creative and super tight, and the sound (both diegetic and non) does an excellent job building immersion and setting the mood of the scene appropriately -- also the soundtrack slaps, worth listening to on its own.  An example of where the game did things correctly can be found in the horror sections. In many of these very tense, slow, and methodical areas (with little or no combat) the devs demonstrate true mastery of the tenets of horror by perfectly combining the elements I mentioned previously together with excellent pacing to create some very tense dark and even scary environments and gameplay. These sections are so good in fact that I can't help but wonder whether this used to be a genuine horror game before the Atomic Heart you see now was created. Amazingly, the rest of the game is so bad it manages to ruin this base; a few things stand out as particularly egregious: the main character, the ending, and the open world.  Without giving spoilers I can say that the ending does not resolve a single plot point and feels very tacked on which together with the relatively weak plot leaves the strong central concept of the game feeling wasted on such mediocrity. The plot itself is also very predictable and cliché. Next, the open world. Let me just be clear: this game does not need to be open world. It works far better as a linear horror/immersive sim. The addition of open world sections just makes the game feel more tedious and adds hours for no payoff. This is not Talos I lobby style open world this is an attempt to be Far Cry and it fails horrendously. There are way too many enemies, travel time is slow and boring on foot and clunky in a car, and other than hunting for weapon mods the open world areas don't actually serve any purpose and don't impact the story progression at all. The only explanation I can come up with for those sections being in the game is some kind of focus group requirement: ""must have open world.""  Finally, the worst thing of all: the main character. He is the most unlikable, idiotic, and obnoxious character I have ever seen in any piece of media bar none; that he's so stupid is insulting to the audience, and to make things worse he has a talking glove that drops massive exposition bombs on you periodically -- completely destroying any chance that the you have to think for yourself even a single time. Every puzzle is explained to you in detail, every chance they get the talking glove explains what the current objective is and how to do it and where to go and ""oh, don't forget to do X and Y and Z."" It's infuriating! The game wants to be an immersive sim so badly but it's not possible to immerse yourself in a character written this poorly, and especially not one that talks as much as he does. Imagine if the hacker in System Shock narrated the entire game to you while you played: ya, it's really that bad. Overall, I do not recommend this game -- at least not at full price."

One thing I want to commend is the attention to detail with weapons. Round in the chamber with a partially full magazine? Protagonist conducts a tactical reload and retains the partial magazine instead of dropping it! Weapon is dry? Protagonist inserts a full magazine and racks the slide or charging handle. Want to have a round in the chamber and a full magazine? Reload an AK with a full magazine a second time, and you'll get 31 rounds (1 chambered) instead of just 30. Excellent, excellent attention to detail. Someone clearly knew what they were doing and I love it. That kind of autistic artistic attention is everywhere in this gameFew hours in so far, loving the game. It has that unique kind of European weirdness that you get in games like Cryostasis, STALKER, and Darkwood. Having said that, the gameplay is incredibly smooth and the engine is very stable. I'm impressed with the day-one performance, especially considering some of the garbage that's come out lately.The game does remind me of Bioshock in that your character gets thrust into a utopian-dystopic world, and has to adjust to a very strange and weird society. There are RPG systems integrated into a first person shooter format. The world is fascinating, with audio logs and great environmental storytelling that flesh out the plot and the lore. The combat has some great meat and heft to it, with great animations and dismemberment. The dodge and melee are engaging, and I usually am not a fan of first person cleaver simulators (though I really liked Darktide, too).Two suggestions I have for anyone wanting to get the most out of their experience: goto the game's start menu and navigate to audio. Turn on english subtitles. Goto the gameplay menu and choose Russian audio for the spoken language. The immersion is greatly helped by this change.I also suggest downloading Flawless Widescreen for 21:9 users. Makes adjusting the FOV in real time a cinch. Devs should have included a FOV slider from the get go, but oh well.I personally don't care about the political gripes some people have with the game. Games, like film, can be works of art even when they come from places where the governing body is AIDS."

Together with his  robotic glove/ full time nurse they go on a magical adventure fighting robots in a tour of the local science institute where unfortunately, due to the abundance of never ending robots P-3 experiences sensory overload which make him big mad. This I thought was particularly effective as a plot device as I began to feel rage to at the sheer amount of enemies I had to fight at once and to add even more realism, as I was playing a handicapped person, could not fight back properly and was constantly pushed over by the robots and other assorted bullies. I felt completely powerless in these situations and could only relate even more with P-3 when he could only cry ''crispy critters!'' in response to the bullying. As for the story it felt realistic to my character as P-3 could not keep up with events as they were unfolding, rather, P-3 would figure it out long after I, the player, had (like 3 or 4 hours after, maybe more). Yet, this only served to flesh out P-3 ever more as because he could not match the intellect of his peers I estimate this is why he feels he needs to constantly belittle his glove, the few friendly robots in the science and the people closest to him. Overall Atomic Heart is a realistic and grounded tale of the struggles mentally handicapped soldiers with rage issues must persevere every day."

Prey (2017) was really good, and better than this in some areas, but the PC version of that game is a mess, and for whatever reason, Arkane never went back and fixed its major issues.During a pretty rough time for PC gamers wanting good performance out of their games, we've been hit with a lot of poorly optimized releases:Thankfully, Atomic Heart runs really well, and the only real issue I've found with its settings is that there's no FoV slider, and the default FoV is a measly 80° horizontal. If you want to change this, you'll have to use , but it's very easy to set up.The main character is probably the game's weakest point. Most of the time he's rude to everybody for seemingly no reason, but at other points, especially later into the game, he actually becomes somewhat likable for brief moments. It's really weird.The other weak point is that combat encounters honestly don't last long enough. The enemies are very easy to deal, and not enough waves of them are thrown at you at a time.

I was rather enjoyed upon receiving the ending of the game, you see I chose to fight Sechenov. Now, without spoiling the story to the best of my ability I will wholeheartedly say that it was a very surprising plot twist of which came directly another plot twist that was second to yet another plot twist. This game reminds me of the Metro series not only because of it's Russian setting but the immaculate story telling through uses that require one to be attent at practically all times if he or she wishes to understand the story being presented. I for one wished to learn more about the story and try my absolute best to not skip over too many details. This goal was ever-so-harder to complete considering that I decided to start off my Atomic Heart journey on the hardest difficulty. Despite having a more challenging approach to the game than many others I was able to appreciate the combat system put into play by the developers. I must say though, this game depends on you looting very often to upgrade your gear and once you have found a good melee weapon, that might as well be ""Game Over"".  So, without bending your ear anymore than I have already (If you have read so far into this review) I will summarize my experience very quickly.Story: AmazingGameplay (combat): smooth - melee focus but guns are an optionGameplay (standard): The very few times that cars are presented, they are not the greatest option as the                  catch on fire very often and are hard for someone like me to drive. You need to collect as many                  resources as possible early-game so you'll be ""overpowered"" as some say very quickly. Also the                  ""dismantle"" options at the NORA stations are underrated and very helpful.Voice Acting: Not the best, though it was translated from Russian and translations are often sloppy or hard to                  understand considering a large culture gap. But overall, I found the characters to be rather unique,                  especially the main character despite his constant swearing or hard-to-take-seriously remarks. Setting: Immaculate, Spectacular, undoubtedly amazing. Such a sci-fi world seems to put myself in Awe. The                  futuristic world with senses of our world (during the 50s) is so very refreshing. I am an American                  who takes pride in such a fact and the idea of the Soviets winning the 2nd world war, astonishing.                  Though I for one do not find Communism appealing, the focus of the game was far from Political. Overall, I would give this game a 10/10 and I hope that you, the very reader, did or will too."

But I couldn't finish it. I encourage you to take the risk and see if you like it but I personally can not recommend it. The environment and the setting is very cool and intriguing, and with upgrades, your abilities get really useful and cooler to use through out the game. But I have gripes with aspects of this game that I cannot overlook. Glitches occur which stop you from picking up certain weapon upgrades. Especially what got me was the AK sight. There is a room you are locked in, you have to pick up a ball that slides out from an area and place it in another. There is some invisible wall that prevents you from collecting it and progressing, causing you to reload or give up on it forever. If this gets fixed I might finish the game.Combat needs work. The game wants you to conserve ammo but there is no block for the melee, only dodge. The block is a ""shield"" acquired through upgrades. It does not pull up fast enough and is more for long ranged defense. The only worthwhile defense is the ""no damage dodge"" which seemed to only work a fraction of the timeBosses are meh. The first is impossible to get any space from and was pretty annoying to fight. Mainly running around the arena the whole time and doing big area attacks, then getting up in your face and doing attacks on you that not even the ""shield"" can withstand. After, the next boss fight were two different, but similar, robots meant to be big and bad looking only for me to take them out almost instantly.  I'll add that I was playing the hardest difficulty expecting some sort of challenge but it just feels lack luster on enemies, and slow on game play. I don't need COD or DOOM type speeds but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game play is just too slow. I do, however, feel that this game would've fit in comfortably with speed shooters, given it's style, but it seems speed was sacrificed for more thought out and tactical attacks to show off the abilities in the game. It's not a bad thing to show off the abilities, but I do wish there was more haste in the game play. Even a sprint option would add so much to this game but it simply does not exist. Again I encourage you to play and see for yourself because it is fun. I've followed this game since 2018 so in conclusion I will say I was disappointed with the state of its release and game play."

So far this is the best since Prey. I want to say I like it more than Prey but will hold out. Atmosphere is very Bioshock. Which I love. It has a lot of good things going for it. I hardly use guns because the melee is actually quite good. Similar to Dying Light/Dead Island and the FPS game play feels great. No crashes, runs very well.Audio mixing could be better."

Some clunky parts, but overall really well done... but...The main character's voice acting is awful, probably some of the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game.I'm not sure how this guy got the job, or if it was a last minute hire, or what, but he is really really bad.Also, everyone else's writing is decent, his, is again just awful, like what happened? I genuinely want to know because it takes you out of the immersion a lot and he isn't a likable character at all.Great besides the floppy turd of a protagonist.Needs FOV adjustment badly."

The combat is great, the story so far is intriguing and the world is beautiful. There is a wide variety of enemies to fight with many different attacks to dodge and weapon customisation is in depth and fantastic. A small amount of almost unnoticeable bugs are rarely present that do not hinder the game experience. I highly recommend this game to many people who enjoy fast pace games with strategy involved."
