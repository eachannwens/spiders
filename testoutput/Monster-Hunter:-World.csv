Honestly there's so much to say about this game. Been a fan of the series ever since Tri, and I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switch, which is dope).Let's start with the cons because I think it's more important to see if the cons are worth looking past if you're on the fence about buying.Cons:- weapon designs are less creative than older titles. Everyone knows that this game is notorious for taking a bland weapon design, slapping on a few monster parts, then calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from. HOWEVER, lots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic. With the addition of layered weapons, this is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfit- monster list is less diverse than older titles. Let's make a comparison between MHW and MHGU. With the addition of Iceborne, there are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU. However, in MHW, about 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo). So that leaves around 63 monsters. 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them. So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game. MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the game, with 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there. Additionally, the monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher. There's giant frogs, big mammoths, more monkeys, giant crabs, giant snakes, giant spiders, etc. Keep in mind, a lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGU, whereas the opposite is not true. Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHW, but not nearly to the degree of it solving the problem.- it's a MH game, so grinding is a huge part of the game. This point is mainly for people who've never played the series. MH is a grind. To get better weapons and armor, you have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need. Then you need to grind it again for the armor. And if you want other armors or weapons, you have to grind those too. With the addition of Iceborne, if you want to unlock the true endgame content, you need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters. Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc. Grind, grind, grind. If you are not a fan of repetition, this is NOT the game for you. If you're a veteran of the series, this point should basically be meaningless. Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?One thing that I think is more of a misunderstanding or neutral point is the gameplay difficulty. In the old games, G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne. There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard. In the old games, monster animations were a lot less telegraphed. Some attacks would happen with very little warning visually, and sometimes you had to guess which move would come out. Healing was different because you ate a potion, then stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish. Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate. Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations. Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor. Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgiving, you took more damage, had less skills available, and healing made you a sitting duck.In MHW, monster animations are much more telegraphed, which is much more fair imo. It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 frames, then unleashing a move that could kill you. This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage. If you got hit, chances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else. Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish. Again, this is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls. Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skill, you can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill. Armor parts have more slots for decorations, so skills are even more accessible. Finally, armor parts have more upgrade levels. This is more just putting 2 and 2 together. If you have more upgrades to your armor, you take less damage.People have complained that MHW is a lot easier than older games, but really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal. If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older games, don't upgrade your armor so high, don't use the ""meta"" sets, use less decorations so that you have less skills, and stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions. The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal. You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to. But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easy, then that's a personal issue.If you can look past these issues or if they don't seem that bad, then you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!- huge QOL improvements over previous games. Mobility, crafting, movesets, loading times, etc. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll love the changes. Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are gone, everything feels so much smoother and streamlined. Farming supplies is so much easier, weapon trees and stats are way more clear, item boxes are all over the base instead of a single location, etc.- graphics are beautiful. Everything just looks so good. Honestly not much else to say here. You just have to see it for yourself- gameplay is very satisfying. All the weapons have their own unique playstyles and all of them are viable when you learn how to use them. There's so much to explore when you learn the small nuances of each weapon and learn how certain moves can help position you for success. The game rewards you for learning monster moves, their weaknesses, how to prep for the fight, etc. And when it all comes together, there's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off. Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they die, but to each their own.- Plenty of content for months of replayability. As I mentioned, this game is a grind. You grind for armor, weapons, supplies, upgrades, equipment, decorations, etc. Grinding is part of the core gameplay, so once you finish the story, there's still plenty more to work towards- Iceborne is an amazing expansion. It basically doubled the game's content and introduced a real endgame. Weapons got upgraded, movesets were expanded. Everything just got better, and with more monsters to boot. A must have imo.There's so much to explore and grind that it will keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of the series or are on the fence about the purchase and you can look past the cons, this game is more than worth the purchase. And at the end of the day, you're fighting beasts, dinosaurs, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragons. What more could you want?"

After seeing lots of positive feedback I decided to jump on this game and I was very pleasantly surprised.For those who don't know what this game is about, it is what the name tells you – a monster hunter game. You hunt monsters, gather resources, craft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear. That’s it, very simple formula, but gameplay is really amazing.The game has a story mode which purpose is to teach you about everything slowly. Step by step you complete the assignments, unlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins. The grind is in no way bad in this game. Yes sometimes when you’re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of time, but most of the time you’ll be hunting strong monsters.Hunting is not as simple as it sounds. First you need to track the monster by finding its tracks which could take some time if the monster is completely new for you.There are lots of weapons to choose and you need to learn the weapon you choose because they all are different and can change your play style completely.It plays like an action game where you attack and dodge. But the fun part is different monsters. They have different moves which you need to learn, you need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks. You can’t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it. This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level. First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster. You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items. You can also use other items like traps to capture the monster, but first you need to weaken it. You can cut-off and break various parts of monsters, like cutting off the tail for example. After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor. Oh and one more thing – you can use environment to your advantage, like shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster. Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster you’re fighting.You also have a little helper called Palico. It’s a cat-like being which helps you in the world. He can do some damage to the monsters or heal you. You can craft armor and weapons for him and make him cute little kitty.Number of monsters is pretty good, but some of them feel very similar to each other. They look similar and their moves are very similar. I wish we had more completely different monsters. I know dragons are fun and cool looking but it’s a game, developers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a bear-like monster which could give you a deathly bear-hug?I love this collaboration with other games like Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy (which lets you turn your Palico into Mog) or Witcher. There’s even a Witcher quest-line and a monster from Witcher universe to fight.From time to time there are events happening which add more variety in quests and craftable gear. They usually are pretty challenging and require teamwork.The game can be played solo or coop. You can play solo but if you’re not very good you’ll have big problems defeating stronger monsters, so you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you. Or you can jump into someone’s session who’s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of you. Surprisingly playing with random players are pretty good most of the time. But sometimes it’s either too hard to find someone playing a certain quest or people just leave the quest. That’s when you need to message your friends and ask for help.Graphically the game looks pretty good. It’s not something special, I guess it’s running on an old engine, but overall graphics are good looking. Performance on the other hand could be better. It’s not bad, but if you want to have 60fps on max settings you’ll need a powerful PC. The world is well crafted and locations look amazing. Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discover.Monster Hunter World is a wonderful game and I recommend it to anyone who likes action games and it’s a must have for coop lovers."

DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission). Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)---Please upvote this so new players can see this and really be able to enjoy the game."

Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set. It's slow going for me, but I don't mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 20 minutes or more of pure adrenaline-pulsing bliss where a well-timed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the line. This game is what I dreamed video games would be when I was a kid in the mid 1980's: it's fun, it's drop-dead gorgeous and runs at a nice buttery-smooth 60fps (on my RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x with 16GB RAM), and overall it's just insanely fun."

Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious, ""do all the quests."" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!"

Excellent fixes, great work from the developers and community managers - little to no BS, mouse fixes, network fixes, prolonged events, and continued support for those with continued network issues. While a clumsy launch is always best to avoid, the gameplay and response from Capcom to the issues they've caused has been more than acceptable.

You pick your character and your cat buddy and next thing you know is you get thrown onto a massive walking volcano. When reaching the main hub - while still confused about the start of your journey - you will be overwhelmed by a lot of choices and stuff that's part of the game: 14 different weapons - each with its own playstyle - tons of collectibles, craftable stuff, ammunition, potions, powders, bugs, plants, ... the list just goes on and doesn't seem to finish.Then there are main quests, side quests, event quests, special assignments to take part in.After picking a mission, you get thrown into the land and have to find out how stuff works, there's little to no explanation. You get some sort of a visualized guide by flies that show you the correct path - but they will confuse you sooner or later.When fighting a monster - while still not knowing how to fight due to the lack of tutorials - you might die a lot.Now this is the part that will either break you or where the game finally clicks. I stopped playing twice and didn't think I'd pick it up; because of the tough fights that didn't seem to make sense to me and because of the collect-athon that just confused the heck out of me.Well, I'm now close to 140h into the game and can't wait for the Iceborne expansion.What more can I say... the game made me want to play on and on and on at one point. The fights were challenging and the moment the monster got caught or died was super satisfying and made you want to go for ""just one more Monster before I quit"".I definitely recommend this game and urge you to give this game one, maybe two chances when you think ""No, this is not for me."" It most definitely is!"

One specific set of these  items are called defender items. Right off the bat Capcom gives you top tier weapons. Why? Because they want you to breeze through the early stages of the game and buy the DLC. Im not saying this was a terrible idea. In fact it was a good move for people that wanted to skip early instances of grind. The problem was how they presented it. New players coming into the game  would see that these items had better stats than anything else that they could get their hands on. There was no warning or caution. Even after beating bosses until  late game anything that is craftworthy is still outdone by these defender items. As of  right now im replaying  the game on a new character without the gear and it's  more fun because i actually have to learn attack patterns instead of facetanking and using the same move over and over. (it actually works like that with guardian gear). This is a very minor issue which is why im giving this a good review because it's still a bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good game. And the expansion is massive so use  them to your liking. However you're paying money for the base game too and it shouldn't be spoiled just because you didn't know any better. tldr defender items and guardian gear ruin the novelty of an actual progression system until iceborne. don't use them if you want to enjoy mhw to its fullest.

FPS altered if leaving it on. You can hardly tell the difference in quality.FPS cost: MEDIUMAnisotropic Filtering: Off.The detail of the terrain from some angles. You will not notice the difference.FPS cost: MEDIUMWater Reflection: On.I honestly can't remember if this was on in the PS4, but I liked the detail. FPS may vary.FPS cost: LOWSH Diffuse Quality: Low.There is this thing in the game where objects that are very close to you - more specifically, between your hunter, and the camera - get diffused, transparent and leave some dots all over the object. Supposedly, you can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this option, but it's very taxing on FPS, so I leave it on Low.FPS cost: MEDIUM Dynamic Range: 64-Bit. Left on 32-Bit and didn't like the colors, fortunately not taxing.FPS: LOWZ-Prepass: On.I honestly have no idea what this is about, even if the game tells you. Had no issues with FPS drops, so I left it On.FPS cost: LOWAfter all that, I can review the game for what it is, but a lot of comments here already explained what it is about, how does it feel, what works, what doesn't; so I'm gonna try my best to do a brief review.Had already spent 350+ hours on PS4 with Hunter Rank 179; I personally love this game, it's one of my favorites of the year so far. Haven't played a MonHun title before, but I can tell there were a lot of improvements, like real open areas and be able to move while drinking potions.The game consists on hunting monsters to carve them to get rare materials to build weapons, armor, and accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters. Rinse and repeat.Character customization is deep enough, you may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunter, and palico. (Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with you)You have 14 different weapons to choose from, and it's fairly balanced.It has no PvP, the game is about hunting monsters, not other hunters.It has a story mode but I've find it not that engaging personally.It has multiplayer, you can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area: scavenging for bones, items, gems, and of course, hunting monsters.You have a HUB where you can improve your hunter with lots of stuff, and more options are unlocked as you progress during the main story.There's also a gathering hub that no one uses because there's no smithy, nor botany, nor melder, nor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera; the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena quests. You can finish the game under 80-120 hours, depending on your pacing. But I would say ""finish"", because a lot of content opens up afterwards, also the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the year.Now, it has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell you, THEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. More spefically, about the disconnections. And guess what? As of today, seems that issue was fixed... at least on the PS4. I had no idea why it happens on PC, but the port job is not perfect. You will face with random disconnections all the time, so get used to it until they fix the problem. Disconnecting from a room doesn't kick you out of the game though.You will notice a little bit of lag on the controls, specially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a quest, your hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest. It's a minor detail, but it bothers me sometimes.Some users have issues with FPS. nVidia users suggest NOT to update your video card drivers, but updates fixed my problem in AMD Radeon.Some users are complaining about the keyboard-mouse controls, I would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position. I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great. The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout instead, since it's an Xbox One port.Speaking of Xbox, I tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectly.Graphics are great, music is great, gameplay is satisfying, it has a LOT of replayability, even after finishing the main story.If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into, I would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter World.If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into WITHOUT disconnections, I would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter World.Better yet, I would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying it.So, personally, I recommend this game for its gameplay and replayability, but maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnections, it definitely can be better."

19,3,Aranrúth,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042897777/,217,2,1,"2,948.1","Posted: October 7, 2020",39,0,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/3fdfc1d7a2405a10cfb8ad060fac2330e2f9193f.jpg,"As a part of buying a new Nvidia GTX 1060 , I received a game for free named Monster Hunter World. A game, which I had no clue what it was all about, mainly due to my lack of knowledge of the previous Monster Hunter installments from Capcom. I didnt even try to play the game, until one month later.It starts with a character who travels to ""New World"", a land mass filled with monsters. Along with the Research Commission that studies the land and its monsters, from a region named ""Astera"". The player begins the game by commencing a quest in ""Ancient Forest"". On hindsight it feels, along with the character, I had also commenced my ""journey"" - a journey to the amazing world of Monster Hunter. What an amazing journey it has been. How do I even begin to explain?MHW + its expansion iceborne, consists of many distinct regions like - Ancient Forest, Wildspire Waste, Coral Highlands, Rotten Vale, Elder's Recess, Hoarfrost Reach and Guiding Lands. Each and every region, along with its tundra, the materials, the flora and fauna, the wildlife are distinctly different from one another. The joy I had in discovering the regions, even the smallest of them, were nothing short of amazing. The amount of time spent on collecting materials from these regions is insane, since there is always something you would have missed.  The gameplay is very simple yet complicated - like most modern games, the player starts with the most basic of armor/weapons and eventually progress by defeating stronger monsters,thereby getting better weapons/gear. The real beauty of the game is that it allows so many different ways to achieve this, with the help of 14 types of weapons. Weapons, which i have never heard, seen or used before in any games. Each and every weapon is unique, has its pros and cons and not to mention their unique moves. I started the base game with dual blades, switched to bow till i reached a certain level and then changed to my favourite weapon charged blade. My current go to weapon being Long sword. I can keep on writing about the weapons, but it is something a player has to experience, persist and then slowly try to master it. Players will have a total different experience in taking on the same monsters with different weapons, the materials needs might be different and skills attached to it as well. MHW is not a hack and slash game - the player needs to understand the mechanics of weapons, how to build the gear around it, the preparation - in identifying the monsters weakness, the ""food"" the player needs to eat from canteen before a battle, how to use the environments in players favour, how/when to use traps. Last, defintely not the least and certainly the most important - studying/understanding monster movements , there by developing positional awareness in battles. This is crucial and is the main difference between a good hunt and tedious one where the player rage quits. The concept is simple, but learning curve is steep and the player needs to persist with it, in-order to have the best game experience. Monsters can still wreck you even after this :)The monsters in monster hunter world - starting with the Great Jagras to the big daddy of 'em all Fatalis - all unique and distinct.  Their strengths, weakness, movements and attacks are so different - that it shows the amount of work Capcom has put into them. I have lost count on the amount of monsters and their ""variants"" available in this game. This is nothing short of exceptional. Monsters are so diverse and so much in much in number that I can write an entire section dedicated only about the monsters in the game.I also had the pleasure of discovering something I have never discovered before (or shd i say avoided ) - multiplayer. This is the 1st game that i have played in muti player mode , since mostly i prefer only the single player side of things.  The in game experience quadriples when you go to an hunt with a full team of 4 - something i enjoy very much to this day and always brings a smile to my face. I have been extremely lucky in becoming friends with exceptional group of players and to this day we hunt as team. And that list just keeps on growing.The game is not without its fair share of issues. This is not a game known for graphical fidelity like many open world games, but still needs immense GPU power to play it smoothly. The online server disconnects, glitches like playes landing on impossible areas and not to mention the insane grind, in-order to get jewels, weapons and armor. Despite this, the game is still extremely addictive. I have played close to 2650 hours - managed to learn and use (frequently) 7 diffrerent types of weapons and still play with my friends as much as possible. There are so many things I have missed to address. This is mainly due to the immense depth of MHW, the amount of layers the game has, that I find it next to impossible to explain each and every aspect of it. Not to mention the ""events"" which keeps on pulling players to the game as frequently as possible - hats of Capcom, you have created an absolute beast.MHW - a game I never wanted to play and here I am, playing it almost every other day. The journey which commenced with me stepping into a world completely new, still continues and I am pretty much sure is gonna last for a long time. Quoting one of my friends - its that time of the day - time to bully the monsters.Peace out."
20,3,Flatulence Florence,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghost_turtle/,637,18,1,130.7,"Posted: August 22, 2018",611,12,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/19073d4eb32f4da9829b1a9ccc9488dd80ed29f1.jpg,"Ive been waiting for something like this for a long time. This game has single handily murdered my RL commitments within its first 2 weeks of being out. This review may be geared more toward newcomers such as myself. It has some issues Ill get into, but I'm also gonna explain what it is, and why it’s so damn fun. So wtf is it then? In a nut shell, there are 5 big open worlds/maps. These maps have huge monsters that you have to track down, kill, and harvest their glorious innards. You yourself do not level up. You’ll pick from 1 of 14 weapons (which is like your class, and you can switch em out as well if you wanna try others) and craft better weapons and armor from the parts you farm from monsters. You have a central hub (Astera) you’ll probably spend a lot of your time in, running side missions, while also progressing through the story and unlocking new maps, monsters, and adding/upgrading beneficial NPC hubs  within Astera. There’s so much content in this game it’s ridiculous. Things will start out slow, confusing and pretty damn difficult. You’ll prob have to google some sh*t and some of the fights, especially your first time going in, can last up to 30 minutes. You’ll have to learn the fights, learn the environments, learn your weapon, and learn what items you’ll need to bring. You craft almost everything in the game, from the coatings on your arrows, food, traps, to different potions for different situations. Everything is harvestable from the world; plants, nuts, animals, bugs, fishing, etc.As you progress through the story you’ll go up in Hunter Rank. The story itself is pretty much one long tutorial and as you complete story missions your Hunter Rank goes up, allowing you to take on stronger monsters as you become more powerful.You can play the entire game SP or MP. For me I would say 60-70% of my time has been spent playing with RL friends. This is were the fun and the problems come in.As of right now MHW has a pretty bad connection problem. From what Ive read, it’s worse for people who try and run match making exclusively. Me and my friends alone, we have connection issues but it’s not nearly as bad as others are reporting. I'm not saying the problem doesn’t exist, but for us its not unplayable.   Honestly it has varied day-to-day. Some days are worse than others. When it does happen, it literally take 5-10 seconds to reconnect. Sh*t can be frustrating at times, especially mid fight, but it’s not something that's constantly happening to us.Another thing, when you’re out on a hunt, you can send up an “SOS”. If you or someone else needs a part from a certain monster, they can respond to this sos and now you have a party of 4 going after the same target. This is the only way I play MP when not playing with friends, and again, I haven’t had a terrible experience with it. It has issues like the rest of the game’s connection issues but nothing as broken as Ive read in various forums. I have never tried to connect to match making so I cant comment on that outside what others are saying. There are currently 2 patches Capcom have been testing that are showing up in steamdb. I should also note that I usually dont play until after 7pm est.Other user complaints have been about performance. Again, maybe I’m just lucky. There are reportedly fixes but I haven’t had to do anything. 980ti/i5 4670k/latest Nvidia driver and I’m running 50-60 fps mid-high settings @2560x1440. I do get dips in the 40s but again, nothing game breaking, not for me at least.So thats pretty much it. Ive had a sh*t ton of fun running through the game with friends. Ive not played a good MP game in awhile and this game definitely hits the spot. There is just so much stuff to do, goals to set on what you wanna do next, helping each other out and so on. The above issues are from my personal experience and in no way am I saying those problems don’t exist. It’s a f*cking fantastic game that’s unfortunately getting review bombed due to Capcom’s slow (or almost lacking I should say) response.On 22 Aug, the same day I posted this review, Capcom patched the game. The patch was intended to reduce connection issues for folks while they continued to iron it out. Ive had about 30 hrs play time since, and have honestly had 0 connection issues, playing as I do, mentioned in the review. Playing with friends in our own lobbies, or running SOS missions. I have had 0 disconnects, 0 MW errors. Every single MP mission Ive started with friends or ran in SOSs since the patch has ended without a single connection drop. Some people are still reporting issues with match making or joining random lobbies. I cant comment on these issues since I dont ever join them."

With the connection issues gone and several bugs fixed, it can only go upwards from here. Also, new content is added every few weeks together with events.Overall the game is a step up from the Monster Hunter series in both graphical terms and gameplay wise.<Comparison to previous MH titles>- Gathering is much easier and faster- More ways to use the environment to your advantage (dropping boulders, sliding downhill to launch an aerial attack and so on)- A slinger which is used primarily for shooting flash bombs, sonic bombs, etc, but can also be used to travel around the environment faster (hooking onto a wingdrake for example)- Turf wars between monsters, which can turn the hunt to your favor- Scoutflies which lead you towards points of interest or monster traces (basically they work like a gps)- Usage of armor skills got way easier, you shouldnt have any problems figuring them out even if this is your first MH- Customizable cat companion, with plenty of gadgets to help you out- Damage indicators which let you know if you are attacking a weak spot or just arent doing any damage at all- No G-rank, this is the only downside reallyTL;DR: Game is good, for both newcomers and fans of the MH franchise"

BUT.. I feel myself getting stronger and stronger, I’m starting to get a feel for my weapons and the monsters.The combat feels solid, the environments feel alive and the game has this Japanese cutesy vibe that I didn’t think I’d be into but it’s excellent.I can’t think of how to describe how good this game is, you just need to play it.It just feels ‘right’ and complete and it absorbs you.If it’s on sale definitely get it or pay full price and get it.

And what I got from that, after thinking about it, was that ANY game is a repetition game. Every game out there from FPS to RPG will be the same thing over and over until you decide to stop playing it. Every Dota2 match, every CS:GO match, every PUBG matches are the SAME if you think about it. In every one of those games you get toxic or chill teammates, you get a good or a bad match, you play on the same maps with the same available characters on the current META. It's not because MHW is essentially a single player game that it's boring or scripted. It feels like the monsters are alive and thinking about their actions, due to random factors + AI it really feels like a more challenging opponent than 1v1 a human being. Honestly, I've played CS:GO, Overwatch and many other FPS all at high level and the most amazing thing about monster hunter is that ALL of those games NEVER served me with the challenge MHW does. MHW requires a lot of skill, it's mechanically challenging and the best part is that you cannot blame YOUR faults on your teammates. This game taught me to own my sh*t and learn from my mistakes.If you are thinking about buying this game, you should do it, and appreciate the art that this game is. This game deserves to be appreciated, respected and enjoyed by everyone that likes well-made and challenging games.Thank you, CAPCOM, for this amazing experience.And yeah, I'm still gonna play it every day like I've been doing since release."

I would not recommend using defender/guardian equipment for low/high rank because it pretty much nullifies any improvement you might have going through the game. There are several mods on nexusmods that improve quality of life as well and they're very easy to install (though I don't personally like HP/Damage etc. meters existing but ultimately that's up to you). I play on a 5 year old 970 and can manage 60 fps with mixed high/medium settings. CPU usage is where this game is a bit high though I think that has improved a bit since they removed denuvo.During sales you'll usually save a bit if you buy the bundle with iceborne but if you aren't looking for a heavy time investment then base world by itself is still decent with challenging quests like arch tempered monsters, though they don't let you use the clutch claw/new moves unless you have iceborne which is pretty lame.I recommend trying out every weapon in the training area and even looking up weapon guides because sometimes the game doesn't explain things very well. I don't really know why I waited so long to write this but I almost have too much to say if I really kept going. I've met a lot of amazing people and had a lot of fun over the years and I am looking forward to future installments and even future mod development for this game. I still enjoy it even after all this time which says enough I suppose."

Got it during winter sale  and it's been just 2 months but the game totally got me engaged. Starting of with the story, It's real fun to know new monsters as the story progresses but as we move on it really gets challenging as their ability enhances. To be a better monster hunter one really has to know every bit of moves the monster has to offer. The game is such that once you hunt a monster u will again hunt the same for its loot and also to be better against it and also to craft it's incredible armor and upgrade it to its fullest. So at the end of the day the basic mantra is (Hunt-Loot-Craft-Repeat). Well seeing this people will say whats the fun in it, but trust me I thought the same and now I can't get rid of it. It can be played either on single player or multiplayer but more the player the more fun and less hard it is, but still even if its hard getting fainted also has fun in it's own way. The worst part about this game is having disconnection issues during multiplayer even though one has a stable internet connection . One more issue is that sometimes while playing if someone gets fainted or tail of a monster get cut the screen freezes for a split second or disconnection issue pops up. Coming to the best part of the game, there are a lot to mention but below I will mention a few which i truly love:1-> Yawning of monsters just melts my heart.2-> Palicio eating food and that purr sound.3-> Meeooooow4-> Poogie greeting you everytime to visit your base.5-> Kulu stealing eggs and eating it in the most fun way as possible.6-> The animation of cats when you order a foodBTW this review is pre iceborne."

There's so many positive things to say about MHW and MHW:I that it's difficult to summarise in a review...There's not really much to say about the story, since it really isn't the point of Monster Hunter. It does the job, it's a little goofy, it's fun, it has positive moments. The story only really serves to introduce monsters. A problem this game has, that MH:R doesn't, is seamless story co-op. If it's the first time attempting a mission, you need to watch all the cutscenes solo and you need to back out and restart the mission with your friend once you've both seen it. This didn't really detract from me playing the game, but it was a bit tedious for co-op. Personally, I prefer to try out some missions solo before I attempt them with friends, so this didn't bother me much. There might be a mod to fix it somewhere on NexusMods.There are basically no games that manage to pull off the hard sell of a ""biological ecosystem"" right - including games which revolve around animals and creatures. This game is, by far, the greatest exception to that rule. Each environment seems to be painstakingly created by hand in a way that feels natural while also blending in the iconic ""zone combat"" feel that every Monster Hunter game has. The terrain itself in each area opens up a lot of possibilities in combat - ""Should I send the monster off that cliff?"" ""Should I drop those giant rocks and icicles on it?"" ""Should I get height and attack it from above?"" ""Should I destroy that dam and sweep the monster away?"" - all of these things, and more, are possible. Each location also tells a story through its scenery, if you really absorb the surroundings. And to top it all off, there are other creatures that you can catch (some rare, and under specific circumstances), that have background to them that really makes them feel like part of the world. The monsters themselves have interactions with eachtother and the environment (with some being quite hard to notice unless you're actually looking for them) in very natural ways that do an amazing job of establishing the food chain. No other ""monster hunting"" style game (let alone game) comes even close to MHW in these regards.There is an absolutely massive selection of weapons and armour in the game, with an absurd amount of ""build potential"". There are 14 unique weapon types, with different playstyles and strengths. Each weapon at least 35 different end-tree variations. You can design builds around creating explosions, builds around putting monsters to sleep, builds around the core elemental wheel, raw builds, builds that maximise specific combat aspects of your weapons. Some weapons you can even customise further through things like augmentation, using specific parts (if they're a bowgun), and decorations. Speaking of which... While many armour sets have bonuses that are incredibly important, you can always give your gear decorations to imbue ""perks"" (more damage? want to break monster limbs more often? more criticals? more elemental? more health? + so much more). And not even all of it is combat oriented. There are plenty of perks in the game that can be used to give you an edge on some of the more casual content, like gathering materials. ON TOP of all this customisation, there's the canteen, where you can create and eat specific meals catered to your playstyle, and plenty of consumable items that you can collect and use to assist you. So yeah, there's a ton of possibilities in MHW when it comes to your playstyle, and how you want to play. For every monster in the game, there's two to three armour sets, in each RANK. And they all look pretty cool, though because they look different depending on the gender of your character, there are cases where the male armours look better than the female ones, and vice versa. You will also absolutely look like a gremlin for the first part of the game, where you're basically just putting on whatever you've got. It does get better, and way later into the game you unlocked layered armor sets, so keep your chin up.There's a lot to say about the gameplay. The monsters themselves are incredibly well designed. There are rarely moments in MHW that feel ""unfair"" to me, an endgame player. The hitboxes are well defined. The movesets are flashy and varied. The roars, sounds, and musical scores are all beautifully crafted. Some monsters, specifically in the late game, have extremely cinematic attacks that easily make the jaw drop. There's only one instance of a monster that I did not enjoy fighting, and it is part of a collaboration event, not even a core part of the game. Outside of hunting monsters, you can relax and fish. You can catch creatures to place your apartment. In Iceborne, you can REALLY decorate your apartment. You can befriend Felynes and other Tailraiders out in the field on expeditions, trade with them, build reputation and do treasure maps, while unlocking cool gear for your Palico (your sidekick) that can significantly help you when you're fighting monsters. In Iceborne, you can do Lynian Researcher tasks, where you take pictures of monsters, creatures, and people doing their thing (I REALLY wish there was more of this). I think the only downside to this game is that it's quite challenging to get new players interested in it. It can take a lot of time, depending on your experience, to get comfortable using some weapons. It can be easy to get frustrated with the combat within the first 50 or so hours of the game, which isn't exactly a short amount of time. Using your weapon, the controls and camera, getting stunned, roars, hard to predict monster attacks, 50 minute time constraints, failing missions, grinding for materials,  etcetera... it can be demotivating. And the game itself doesn't really do a good job explaining some of the nuances of your weapon - you're really left to your own devices or YouTube guides, which definitely is overwhelming. Of the dozen or so friends I've invited to play Monster Hunter, I'd say only a couple actually ended up playing until Iceborne, which is a shame because there's an extreme amount of potential in this game that they can miss out on. I can't really blame this on Monster Hunter, though, or the players. There's such an incredible amount of depth to the combat and system that it would be a disservice to the players to attempt to explain how literally every aspect of every weapon worked. The tutorial is long enough, and there are already ""guides"" in-game. Button prompts are also available on screen. My only suggestion to a new player who's feeling frustrated is to take your time with it, try out different weapons, use the resources available (like the training area), tackle easier monsters to get used to things. It does get easier, and it does feel more fluid the more you play. And, oh boy, when everything finally ""clicks"" - you'll feel absolutely unstoppable. To condense things: I strongly recommend this game. It does things right that no other game seems to even bother attempting. You might have a hard time getting into it. Just take your time to enjoy it, and take it slow. Don't get trapped to one weapon - try a few out. You might find something more comfortable to your playstyle that way. And maybe one day, you'll see how deep the Charge Blade rabbit hole really goes."

True to its name, a bigger focus has been placed on making the environments feel lively compared to previous games; hunts take place in an vast, open world populated with diverse flora and fauna. Creatures have their own lifestyles and behaviours. Certain parts of the environment are dynamic and can be used in creative ways. And, perhaps most obvious of all, the graphics of this game are absolutely beautiful, amplifying the natural look. However, ending the review here and calling it a day would be doing it an extreme disservice.Throughout your travels in the New World, you will become very familiar with its feral inhabitants. Each has its own identity--unique designs, mannerisms, strengths, and weaknesses, all communicated in meaningful ways. From the adorable Dodogama to the ferocious Anjanath, monsters come in all shapes and sizes. One thing is certain: the monsters are usually many times your size, so you better get used to playing around their big attacks.MHW offers a diverse selection of 14 weapon types, each with their own nuances and weapon trees, allowing you to boost your damage and augment your weapons with elements. I am not kidding when I say I hope you like studying videos on how to use weapons, as even the simplest of them have their own unique uses and playstyles. For reference, throughout my MHW career, I went from maining the Heavy Bowgun (a big gun, not much to say) to the Insect Glaive, a polearm that excels in aerial combat, then to the Sword and Shield, a light weapon whose greatest strength is its versatility. I've long since completed the main story of both World and the Iceborne expansion, but I am still having fun trying out all the other weapon types and figuring out how to use them. There is a training area that allows you to experiment safely; I suggest using it as soon as possible to pick and learn a weapon. Don't be afraid to switch weapon types if you get stuck, too.We haven't even touched on the armour system yet, which offers a comparable amount of choice. Armour sets are comprised of 5 pieces; head, chest, arms, waist, and legs. Within these 5 categories, there is a wide array of designs, each offering different defensive stats. Most of the armour pieces in MHW draw inspiration from the monsters you hunt, letting your hunter look quite stylish, too. Additionally, armour comes with armour skills: abilities that strengthen you in a variety of ways, not just defensively.Hunts in MHW generally follow a straightforward pattern. First, you collect tracks of the monster you've targeted. Once you've collected enough tracks to locate the monster, it pops up on the map. You then run over to their location and fight. Usually the monster will run to another area; it's at this point you recuperate (heal, sharpen weapon, etc.) and give chase. This loop of fighting and chasing continues until the monster is slain or captured (the hunt is a success), or you faint too many times (the hunt is a failure).As noted before, a large part of MHW is its environments, including creature lifestyles. To help players engage with this part of the game, players must first explore and locate the tracks of their target before they appear on the map. This feature is a bit of a hit or miss; for some, this only serves to slow players down before they get to the action. For others, this helps develop a sense of familiarity with monsters (i.e. learning their habitats) outside of learning their attacks in direct combat.Combat is all about commitment, in the sense that every attack has an animation that limits your control until a certain amount of the animation has played out. Combat is also highly expressive; besides your weapon of choice, there are a lot of consumables you can bring into the hunt or find in the environment that offer benefits, from traps and bombs to items that heal or provide temporary buffs. In this game, combat is the smoothest it has ever been in the series; the player character feels very responsive, you can continue moving during animations such as using healing items, and attacks that are timing-based generally have large windows for use. By default, controls are also displayed in the top right corner of the screen and update according to context; this makes the game fairly user-friendly.At the end of each hunt, you are rewarded with materials that allow you to forge and upgrade equipment. Thus, the larger, overarching gameplay loop is ""hunt, upgrade, repeat."" Due to the random nature of materials dropping, however, this gameplay loop can get rather grindy at times. This grind is somewhat alleviated with the use of investigations, hunts that provide extra rewards, but it is still very much there.A large part of the  games is their multiplayer, and it is no different here. Hunts take place in sessions; hunts have a maximum of 4 players while sessions can have a maximum of 16, allowing for easy drop-in and drop-out. Additionally, you can fire SOS flares during hunts, allowing players from other sessions to join you. There is a restriction on story missions however; other players cannot join you until you've viewed all of the hunt's cutscenes, which generally entails encountering the monster and watching its introduction. This tends to be a very large downside when playing through the game with friends, as you will constantly have to wait for everyone to view cutscenes before being able to play together. In general, however, the multiplayer is a big point in MHW's favour. At almost 4 years after release, people still play this game. This also means that there is a good number of veterans willing to help new players find their footing if needed.Another point I'd like to address is menu navigation. There are  of menus and UI windows in this game. Additionally, the game loves to bombard new players with tutorial screens. As a result, it is very easy to feel overwhelmed by the amount of information overload if you're not used to the UI of, for example, MMORPGs. Thankfully, this is mostly only a problem outside of hunt. My recommendation is to slow down and take the time to process whatever you're looking at, or ask a fellow hunter for help. Half of these info screens aren't even shoved in your face, and arguably these ones are more useful as they pertain to things like weapon-specific controls and combos.I won't deny that this game isn't for everyone. MHW asks for a bit more patience than usual on the part of the player. However, if you can look past the grind, get used to the UI, and deal with the odd multiplayer quirk of the story missions, you'll find an absolutely huge amount of playtime here. This game has a lot of nuance, way more than I could ever feasibly cover in this review. It is this amount of detail that keeps me coming back for more; I love learning about how each weapon counters the attacks of certain monsters, and the surprising amount of ways I can use the environment to gain the upper hand. , to both series newcomers and veterans alike.I'd like to give  to Morgan, a Charge Blade hunter and absolutely wonderful friend who not only got me the game and Iceborne but also held my hand as I was learning the ropes. I am eternally grateful for your help, ya big ol' softie.I'd also like to thank the countless other players I've met in my travels for making my experience as great as it is. They've not only made for skilled teammates, but also great companions. Cheers, friends."

Here are my personal opinions on the positives and the negatives of this game.Pros:+ Extremely engaging hunts+ 14 different base weapons, with tons of different variations for each from the monsters. The weapons have such satisfying impact.+ The environments feel atmospheric, and it feels smooth to navigate through the jungles and all the other locales.+ Unique artstyle+ Frequent updates with festivals, collaborations (Megaman, Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy, Witcher, etc) and new monsters added, Behemoth being the last new monster to be added before the eventual Iceborne expansion.Extremely hard versions of the already implemented monsters in the form of Arch-Tempered monsters are added for the duration of events, each offering a more powerful armor set. Also Layered armor sets.+ Max 4 Player Co op, coop is very well implemented, save for the very janky experience if you're trying to play co-op during story missions. There are strange limitations before a friend can join, for example you have to see all the cutscenes. But most of monster hunter happens outside of story, and that's where it shines. Its just a pleasure to play with others.+ Complex character build opportunities, you can mix different sets to get your optimal build, and you can insert jewels into slots in the armors that give you additional skills.+ The progression feels so fulfilling, even through the 100h mark you wont feel bored.+ You have crafting systems, before a hunt you have to eat a meal to grant you different buffs for your next hunt, you can farm ingredients, you can meld decorations (the jewels) and you can sent your Palicoes for an adventure to bring you loot.+ Hunts have such fun hijinks, monsters disturbing your encounters with another monster, they have turf wars, and overall hunts turn into a pleasant chaos.+ The Switchaxe+ Great community overall, people put effort into their guild cards and most people are helpful during hunts. No real toxicity. + You really shouldn't have to mention this, but yeah no microtransactions. Probably why the game feels so good in this day and age.+Ultrawide support's here! Took a while but they did it.Cons:- A mediocre story.- Annoying handler, seems to take all the glory for the hunts, even though never participating actually in any. A liability.- Performance has been optimized imo, but still I dip occasionally below the 40fps, and one of the recent patches kinda botched the performance.- SOS hunts tend to be a bit infuriating, because some players just are potatoes. So carts happen a bit too much at times.- I'm not sure, but I think the game has a desire sensor. Curse it!-  Bazelgeuse keeps popping up in all the wrong times.- (Edit:) Co-op does suffer from a few hitches early on in the game when you're doing story missions with friends. You first have to enter the quest alone and see all the cutscenes before your friends can join in, which is just frustrating.If this game appears in a sale or even at it's full price this game is an absolute recommend!"

So it was only a matter of months to receive the game.I pre-ordered as soon as I decided if I would go for the Standard or the Deluxe Edition(I chose the Deluxe even after seeing people saying that it was just some skin and stickers, but I had the feeling that I would enjoy this game, so... -by the way, if you're short on money, go for the Standard Edition, you won't be missing anything from gameplay perspective).The game is huge, if you know what you're doing(already played MH) and do just the bare minimum it will still take more than 30 hours. If you're fresh new and like to explore and try anything you see, it can take near 100 hours. And there still a lot of content after the campaign.So, I played a lot, finished the campaign and was still playing, when I was around 200 hours invested in the game, my save got corrupted, I tried to ask the Capcom support, but they said they couldn't do anything. Tough luck...On the next day I was creating a new char and playing everything again. That's how good this game is. I can't think of any other game that I would do this.About the game... you run a lot around the map searching for the monsters, after you encounter them you smash, slice and shoot them a lot with one of the fourteen types of weapons, you try to not get stomped, bitten, clawed, headbutted, ran over, flamed, iced, electrified, watered, dragon-ed(!?) or exploded and, if you did ok, after half an hour you walk victorious with your cat. Oh, I didn't mention the cat, sorry. You are hunting the monster together with a biped cat wearing armor and it calls you meowster.Being serious, this game has the best gameplay loop I've ever seen. Each of the 14 types of weapon changed the way you play the game, it would be the same as changing the class in other games, but you don't need to start a new character to see if you would even like to play as a different class. You just go to the blakcsmith and say ""My dude, I want to try this other weapon, here's some monster parts and some money."", he gives you this new weapon and now your character is totally different, you will probably yell that this weapon is ♥♥♥♥ because now you get hit by a lot of moves that you were easily escaping before, then after some tries you start to enjoy this new weapon and it's now your second favorite weapon. Because no other weapon will take the place of the hammer that goes boom!When you change weapon, all moveset of the character will be different, and I'm not only talking about the attacks, but walking speed, roll(or if you even will have a roll), time spent to sheath the weapon(yeh, even this is important), if you have a blocking ability or not, stances. So the moment-to-moment of the gameplay loop is always engaging. ""Should I attack now? Should I heal now? Should I move left or right? Is it better to keep lying on the ground after getting hit or stand up immediately?(yep, this is important too).The basic Monster Hunter: World is already a game where you can easily sink hundred of hours, you add Iceborne to that and you get on the 4 digits territory. The expansion is big enough to be a new game and you'll be revisiting all of the original maps for new things.So, yeah, I couldn't recommend enough. F*ck, didn't even talked about multiplayer... well, I do prefer playing as a single player game, but multiplayer can be funny, not so much when randoms are getting killed and making you fail the mission, but sometimes you'll even laugh watching those crazy suicide hunters... I do not recommend you keep calling for SOS right from the beginning, since this can bring people with end game gear that would wipe the monster in 2 minutes. Try to enjoy the game with players of similar level if you MUST play online. By the way, Capcom, how about porting some of the old games?Choose the biggest Monster Hunter before World and BANG!, I bet all the players who keep playing MHW would buy this thing at launch.Oh, and while you're at it, bring me Breath of Fire IV too, alright?"

Unfortunately I do not know why I have played for almost 700 hours at this point. Does this game have a great story full of memorable characters, emotion, and personal growth? No....no it does not, you pretty much kill monsters and use their parts to craft gear to kill bigger and badder monsters. There is something about that kill-and-craft system that got me hooked. Whether it is creating a new build or mastering a new weapon it just always feel great to play. I would recommend getting the base game first and take some time to get familiar with the controls. The learning curve for the game can be large if it is your first Monster Hunter game, and that applies to every aspect of the game not just the controls. I can not promise that you will get hooked on the (almost endless) kill-and-craft game of Monster Hunter.....but man if you do buckle up for a long amazing ride."

You hunt huge monsters. Let me first mention that I'm new to the Monster Hunter games. I was skeptical when I first bought it. I asked myself, ""Is this any different from Dauntless ?"", and within the first 2 hours of playing I realized it's nowhere compared to Dauntless.Of course, it's not fair compare a free to play game with another game by a very established developer: Capcom. But I thought it would just have the core of what monster hunting should be.I stand corrected. Monster Hunter has surprised me with the other aspects besides hunting, and the mechanics of hunting. This is truly a one-of-a-kind unique game. About 200 hours clocked in as I'm writing this review, yet I'm still not done with this game. Capcom is constantly pushing out new events and new monsters. They listen to the community on how the game can be improved, and they have proved themselves to be developers who care for their players. I'm only comfortable with 1 out the 14 types of weapon in the game, and I am planning to try the other weapons. If you're looking for a co-op where you can literally spend hours playing with your friends, this is the one to go with. It's even more fun with friends.Get this game while its fresh !"

If any player has never played monster hunter they can jump into this one and not have a problem as it parts from the previous series well. Story is great and fights are epic my only concern was why they were so strict on mods for the iceborne part but creators worked around it and did a great job. I only use aesthetics as in looks and sound effects but there probably was cheaters out there, but you can tell by their skill. I am disappointed that they went back to the switch which is a hell of a downgrade graphics and mechanic wise. But 2022 proved monster hunter world 2 will be released and I will be looking forward to that as well.

If you are only here to finish the story, then, it can be achieved without much grinding but keep in mind that, the story of Monster Hunter World is there only for the sake of being there; it's nothing extraordinary & shouldn't be your only reason to buy the game. That being said, grind is a must if you want to venture beyond the story & lust for some of the best gears & late monsters in the game.Now, the core strength of this game undoubtedly lies in the various monsters that lurks around the world. Monsters are effing brutal, each with their own distinct characteristics & abilities. Each & every of them feels like a boss fight. Preapre to spend good 10-15 mins(or even more) to take down a monster as they are quite tanky but the pleasure of besting them surely feels incredible.Apart from the monsters, the gameplay mechanic is solid as rock, coupled with the gorgeous ambience. The game sounds good, looks better, plays best. Total of 14 different types of weapons with skillsets, playstyles & combos that's unique from one another. Freaking tons of badass looking armors, deep customization system & crafting options are at your disposal to make your life easy when you take on those mystical creatures of doom.If you want to solo only, albeit surely possible, it may get a bit difficult or tedious. Best played with mates of course, and, the multiplayer system is being implemented in such a fluid way that you can join others(& vice versa) very easily without any hassle.No server issues anymore as well.Only gripe that I have is that joining the story quest in multiplayer isn't as seamless as joining those optional quests. I had to reach a certain point(cutscenes) of every story related missions & only after that my friends could join which made my experience a bit disjointed. Also, some quests where I had to search for monster tracks felt really exhausting & monotonous beacuse I had to return to hub & come again repeatedly to search for it to fill the bar.So, overall, I would recommend this game if grinding is your cup of tea as you'll be battling with the same monsters again & again for those exotic loots. If not, I would still recommend it to buy with your friends to experience some epic monster fights in co op, but, on sale."

Steam is for some reason incorrect, it's only logged 18.1 hours as of writing this, but my actuall game log time says 32:28:35 on main + 1:03:30 for the second character I made. (That's about how long the intro takes before you can play with friends.)I am having a blast with this game. I didn't play other Monster Hunter games in the past, but I did play the hell out of Dragon's Dogma. A lot of these mechanics feel familiar, from the UI design to companion characters, and how bosses and elemental effects work. Supposedly World drifts from the MH forumula a tad and I guess that's right, but being like DD isn't bad either. Feels more like an RPG than a pure Boss Run game, which I prefer personally.I'm on track to clock hundreds of hours into this game. It's all I can think about while at work or out and about. How to tackle the next monster, what gear I need to build, what materials I need to gather to prep. The environments are beautiful so far, I love the monster variety. I love the way they fight over territory. I love the amount of weapon variety, there's all types for every kind of player. I really think it's worth a buy. My only con is that cosmetically I have little choice of my armor selection, as skills/talents are tied to specific peices of gear. So you end up looking like a mishmash clown. I am hoping they add more layered outfit choices (all that's available currently is the Samurai outfit), because they aren't seeming like they're going to implement cosmetic item slots or let you dye the regular armor types, unfortunately. But even then, I am too distracted by what the monster is doing to worry about what I look like most of the time."

Pickaxes, those are gone too. Just get your ore and move on. No more having to paintball monsters to track them. Now there's a new system of tracking through footprints and leavings. As for hot drinks and cool drinks, cool drinks are only needed in very specific situations. Not for an entire zone. And hot drinks, I don't think they're even in the game anymore. Hell, there's even fast travel now. Now that's an aspect of ""modernization"" in game design that I can get behind. This is absolutely a reboot for the series.

Are you looking for a game that has : 1.) Grinding mechanic2.) No loot boxes or pay-to-win walls that gives you an overall advantage3.) Can run both in Offline and Online mode without disrupting your progress4.) Has a level-up system5.) Primarily loot-based centered6.) A game that actually rewards you for your hard work7.) Purely PVE-based and doesn't have a niche of PVP in itThen my friend, Monster Hunter: World might just be the game you're looking for!Monster Hunter: World is a game that revolves on a near never-ending cycle:  If you're expecting a story rich or lore based game off of MH:W, then I'm sorry to say that MH:W isn't really that type of a game, as the title itself implies; you're here to hunt monsters. Now don't get me wrong MH:W does have a story and some lore added to it but it's basically just a pre-text to set up the main focus of the game - Hunting Monsters. You're an A-List Hunter off to the New World to investigate a migrating Elder Dragon.Let's start off with the  What I really like about MH:W is that it actually has a whopping 14-different weapon types to choose from each with it's own combo's and play styles. And countless armor pieces to  that suits your preferences. Mix and Match? What do you mean? You see, armors in MH:W has these specific skills that come along with it and when you pair an armor with that same skill you level it up unlocking more bonuses. Now choosing what skill suits you actually depends on what weapon you're using (i.e. If you're a Bow Bro, then you'd naturally look for a skill that goes along pretty well with a bow and many more). And this very mechanic is what I like, you actually have the freedom to build a certain Weapon and Armor Set based on your preferred play style. And what's more is each weapon type feels like your starting a new game since it'll take some time getting used to it. Which is why my advise is to start off with a weapon that's easy to use then master it first. Oh and each weapon upgrades has a skill tree, to get the weapon you want you need to do hard work which means no slacking off hunter!Let's proceed to the  part of the game. What's unique about Monster Hunter: World is what sets it apart from other RPG games when fighting monsters, normally you'd unsheathed your sword and dash into the fray slashing left and right until the monster actually dies right? In MH:W that's actually not the case;  actually feel like a true  in this game.  is key, you actually get rewarded by it than being bold and aggressive which makes hunting rather hard. How so? Because you actually die a lot and waste a lot time in the process, in MH:W you need to research first about the monster you're about to hunt, study it's weaknesses, it's habits and most importantly how it attacks.  Remember this. The game even has it's own ""Monster Wiki"" that tells you important info on a monster. The more tracks you gather, the more you'll be able to understand a monster's weakness and how to exploit it's weak points. Overall hunting is pretty self explanatory: You track a monster, kill it, skin it, use the materials you took to craft gear, then use that gear to take on a larger monster, rinse and repeat but it's more than that I assure you.The only thing I hate about the game is how your Hunter is basically mute, he/she does not speak and everytime an NPC talks to you, you just nod back! that's all you do, you nod as a reply! It's get's funny when an NPC asks you a question and you just nod. Bruh.MH:W is actually pretty fun, it has loads of content in it. You'll get to love and hate it at the same time, the greatest feeling you'll ever get from this is after defeating a certain monster after it's been drilling you in the ass for 2 hours as it effortlessly 1-shot you as you try to dash and evade for dear life (I'm looking at you Nergigante) that rush of accomplishment is what gives MH:W a 9.5/10 in my book, and I'm not planning on putting this game down anytime soon especially since the Icebourne DLC adds more freaking content, monsters and skill sets in the game! If that's not enough to get you to buy this game, you can also play as Geralt or Ciri from The Witcher 3 and fight a tough Leshen (ngl this is what got me to buy the game in the first place since I'm a sucker on anything that involves The Witcher series). You even play as Ryu from Street Fighter or Dante from DMC! Still not convinced? Did I forget to mention you can have a CAT a.k.a a PALICO as your partner in crime? BUY THE GAME!"

For some weapons you need to watch a 30 min tutorial on YouTube to even get an idea of what it does.- git gud difficulty- repetitive grind- co-op- grind- terrible endgame RNG- and grind.And yet I love it. I rage uninstalled it 3 times because I could barely hit a tiny monster that wasn't even a proper enemy.But once you wrap your head around the mechanics, stop mashing buttons like an idiot and approach it more like a turn-based action game where you need to think when to attack, it really shines. There's a lot of depth to these weird and nonsensical weapons, with each being almost like a different game, and it's really rewarding to learn them.The fights with monsters are long and epic, the difficulty increases not too quickly (although there are some moments late in the game when it gets stupid hard, like Alatreon at first).What is great about it is that the game doesn't try to be a book or a movie, it trades a story and logic/realism for a rewarding gameplay loop. Hunt huge monsters, loot them, make better gear, hunt nastier monsters. What made me stay is that playing the game in itself feels rewarding, not just getting the loot. You also get better at the game by playing it and practicing, not only looking up builds. It's also pretty challenging but not cheap, you have a lot of tools at your disposal, along with environmental traps, so you can approach things in many different ways on top of learning the monsters' attack patterns. It's also solo-friendly (I'm not very social...) despite being a co-op game, I managed to solo almost everything, except Fatalis.If you try to play this game like a button-masher, you're gonna hate it. But if you take a slower approach and learn how the game is meant to be played, it can be an awesome ride. One thing though - DON'T USE DEFENDER GEAR. It makes a lot of the game much easier, which will prevent you from learning it correctly and later on, once the gear becomes useless, the difficulty will spike so hard you're gonna quit."

What a shocker.But! It’s actually so much more than the premise would suggest. The title is true to itself: This isn’t just about fighting big monsters. This is about experiencing a  filled with monsters. Here’s what that means, and why I think you, the reader, may enjoy this game more than you thought.To quote the YouTuber Punk Duck: “This isn’t Monster Hunter. It’s Menu Hunter.”Monster Hunter: World is just as much about browsing through menus and managing your equipment as it is actually fighting that fire-breathing T-Rex. From start to finish, your character never gains any innate statistical improvements. You don’t get more health, more stamina, more damage, nothing. What changes is two things: your equipment, and your experience.Armor management is vital to success. The only thing standing between you and a “Quest Failed” screen is your armor rating and your abilities. As monsters get stronger, you need better armor to take less damage. As they get faster and tougher, you need abilities like Focus, or Critical Eye to charge up your weapons faster or increase their critical hit rates. Monster Hunter is a series about meticulous preparation, and while such min/maxing can turn many away, it also gives a greater payout when you succeed. These monsters aren’t just simple enemies, every one of them is a raid boss in and of itself; a lengthy and brutal foe to be overcome with endurance and meticulous preparation, not a Leeroy Jenkins-esque rush.But what makes World stand out so much, even amongst its own Monster Hunter peers, is its dedication to actually being a WORLD. Older titles had herbivores and smaller monsters that roamed around, but never at a scale like this. MHW has hundreds of non-megaboss creatures flying, crawling, and roaming around every corner of every area, and ALL of them can be collected and displayed. Crickets? Fish? Spiders? Bats? Birds? Frogs? Cactuar from Final Fantasy VI? If you can think of it, it’s probably in the game somewhere. You can observe them, capture them, even keep them as pets. This is the kind of experience you usually only get with games like Subnautica or No Man’s Sky: the wonder of exploring an alien and unknown place, to see what lives there and interact with it. And you get gigantic boss fights on top of that too!Just to add even further to the ecosystem focus of MHW, the large monsters themselves also interact heavily with the environment. Poisonous Pukei-Pukei can be spotted eating nuts from vines to refill their poison sacs. Carnivorous monsters can be observed stalking, killing and eating prey when hungry. All monsters, large and small, will go grab a drink from a stream every now and then. Territorial monsters will fight other large monsters mid-battle to defend their territory. In fact, some monsters aren’t even aggressive towards you unless you attack them first! Everything in World is treated as a living, breathing, REAL creature that could actually exist. Many players other than myself concur that some of the most enjoyable moments in the game can be had by just watching things unfold around you. There’s so much detail in every environment that it’s honestly a shame many people write the game off as just “fighting big dinosaurs” or worse, claiming that only the gameplay matters. The environments found in Monster Hunter: World are the best in the gaming business, and I wish more people were aware of it.MHW has a story, but it doesn’t take itself particularly seriously. Normally, that would be bad. But in this case, it’s actually quite nice. The player is part of an expedition force to explore “The New World”, a continent and land separate from previous Monster Hunter areas. This means everything you experience isn’t just new to you, as a player, it's new to the characters as well. You get to deepen your knowledge of this world around you as the game guides you to new areas and new monsters to fight.It guides you, but doesn’t railroad you. You’re free to straight up IGNORE the main plot for as long as you want, fighting the monsters you want, when you want. One of the best moments in the game for me was when my friend and I spent a full day attempting to bring down an Anjanath before the story quest to hunt it was ever brought up. It took us several attempts, but eventually we brought the beast down with help from a gargantuan monster we had never seen before, a Rathalos, that picked Anjanath up in its claws and slammed it down onto the forest floor with such force it made our damage numbers look puny in comparison.It was a phenomenal experience, and more importantly, it was 100% organic. We chose to do that, not the game. MHW gives you the freedom of choice and experience in ways few other games do, especially other boss-rush styled games.Monster Hunter: World looks . The environments are rich and detailed, with life seeping from every cave and treetop. The monsters are visually distinct and have memorable designs that make them stand out among other games and even each other. Each and every nook and cranny of this game’s design had so much clear love and effort put into it that it’s easily my favorite game of all time in the visuals department, even over games like Hades and Subnautica.Monsters move fluidly and with intent, as animated in their actions as they are in their visuals. Lighting arcs off the back of a Tobi-Kadachi as it glides between the trees. The throat of an Anjanath glows crimson as it becomes enraged, and the sheer level of intensity in the particles and lighting of Elder Dragon attacks defies words. Every second of a fight is desktop wallpaper material.Once again, Monster Hunter: World excels in another category. Monster roars are primal, powerful, and give off the true feeling of a colossal beast pushed over the edge. What other game series has video compilations of just enemy roars all over the internet?The sound of intense wind ripping by, fireballs exploding, ice shattering, all of it sounds incredible in the midst of the action. Every moment is an experience, visually and audibly, that other games wish they could have even a third as much.The game runs great on my hardware, but I also have excellent specs. A fair warning; all that visual spectacle comes at a cost, and the game is fairly demanding to run on high settings. Don’t attempt this with a potato PC.Also of special mention is the Iceborne DLC. This isn’t a traditional DLC that adds one or two new things into the game; Iceborne is an entire Master Rank expansion into the base game that itself is nearly TRIPLE the size of the vanilla experience. Double digit monster additions, an entire second story campaign, two new areas, expanded weapon movesets, more hunter tools, the whole shebang. If you love MHW, Iceborne is a must-have.Monster Hunter: World is a masterpiece through and through. It has its faults at times, and a very harsh learning curve (Use google, seriously), but the payoff is immense and deeply satisfying. If you see it on sale,"

Third-person action RPG LooterYou as the player accept quests from a central hub location to take down x number of monsters out in one of several semi-open world large scale maps.

When you kill monsters, you receive monster parts that can be brought back to the hub Smithy and crafted into new & improved weapons or armor of your liking. Rinse and repeat.MHW looks absolutely amazing and runs very smoothly even on a somewhat outdated CPU. There are lots of customizable settings to tune the game to the performance of your liking. The graphics don't get boring as there are 5 different maps in the base game all varying in theme with each map usually home to a select number of the giant monsters you go out to hunt so often. Many of the monsters look unique & incredible and only a select few look eerily similar/have colored ""variant"" monsters.To be blunt, the story doesn't really matter in this game. There is an overall plot being conveyed but the gist of it is that monsters are behaving weirdly and the field/expedition team you eventually join up with wants to know why. But let's be real, you just play the game to hunt monsters, and more monsters, and more monsters.•Very friendly to newcomers to Monster Hunter series; many tutorials, a training arena exists for you to practice a new weapon should you choose to, and the pacing is well done in terms of difficulty ramp up•Hard to get bored; if you feel like you've mastered a weapon, why not choose one of the other 13 to master? Or why not set a goal of making an entire armor set/crafting the weapon at the end of the crafting tree to further assert your dominance over the monsters•As of the time of posting (July 2020), CAPCOM is still releasing new FREE(*) updates to the game in the forms of more monsters and more armor sets alongside those monsters. These free updates include different seasonal events that occur year round to participate in where you can earn special rewards (e.g. Unique layered armor/ customizable options). [*Disclaimer: The free monster updates sometimes require the Iceborne DLC in order to encounter].•Mods are available to download if you are interested in modding the game; good variety of mods out there (usually changes appearances of armor/weapons, quality of life changes, and some cheat mods exist if you'd like to (just be a decent person and don't cheat if you are going to join online hunting parties)•If you are a newcomer, the game can frustrate you if you are unable to take down a monster after long fights result in you losing all progress and having to restart the quest again. Most of the times in those situations, the game is signalling that you should probably learn how to better read a monster's AI, when you need to dodge, your armor might need improving, etc. It all comes down to practice and understanding game mechanics so try not to let the game ""beat"" you.9.5/10, a solid recommendation"

Basically, you are a monster hunter from a guild of monster hunters on an expedition to a new continent when a big ol' mountain monster gets in the way and sets the stage for plot to ensue. It's not the most captivating plot, but it's got a fun, goofy, and sincere charm to it that keeps it from overstaying its welcome. You choose a weapon and get to hunting, taking on missions from the guild to take down monsters and use their bits to make better and weapons and armor that give you better stats so you can take down bigger monsters. You can also capture the monsters, which makes you feel a bit better since you don't kill the monsters, but you still get bones and stuff afterwards so someone's eventually killing that monster, apparently.Combat is fine-tuned and varied. There are tons of weapons in the game, from a sword 'n' shield to a heavy lance, to a giant sword the size of a table, to an axe that charges up and morphs into an elemental sword, to a set of bagpipes that buff your teammates and can also be used to brain monsters. The weapons all feel like they were developed and balanced with  equal care and attention, and attacks feel weighty and impactful. People draw lots of comparisons to Dark Souls, and they're mostly on the nose. Weapon swings can't be interrupted once you commit to them, but you've got more combos. You can't button-mash here and expect to come out on top. In addition, the hunts let you use traps and buffs and skills and environmental hazards that keep things fresh.Weapons and armor can be customized with charms and upgraded, and each monster has a different themed set. Stats matter, so make sure you've got good fire resistance going up against a fire-breathing monster, for example. But there are enough sets and charms to offset stats that you can absolutely lose hours playing dress-up if that's your jam (as it is mine). Also, you have a companion that goes on hunts with you, it's called a Palico, it's basically a bipedal cat, you can customize it to look like your own cat if you want, and it's wonderful.The monsters themselves are the highlight of the game. Beautiful, fantastical designs, that go weird places but are grounded enough in reality that they look like they could exist somewhere. The cool part is that they behave like real animals - during the tracking phase of the hunt, you can just watch them as they go through the world. They interact with the smaller animals, with the plants and hazards in the world. They have territories and nests. It almost makes you feel bad for hunting them!Multiplayer is great but a little janky. Personally, I played the majority of the game solo, and had a blast. You can join your friends on missions, but the cutscenes are unskippable and if your friend is on a story mission, you have to wait until the cutscene is over to join. It's all a bit weird, but when you get going, it's a ball.The game also has a ton of QoL improvements from the previous games - just off the top of my head, the zones are no longer broken up into areas, and you can walk while drinking potions! In previous Monster Hunter games, the levels were broken up into areas, with transition screens between them. Here, the areas are all connected, and once you load the level you're good until you go to a different level. It helps the environments feel so much bigger and less game-y.The game is still very heavy on menus and prepping before fights. There is a hub where you replenish your inventory after each quest (you can set loadouts to speed this up now) and eat a meal for a boost. The meal is accompanied by a very fun cutscene of the Palico chef and his assistants preparing a big delicious-looking platter for you, and it's also wonderful. But, yes, the menus can be a bit much. And often right at the beginning the game can feel like it just dropped you into an ocean of menus, while you slowly drown in inventory screens. Don't panic! You can get the hang of all that later. Just focus on the hunting at first and you'll be fine.Monster Hunter: World is an absolute treasure of a game that's loaded with content. It's perfect for seven-hour binges or for one thirty-minute hunt if that's all you have time for. Gameplay is tight and varied. The whole thing is dripping with charm and polish. Pick up this game and get to work, hunter!Follow  for more reviews!"

You find yourself finally finishing an armor set, just to immediately move on to farming another. You will die in a very dumb way, rage-quit, and just hop back into the game 30 minutes later. The core game is very good.The music is excellent (except for the Astera theme, which I find very annoying after a while), the graphics are great, especially with the High Res pack. And the monster designs are great. The controls will take some getting used to. I already owned the game on Xbox, and found playing the game with the Xbox control to feel sluggish and clunky. I waited to buy this version, until after the mouse input control issues were sorted out. Overall its a lot more enjoyable to play, now.The community is....ehhhh....it's...a thing? As long as you know what you are getting yourself into when you leave your quests open, or fire that SOS flare, you should be fine. By getting yourself into, I mean...that the random people that join will usually make things more difficult for you. Every so often you'll get lucky and some high level pro will join you. But for the most part, you're gonna get people smacking you with their hunting horn and firing their bow in the wrong direction. You'll put the monster to sleep to set your barrels, just to have some guy smack you and the monster with his hammer before you can finish. You'll mount the monster, and have a guy drop a pile of rocks on you. Its REALLY a free-for-all crap-fest, so...yeah. If you want to play with randoms, just...make sure you bring your patience along. Otherwise, its definitely better to play solo or with friends.Overall I've definitely been enjoying the game so far, even with the quirks."

With its extremely wide range of visually impressive landscapes alongside its diverse stable of fantastic dragons, brutes, and other varied beasts, Monster Hunter has managed to carve out a unique niche in the Action RPG genre. And that's no small feat, considering the genre boasts other strong contenders like Dark Souls.The gameplay loop of a Monster Hunter game is simple.- You decide that you want to make a specific piece of armor or that you want to upgrade one of your weapons.- You load up a quest with the specific monster that drops the resources that you need to craft said upgrades.- You make your way through the colorful environments, tracking the monster in question.- You beat the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of said monster.- ???- You now have a shiny piece of new armor or a fantastic new weapon.Some might feel that this sounds like a grindy, tedious experience. You wouldn't be wrong in thinking that, as grinding monsters to look for rare parts (♥♥♥♥ the desire sensor) can be frustrating at times. But the feeling of finally seeing the rare part that you need for an upgrade that will vastly improve your power level is exhilarating. It's so satisfying.I've been playing Monster Hunter since the original PS1 days, and every game has hooked me in to the point where I now probably have about 1,500 - 2,000 hours across the entire franchise.That being said, I had to think long and hard about whether or not I would recommend Monster Hunter: World.Capcom has massively improved on the actual combat mechanics and added useful UI components that previous entries lacked. However, there is a noticeable lack of monsters in MHW when compared to previous installments in the genre. MHW currently features 31 Large monsters and an additional 17 Small monsters - which is absolutely pitiful when you consider the fact that MHGenerations featured 71 Large monsters and 31 Small monsters. Fewer monsters means fewer item sets and a noticeable loss of creativity in setbuilding. One of my favorite things in Monster Hunter is the ability to tinker with mixed sets and come up with some really creative and fun builds.At the end of the day, I settled on this: MHW is fun. Really fun. While I tapered off my playtime due to the lack of mixed set potential in the endgame, I still think that it's a game worth playing. With a new expansion in the form of Iceborne rapidly approaching (Jan 2019), MHW will continue to grow and I can only see it getting better and better as more monsters and environments are added."

Although, there's some issues from PC porting, but it doesn’t hide the fact I still enjoy the game.Monster Hunter: World (MHW) is considered as fifth generation of Monster Hunter series developed by Capcom. You play as hunter, receive task to hunt or capture various monsters as they reward you their components for advanced weapons and armors. Unlike previous titles, MHW is designed to introduce new players with more casual gameplay and new mechanics, yet it still remains complex and challenge hunting as core gameplay in seamless environment. MHW is powered by MT framework game engine (same as Dragon’s Dogma, RE, DMC) with improve AI and Havok physics to simulate realistic experience and most alive world in the series. The story takes place in part of New World. You play as a hunter of Fifth Fleet (customized via character creation), working on expedition to study the migration of Elder Dragons. The team first encounters Zorah Magdaros, one of massive Elder Dragon which motivates research team and hunter to track down Zorah as part of main campaign. Story is not always the strongest selling-point of the series. MHW did its best to create believable plot and backstory via high quality cutscenes and environment background. Overall, the story is quite enjoyable, even though it’s predictable, has weak character development, awkward moments (especially your assistant “Handler”), and bad lips sync.MHW gives you freedom of choice to approach the hunt. You start from basic hunting knowledge as the game constantly introduces new mechanics (tracking, gathering, traps, environmental advantage and much more). Lots of information and UI are thrown into screen, but it’s become handy once you get used to it.There are total 14 weapon types (11 melee and 3 ranges). Each weapon has different distinctive move set, combo, weakness, and strengths. It serves purpose and role of combat one way or another, yet allow player to find best weapon to fit their own playstyle. Landing hit always feel satisfied and weight from hard-hitting Greatsword to sky dancing move of Insect Glaive. One thing I would mention is combat in MH series encourages player to master their moves, position, timing, alongside with monster behavior. It’s something you’ve to get used to, as some weapon require higher skill than other, but reward very satisfied outcome. MHW also introduce “slinger” as sidearm, allow you to shoot various bullets type that you collect from environment or monster part. It has grappling hook to traverse faster or reach higher ground to mount the monster. Moreover, you also have “Palico” as cat-like companion to support you in various ways depended on its equipment which you can freely customize.The game features five main areas filled with different biomes and settings. From dense ancient forest to beautiful coral highlands, every sub-area is full of details and routes connected each other. You tracking targeted monster by collecting dropped samples to reveal their location and level up research point, allow you to track them more easily. Yet, those research points will be used for various supporting feature such as plant greenhouse, crafting Palico gears, trading random materials, including information of monster. Hunting is MHW very dynamic and fluid. Gameplay also emphasize on environment interaction and vertical combat. Taking advantage of high ground to mount on monster or kick Paratoads to paralyze big monster is always amusing. Sometimes, you encounter random turf war between two or more monsters. Let them fight while you hiding in bush. Breaking monster part for specific loot and capture when target shows sight of weakness for better rewards. All are just a small part of MHW experience. Thanks to very smooth character movement and monster animation alongside with responsive keyboard control (although some default setting need to be tweaked). You can also team up with other 3 players for chaotic fun experience (like launching a friend to make aerial combo using your hammer or gang up monster with trap and barrel bomb) as the monster become tougher and aggressive based on party size.After each quest, you can choose to freely explore in Expedition mode or back to main village “Astera” where it serve as main hub of various side features to upgrade your hunter, crafting, create meal for buff, receive special task, decorate your home with capture small creatures, or meet other players in Gathering hub. Every loot and quest rewards you with new special gadget, gear recipes, and unlockable features makes you’ll feel like constantly improved. The smithy allows you to customize gear, each weapon has different tree build and armor set has its weakness and strength. Yet, you can use mixed skill from armor set, depending on what monster you’re facing as the element damage and ailments do matter on higher rank monsters.On a side note, UI and inventory system could be a bit messy and confused for first time, but it major improved game flow once you get used to as player can customize loadout, wishlist, name, guild card, and quick crafting which is very useful during real-time hunting.While most of voice acting is decent and lip-sync performance is hit-and-miss, MHW has amazing soundtracks and ambient musics. They're memorable, film symphony orchestra, and motivated during hunt as it play dynamically on certain situation. Most of sound effects are solid. Large monster give you terrified roar and distinctive to define their identity.MHW still offers more end-game contents after main campaign, introducing Tempered Monsters, extended upgrading features (augment, jewel, limited removal), and more upcoming free contents same as console version. Side optional investigation, arena time attack, or participate event hunts. Moreover, you also unlock special quests on certain hunter rank. At this point, you might ask yourself or set your own goal if you enjoy hunting more hardened monsters over and over for specific upgrade components. You’re grinding for maximize your gear and RNG can be painful or enjoy random hunt for pure fun. The choice is yours and it’s still worth even though you only play main story.It’s first time of MH Team to work in PC port. The performance varies on different builds and drivers. Although I had no crash issue on low-spec PC, the optimization itself is very decent. The some textures are slightly sharpened than console version, there are some blurry textures and overused effect, it also lack graphical option to disable in-game DOF and motion blur. Huge particle effect on some area or specific attack can kill FPS due to poorly optimized MT framework engine and how the game function which impact on CPU usage. Inconsistent network connection can sometimes present in prime time. But Capcom manages to finally resolve critical connection issue which I really appreciated (September patch). At this point, MHW becomes much more stable as the developers deploy patches from time to time.MHW is designed for specific audience. People who enjoy hunting, collecting, crafting, tracking progression as based formula. High-risk, high-reward combat but improved accessibility in most ways. It’s not perfect, but it’s great way to introduce new comer to the series, but still offer challenge and fun factor to veterans. At this point, it’s best to find out by yourself and I believe MH Team could deliver QOL update and free content for better experience from now on.I hope you fine this review helpful and enjoy hunting~"

I've clocked 95 hours over six days and I wholeheartedly think this is a wonderful game to experience even with all of the problems. I'll write this review mostly in the context of players that did not play the PS4 version, and I will treat this mostly as a game for newer players that are unsure about buying this game. Bear in mind that Capcom has done a messy job with the port as a whole, but the game itself is a masterful experience. The Pros: -Monster hunting is amazing. You legitimately have to think your way through as you progress through the game. -14 choosable weapons, and every weapon is viable for the most part to progress through the story. Some weapons naturally have an advantage over certain mobs over others.-Progression is wonderful, and there are trees to each weapon that you can pick. Some weapons are unique and customizable. -Beat monster, then use monster bones to fight bigger monster. That's the joy of monster hunter! -Solo gameplay is amazing, and in my opinion the way to experience MH the first time, especially when youre facing new monsters. -Very detailed world design, 5 unique areas each sporting unique monsters to hunt.-Diverse skills that each armor sports, making proper builds an actual thing. Build does matter, and will increase your damage!-T-Rex that breathes fireThe Meh: -Story is interesting to some extent, but hard to really get invested in.-Characters are unnamed. They're literally called ""Handler"" and the like. -No glamour/transmog system, so you can't cover an ugly looking armor that might be good for your build.-Lack of content after completing your own goals, and not currently caught up with PS4. -Iffy control schemes, simpler weapons like the Bow won't mind it at all, but weapons with more button presses will want a controller. The Cons:-Multiplayer is BROKEN for most people.  D/C from my own session even though I'm in Discord fine! -The game is not very well optimized, a few particle heavy bosses in the very endgame will absolutely tank your fps, even my friends with good rigs have complained about it.-The game renders entire maps together, so some of the worlds you'll experience worse performance because of size and complexity. -DenuvoIs this game worth $60 to you? Maybe not, but I had a wonderful experience and I would certainly recommend at least playing through this game if you have never played a MHW game. The people who have given negative reviews are correct in that the optimization and connection issues are absolutely horrendous, but many of them also speak from the point of view of someone who has already played the PS4 version and expect better of Capcom. If you're a new player that has never played a MH game, you MUST play this game."

If you haven't and are planning to get into it, you might want to think it over. It can get pretty tedious for those who don't like the idea of its grinding but the experience it offers, can hardly be found in other games. Of course that differs individually. Many newcomers will either grow to like it or just hate it outright.  First of all, MH isn't one of those typical story rich JRPG games. Sure it has a pretty decent narrative, but the real unique selling point of Monster Hunter is, from the name itself, mastering the hunt and being the best hunter you can be. There's no experience points and level progression as the gameplay is entirely skill based. You'll learn, adapt and overcome. Learning everything about monster behaviour, attack patterns, where it sleeps, its weak spots and the effective weapon to use against it. Either way, there are no bad weapons in this game. I have found all weapon types to be extremely well rounded, fun to use, with some having impressive multi functionality. The only question is whether the weapon you're currently using has been upgraded enough to deal significant damage. Which brings me to my next point, in response to the tedium of grinding often mentioned by newcomers. It's offset by the motivation of crafting gear based on that monster's parts. The satisfaction of upgrading an existing weapon into a powerful elemental version, from materials you worked long and hard to get is an experience unlike many others. Payoff is huge. Same goes for armor as well and it looks damn good. Once you get the hang it, you'll start to appreciate the world that surrounds it, from the lush biomes of the ancient forest to the snowy wilderness of Hoarfrost Reach. You'll cultivate herbs, craft essential healing items and buffs, set traps for capture and simply just hunt monsters alongside friends. Frankly any game is fun with friends and even though MH is marketed as co-op, make no mistake that it's a solid single player experience too. When a hunt gets too tough, players can fire a signal SOS calling for online hunters to come to your rescue. Emerging victorious after a long and brutal fight, is in my opinion, one of the greatest pleasures in gaming as a whole, and that's based on my personal experience playing Monster Hunter since its inception on the PS2 and onwards."

It practically has no tutorial, they're just walls of text that a new player (like myself) would largely not be able to read with much comprehension. But, once you get past that hurdle, your enjoyment skyrockets and the game gets even more fun the more hours you put into it. I highly recommend playing it with some friends. Were it not for my friends to keep me going, I probably would've given up on the game early on.Getting to know the game takes some patience, especially if you like to take your time like me. Even with my experienced buddies and watching some vids, it was a slow learn for me. I'll be transparent and give my timeline of learning the game:8 hours in: Just now getting comfortable with the  mechanics. I've found a weapon type I enjoy—the switch axe—but I'm mostly just button mashing.16 hours in: Controls are largely muscle memory, making mistakes here and there. I no longer have to think when doing combos with the switch axe when it's in axe mode.34 hours in (time of review): I understand how affinity (crits) work, and I'm starting to learn how elemental damage works. I'm only now starting to integrate the sword mode of the switch axe into my combos—previously I only used sword mode when a monster was stunned or otherwise immobile for a prolonged period of time. I stopped using the 'Defender' weapon tree, as I'm now confident in how to combo and don't need the crutch of that OP weapon.If I were to give recommendations to new players:1) Get some friends to play with, they'll keep you going.2) Go to the training room and practice with all the weapons until you find one that clicks with you. To get to the training room, go to 'Your Room' (it's labled on the map) and speak with the cat person (palico) that isn't your companion cat person. They'll give you an option for training, where you can mess around and equip all the weapon types in the game.3) This is a hot take: Use the 'Defender' weapon tree. The Defender weapons are OP and do a lot of damage. The intent is to allow returning players to plow through the main game and get them to the post-game/DLC content faster. This extra damage will allow you to kill monsters just by button-mashing. As a new player, this serves as a safety net that'll give you time to familiarize/experiment with the controls and combos without getting frustrated by having your ass handed to you. Once you feel confident, switch to a normal non-Defender weapon tree.4) Don't use the Defender armor. See point 3 for it's purpose. By using the normal armor available to you, you'll learn how to evade (dodge roll) properly as well as understand what/how skills work and how progression works in the game. It's a great game, but it's pretty unwelcoming and slow to learn. However, once you get there it becomes incredibly fun. Bring some friends with you."

You are tasked by The Research Commission to travel to the  to study the activities of   (tremendously powerful monsters on a truly massive scale). Character customisation is good with lots of options and you can even customise your Palico.The game may appear a little complex at first but once you have played for a while the basics will become very familiar. The formula is essentially this:Capturing monsters involves creating  and ,  a monster sufficiently (), luring the monster into the trap and then using the tranquillisers to knock it unconscious. This can be done on both capture and hunt quests.Large monsters are pretty varied and will change depending on the area of map your in - Giant lizards (), Fire breathing T-Rexs (), Giant electric squirrels (i), Dragons (), Inflatable Albino bats () to list just a few you will meet at the start (). The more you track a monster the more info you will find out about them (), each has its own set of weak spots and each has its own set of resistances and vulnerabilities. To be most effective, hunters should use appropriate equipment for the monster they are going to battle. (for example having armour that is highly resistant to fire and a weapon that deals water damage when facing the fire breathing Anjanath)Map areas are grouped by biome (Ancient Forest, Desert, a Cora landscape, etc)  and each have a very different ,  and .  an smaller creatures can be caught in your net to craft potions or items later, some can even be kept as pets in your room. ,  and  can be harvested, you can catch  with your net or rod and bait, you can explore and find , new  and . Each location is made up of a number of different  seamlessly connected together and which you can travel between and explore freely. Levels have quite a lot of  and  and I often times find myself getting turned around or lost (but ) There are 14 main weapon types in the game each with their own  and , each of these types then has many different  which can be crafted using  collected and harvested during missions. There is also huge array of different  (for you and your Palico) which can be crafted at the forge, each has its own set of armour ,   and , as you progress through the game and fight more monsters more of these armour sets and weapons will become available. I would recommend testing out the different weapons in the sparing area until you find one that suites your playstyle (also don't be afraid of swapping around either).I've given you some of basics but its really only scratching the surface, this game has a massive  to it which really helps considering a few of its flaws. , you will in Monster Hunter World need to fight the same type of monsters quite a number of times before you are able to progress onto a stronger monster (especially if solo). This is to increase your hunters level and also to gather the required materials to craft new sets of armour, weapons and items you will need against stronger foes. Until you learn a monsters you may well have a hard time avoiding attacks which can be powerful (rage attacks) with certain monsters and cause you to faint (sometimes in one hit if under geared and under powered). Due to the way this works this can sometimes create something of a () where you feel overpowered against the weaker monsters but get utterly trashed by the stronger ones. If you meet one of these either find a good  to support you or  your equipment to best suit the fight and learn the attack pattern, you will get through eventually!Graphics are good, even better with the free HD texture pack, I would recommend using  (guides are available) if colours are a little washed out, that and turning off motion blur. Lip syncing in cut scenes for English is absurd but easily overlooked.Playing a mission in  () is a lot of fun, and I would recommend coop as the way to play the game, however there is an issue with coop and the story campaign. For some reason (s) Capcom require players to first play a story mission through until the end of the /   before other players can join them in coop. This often means to play a story mission coop you need all players to start the quest, play until the battle, abandon the quest and then restart in coop mode, its quite absurd but possible to work around. However story missions are only part of the game and  quests,  quests,  and  do not have this issue. In addition to quests you can free roam the different biomes in  mode, but to do this in coop you first need to complete a quest with your team and all select return to camp.Well done if you've managed to read this far, honestly there is so much more I haven't covered in this review and more still I have yet to explore in the game but I hope this review has given you a feel for the game and some of the basics. Despite a few flaws this game remains a thoroughly enjoyable experience, particularly for coop play and I would highly recommend it."

Get it. Get it even if you never played any of the games before. Get it and try to at least get to the credits and see how the game treats you. It may be frustrating or stressful to play at first or seem maybe boring at first glance, but the second you make that first push, oh man, it's like nothing else in gaming. Maybe the servers seem to treat you badly but it's really not that bad compared to the sheer good the game offers. It's really not intrusive at all and you can reconnect from the main menu. Connection->recently played or somesuch. You're welcome.Full transparency: I am a huge Monster Hunter fanboy. Full-on, rabid fanboy. I can however, without bias, tell you that Monster Hunter World is the best Monster Hunter game made so far. From a technical, conceptual and executional standpoint. I could tell you the technicalities of the game, but everyone does that already so if you're into that then you're wasting your time reading this. This is why my first sentence is what it is. I can't do the game justice here. I've written and rewritten what I wanted this part to be many times but it's just not coming together. I can't say it easily. It can't be said easily. It has to be peeled back layer by layer, but if you're a newbie, then probably nothing of it would mean much, if anything at all. So you want to get into Monster hunter? Fine, ...fine.Go, and type: ""Monster Hunter Zero"" into the Youtube searchbar and watch the video from the channel: ""folga"". Even if you have the game already or have started Monster Hunting relatively recently. Done? Play this game. With friends/family if you can. Convince 'em. Did you like it? Play Iceborne when it comes. Play at least one of the previous games if you can. If there's a will, there's always a ship willing to sail you in that department. My recommendations are: Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter Freedom, Monster Hunter Dos, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Monster Hunter Tri and 3U separately, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate. In that order and one by one if you can do all. FU&P3rd or GU if you can't. This is important: Don't rush. Did the new MH after Iceborne come out? Play it. Think you done enough? Are you satisfied? Can you swing a fish to beat up some dinosaurs with now? How about a chainsaw? Two chainsaws!? A bone? Use cats to beat up cats. Eat some Kirin Cheese. Eat some wyvern head. Shoot unlimited elemental works from a weapon no one cares about. Make the coolest looking sword straight out of Gothic 2. Or a drill from TTGL. Or beat up Gurren Lagann. Make a mix set. Make 50 mix sets. Try out a new weapon. Sharpen your weapon back up to yellow. Sharpen your hammer, sharpen your anvil, sharpen yor bagpipe, sharpen your recorder-bell, sharpen your wyvern head. Go into mud. Go into lava. Go into water. Go down into a hole. Go up a mountain. Get deep into the jungle. Lie down into sand. Listen. Catch fish. Catch bugs. Especially the Killer Beetle. No wait.. Shinig Beetle? Shine on you... Killer Queen..?? Take those sweet as.s jeans and dodge some bayblade spins and boom-booms from a living train. Get rabies. Eat a pill that gives you rabies. Curse that flying as.shole that he left the area again. Look into those blue eyes and hate them and then love them and then be annoyed and then be content. Pick up some poop, pick up some rocks, pick up some weed and shrooms to heal yourself with. Collect honey and post how many you got. Time out on trying to get specific fish.

This game kicks an incomprehensible amount of ass, plain and simple. After over 500 hours pumped into the game between PS4 and PC, I can safely say this is my favorite Monster Hunter game, and one of my favorite games, period. Visuals: Holy cow this game is an insane visual upgrade from the previous installments. This franchise went from looking like PS1 - PS2 games to next gen beauty. So much detail was put into every little nook and cranny of this game's, well, World! A whole 450 hours in I realized that there's a back door in the smithy's shop that leads to a staircase. Go up said staircase and you will be welcomed with a view of the surrounding area, and it is stunning. That's not even considering the monsters, which also have also gotten their own graphical advancements. 9/10 in the graphics departmentSound Design / Music: This one comes down completely to personal taste, but in my opinion they nailed the OST and sound design in this game. Every hit, every roar, everything just sounds perfect. All the most important monsters have their own themes, and all of which sound amazing. 8/10 in the Audio departmentUser Friendliness: Unfortunately, the game falls short in this case, which sucks since this is a VERY important part of a game as complicated as Monster Hunter, ESPECIALLY to new players. The game tells you basically nothing about how to use most weapons. All the main moves are tucked away in your Hunter Notes, with the more obscure yet useful stuff just straight up never being told to you. For example, with Greatsword you have a tackle move. The game tells you about the tackle move, but not all the best, most useful times to use it. Only from watching guides online I learned that you can tackle THROUGH A MONSTER'S ROAR. This is an insanely useful way to use this move, yet the game never tells you it! Every thing this game tells you is the most basic ♥♥♥♥ slapped on some text. Affinity, the importance of eating, the various NPCs around Astera, how to navigate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ancient Forest, how to build a proper endgame set, and many more are all vital to an efficient hunter, yet the game either tells you too little, or doesn't tell you at all how to best utilize your knowledge about them. 3/10 for it's bad user-friendliness. Difficulty: I've seen a few people say that the basegame is one of the easiest in a monster hunter game, but that's mostly coming from veterans who got desensitized by the hellstorm that was the first couple entries. This game starts off reasonably easy, giving newer players a chance to get acquainted with the game, then basically pushes them off a cliff once the mid-endgame rolls around. You go from a reskinned version of a monster you already fought to an Elder Dragon that literally eats other elder dragons in 2 quests. The game's pacing may scare off new players, but I personally didn't have too much trouble with it. Power though, and harder monsters will get easier through experience, trust me. 4.5/10 difficulty for early game6/10 difficulty for mid-game8.5-9/10 difficulty for endgameMonsters: Easily the most important part of this game, and in my opinion the monsters are awesome! You got a Dragon that shoots tornadoes at you, a wyvern that has explosive scales that it drops on you like a WWII bomber plane, a Hellhound that zooms around the map at breakneck speed, a T-Rex that sneezes fire, the list just goes on. My only gripe is that there isn't much in terms of diversity. Pretty much every monster is a reptile of some sort. Thankfully this is fixed in Iceborne, so I can't complain too much. 7/10 for MonstersConclusion: Do I recommend getting this game? Absolutely! Do I recommend going in blind? Hell no. NEVER feel bad about using guides in this game, they make all the difference. I recommend Arekkz, TheGameconomist, and Boomstick Gaming. Without these guys, I would've given up a long time ago. This game is also AMAZING with friends. I did my most recent run with my buddy, and It is so much more fun to kill monsters as a team. Overall, it's got a few rough edges, but it excels in most other departments. Overall, 8.5/10 Really makes you feel like a poacherCiao! :)"

Those issues are long gone now, the only times I get disconnected nowadays I only have my own internet to blame. If you go looking at the negative reviews, pay attention to how many hours they have played and think about that.The secondary thing I feel mentioning upfront is that while this is a game where cooperation is highly encouraged, for some reason other players can't join your story quests if you haven't seen the cutscenes first. This can be rather annoying if you are playing together with friends, and unfortunately there is no good solution for the players. So you'll end up having to do the quest alone, watch the cutscene and wait for the notification that you can use SOS Flare. At that point your friends can join, alternatively you leave the quest and group up together with your friends, doesn't matter.There aren't *that* many of the story missions, the meat and bone of the game is beyond the story so to speak.With that out of the way.... (just skip to bottom if tl;dr)This game is absolutely gorgeous! The environments are beautiful, there's plenty of places to explore, paths to find, things both inanimate and living to collect and obviously monsters to hunt...You'll be able to see a monster from far away, so if you have clear line of sight you can spot monsters much further away than other games would allow.The monsters look fantastic, and they actually have like routines to their daily life. So if you are sneaky enough, you can follow after a monster and watch it as it goes about its business. It'll mark its territory, leave foot prints, maybe spit/puke on trees and the ground and of course hunt. The monsters don't take kindly to others coming close, neither hunters or  other monsters. So while you're hunting one monsters, you might find another monster who decides to fight the monster you're hunting! In fact, everything in this game looks great. Except for the handler, but you can change her looks with mods if it is too much.This game probably has one of the deepest combat systems I know of.When you start playing, you'll get the choice between the basic metal version of all the weapons.Your choices are: There is no  choice when it comes to picking a weapon. While some situations might feel better with certain weapons especially if you're still learning, overall all the weapons are very balanced and offer quite different play styles.Not only do the weapons offer a nice diversity in play styles, most/all of the weapons have a surprisingly deep system of attacks and combos.As an example; the great sword might seem real straight forward, but it has a move that can be surprisingly effective against monsters. Normally you'll be slamming that baby down on the monster, and if it attacks you'll try to block or dodge. However! If you master the shoulder attack, you can interrupt the monster's attack and possibly even stagger it, leaving it exposed for more hurting.Another example is the insect glaive, essentially a polearm that comes with an insect that you can feed to make it more powerful. With it you can jump up a little to do aerial attacks, or swing around on the ground. But if you take the time to collect essence from the monster(s) you hunt, you'll unlock stronger combos and even aerial attacks that allow you to stay airborne for as long as your stamina and/or essence lasts!There are many examples like this, so if I feel somewhat tired of a certain weapon I can just change to a different one for a completely different feeling in both tempo, damage, and intensity. For example, if I'm lazy I'll just go gunlance and play it safe. But don't mistake that for gunlance being a tame weapon, in the right hands it can destroy monsters.In some cases, the weapon has a different playstyle based on the upgrade path you picked for it.The weapons can deal all sorts of damage. Anything from the typical elements like fire, ice, thunder over to stuff like poison, dragon (yes) and even debilitating effects like paralysing and even sleep. Yes the monster can be forcefully made to fall asleep during combat, for reasons you'll discover.When it comes to actually hunting the monsters there is  important thing to always do.That's dead serious. Capcom's Monster Hunter series is one that rewards patience and due dilligence. When you fight a new monster, focus on just understanding it first. How it moves for attacks, roars, where it normally hunts, where it roams and even where it sleeps... If you don't pay attention, the combat can quickly become punishing or as some might say, ""like dark souls!!!"".Unlike that game, the attacks of the monsters are well telegraphed (most of the time) and while a monster can feel really overwhelming in the beginning, with time you will conquer it and dominate it.The monsters are well designed, both for combat and movement. While some fights can feel frustrating because of the hit boxes being slightly misleading on certain monsters, it's overall a very fair system. You'll learn the ins-and-outs of the monsters in no time.There are no levels in this game. There is hunter rank, but it's mostly just an indicator of how much time you've spent hunting. So a HR 50 have as much HP and stamina as a HR 1 player.The difference comes down to the armor, decorations and of course the weapon they are carrying. The gear you choose will eventually have more to them than just defence and resistances, they will have skills available.Some skills will increase your max HP, some will increase your raw damage, some will increase elemental damage, some will make you dodge further or even make you eat faster! (yes)Additionally more powerful equipment will even have set bonuses. To obtain the gear you want, will require lots of hunting and that's half the game.The game loop can probably be summarized as plainly as thisHunt monsters for materials, use the materials to craft better gear, use the improved gear to hunter stronger monsters and keep trying to reach higher and higher!It sounds simple, but that satisfaction of finally beating a monster you've been struggling with is so good. It's a game where you can noticably see the difference between the ""old you"" and the ""new you"" after playing for a good while. I currently have 430 hours in the game, there is still so much for me to learn.I barely know how bowguns work, I have never used charged blade and there are many weapons I don't use much or haven't mastered yet. So I wouldn't be surprised if I find myself having more than 1000 hours in this, because it's just so  hunting with the weapons in MHW.Looking forward to the events that are still coming to MHW, and I especially look forward to the announced expansion Iceborne.I don't really know what more to say. I love this game, it's fun, it's a game I can keep coming back to for more action. In a way, this is my ""skinner box"" game. Good thing I picked a game that doesn't have microtransactions or loot boxes. Just pure quality and fun (and some pain...)TL;DRYou hunt huge monsters with cool weaponsYou can mount the monstersYou can use a wide variety of weaponsIt's a really satisfying game with a good repetition loop. It's an easy game to get into, and hard to master. Just gotta play it at your pace.Ignoring the nitpicks I have about it, a 10/10 game."

The original console version of MHW was released in January 2018, with a PC adaption in August 2018.++ Gameplay. Easy to learn, but hard to master. Each weapon (14+) demands a different tactical approach in combat. The various monsters have their own attack patterns, weaknesses and environments. Hunting and gathering facilitate the creation of better weapons and armour. This in turn allows for specialized equipment in order to hunt bigger beasts. + Level design. The different world areas are full of rich detail and offer plenty to discover. The flora and fauna provides an endless array of useful collectibles.+ Companion. Your feline sidekick can be customized, has some useful skills, and will support you in combat. Yet, the Japanese obsession with cats has been pushed to its extreme in this game.o Multiplayer. The flexible cooperative MP options let you play the numbers game to take down your adversaries. But the irregular disconnects will lead to rage inducing moments.- Story & characters. Boring Godzilla scenario threatening the invaders of the new world. Clichéd characters & silent protagonist. A fraction of the content is synchronized. Console based text progression.- PC adaption. Every action you take in this game beginning with the submenu navigation, over inventory management, down to drinking a potion - while being chased by a fire-breathing monstrosity - will remind you of its console roots. Little effort has been invested into the adaptive work for the PC version.It deserves most of the praise it has received and I enjoy the gameplay immensely. The hunting and gathering culture represents the core element of the game, and it has been excellently executed. Nevertheless, it is being held back from being great by the suboptimal story-telling, PC adaption, and reoccurring server issues.Recommended for curious adventurers and people with a cat fetish.Keep in mind that this game is a random number generated grind festival.

There are a lot of QOL changes that may/may not be good depending on how much you liked the feel of the older games.If you are no stranger to the previous MH games, then you will feel more or less right at home with this one! With gorgeous environments and 'open world-ish' maps, it's by far the best looking monster hunter game of them all. The world feels alive in a way it never did in past installments which helps to make each hunt feel more like an actual hunt. If you have never played a MH game before, then this is a really good place to start. In my opinion, and that of most other hunters, world is the easiest game in the franchise to get into, but that does not make the game any less challenging or worse off than the others. But at the same time, if you end up liking world, and don't mind a graphical downgrade, then check out the older games as they're definitely still worth picking up and playing.As for gameplay, it's real simple -- It's pretty much given away in the title of the franchise. You create your character, get introduced to the world and your first few monsters, and then you hunt them. You hunt them for materials you can use to upgrade and craft both new armor, and weapons. You then use your new gear to hunt other monsters, and so it goes.I know it doesn't sound like the most thrilling gameplay loop ever, but it really works and that's all thanks to the fact that nearly all of the monsters are a blast to fight. Not to mention that you have a lot of weapons you can bring to the fight as well, each with unique playstyles to them. Finding the weapon that works for you, or experimenting around with the different weapons available is a lot of fun!Each hunt is essentially just a boss fight, and the difficulty of each encounter is mostly governed by how prepared you are to face whichever monster you're hunting. Combat is slow paced for  weapons, so positioning is important. You also have the option of teaming up with 3 other people online, or of course, bring your own friends along for the ride.All in all, gameplay is satisfying once you get the hang of it, and some of the end-game fights can get pretty crazy! That aside, if you're familiar with the franchise, there's a ton of QOL changes to the game. Like being able to move while chugging your potions, insta harvesting plants and quicker mining, monsters attacking each other instead of locking on to you etc. Some are great, some not so much depending on how much you enjoy the play and feel of the older games.Regardless, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to both returning players and new ones alike!"

I played through the entire game with a friend, and I had a blast doing it – and yet, we had to engage in some shenanigans to be able to actually play through the campaign together cooperatively.The basic gameplay cycle of the game is pretty straightforward – you eat some food and craft some items in your home base, while talking to a few NPCs who give you various items for completing tasks and quests. You go and take a quest from the quest board, which is almost always to hunt a big monster out in the world.When you accept the quest, you are taken into one of a half-dozen zones and need to go find the monster. Typically, you do this by collecting some monster footprints, and once you collect enough of those, you get a trail guiding you to where the monster is. At this point, you start fighting the monster.You will battle the monster for a while, but eventually it will run off into another area of the map; you don’t have to track them again, and you can rather easily pursue them there, where you continue the battle. Rinse and repeat until you have killed the monster or have used a trap from your item inventory to subdue it.After you win, you carve the monster’s corpse up for body parts and are given a quest reward (which gives more body parts – and even more if you captured it, to make up for not cutting it up) and then go back to town to craft more items.All of this sounds pretty basic, but in practice, it’s actually really fun. There are dozens of monsters in the base game, and then dozens more in the Iceborne expansion, which is basically another game unto itself tacked onto the end of Monster Hunter World. These monsters almost all have unique attack patterns and appearances, with only a handful of monsters that are just recolors. As you progress through the game, you unlock first high rank, then master rank monster hunts, and the monsters at higher difficulty levels are not only tougher and deal more damage, but also gain new attack patterns (including entirely new attacks not seen at lower levels!) and are significantly more aggressive. This gives the game far, far more gameplay variety than is seen in many games – there are a huge number of fairly elaborate “boss monsters”, and your goal is to defeat them all so you can kill them and wear their skins.In addition, you are given a whopping 12 different weapon types to choose from. This includes nine different melee weapons and three different ranged weapons. These have a very high degree of variety – the attack patterns and reach of different weapons are wildly different, with weapons ranging from the extremely slow and powerful great sword to the extremely fast dual blades. Some weapons allow you to block attacks with shields (or in the case of the great sword, the flat of your blade), some allow you to move around while you have an attack charged up (instead of being stationary while attacking)… there is a great deal of gameplay variety in them, and they all favor different playstyles. All of them are viable in the game, though some are a bit better than others, and some weapons (like the bagpipes, which give group buffs) are stronger if you are playing with other people.In addition to all this, you have a “Palico”, a cat who you bring along with you. You get to choose their appearance, and dress them up in cute armor of their own. These also get “palico tools” that you level up and which give you various effects – be they healing you, stealing items from monsters, buffing the party’s attack and defense, or stunning the monsters with traps.There is also an inventory of, frankly, far too many items, which consist of healing items plus items that do various other things, like grant temporary invisibility, allow you to regenerate health faster, lay down traps for monsters, give you special ammo types temporarily, or buff you in various ways. Your inventory space is limited as well, which can be an annoyance when you pick up too many things on a mission.And on top of all of that, there are decorations and special skills associated with your weapons and especially armor that allow you to customize your character in various ways, giving you resistances to various types of damage, letting you use items faster, or buffing you in a broad variety of ways.The core gameplay, thus, is really good – you not only have a ton of different boss monsters to fight, but also a bunch of weapons that you can fight them with, all of which feel pretty different to use, and a high degree of character skill customization on top of that. You make your weapons out of monster body parts, so you can experiment a bit but also are given some direction on which monsters you want to hunt next. As none of them require too many parts, you generally don’t need to farm a specific monster more than a few times at most to craft a better weapon.The cooperative gameplay is pretty good as well – you can join someone else’s session and go around hunting monsters with them, joining in on their quests with them. Additionally, there is an “SOS flare” that can be fired off during a mission to allow any player in the world to join your game and help you out. Up to four players can play together alongside each other at a time.The game uses a scaling mechanism to make monsters tougher when you play in multiplayer – playing with two players doesn’t quite double the monster hit ponts, while playing with 3-4 doesn’t quite quadruple it. The result is generally that multiplayer makes things easier, as the monster ends up more distracted and you have more time to heal or otherwise prepare yourself. Playing with two players felt fairly ideal – you get to keep your palico companions, which is useful due to their special abilities, and it also doesn’t feel as unfair as it can with four players all beating up on the monster simultaneously. The only downside of playing in multiplayer is that missions are failed based on the number of faints for the whole team – so while a single player fainting three times would end the mission, so does three players fainting once each. Against some enemies with powerful area of effect attacks, this can be something of a liability.The biggest problem with cooperative gameplay is that the core missions of the game are ill suited for it. You are not allowed to join a mission until the host has seen all the cutscenes – but if you haven’t seen all the cutscenes for that mission yet, you can’t join theirs, either! The only way to play through the story together is for one player to enter the mission, trigger the cutscene, then exit out, then wait for the other player to get to the cutscene so they can enter their mission to complete it together. This is even worse with 3+ people, as all of them have to do this in order to play through the main story together. There is no reason for this – indeed, some of the later special missions have cutscenes but allow players to play together on them from the get go, meaning that the restriction was entirely arbitrary.The other weakness is that the game's endgame is very grindy and not very fun - but after playing the game through, you'll probably be pretty sick of it by the endgame. I would recommend taking a break between the first game and Iceborne.All in all, Monster Hunter World and its expansion, Iceborne, is a really great game. It takes a bit of getting used to the combat, but the game is a blast, especially with a friend. Just don’t keep playing after you’re sick of it."

Not gonna lie but this may be the best action RPG or perhaps the best game on steam to exist yet and I maybe obsessed with it at this point. It offers everything that one may desire in any game. MH games aren't plot driven but this game offers a decent one compared to all the other previous line-ups which had little to none. (Whoever decided to make cutscenes unskippable, please don't) Possibly the best co-op experience out there. (Soulsborne games should learn a thing or two from it) May very well end up creaming your pants. Close to being perfection. Absolute bonkers. Can surely say that it's 2x or 3x bigger and better than the base game by miles. Get prepared to lose your touch with reality. Non-tedious and amazing in most cases. (Yeah I'm looking at you, GTA Online) Endless. Riddled with jaw dropping in-game collabs.All in all, it's a game crafted with love, passion and admiration by the devs. The support this game got was truly out of this world. Devs really listen to their community. Triple AAA studios should really take notes from this game. In the end, I'll wait for the sixth gen MH to top this one."

For those unaware, the premise is to simply kill monsters, obtain their materials, use those materials to craft stronger gear, and fight stronger monsters.There is a skill involved in learning monsters attack patterns to play through the fight, where each hunt can take 10-20 minutes on average. You get eased in with weak large monsters at first, until you eventually hit a wall. You'll know it when you get to it.Pick your new weapon main, learn your combos and how to play out the hunts, and you'll have some of the most fun you can have in an ARPG.It's worth full price, however if you could get it on sale with the Iceborne expansion, you'll be busy for hundreds of hours. The game is absolutely beautiful, so make sure you actually meet the recommended specs. If you don't, MH:Rise is a great option, however Rise is noticeably easier than World which is one of the few reasons World is a superior experience."

However, this game is not for everyone.Do not buy this game if you are not into grinding. Monster Hunter is all about fighting the same monster again and again to build gear or to learn the monsters move.  If this does not sound like a good time to you, turn away now.That said, the big improvements come from the Iceborne expansion. All the favourite monsters make a return as well as gear. I think the only con would be that you will not be able to experience any of these monster early because they are all tied to the expansion unlike in previous games where you may get i.e a Tigrex in low rank (granted that Tigrex came in a full release expansion game in MHP2G), so thinking back, low to high rank was very short story-wise and gameplay-wise too. But that's a very tiny nitpick."

If you've been curious about the series then this is a good starting point: the gameplay mechanics are nicely refined, there's enough in-game content to keep you occupied for a while and you can always have a blast with friends or strangers. The initial release was pretty rough, but this PC version was patched up over time and eventually became on par with console counterparts and better.This game has tons of content, enough to keep you occupied for months. The base game already had a respectable amount of hunts to do and the gradual free content updates that have been rolled out throughout the years have expanded the game even more. New gear, new events, new monsters have been added and all of that requires a solid time investment. This, without a doubt, is the biggest Monster Hunter game ever created.Each weapon class has a distinct play style. You're given all the weapons from the get go, so you can go out and try them all out. It's possible to jump in directly into action and do the trial and error way or, alternatively, check all the moves in the training area. This area is perfect for figuring out your favorite attack strings, as within this area all your damage output is shown and the game provides the player with an overlay of all basic attacks, like in a fighting game. You can pick your favorite weapon class and pretty much play until the end of the game. Of course, it's best to be familiar with multiple weapon classes, as different monsters may require a different approach. There's only one place where the player might be forced out of their main weapon comfort zone — the arena. The arena challenges are essentially time trials that offer players set gear, weapon and item presets to fight with.The quality of life improvements in comparison to previous titles are immense, there are tons of tweakable options and interface shortcuts. The development team took everything they knew from the previous games and made this the best Monster Hunter game yet. It's possible to customize your item inventory, putting everything in your own personalized order. Then there are the radial menus that allow you to pick any item or even gesture without scrolling through the inventory or going through lengthy menus. Item management in general is easier and things like gear and weapon stats are more descriptive, even if they look a bit too overwhelming at first glance.It's important to point out how refined the game play mechanics are. Monsters have very distinct attack patterns, character controls are solid and if you screw up then you know it was your own fault and not the game's. The general controls are tight and require precise inputs and timings, cue the Souls-like comparison. The series are indeed known for the difficulty, however, the learning curve in this game is just right.The story has never really been important. Any Monster Hunter game that I've played had it and I can't say that I can remember much, because it quickly becomes irrelevant. It's used as a reason to hunt monsters, a reason to gradually introduce more difficult monsters, but it's really unengaging and bloated to say the least. Tons of text and dialogue is thrown at you with all the fancy names and terms just to confuse even more. Racing games are plagued by the same approach and the situation with story engagement there isn't any better. The inclusion of the story by itself isn't a bad thing by any means, but in this case it's closely tied to the gameplay until you've finished all story arcs. Then you can do whatever you want without any restrictions whatsoever.The amount of story, tutorial, messages and things that you're supposed to check and remember is overwhelming, headache-inducing even. The introduction sequence is fine, but when you're thrown in the meat and potatoes of the game there're tons of things that are thrown in your face all at the same time. Granted, you don't need to do much to start your first real hunts. Since this is the most ambitious Monster Hunter title yet, it makes sense that this title has a MMORPG feel to it.This isn't the first Monster Hunter game to feature Co-Op, so the team has experience, but it's the one that has dumb and backwards story mission Co-Op system. To make the cooperation system more confusing than it should be there's a restriction which prevents the player from playing a story mission together with someone until the player has seen all story-related cutscenes within that particular mission. Meaning that if you were planning to just sit down and seamlessly play with your friends, then that's not going to happen. The host needs to view all cutscenes and then either shoot an SOS signal (which opens the floodgates for any player to join in, so your friends might miss the opportunity) or quit the level and make a new lobby for it. Why couldn't the other players join in to view the cutscenes is beyond me.Every time I open the store page for the game it never ceases to amaze me how many DLCs are put on sale. I don't have a single game in my library that would have ... 174 DLCs on sale. Sure, like 10% of them are free, but this is something that you'd see on milked Koei Tecmo games, which isn't exactly a favorable comparison. I can understand that since this game has received countless content updates and is somewhat a live service then some players can opt in to spend extra money on bling. At the same time I can also say that this game has been a huge success across all available platforms, is Capcom's most sold game of all time and that it's still selling even now. Point being that with these kind of sales alone there should be enough revenue to keep the game afloat with content updates, reeling in new players and keeping existing ones interested.It's no big secret that initial first impressions of this game weren't favorable. With the huge maps filled with monsters and various visual effects the game hammered both CPUs and GPUs alike, even if you had a high-end system. In my particular case both CPU and GPU have near 100% utilization at targeted 1080p60 and that's not even with all of the effects maxed out.In terms of performance, I can't say that much has changed since the release. The console version frame rate is all over the place and goes as low as 20 FPS, so being able to experience this game at a responsive frame rate ranges is worth it. What did rapidly change is the hardware market: thanks to AMD, high core count CPUs are now available for cheap and newer graphics cards rip through this game easily.One thing that was soon discovered after the game's launch is that the texture quality on PC's highest settings was a step below the consoles. There was no real excuse to have dumbed down texture settings while also offering other visual settings that go way above the console quality. It took way too many months before this was finally addressed and now you can enjoy the game the way it was supposed to be from the get go.Another major issue that I personally didn't encounter much is that people often had connection issues and got kicked out of the lobbies mid-session. Considering that hunts can be up to around 50 minutes long, such behavior is really frustrating. This undesired behavior was patched, but even today there are people (probably on weaker connections) that still suffer from this.The game leaves good first impressions. If you get drawn into the cycle of enjoying the combat and grinding for better gear to whack even stronger monsters, then you'll spend hours upon hours in this game. Content patches and game fixes addressed majority of my complaints, so I can easily recommend Monster Hunter: World in its current state.Review copy provided by Capcom Co., Ltd."

Simply making your own builds and testing them gives so much joy, especially considering how, while there is most certainly a meta, you can use pretty much any weapon, and any build, and find some amount of success. No other game makes me feel this way; there always seems to be some build that is just better than the rest, and if you want to go to the higher levels, you are all but forced to use that particular build. For this reason alone World is one of my favourite games of all time."

The environments are sprawling, beautiful, and full of opportunites to use the terrain against your foes. I have been playing the game entirely in co-op, with no issues after the first couple weeks.

If I could go back in time and experience my first blind playthrough again, I absolutely would. Monster Hunter World is probably my favorite video game of all time. If you're on the fence about Monster Hunter (any game in the series, not just World) I would say it's a little bit like learning an instrument. There's a lot to figure out, you're going to feel like you don't know what you're doing, and it's probably going to be hard at first. But if you're not afraid of being bad at a video game, you're in for one hell of a ride. Is this game... Overwhelming? At times, sure. Grindy? At the endgame, absolutely. Full of RNG percentage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? If you want to be top-tier-meta, you have to get lucky, sorry. But All of the negatives I found with this game are entirely optional, kind of like NG+ and all the *walls* I ran into came after about 80 hours or so. I could've stopped playing the instant I felt that the gameplay loop was giving me diminishing returns, and I would've 100% felt that I got my $60 worth. (I didn't, but that's not the point.)People often say a Monster Hunter game doesn't begin until after the credits, just like all gigantic JRPGs, but that's not how I remember World. Exploring some of the most beautiful levels I've ever seen, learning how to properly use my weapon (only to discover a new move after another hundred hunts), seeing patterns and learning how monsters telegraph their attacks, and the addiction of getting the one item drop that lets you finish a new armor set. I imagine this is how people who only play SoulsBorne games feel, minus the  masochism. In terms of sheer joy, this is up there with those moments as a kid playing Guitar Hero for the first time, or staying up until 4am at a friend's house playing Smash. Again, this is probably my favorite video game ever, and I wouldn't even say I'm good at it. After 350 hours I played 99% with 1 weapon, and so you could make the argument that I've barely scratched the surface, with 11 others waiting for me to pick up on a replay. (I won't, but again, that's not the point.)For what it's worth, I played mostly solo, but multiplayer is a blast too. I don't really have a conclusion or closing statement or anything like that, I just wanted to gush about this game. Thanks for reading this far, hope you're having a nice day :)"

Combat is incredibly fluid and heavily centered around performing combos to maximize your damage output. On the surface all looks and behaves well, but the game in general is quite the resource hog (focused on more below). Be that as it may, the game's combat in itself both looks and feels great, and so comes off as a positive point.+Hunts: This is the main thing you will be doing in the game, and I can happily say that each new creature you hunt is enjoyable, in the sense each hunt feels similar to a boss fight, as it should. Fighting each new creature, figuring out their attack patterns and weaknesses is what makes each new hunt so thrilling, and MHW does just that with this release.+Graphics: The game looks great, simple as that. Each creature you meet and the expansive environments to travel in are stunning.+Variety: You have a total of 14 weapon classes to choose from. Each providing their own sets of benefits and demerits, and allowing you to take on different means of approaches for a hunt. These varying classes basically allow at least one fit for any hunter to mesh with their preferred playstyle.+Cats: Your Palico companion, and chefs, are simply adorable. That's really all I want to say, but your companion in specific is very helpful and still gives you a partner if running solo. Your Palico can assist in a variety of manners be it in damage, defense, or restoration. -Optimization isn't the best, more modest rigs are going to have a tougher time of running it (my 1080 barely passes 60 fps on high in 1440p, even when out of combat). UPDATE: After turning off volumetric rendering for the fog in the advanced settings I'm getting between 90 - 100 fps on high. Hard to say how much of an increase lower end rigs will experience so I'll leave this up as a ""buy with caution"" point.UPDATE 2: According to hardware monitor my i7 8700k almost reached 100 degrees celcius, this is NOT okay. Yes the game is more cpu intensive, but to the extent that my hardware is well past the threshold any CPU should reasonably take shows that the game is more poorly optimized than initially thought.-Denuvo: people seem to be experiencing a lot of issues and from what I'm seeing it seems mostly due to the anti tamper denuvo in the game. If it's as bad as it seems, you may want to make sure your computer is compatible which, if it isn't, will suck for more than a few I'm sure (knew there was denuvo but didn't interfere with my experience, guess I was lucky). -Online: It's only kinda functional, at first playing with my friend was a bit confusing due to how lobbies worked but after figuring it out we got to hunt together, BUT we have experienced connectivity issues in the game and randomly disconnected from one another. As we were continuously communicating through discord, it's evident that this isn't an issue with our actual connection to our internet.-Controls: I've personally opted to use a controller from the start, and have no real complaints about the controls. But experimentation with the KB+M felt very off. The mouse in particular behaves like a joystick rather than a mouse for aiming with the cursor, and causes for some incredibly awkward movements. There doesn't seem to be any way around this either. I'd recommend a controller if possible for other buyers, but this will come as a bummer to many if not (unless this is later fixed of course).My first real Monster Hunter game in the series and I love it, recommended to all, newcomers and veterans alike. Will update more if need be as I play through the PC version.Additional info: After playing through the game a bit more, more issues have sprouted up. The game works and I am indeed enjoying it, but there are many who are going through worse due to these stated issues. As such, I advise caution to purchasing this game immediately, it may be best to bide your time and see how the game is patched."

With that being said I would hope that I am more than capable of giving some insight on my experience with MHW as a whole.Firstly. The developers deserve all the praise in the world for releasing a great game brimming with tangible content. Ever since release they have also been consistently updating the game with new exciting monsters, weapons, armor, etc. for free! They have also been continuing to do so after the release of the Iceborne expansion several months ago, which alone had already doubled the amount of in-game content. A lot of triple-A titles these days charge you absurd amounts of money for extremely small content packages with little to no support following afterwards. This isn't even mentioning the small fact that MHW's cosmetic DLCs don't make you feel obligated to buy them when comparing them to the cosmetics that the base game has to offer.Being the first world-wide Monster Hunter to release on all major platforms, there is without a doubt a handful of things the devs have not handled perfectly following its release. The major killer being co-op in the early game, primarily just for the story quests which normally only last a few hours anyway. I for one think the story should be handled alone for the most part so new players can steadily learn and adapt to the game to avoid frustration in the future. Besides that I still do encourage seeking guidance from veteran players when needed without ruining the game's experience. I myself have helped dozens of friends in the past learn the game because I knew it was entirely worth the effort.With all that being said MHW is indeed an objectively grindy game on paper when you really start to sink your teeth into it. As with a lot of games there's an expected level of tedium when it comes to any kind of grinding. Regardless, as with every good game, there is always some sort of repitition to be had in it's own right. The game is only ever ""grindy"" if the player makes it so. Yes there are times where new players will have to take things slow but for the most part anyone can just casually progress through the majority of the game without any huge stops(Depending on the player of course). There is always something meaningful or important to do regardless if it has anything to do with grinding. However if you're the type of person who does enjoy min-maxing gear or heavily personalizing your play-style then it's a very rewarding grind if you put yourself through it. Hence all the players who enjoy the game.Moving on. The game offers the player 14 different diverse weapon classes to freely choose from. Some weapons are easy to learn but have higher mechanical skill ceilings, while others are more technically complex but are easier to master, some just outright more stylish than others. Armor can be mixed and matched to your liking to provide different skills and abilities to help further personalize your play-style, whether it's situational skills or ""comfy"" skills. All of this on top of the game's straightforward yet beautifully in-depth character customization at the start of the game(Which is permanent unless you pay a couple cents to re-edit your physical character). Also I'd like to mention that even though there is a clearly defined meta when it comes to dealing damage in this game, the vast majority of the hunters who abide by these ideals are mostly all bark and no bite. You can't do damage if you're already dead. Therefore I strongly encourage everyone to play the way they want as long as it helps them survive.Speaking of death. In regards to frustrations with the harder content, every single quest in the game runs on a timer... I think it's perfectly fine if the devs want to give a couple of endgame monsters damage checks. The game was never meant to be easy. The game gives the player literal solutions to every problem in the entire game. It's just up to the players themselves to step out of their comfort zones to prepare for and overcome them all(Alatreon is not as hard as people make it seem). The only real penalty for death is the loss of used items, time, and reduced quest rewards assuming the player can actually complete the quest. Nothing too hardcore here.On a small tangent for active players. There have been lots of frustrations stemming from the newly introduced clutch claw mechanics. While I do believe the clutch claw is a perfect addition to MHW it was executed horribly. I feel the best way to implement these mechanics would be to have all weapons soften in one clutch but to allow certain normal attacks from slower weapons to straight-up soften or at least prolong the softens when making contact.Gameplay is insurmountable. When animations and sound design are done as good as this, it goes completely unnoticed and even taken for granted at times. Everything happening in the game feels so real and natural. Monsters have intention, weapons have believable weight to them, and the player characters make everything they do seem deliberate. Other games slowly lead you to a climax in which they grant a reward after. Where as MHW is one of those games where the climax is the reward, but that's the secret of MHW, you're always at the climax. Every second is a fight for your life yet also a display of power and finesse. A truly intense back-and-forth of instinct and endurance of whether or not you or the monster tires out first. All of that isn't even including the best part. The experience of fighting alongside other hunters. You see a lower-level hunter struggling so you offer them help and then cross paths with them, better than they were, in the future. Or you see another hunter using the same weapon as you so it turns into a competition of who's better with the weapon but you both end up completely in sync with your movesets while attacking the monster. Or the monster pins you down and that one annoying teammate who kept knocking you over with his weapon earlier ends up being the one dropping their weapon to save your life.It's a game. You're supposed to be having fun.Is all the time you put into having fun with something gone to waste because something else on the surface made you upset with the it at the end of it all?If this game at all sparks any sort of interest to you and you're willing to go in with a clear and open mind to experience the world of Monster Hunter World. You won't regret it~EDIT: Sorry for the edits. OCD things~"

Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. It came to the point where I lost my girlfriend because of it. The game is not for everyone though. It can be described as a grindy game to get gear to progress. The way to feel a sense of progression in this game is not through a level-up system. It is done through acquiring new gear, learning new monster's moveset and finally overcoming the monster with your new-found knowledge and skills adapted to slay the target. It is said to be grindy because, defeating the target monster once, usually does not give you enough materials required for the full set or a particular piece of equipment you need. You have to fight the monster on average twice to obtain that monster's gear. Collaboration events unfortunately will fall in the same rule most of the time. For those who wish to be a completionist, like me, it will easily burn you out since the quest will become repetitive. To counter the mundane gameplay, there is an assortment of weapons to choose from, each with its unique styles and variations to play any given weapon. Some weapons may not be favoured for certain monsters, while some just outright abuse them. Picking out and trying new weapons are always a treat and learning techniques is always refreshing to learn or re-learn whenever you come back to pick up the game. So if you're ever bored, try out different weapons.Personally, I came from older titles such as Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Tri, and XX. Translating skills from previous titles to here is smooth and in World, there are many quality of life changes that just makes the game so much easier to play. So for returning players, I would recommend trying out World as well. For those that are considering getting the Iceborne expansion. I would also recommend getting it. Tired of walking from one place to another with your joystick or pressing ""w""? Iceborne introduces Uber. Experience riding on a monster. It is also possible to use items to sharpen your hammer or hunting horn while in transit. It saves time and looks hilarious by itself. However, I do recommend completing the base game before proceeding with the Iceborne content/region. Anything else would be spoilers beyond this point.Great game, one of my favourite games of all time. I thoroughly recommend it!"

Contrary to what a select few are reporting, I'm actually able to play it (and that seems to be what the majority are experiencing) but averaging about every hour/hour and a half, the game gets an error and kicks you out. (EDIT: Since the patch, this issue appears to have completely disappeared. There may still be crashes but I can only presume they're very rare)Before people flip their ♥♥♥♥, the issue actually appears to be related to Steam's newest reworks to their friends system and ecetera, so you can blame Valve for trying to fix what wasn't broken, and breaking things in the process.Anyway, the game's excellent. I'm not a series veteran but I had played Monster Hunter prior to this one, and this is certainly an excellent entry into the series. Expect:-Slow but satisfying combat. While the series can be compared to something like Dark Souls' systems, don't expect to be mega-mobile 24/7, with the ability to turn on a dime and run as fast as a speeding bullet. This game's combat is, relatively to even Dark Souls II (the slowest of all the Soulsborne games), even more methodical. While some weapons like the Bow or Insect Glaive let you be pretty mobile for those who prefer that kind of style, the game will demand that if you want to do serious damage, you'll have to commit to a position and stay there. The same, however, goes for the monsters you fight, so it's not exactly unfair.-This game to be more welcoming than pretty much any other MH entry. Now, don't make assumptions: This game is complicated as all hell (what with over a decade of new iterations adding more and more features), and there WILL be mechanics that will confuse you and you'll likely resort to guides on the Internet to fully understand, but this was explicitly made to introduce Monster Hunter to people who had never played it before, and it's also certainly not a dumbed down version of previous MH games. If you can handle the complexity of, say, an MMO, you can absolutely handle Monster Hunter.-A single gameplay loop (hunting giant monsters) that the game will repeat, a lot. If you're playing Monster Hunter for the campaign, don't. This game is made for people who enjoy that formula of planning, tracking, and execution that the series has refined to a knife's edge, and most importantly, it's made for people who are interested in repeating that formula into the post-game. If you just beat games and you're done with them, MH might not be for you, I'd recommend something more singleplayer-driven. (though this game can be played singleplayer and you can still enjoy it)-Slightly less ""content"" than most other Monster Hunters, but that's probably because they strimmed down the more grindy elements. Even then, we're looking at a 30 hour campaign, a post-game that'll bump the playtime to at least 70 for anyone interested, and a core game that can entertain people for 200+ hours if the core gameplay really hooks them. If you think 30 hours for JUST the main story, in a series heavily centered around post-campaign content, AND in a game that already reduxed the core gameplay of the series into the modern era in a way that feels more smooth and polished than it's ever been, is ""not enough"", I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to tell you.Overall, a very fun entry into the series that will hopefully serve as a good introduction to those who are new."

There is no denying it definietly got better. There is also no denying that there still are major problems (for example, lack of optimization got even worse and all redundant 3rd party software that this game utilizes got exponentially more intrusive) that do not justify ceasing all the work on fixing port problems. Yes, most of these problems can be fixed by mods. No, those mods are not included in ""box"" product, hence this point. With Iceborne's release, parts of main game combat got axed and moved into a new Iceborne-exclusive crutch feature (that majority of players either find unnecessary or downright hate, by the way), so only DLC owners can fully experience the main game content. This is just a petty, disgusting practice that no sane person will ever defend. About aforementioned crutch aka clutch claw feature - yes, despite all the steps made by Capcom in final title update to make it less frustrating and demanding, it still is what it was - a stick in combat flow's gears that forces people to interact with half-аssed mechanic that doesn't work properly 20% of the time, just to be able to... do exactly what you used to do without it in the base game? A new shoehorned mechanic wouldn't be such a big deal if it wasn't for the fact that most of new bugs, as well as random outcomes in combat, are directly tied to the fact that player is forced to constantly roll a dice whether it's gonna work properly, or randomly fail in many different possible ways and get them killed. New content coming up post Iceborne release was fun and challenging... until it wasn't. I know it is very hard to come up with new challenges and engaging fights within established rules, but completely breaking the rules is not the right approach in game design, which is exactly the path Capcom took with all the latest title updates.For example, there used to be unblockable attacks, and a skill to guard unblockable attacks. So, Capcom in all the light of their genius, gives monsters attacks that are... even more unblockable, and bypass that skill entirely? There are already monsters that you are safer just eating an attack from and going into invincible recovery than guarding and getting unsafe blockstun for several seconds, mind you, so why not just use that, to make the game obey its own rules? You have hyperarmor, but some attacks go through hyperarmor because... muh difficulty? You have a mantle used specifically to get a safe clutch claw on the monster, so now some monsters either ignore it or destroy it instantly with fast startup attacks? Why not design new fights in such a way that makes those options less safe, but without just making them obsolete? You did it right with Rajang's unique interactions with clutch claw, why take the lazy path and just disregard the tools you gave to your players in pretty much all later title updates?Some weapons being a better matchup than others against certain monsters was always a thing in Monster Hunter franchise, but certainly not to a point where you dump a weapon you have 1+k hunts on in favor of a weapon you've never played due to how little return you get on all the effort you put into playing your main weapon. Before title updates, some matchups had mandatory build adjustments: you pretty much had to slap a shield on your heavy bowgun to fight Ruiner Nergigante; however, now you just have to ditch the entire heavy bowgun just to not hate your life when fighting Fatalis or AT Velkhana, while there are weapons you can literally mash a button with and win those ""challenging"" fights.This is not challenging, this is just inconsistent and wrong - don't take my word for it, most of the experienced players from multiple game communities I play with agree that the entire weapon matchup balance against latest monsters is all over the place. If that's not convincing enough - look at your average speedrun differences, where all the fast melee weapons' gameplan is to just go in and proactively hit the lategame monster while dodging attacks mid combo, while all ranged weapons and some slower melee weapons are standing there and having a stare contest with the monster, waiting for a good AI RNG since they don't have any tools to counterplay most of its attacks.Anyway, later title updates - cool hunt designs spoiled by rule inconsistencies and artificial, inflated difficulty. With how little flexibility you have in your playstyle, they play more like gimmick bosses than actual monster hunts. I still can't tell if it's a core gameplay design flaw, or just Capcom being lazy to balance later hunts for all weapons and competent playstyles. Capcom made a wise decision to bring some of missing collab content on PC, which is a good thing, and one of the major grievance in outdated version of this review. They also synchronized updates for all consoles, but way too late, when it didn't really matter anymore. Most of existing input/GUI bugs or port-specific code artifacts got fixed. that conditions of obtaining some collab contant may vary, you may have to pay full price for things PS users had options to receive for free."

Every weapon is different. Every monster is different. Still, there's enough predictability to give you a sense of accomplishment when you complete a quest a little better than your last. And enough chaos you can't help but laugh at some of the monster's antics, other players, or even yourself.You can easily devote dozens of hours in the endgame to defeat a certain monster, and be quite satisfied to succeed in twenty minutes. A feat few attain.At this point, many players will think they've done all there is and move on to other games. But some will find themselves devoting hundreds more hours to complete it in ten minutes! In any case, they're no longer the same player: they have a much deeper understanding of their weapons and monsters. It is also inevitable that they find themselves bumping repeatedly into other like-minded players, and discover this ongoing journey is much more fun with friends.And it doesn't seem to end: there are communities who still find room for improvement, especially with a little teamwork. Among those with several thousands of hours under their belt are hunters who can accomplish the quest in under five minutes.You will meet all sorts - join us for an amazing journey."

The music is great, gameplay is great, multiplayer is so much fun when it works but it does disconnect often enough to not be perfect, the story is alright (unskippable cutscenes are annoying) but it is secondary to the action. You get 14 weapons to choose from, each with lots of moves and some even have different play styles among them. It's a game that even after thousands of hours you can still improve and learn new things. The monsters of course are the stars of the show and there's a wide variety of them (60+ if I recall correctly) and there's tons and tons of content even outside of proper monster hunting. Crafting gear, augmenting and upgrading it, improving your ""farm"", obtaining special items called boosters and mantles, collecting decorations to make builds, capturing pets, fashion hunting, exploring every locale... So much stuff to do. Also, blessed be the last update. Fatalis is amazing.EDIT: Updated for the Steam Awards, yet again"

Haha.The game went from disastrous release to a smooth sail in a couple of weeks. After a few tweaks and fix here and there from Capcom, Monster Hunter World is finally enjoyable on PC. The most annoying issues I had before was connectivity and mouse camera control that feel sluggish (even though I mainly use gamepad, but sometimes switch to mouse/keyboard). Now:- No more server issues.- Mouse camera controls are very fluid.The graphic is certainly amazing. It is certainly a major improvement from previous installment in the series.  Some people are complaining about low texture quality, but I don't feel bothered with it because when I'm on the hunt, don't usually pay much attention to it.The gameplay is challenging as ever, with ridiculous hitboxes and the sluggish movement of your character even when using light weapon like dual blade or sword & shield. But all that hurdle will be rewarded with the iconic music at the end of the quest, but with the most awkward last hit. ""A little poke to the toe of that Nergigante, bam, quest finished. Okay I guess, let's carve it.""I think things that lacking now are, the optimization of keyboard control (Rename loadout with escape? Oh come on. And don't forget to press F1-F4 first before using items in quest), and the lack of meaningful event. I get it, baby steps toward better future right? But those steps're better be like Xeno'jiva's one, or people will lose patiences with this already scarce roster of monsters.All in all, I think this game deserve to be put in your library. Just find a friend to play with 'cause hunting alone is somewhat boring in the long run."

For a very long time a lot of games never really drove me to play them, either because there was little to no replayability, or the concept of the game was cool and all but a lot of things get in the way of the experience whether it be because of an annoyance or the gameplay gets repetitive. However this game has a lot of those issues solved for me- Mechanics are quick and easy to learn- There's unique ways to fight each monster (even if it may be like darksouls in some cases)- The environments are well crafted to not only look good but have practicle uses in navigation - There's no hand holding because the game expects you to learn how to play it instead of tells you everything anytime- Tons of replayability due to the amount of weapons and the various trees that are available- Multiplayer capable (so that it can make some particulary difficult monsters a tiny bit easier though it auto balances them)- Well crafted DLC that feels like it's own thing but without feeling like it should be just it's own game (plus it adds to the replayability because it adds more stuff to grind on)Any many many more but I don't want to make this review any longer than it already is, but yes I recommend this A LOT"

However there is a lot of controversy around World and especially the PC port which some people might read about and get worried about the game not being good enough and I'd like to adress some of these points. For those who aren't interested in these, just scroll down to the bottom for my thoughts on MH:World itself.First of all: The delay between Console and PC release.This one is actually quite simple. Compare a console with a PC, what PC you ask? Well, I don't know, Everyone has different hardware and it's hard to say what a ""standard"" PC looks like. And thats the big problem here. Consoles all have the same hardware, meaning developers can efficently optimise their game for those platforms without worrying about differences in performance, which is why for the PC release they had to take some additional time to properly port the game which from my over 300 hours can say they did quite well.Quality of the PC port.How well does the game hold up compared to the console counterpart? Quite well actually. Sure the game is resource intensive but the performance is smooth. Even mid-level PCs can run the game at solid 60FPS given they set up the video settings correctly.The one issue the port has is the interface which is clearly made for controllers but those menus are not gamebreaking. Opening the ingame text chat sure has a few clicks too much, but that aside, most things can be streamlined by taking a few minutes to adjust the control scheme of the game.The connection issues the game suffered from early on during the release also got resolved, making the online experience as smooth as never before as long as everyone has a stable internet connection.Lack of content compared to prior games:This is one many returning players like to bring up, which is fair. You pay a good chunk of money so you expect a good amount of content for it. But many seem to ignore one important feature of the franchise. World marked the beginning of the 5ft generation of Monster Hunter games. What does that mean for all those who are new to the series: Every generation includes multiple games, each effectively being an expansion of the prior one. Like MH3U being an expansion for MH3 for example. If you consider World as the first game of this generation and compare the amount of content with other first games of their generations, The amount of content is actually very comparable with the difference that World has reached a new level in world design which of course takes up a lot of dev resources as well. Iceborne will be acting as the second game of this generaton, except it's an expansion so you do not need to buy a new game, just a DLC. And you dont need to start fresh if you don't want to but can carry over your existing hunter unlike previous games where you effectively just grinded through the same content as the first game of the generation. So overall I'd say this is a massive improvement.Monster Hunter: World is a game not without flaws but thanks to the streamlined gameplay and quality of life features it manages to stand out from all other titles in the franchise as a unique game and a perfect entry into the series for new players while keeping all the core elements that made it so addicting for everyone who played the prior games. Is it easier than older games? Yes, quite a lot so, but with Low Rank acting mostly like an extended tutorial for new players while returning veterans can rush right into the endgame where their skills will be tested by Tempered and Arch-Tempered monsters.And lets not forget the mod support. The community made a vast array of mods already ranging from minor visual upgrades, to information focused interfaces and even custom quests which players can challenge themselves with."

Why it is that good you asked? I will tell you all the good things and the bad things about it in this review!I will first address the elephant in the room, or should i say... The big monster in the room, its the combat gameplay. It is really fun and challenging, the game basically has you fighting this big ass monster with their own move set and behavior that you learn and adapt with. It makes every battle feels like an epic boss fight that can last between 10-50 minutes. Just like every loot focus game, when you kill a monster you will get loot that you can combine to make weapons and armors that will make you do more damage and take more damage. With the new higher tier equipment for example, can make the monster fight that you epically beat after an exhausting 45 minutes battle with the lower tier equipment, be beaten in 10 minutes. The best thing about it is that you still feel the excitement of beating it cause it can still hit you, although it hit you with less damage cause of the new equipment, you still feel like you have the challenge to beat it faster and with less damage taken.Outside of the main combat, the gameplay also has you getting loot from your monster hunt and make equipment from it, i do have to say although i usually don't like a loot-based game cause it can get very grindy. In this game, the combat is very fun that i can tolerate having to grind for loot. It's still a very grindy and RNG-based game sadly. There's some method to lower that grind time like a way to get a coupon that can be traded for rare loot by doing the weekly quest. But it still only lower the RNG part somewhat, since there's still some loot that you can only get by hunting monster and pray to RNG God that you get the loot that you want.The great thing about this game is how many combinations of playstyle that you can do by using different weapons. There's 14 weapon type in this game and every one of them really changes how you approach to combat entirely. You can use lance and basically be a walking tank, really slow but can block a lot of damage coming to your way. You can bowgun and shoot them from far away and run away when the monster gets closer. You can even fly and comes down just to hit the monster at the right time using glaives. You get the point, there's a ton of different playstyle in this game and each of them can take a while to master. Giving the game a longer playtime assuming that you enjoy the core monster hunting gameplay.The story its... Okay. I really do try to follow the story and i just lost interest halfway through. The story basically can be summed up to, a group of hunters go to a new world, see a new monster and basically try to fight it all. Other than the main monster, i honestly already forgot why we need to hunt them. The plot really not the strong point of the game and its easily forgettable. But that's fine because most players that play Monster Hunter: World didn't play it because of the story. It will be better to just think that there is no story.The graphics and music! First is the music, it honestly got the same treatment as the story. Easily forgettable, outside of a few that stand out. I feel like they just put music not to enhanced the experience and more as a sound to make the game less quiet. I wish i have more to say about the music but i don't. The graphics, i will have to say that i play this game on the lowest settings, so it may have really great graphics, but i can't experience it. So, i can't say anything about this one.The question still remains, is it good enough for your wallet? I will say that its a very good game, despite a few flaws in it. I will recommend it to the fullest if you like action challenging boss fighting game, you will feel right at home with this one and will spend countless hours on it! Recommended!"

Before that, I want to tell you that I am new to Monster Hunter series and this is my first game.RPG , Single player , Multiplayer ( 4 players max. ) , Action so on as the tags says| Slaying Monsters | Make weapons and armor our of their bodies | Slay bigger and harder monster |Upgrade the weapons and Armor | Amazing story | A tough game | 14 types of balanced weapons | 4 Maps + 1 expansion DLC Map incoming | 40+ Monsters and more to come |Appropriate for Any age.• Graphics are Amazing and does run from Low end PC ( but on low settings ) as well. • You don't need to create new character and level to be support or DPS. The same character and any weapon can go however you like to. • Monsters feel realistic. They don't just fight you as AI. They have ecologies , turf wars ( fighting for ones turf ) , eating when tired or hungry so on. • Updates , DLC and collaborations constantly updated. • No Pay to win. All the DLC are costumes and visual beneficial except the expansion map incoming []• No long loading screens. They last around 2-14 seconds mostly. • Tough game but worth it and rewarding. • Even the grind doesn't bore you. • Fantastic Story and doesn't need you to play previous games to understand it.• Connection issues are fixed long time ago. Its not of an issue now.• Constant seasonal events updating. • Performance is amazing in all kinds of specs. Low mid and high. • High End PC can run High Resolution Texture pack  DLC to make it even more high quality textures.• Complexity & learning curve. For me the complexity and learning curve isn't very steep. But for my friends, some things seem to be hard to understand. I guess they are enjoying game too much rather than observing at least thats what they said. But in this generation everyone just googles the things that bothers them and find answers anyways. • Volumetric Rendering. This is an option in settings that boosts your performance a lot and reduces VRAM consumption by 1.2 GB. It just adds a fog that covers objects which are a little further away, most of the people don't like it as well. Especially considering that much of performance increase. Either way its your personal preference.• The game is Addictive. Seriously , I have spent a lot of time just watching at monsters mind their own business. The monsters just doesnt wait there to attack you. They in fact live like they are real living organisms. And a lot of detailed stuff.• Progress through your story (Assignment Quests) to unlock various perks. Armor Improvement , weapon Damage improvement & .• Herb + Phial = Potion , Potion + Honey = Mega Potion which heals you by huge amount of health. Flash bug = flash pod , equip on slinger and shoot at monster face to make them blind or make flying monsters fall down. Dung = Dung pod , equip on slinger and shoot at monster which you don't want to fight yet its irritating you. It will flee away by doing so. • If you hit a point where its very hard to move on , inside the quest , press escape >  fire an SOS flare. Make sure you do it within the 10 minutes of quest started. If not people who comes to help you doesnt get rewards and those who know it ( most of them ) won't join. If the time has passed away , you can return from quest ( you will have the items you farmed and used items will disappear ) or Abandon quest ( you will return to town as if you didn't even go to quest , without losing items or gaining items from quest ). • If you fire an SOS and someone comes to help you , try not to die. As there is a limit to where you can die ( 2 is normal limit and 3rd time you die, quest is failed ). They are unable to help even if they came because of quest failure. So there goes my honest review about the whole game. Hope this helps you decide if you want to buy the game. And I am right now reached endgame and I am happy to help if you guys need any help. If I am not busy, I would surely help you. Ping me at discord ( AlexCorner#9324 ) or comment on this thread if you have any questions or if you don't have discord. I blocked incoming friend requests as I am selling some stuff in steam market and I don't want to negotiate on them."

I'm also quite fresh to the Monster Hunter franchise as any of the games that did make it here were on the Wii and by the time the 2010s rolled around I was starting to move on from that platform. So here is an unbiased review of the game from the perspective of someone fresh.Pros:+ The game simply looks gorgeous, and while you certainly couldn't run this on a work laptop the game is really well polished with no crashes as of my near 40 hours playing thus far. I've had some frame dips when there are a lot of particle effects thrown into the air but they're immediately corrected the second after. I would still tone things down just to make it easier on your computer.+ Tons of really well designed armor sets that you can upgrade and continue to use even in late game, so nothing feels absolutely useless as you become more powerful. Because the armor sets have unique resistances the game encourages you to change your armor and weapons to fight the monsters you are hunting accordingly.+ There are so many different ways to approach your hunts that it's almost countless. You could bash the dinosaur's head in with an over sized mallet, OR you could bash the dinosaur and capture it, OR you could wait for the dinosaur to go to sleep and then blow it up with a powder keg to weaken it for the fight. With a total of 14 weapon types to choose from and several branching upgrade paths, added on top of that with countless utility items, the world is pretty much your oyster so it's entirely up to you on how you want to punch dragons/dinosaurs in the face.+ Music isn't exactly anything to write home about, but there are particular tracks featuring flutes and violin play that have caught my attention. All the music feels fitting and does a good job of going with the environments or fights so no complaints there.+ Sound design is almost flawless. I can't really say there's anything I would change except for making the impact sound of weapons a little bit louder and some of the monster sounds. I have noticed a couple chicken noises as well as stock audio animal sounds you would typically hear in cartoons overlayed with other noises. Other than that, weapons sound satisfying and the monsters sound fairly intimidating despite those two points.+ I'm not one for paying attention to video game food or even anime food, but damn does this game make food look GOOD. There is no point to this point, it simply must be pointed out. There is nothing more satisfying than eating a meal before punching dragons and or dinosaurs in the face, until you consider the fact that your food is being prepared by anthropomorphic cats... And they are indeed not wearing hairnets.+ Crafting is really straight forward. None of that ""You need to have an alchemy level of 30 to craft healing potion II !"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You gather the stuff to make stuff and you can go to a botanist to generate stuff while you're gone so you can collect stuff to make more stuff. In other words, if you have the stuff you can make the stuff and not even my pessimistic ass can complain about that.Cons:- There are SO MANY useless animations for things just to deliberately waste precious seconds for no other reason other than to waste precious seconds. Getting on the giant iguana to chase whatever you're hunting? Better pet it first and ask how its day is going. Getting revived by your cat? Better get up and give him an exaggerated anime thumbs up and nod. Need to just take a quick swig of potion to cure yourself of poison? Better take two seconds to down the whole Gatorade. The last two I mentioned as examples can be helped to a certain extent such as just not dying like an idiot or making herbal medicine but that does not make this ♥♥♥♥ in the moment any less annoying.- Whoever thought it was a good idea to have unskippable cutscenes should be shot.- As far as I am aware you cannot skip the tutorial at all, and it goes on, and on, and on... I don't think the tutorials let up until I was 20 or so hours into the game. To make matters worse aside from wasting your time, I found myself having to check the wiki or Reddit forums for extra information on things anyway. So the game puts you through this long tutorials with a dump of information but it's not even enough to fully explain what it is trying to explain.- I feel like some of the vendors you can visit could have very easily been incorporated into the menu, such as quests, investigations, and the bestiary. I find it quite ridiculous that I have to go to the research facility, another hub, just to manage my investigations. Again, some of the design decisions made in this game feel like a giant conspiracy to waste the player's time, not to pad out the game time, but just to be an annoying ♥♥♥♥.- The story... I had no expectations coming in, none at all, but damn is the campaign a slog to get through. Disjointed dialogue even with Japanese voice acting, cringe deliveries, CANNOT SKIP CUTSCENE, and apparently they didn't care to even fully voice act the characters, so most of the voice acting is limited to cutscenes while out of cutscenes you read what they're telling you as they just spout unrelated vocal lines such as ""YEAH!"" ""OKAY!"" ""LOOK OVER HERE!"" and ""REMEMBER TO TAKE A BITE!"" You will feel more like a captive audience playing through this game for the first time, and simply perturbed the second time.Those are my thoughts on the game overall with 40 hours and no previous experience with this franchise. I think the game gets mostly everything right it's just a death of a thousand cuts where there are small inconveniences that stack up on one another as you play. For me it greatly annoys me, but for someone else it could be no big deal. I still highly recommend getting the game if you have a computer that can run it smoothly, but because I'm a broken record and I love penny pinching pick this up during a sale. Why impale your wallet for Capcom? Get everything in the deluxe as low as you can go!"

I played MH3 quite extensively and loved it. I tried to get into some of the other ones but hated playing on handheld... I had this idea that MH: World was going to be very different from the other games and put off playing it for a long time, but I honestly wish I hadn't!Everything I loved from MH3 was there. It felt like everything I liked about the game but better. I feel like they just improved everything.I love the concept at its core: You hunt monsters, harvest materials and craft better gear. The gameplay is fun and you have a huge variety of weapons that each have very different playstyles, so it's grindy but it's fun to grind.There are only a few maps. Each are pretty big, but especially rich in details and in stuff to find. Instead of having massive, empty worlds, you get very iconic zones that you learn to recognize over time. Instead of progressing through the game and forgetting ""old"" zones, you get to play in each of them for the whole game. I found myself constantly finding new shortcuts, new little hidden places with materials I hadn't seen before. It's fun even just to run around and gather stuff. If you've played any of the previous games, it's one big map now! No more transitions between zones.Crafting doesn't feel like a chore. The system is very well made and shows you dependencies when you've unlocked them and allow you to craft them first before crafting the item you want. You get plenty of ""loadouts"" or presets of items for your inventory, your equipments etc. So you waste less time managing your inventory and more time doing things that are actually fun. I think it's a great ""in-between"" having a tedious crafting system and removing it altogether.Playing through the game, I felt like there was always something new. Whenever I thought I had finished the game, I would unlocked 30 new things, new monsters I had never seen before, new zones when I thought I had unlocked them all. This game does a great job at giving you a sense of progression.There is always plenty of stuff to do, it's easy to set goals for yourself and even when you do run out of new content (after 100+ hours), there is still tons of things you can do.The gameplay is hard but rewarding. You learn how the monsters move, where they go, their weak spots. A lot of it is simply knowledge. You don't necessarily need insane technical skills if you're patient and you know what you're doing. But it always gets harder...One thing I also found interesting it's that it's one those games where everyone seems to like different weapons... I've heard from different people that different weapons were ""the best"" or ""broken/overpowered"". I think that it shows pretty good balancing in a way, when everyone feels like a different weapon is the strongest.It's overall just a very satisfying game. It's fun, it lasts a long time and there's tons of things to do.If I had to think of a few things I liked less... I wish I progressed ""slower"", especially in terms of armor. I found that I progressed so fast I was skipping lots of sets of armor and crafting the strongest I could instead. I think a lot of them look really cool and it makes me sort of sad I never got to wear them!I also dislike how cool sets look, when most of the time you'll have to mix and match different pieces to get the best skills, and ""layered"" armors (cosmetic overlays) are not exactly very varied.I would say that I wish there were more maps and more monsters... But there's already way more than I would expect. There's a new expansion coming too! I just hope that they will keep expanding on that game. I love being able to play on PC at last!If it sounds like your kind of game, don't hesitate to grab it. I promise it's worth it."
239,25,Kiri,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BHakm25yMZo/,31,3,1,645.1,"Posted: October 22, 2020",131,0,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/cd0cf896ddd5a1cea4547799571401420abf82b7.jpg,"After over 600 hours poured into this game I've finally found myself qualified to provide a somewhat objective view on this game with my own personal thoughts mixed into it. With Monster Hunter: World, Capcom delivers us a wonderful product filled with love and passion from the developers, and lets us discover a wonderful new world filled with many different living creatures and a gorgeous display of flora that differs on each and every map the game lets us visit. While story-wise you shouldn't expect to be blown away with amazing dialogues or any intriguing plot lines, you can definetely still get immersed into this world of people working together to fight a common enemy and overcome any problems coming their way. Our character gets a very warm welcome and we can feel the gratitude of people around us for risking ourselfes by fighting monsters and gathering materials for them. As the story progresses and our achievements pile up, we gain more and more respect from characters that are introduced as our superiors and it gives a great feeling of acoomplishment.Now for the main point, gameplay. Monster Hunter once again provides us with a staggering amount of different weapons and armor pieces for our use, which we can craft or upgrade using materials from the monsters we slay or capture. From the start we are given an option to set off on a hunt with one out of 13 different weapons, each and every one of them being very unique and different to each other, and an enormous amount of combinations of set skills from different armor pieces and decoration jewels. Speaking of which, this is what the endgame focuses on progression-wise. Now about the hunts themselves,early on the game can easily make you feel underpowered and leaves many new players frustrated, however with time and experience we learn about the monsters and improve which is one of the main points of hunting them. With time we learn that every monster has it's own elemental weakness, a weak spot or even a behavioral weakness that we can exploit to gain an upper edge. Visually almost every monster is stunning and we can see that a lot of work went into them. All monsters feel like they have a will of their own and we can sometimes see them interact with the enviroment surrounding them. Now when it comes to the fights themselves, to be blunt, some aren't perfect, some are wonderful and feel like a duel between you and the beast and some are just painfully bad and simply not fun. Fortuneately, most of the bad fights are only in the early game and we don't have to witness them that much but there are also some that stay in the endgame and could be a source of frustration when grinding for better gear, HOWEVER a credit is to be given where it's due, and I must say that when Capcom makes a well designed fight, they do it really well and fighting these monsters feels amazing and the better you get at it, the more good things about it you notice so I would say that the good easily outweighs the bad. After beating the main story we are left with 2 options, stop playing having completed the main tasks that were given to us or take on the loads of additional content waiting for us to challenge. Although the game has a main story for us to complete, most of the content of Monster Hunter comes from all of the stuff we can do after we beat it. We can face off against stronger versions of monsters we encountered earlier or just more of them at once, try to upgrade our gear even more, complete event quests that give us unique rewards or perfect your build for any weapon you like. The amount of things we are encouraged to do besides the story is amazing and the feeling of wanting to get better at beating a certain monster and cutting down the time it takes us to beat it and finally acoomplishing it is what makes people pour hundreds or even thousands of hours into this game. Apart from the main feature of the game which is hunting said monsters, we also have things to do on the side to ease our next hunts. You can set off on an expedition to gather materials, hunt smaller wildlife or even enjoy some fishing, and while all of this is optional, it does reward us for engaging in it. Monster Hunter features a quite lenghty list of things we can craft to aid us during hunts and some of them are pretty essential later on. Things like better health potions, drinks that give us damage or armor buffs, traps, smoke bombs, poisonous knives, ammunition and so on. All of this almost never makes you feel like you did it for nothing.To summarize, Monster Hunter: World is an amazing game packaged with amazing and unique gameplay and a living world inside it. Even though it isn't a heavily story-focused game, I still felt emotional when finishing it and immediately got hooked into the content that was waiting for me later on. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is interested in it. There is a reason that it's Capcom's best selling game, and hopefully after Monster Hunter: Rise we see an another entry on this scale as soon as possible. This concludes my review of Monster Hunter: World, specifically the base game, as there is an amazing expansion that has twice as much content with it, but that deserves a review of it's own.           Good luck to any of new aspiring hunters who just got into this wonderful game and hunt on!"

You also have an adorable cat companion called a Palico which can be outfitted with its own gear, all offering different bonuses for your character. And when it all seems like you’ve got it sussed, along comes High-Rank, Monster Hunter’s “post-game” content, which changes some monsters, adds new ones, and essentially doubles the amount of gear to lust after.The deeper you look, the deeper it all seems to get - and that sheer level of complexity has historically been what stops Monster Hunter from offering mainstream appeal. But let’s get something out of the way: there’s been an assumption among the waiting audience over the past few months that - despite the protestations of Capcom itself - World would simplify the series’ more obscure ideas to help court a western audience. After just the first few hours, it becomes abundantly clear those concerns are unfounded.Monster Hunter has always been opaque, its menus pebble-dashed with byzantine statistics, and its combat purposefully designed to be methodical and challenging in a way that feels strange next to modern action games’ fluidity. Practically none of that has changed. This remains a game where learning is as important as doing, from potion recipes to intricate combos.World is decidedly not a my-first-Monster-Hunter experience.“What’s changed in some ways is how they’re presented. Quality-of-life improvements have smoothed off a few rough edges, making crafting simpler, armour skills more abundant, and introducing quicker, more efficient looting. But many difficult-to-grasp aspects still remain (it’s still crazy to me that weapon tutorials are still so meagre), and few have been made with the first-time player in mind. Playing in a party alongside new hunters, I’ve been bombarded with questions ranging from the simple (“Where can I change my weapon again?”) to the slightly more specific (“Why does my glaive come with a huge insect buddy, and what does the dust it leaves behind after sucking the juices out of a lizard do?”). The bottom line is that World is decidedly not a my-first-Monster-Hunter experience - this is full-fat, waterfall-of-information Monster Hunter. In that respect, it’s the same as it ever was.Those coming in looking for an all-encompassing adventure story will find World a little lacking, too. The central plotline - of travelling to a new continent in the wake of a migrating Elder Dragon - is a neat one, and pleasantly naturalist in tone (well, as naturalist as you can be in a game about killing mythical creatures to make shoes), but it’s nothing more than a pretext for the near-endless hunts ahead.But as far as opportunities for new experiences go, World just never seems to stop providing them – and I love that feeling. 50 hours in, it’s still regularly throwing crafting possibilities, monsters, even entirely new systems at me and expecting me to put time into learning how they can benefit my character.One of the most consistently exciting, satisfying, and gratifyingly absurd games I’ve played.“But no matter how much I or any other fan tries to convince you, there’s a chance that a game that requires this much management alongside its maiming simply won’t be for you. I urge you to at least try. Find an experienced friend to guide you or sit down for a few video tutorials, because Monster Hunter: World is one of the most consistently exciting, satisfying, and gratifyingly absurd games I’ve played since, well, the last Monster Hunter game.A disclaimer: though I’ve completed the story quest, I’m absolutely nowhere near “finished.” Side quests are clogging up my menus, I haven’t touched the majority of the weapons, and even the end of the campaign opens up a second, much more difficult half. This isn’t an admission of guilt, it’s a demonstration of what kind of game we’re dealing with. Above and beyond anything else you can say about World, there is a lot of it. It’s still stupendously generous with content and, better, matches that with consistently making your time feel well-spent instead of wasting it on empty-feeling grinding."

Past games never had these.+Awful fetch quests (egg gathering and resource picking) heavily reduced or non existent here.+Story much better than previous games.+Map design, gone are the constant loading screens between zones.Cons-End game is lacking compared to the base end game from previous entries. This is due to Capcom remaking all graphic assets from scratch.-While difficulty curve is much more manageable than pass games it will still test newer players when they reach high rank.-Poor gear variety compared to past games (very few sets are any good). Too many shared weapon models and reskins especially at end game.-Quest hub feels empty and doesn't have the shared space by default for online.-At the time of writing online is much less populated that nearer launch."

Big boss enemies similar to a T-Rex or Dragon just to describe a few. Successfully completing a hunting quest will get you various equipment upgrade parts. Eventually you will want to repeat the same quests multiple times to get all the upgrades. It's also exciting to fight them partially because they have a wide variety of attacks. The game does have some RPG elements like upgrade paths for your weapons and fishing side quests but it's an action game at its core. There is also fighting game lite elements with a 3 button attack layout and combos. Controls are responsive and are good for an online 3D action game. Not really surprising since this is a Capcom game after all.The 3D graphic offers a wide variety of exotic locations and it does feel like a living monster world. You traverse vast desert hills, climbing vines and cross over streams. Exploration of big levels and gathering from your environment are portrayed nicely and help the world be more immersive. The soundtrack is awesome and offers some nice modern style classical music.It's not a perfect game because the story is a bit weak and there are hit detection bugs. But fortunately the gameplay and graphics make up for it. The online 4 player co-op only adds more to the already good replay value. Overall if you like grinding then   is a very enjoyable action game."

I can say that it runs very well and looks amazing on both, but pc of course allows more graphical options for those with lower or higher end pc's respectively. It is one of my FAVORITE games of all time, especially with friends. 1: The Monsters are great. 2: The characters are decent enough except for one *cough* ""handler"". 3: The story is serviceable but you don't get monster hunter for the story anyways. 4: The combat is very fluid and rewarding, and so is the monster hunter ""grind"". Getting that armor set or that weapon you've been trying to craft for the past couple hours is a great feeling. Overcoming that one monster thats been giving you  a rough time still gives you  a very satisfied experience. Of course just because i love the game and the franchise as a whole doesn't mean i cant criticize it for it's downsides and straight up failures. 1: In my honest opinion this is probably the weakest monster hunter has been in terms of weapon design coining the phrase ""bits on sticks"", it just doesn't have the fun design as the older games had. Like beating a fire breathing wyvern in the head with a thing of ham, or a giant teddy bear, cooking utensils against a literal dragon! They got better with iceborne but unfortunately worlds weapons for the newer monsters just look dull in comparison. 2: Not being able to join a friends quest until they've seen the cutscenes is a real pain. Seriously, could we not have watched it together? or how about being able to skip the cutscenes all together? At least give us the option, especially for players like me who have beaten the game already. If they added that option i haven't seen it. 3: The clutch claw.....its not the best. You can learn how to use it yes, pretty easily actually, but it feels like if you wanna do a quest rather quickly you have no other option than to use it. Always scrambling to latch onto the monsters head to knock it into a wall, or its legs to soften the hide kinda slow things down for me ironically since its supposed to make things faster. 4: WHY THE CRAP DID YOU NOT PUT IN A PAUSE FEATURE! I don't care who it is, sometimes you gotta get up for something. Your dog telling you they have to go outside? Someone knocking at the door? Forgot that you said you'd clean the house while the're gone and you hear the car pull into the driveway? Well sucks to suck, you better find a bush to hide in so you don't faint. Look i know it seems like i'm being harsh with the game but that's only because i want them to do better. and i know they can do better since rise improves on basically everything i just complained about. In the end i still adore this game despite the flaws, the good far outweighs the bad. And i hope that whoever gets this game has as great a time as i have."

I towards the middle of 2022 decided to give it another chance and do a bit of research before starting. This was the best idea because I feel the game throws a lot at you very quickly and it can be overwhelming. This gave me a place to start and I actually started to enjoy the game.

This is by far my favorite game and greatest time sink. I spent roughly 500 hours in the base game and have played through both mhw and mhwi twice. I have nothing left to farm but still play regularly because the mechanics are so deep and satisfying. This game is on sale for $20. You should buy it. And then if you love it, buy iceborne. I got this game for free, it came with my graphics card (gtx1060) on my first PC build. I built the PC to play battlefront 2 and the forest (also good games). I downloaded mhw and played up to the first large monster quest. I picked hammer because it looked cool. It was clunky and slow and I uninstalled the game. I was talking to some friends months later who play pc games and they said they liked mhw, and i laughed at them. But I gave it another chance. I tried other weapons, I watched guide videos, and I fell in love with the game. Button mashing is clunky and feels awful. Learning the weapon feels like a dance. I have since spent way too much money buying this game for friends and making them play with me. I have learned to play all the weapons and farmed everything there is to farm (I have not done all the achievements, that does not excite me). I even play weapons that I don't really enjoy (sns, lance) because they still feel better than combat in other melee games. I love this game and I cannot wait until Rise comes to PC. For those that do not like it just starting out, do not uninstall like me. Try a different weapon. Watch tutorials. There are some moves that would take hundreds of hours to learn organically (perfectly valid way to play if you want though). Try different armor skills that change how a weapon plays. You will be glad you gave this a shot."

This review will mostly cover the PC-port related issues. I've also added some Iceborne-related info.IMPORTANT: Base game + expansion pack (aka Master Edition) is usually the better buy (updated to reflect price change over time).Oct 2021:They removed Denuvo, Still around 55-70 FPS on GTX1660 Ti depending on settings.Still crashes sometimes, dunno why.Haven't tested netplay for a long time.Dunno if other issues fixed or not.Apr 2020:Loading much slower, even on SSD.MORE ANTI-MOD. Some can't use Reshade anymore.Random Err12 crash.DX12 randomly locks PC since 4 patches ago, requiring reboot.Took 2 weeks to fix MHW triggering anti-virus.Still very laggy, even on powerful PCs.Still unstable online that makes raid events impossible to clear.Jan 2020:Iceborne breaks everything. Crashes, freezes, save corruption, anti-mod, very laggy anti-cheat.Oct 2019:In May, I upgraded from GTX 970 to 1660ti and got ~50+ FPS on the title screen, but I still got the same old ~45-50 FPS in-game, regardless of graphical settings.Non-Denuvo DMC5 proved that Denuvo limits video card by bottlenecking CPU. Up to 20% performance hit. I later upgraded to a new CPU, same video card. Now MHW runs smooth as silk.PC Iceborne came out way too late. On PS4 they've finally started dripfeeding 2 year old fashion armors, despite being fully implemented from the beginning. They know it's always been the most requested feature.Quick summary:Not a terrible port, but has extremely terrible CPU optimization. You need a powerful video card to use the high-res texture pack, otherwise many textures are very low-res. But it's still superior to console because of higher fps, much faster loading, and mods.I can't recommend a game with major issues that shouldn't exist. I'd be annoyed if people recommended me a game and it didn't work properly. So I'm not going to do that. I paid for this game, I want them to fix it. Years later, still many unfixed issues.Major issues (STILL relevant as of December 2019):- Stuttering on any kind of input. Capcom has only very recently acknowledged this and are finally looking into it. AFAIK not fixed.- Special K author Kaldaien says the game has worst ever CPU & Denuvo usage. Iceborne also has Denuvo. Early reviews suggest it still runs like crap because of this.- Blocky skin in cutscenes. This problem exists on PS4 Iceborne, too. STILL.- Still lacks disable bloom option.Fixed issues:- Keyboard settings error and ""can't save game"" error occurs if you store your backup files in the same folder as the other save games. If you move them out, both problems stop.- You can now see friend sessions even if private, and join friend sessions easily.- There is now an official high resolution texture pack. Almost a year late.- Newer Nvidia drivers fixed the huge MHW frame drops.- Effect huge frame-drops fixed.- Online disconnection issues seemingly fixed.- Mouse and keyboard supported.- After months, they finally added disable DOF and Motion Blur. DOF is still forced on during cutscenes.Unconfirmed past issues:- Not sure if clientside can still cause all session players to disconnect via mods.- Months ago there were reports of crashes on startup caused by Steam Overlay, GeForce Exp, Ansel, Reshade. No idea if fixed.- Some reports of getting randomly locked out for a day after an update, due to Denuvo.- There were reports of the Taroth event having crash/freeze issues. Probably fixed.- Very, very rare bugs (sheath bug, infinite machinegun sound, cannot interact with anything and have to restart).- All versions of this game reportedly have a small chance of corrupting savedata or refusing to save. So you should try to backup regularly.PC port positives:- Loads MUCH faster than the PS4 version, even without an SSD. PS4 takes a minute or two. This loads in a few seconds, presumably if you have enough RAM.- Looks nice, when it runs properly.- Minor improvements to the GUI over the PS4 version, which were added to PS4 Iceborne.- Modding. Now you too can easily wear the tons of NPC-only outfits Capcom keeps making. On top of fixing tons and tons of other issues.- Several graphic options have a ""variable"" setting that auto-adjusts graphic options in realtime. Some are noticeable, some not so.- Gamepad support and key config via Steam Big Picture. I've heard there are limitations.- Option to configure confirmation and cancel buttons (fixes the Asia vs West button swap problem).Conclusion:It's pretty obvious Capcom didn't test the PC version enough. Yet they saw fit to give early access to streamers and reviewers, who (as far as i'm aware) did not seem to notice any of these significant issues. Next time, get real testers to test your game.It took them a long time to admit to and fix many of the problems. CPU optimization (ie. Denuvo) is still so bad that it can seriously impact the frame rate. Outside of the ongoing major issues, I think you'd still need to have a clear understanding of what the Monster Hunter games are like. I get the impression many people jump into this game expecting it to be something totally different, and end up disappointed.As a game, it feels like just barely enough content. By endgame you'll realize it's stretched thin, with heavy reliance on RNG in endgame. It's designed in such a way that you end up fighting the same few monsters over and over until you get burned out.There are some things that are done well, and several things where it feels like they dropped the ball, or are seriously trying to troll customers by doing the opposite of what everybody wants (no joke...for example, despite players complaining about this for almost a year, they keep adding exclusive outfits and hairstyles for NPCs, despite NPCS and players sharing the same models).That being said, if you do enjoy the core combat, then you may end up playing this for a long time. I won't go into detail about the gameplay in this review, but I will say that if you just want something to spend 30+ hours on (rough minimum time to complete story) and you don't mind RELATIVELY ""clunky"" (ie. compared to what people normally expect) high-risk controls where you cannot rely on lock-on, then you may want to give this game a try.If you want to try it first, and maybe refund it, then be careful not to spend too much time on character creation. Just use a preset, get past the unskippable lengthy intro, and jump into training room to try out the weapons. This is a game that relies very heavily on whether you like how the weapons and combat feels. If you don't, you won't enjoy this game.Also note that this game is easier in solo. Multiplayer has a high chance of people screwing up, resulting in quest failure. Monsters can chain multiple attacks to kill you off a single hit. This happens often when you're learning the game. You're supposed to try not to get hit. Three deaths means restarting the quest. If that sounds frustrating to you, you may want to avoid this game.Part of the fun is overcoming these challenges. Once you learn the monster patterns and how to use the weapons effectively, it can be a satisfying experience.UPDATE: Iceborne actually fixes many of these issues. Monsters are less cheap and give you more breathing space in Iceborne. So again, you should probably wait for Iceborne before buying the PC version.By the way, I'm not a veteran of the franchise. This is the first Monster Hunter game that I've fully invested into. From what I've seen others say, compared to previous games, this one is a few steps forward (eg. much better audio/visual, easier to obtain crafting materials, weapon improvements), and a few steps back (eg. less monster variation, story/setting too ""casual"", annoying NPCs, poor fashion support, lack of things to do in endgame, reliance on limited-time events). Also, you can't do events offline, unless you mod the game."

Second, the UI sometimes leaves a fair bit to be desired, which can sometimes lead to information overload and others just makes things awkward to navigate; third, some aspects of the game don't get explained very well, while others it keeps reminding you about long after you'll have become familiar with them."

I got into this because a friend kept telling me to play it (he’s a monster hunter fanatic) but, to be honest, I had no real interest in the game.. It’s not everyday that I like a grindy game that isn’t a MMORPG, like World of Warcraft for example. I kept watching things on the game, and the gameplay didn’t excite me at all, it wasn’t like, for example, watching Destiny where the gameplay looks flashy and captivating, for someone that didn’t know a thing about Monster Hunter, watching it just made me feel less excited cause it all looked like a big mess, the monster looked cool and interesting, but the gameplay didn’t, at all!And that’s when it came out and I started playing it...____________________________________________________________Since I was new to Monster Hunter as a franchise, when I started playing, I had no idea what I was doing. I wasn’t playing it correctly, I wasn’t approaching the game the “correct” way. I went into it thinking I was playing the Witcher or a fast paced game like Destiny(I know it’s an FPS, but I’m talking about the approach to gameplay), I was getting it all wrong, and at first the game didn’t convince me.The amount of materials, different consumables, different weapons and armour confused the crap out of me, it was a lot to take in and I took it in very slowly, cause I didn’t get really into the game until Iceborne came out.My friend got Iceborne for me and, I have to admit, I fell in love with this game. I approached the game in a different way, I started looking into stuff and studying it, started learning more weapons, and started playing in a more methodical way, slowly and with decision making in the middle of it, instead of the usual spam I did before. When that all clicked the game started flowing, and it feels like a whole different game to me.Now Monsters don’t feel as unfair as they did before, and it feels like I can actually control the battle (well, not always, but you know what I mean).Don’t want to drag this on forever about gameplay, but I just want to say that it’s one of the best gameplay experiences I ever had. Oh, and to finish this segment, if you haven’t already, do yourself a favour and start using a Charge Blade!______________________________________________________________The lore is still very new to me, in this game you found a new world and you’re sort of colonists trying to make a living there and what not. Not much to the story in this game to be honest. The lore that surrounds this franchise as a whole is the most interesting part! I’m still learning about it slowly, but how the world came to be with dragons creating it, and humans creating the following with their scales is astonishing!The great war between the ancient civilization and the dragons because of the forbidden act is also pretty interesting, how it all started, how it all ended, and how the ancient civilization still influences the one where you play, especially in the weapons department, cause everything else seems like the world is still in some sort of stone age.Another thing I find fascinating about this world, are the legends within it! The black dragons like Fatalis, which is nothing but a legend until you face one in one of the older games! Just the legend behind these monsters make them so intimidating!As I said, still learning about the lore, but it is very good, makes me feel like I’m drooling over Souls lore again!______________________________________________________________Only have some things I’m not a big fan of in this game…One is, I can’t seem to figure out how in the world they haven’t made it so, when you go fight a new monster, you don’t have to go in alone, see a cutscene and then tell your friends to join, it makes you go in alone, make your friends wait and then after you find the monster, wake them up to come in.. I can’t understand, because they made it work for Shara!And, I guess, now that we are in Iceborne, wanting to craft something for current content and having to go all the way back to low rank to kill monster or pick up some bones is kind of annoying, I’m just nitpicking to be honest, if I had played more in the base game I probably wouldn’t have this issue!"

A sign that they didn't even know what they were doing on the consoles.Then they said they wanted to take 7 months to make sure they get the PC version right.I am just stunned by how little effort was made by Capcom, but all the while they charge full price, not a reduced price to reflect their reduced effort.MHW PC has incredible potential, but if Capcom continues ignoring the reports, the only one they'll have to blame for this mess is themselves."

However hunts are very variable, the small changes in location, large variety in weapons and encounters along the way can add an amazing amount of freshness to a hunts that could become boring. In extreme cases you can even change to one of the many weapons that allow you to basically completely change your game experience.The biggest downfall this game has is probably the difficulty. MHW can become quite a hard game and there are many skill jumps that a beginner must leap through to be able to experience the game properly, these skill jumps can and have deterred players from continuing the game and have caused me to have to take periodic breaks as i reach those jumps. I know difficulty is quite a  touchy subject in video games but I feel like less able player might enjoy a way to experience the content they may have been locked out of.However the thing that in my opinion ties this game up into a brilliant bundle of fun is the sound design and sound track. Its quite rare that I add most of a games soundtrack to my spotify playlists but MHW has that honour, the music for fights such as the elder dragon fights and the Bazelgeuse fight have a unique Adrenalin pumping energy that has me ready for anything these monsters throw at me. The sound design, especially in iceborn, is exquisite. The ice crunches under both the players and the monsters feet with a beautifully satisfying sound and the roars of every unique monster feel right for each monster, if I have my headphones on some roars have even given me shivers.Overall this game is nearly a true masterpeice,9.5/10 IKGN"

So you need to dedicate some  and  solely into understanding - Certain monsters behaviors\weaknesses - Certain Game mechanics - Important parts of maps, etc etc~ and while i KNOW this may sound like a chore to do, Trust me ... it REALLY never felt like it is. it was just really fun to learn all sort of stuff about the game and how it works and how to deal with all of these monsters and all~ so even the learning process of the game is really fun! ---------------------------------Now If i had an issue with this game it'd be just how  breaks the base game in a really unfair way. you see, most dlc's are just ""Adds-On"" to the existing game, they may have a couple of op weapons here and there buuuut they don't really totally ""Break"" the game at all.  on the other hand, Is Like .... a WHOOOOOLE game, it's like.. as good as MHW2 ! It's got everything the base game has, but just BETTER. So let's say you've put 100 hours into the base game and you've grinded so much and you feel like you've really built an endgame setup for the game and all of that. Well... You could have put the SAME amount of time and effort into the  dlc and gotten like a ten times stronger setup. The Huge Gap between the dlc and the base game just really makes the base game itself not worth playing anymore... because you know all the people went over to the iceborne dlc, and they can join your quests in the base game, and most of the time they just end up killing the monster in under 2 minutes at best and that just really ruins the fun for you cuz u just really did nothing. and i KNOW u can just ""pLaY tHe gAmE aLOnE"" but it's a multiplayer game ... why do i have to avoid mp in a mp game- (Also you REALLY feel left out if you only play the base game lol)And This Brings me to the Point of, While YES the base game is Absolutely great and fun and worth the Buy, You're Still not gonna get the full experience if you don't buy the DLC, and i'm just not a huge fan of this whole thing if i'm being honest with you. BUT aside from that, if you have no problem getting both the DLC and the Base game, then you're really in for a one hell of an experience !"

It’s a straightforward concept at core, but with many intricate systems expanding upon it. The simplicity leads to complexity, and the result is a game that keeps on giving as you master its abounding aspects. The forty-hour main quest is only the beginning; a mere introduction to your journey as a hunter. And trust me, this is a journey worth taking.Starting off with the selling point - the hunting. Before you can fight the target, you must locate it. It’s done by examining tracks. Once you’ve found enough, your scoutflies will lead you to the monster. These are a pivotal part of the gameplay, as they point you to resources in the wild. It’s a clever way of implementing markers as you’re not distracted by them. I wish more games did something like this. Battling monsters is like a riveting dance; not only do you have to keep up with your foe’s moves, but also combine your attacks in the process. Combos are a central part of the combat, and rightfully so. They’re satisfying to pull off and also vary the gameplay, but timing them right is important. You’re not mindlessly hacking away at enemies; instead, you have to watch out, as a monster can interrupt your chain of attacks. Grasping their behavior is vital if you wish to be successful in the field. It should go without saying, but different monsters behave in different ways. The dragons, when overwhelmed, will take off. You can either wait for them to land, or use your tools to force them down. Some monsters will be quick, moving around as you struggle to land a hit, while others will be slow, but devastating when they make their move. Monster Hunter’s combat never gets old - each slash, each slice, every single cut  impactful. It’s not going out of its way to punish you; if you can learn its principles, the tables will turn, and the monster will no longer be the boss - you will. With thirty-one large monsters and five unique locales, there’s a lot to do, and luckily, hunting the same monster doesn’t get repetitive due to the fluidity of the combat.Once the hunt is over, you’ll be rewarded with items corresponding to the parts you broke. You can use these items to craft new gear at the smithy. One hunt rarely cuts it though. Don’t expect to craft an armor set after killing a specific creature once. It takes time to complete your desired build, which makes it satisfying to accomplish. With more than a hundred sets of armor, the options are almost endless; each piece comes with a set of skills that you can mix together to suit your needs. I only have one complaint. You can acquire  for your gear; these function as charms granting additional skills. Unfortunately, it’s random which ones you get, meaning that you can play for hours without acquiring the desired decoration. It’s the opposite of the great gameplay loop I described earlier, and it puzzles me why they chose to include it. You can choose to overlook them, but your builds won’t be as powerful as they could be.In terms of weapons, there’s 14 types in total. Each comes with a distinctive moveset and new mechanics to master. The  focuses on quick, long-reaching slashes and will satisfy any katana fan. Its key aspect is the , which charges up as you deliver blows. Once full, you can unleash a string of attacks, followed by a devastating blow. If you’re afraid of personal contact, the ranged weapons are for you. The  is a half-rifle, half-bow hybrid capable of unleashing a hail of bullets from afar. It also comes with the task of conserving ammunition. The weapons are just the tip of the iceberg. From traps to a slinger, you’ve got an array of tools to use. Is a foe too aggressive? Stun them with a flash pod. Did a monster interrupt your fight? Throw dung on it, and it’ll be gone in the span of seconds. Want to capture a creature? Lure it into an electric trap, and calm it with tranquilizing bombs. It’s a given that learning all of the systems takes time, but once you master them, you can take your hunting experience even further. Sadly, managing your equipment is a hassle. The menus are cluttered with information, and thus, hard to navigate. If you’re playing with a mouse and keyboard, something as simple as moving an item to your inventory is a struggle. Rather than allowing you to drag them around, it works like on a controller: first, you have to click on an item, then on the slot you want to move it to, before you get to select the amount you want. This is only one of the difficulties when it comes to UI, and it adds up. You do get used to it, but there’s no denying that it’s flawed.  Dynamic - a word that perfectly captures the world Capcom has crafted. It would’ve been easy to place you in a small area with only one monster, but they didn’t take that shortcut. Instead, each area contains a variety of creatures that interact with one another seamlessly. It’s common to witness two beasts brawling - a surprising event that can occur during a battle. It allows you to take a break, and potentially patch yourself up.There’s also a story, but it’s nothing to write home about. Serving as a guiding wind, it teaches you the ropes of the game. It’s uninspired, clichéd and most importantly, insignificant to the experience. They didn’t even bother to name the characters. Your companion goes by the name of , and is the eager and slightly irritating stereotype we’ve seen so many times before. It’s not a big con, since the game doesn’t need a compelling narrative, but it’s worth mentioning nonetheless.Thanks to the art direction, the areas you visit are stunning. From the lush, green colors of the  to the pink and blue ,  never ceases to amaze. Sadly, the same can’t be said for the graphics. Despite shoddy performance, there’s nothing to be amazed by here. Distant objects look blurry, and the textures, while good, are nothing to be amazed by. It would’ve been fine if the optimization was good, but that’s not the case.  | 1440p  While complicated and time-consuming, Monster Hunter World is an outstanding game you can play for hours upon hours. The combat is satisfying, the world is dynamic, and there’s enough content to keep you playing. What more could you wish for? There are issues, such as the confusing menus and poor optimization, but the game remains amazing despite these."

It's scenery/locations are absolutely beautiful and provides jaw dropping textures and graphical upgrades that Monster Hunter really needed (Since the 3DS quality graphics are getting quite old now :P Though MHGU is pretty good graphically wise on the switch).I've enjoyed every single second of this game and is definitely worth every single penny you invest into it, the content updates are free (Excluding some DLC's which are rightfully paid ones, not everything can be free lol). The weapons feel and play how they should, the monsters are wonderful and highly creative and the overall soundtracks to the game are perfection.However, I do feel as if the endgame did lack somewhat as it really didn't feel as interesting and as great as what previous titles offered (Deviants and so on). Though it's how I feel and in my opinion overall I think they should at least make some effort to improve the endgame in terms of what monsters drop streamstones and so on, grinding elder dragons all the time is getting really meh...Having that more variety with other monsters like Bazel, Jho and so on would make the grind more worth doing than just 5 elders.But with the iceborne expansion coming it's way pretty soon I'm pretty excited what Capcom has in store for it's G-Rank tier difficulty (Not calling it master, it’s always been G-Rank for me and keeping it that way). Nargacuga is coming and I'm already pumped for it.Overall Capcom you did a splendid job on this game and deserve every single bit of respect for this high quality game that you don't see much of in today's game industry.Odie~"

This honster munting game has captured my attention enough to ascend to the top of my library in playtime over other time-consuming games I've played like Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, PAYDAY 2, and Warframe. There are plenty of great aspects which have caused me to stick it out for this long and flaws of the game that I’m aware of, but I'm going to simply list the main reasons for my playtime.It's a Monster Hunter, one of the best top-selling franchises in that well-known island in the far east, but more importantly; a Monster Hunter on PC. MHW is currently the only Monster Hunter you’re able to play on PC without an emulator and it's a bonafide mainline entry. This means no more manhandling a handheld console and cramping your hands while barely possessing any real estate on the small screen. You can even play with keyboard and mouse (albeit with a couple rebindings) or plug in any controller you'd like. There’s even a modding community if you want to spice up your game and sate your need for variety or other… needs you may have.Content is a key ingredient in the recipe of any long-lasting game and there’s loads of content in MHW to be had for both the folks who desire an adventure with respectable length or a part-time career in aggressively euthanizing monsters. Strolling through the main content with the Iceborne expansion and monsters added post-release is likely to take at least 40+ hours and if you can get into ""the loop"", this time figure can be multiplied tenfold. Not to mention the large roster of intriguing monsters and their variants you’ll be driving into extinction during the gameplay. Sure, there are a few palette swaps, but it ain't a Capcom game without some recycling. Factor in the weapons too and you got 14 methods to disrupt a colourful ecosystem. I've utilized all of these weapons and they are all marvelous; my personal favourites being the Greatsword and Hunting Horn. Side Note: MHW is also great for Fashion Souls, thanks to the layered system added in later Iceborne updates.The last main reason which made me enjoyed the game so much, is the SOS system or how the multiplayer functions in general. The game easily and hastily allows you to pair up with other hunters on the quests you actually want to do by letting you send out a signal for assistance or seeking out those in need of aid with the quests you’re interested in partaking. In addition, you can create a public session with up to 16 players for a hunting orgy at the hub and 4 players at a time on the field. These sessions are possible to be made as friends-only for buddying up with the lads for some casual hunts or a professional execution. If you’re not interested in multiplayer though, the game is progressed just fine on solo and most non-event quests are playable offline.All in all, these are the main reasons that have kept me playing for so long all this way from release. I have no regrets in MHW compared to the games I mentioned previously where I felt somewhat unsatisfied with my investment of time or felt I stayed longer then necessary. The base game + Iceborne is a bit pricey, but I truly recommend it on a sale as the value is worth the cost."

For example, for me it was a certain desert horned foe, took me a few days before i could take him out and now can beat it in under 2 minutes!Now with Icebourne being a paid DLC, that may turn some people off from getting it as they may feel that it'll just be like other games DLC with just 1 map and a few new monsters and weapons, but I can assure you that is not the case. I personally have done a bit of research on other Monster Hunter game series and have found that in the majority of cases, the DLC or in other words the ""G-Rank"" expansions have massively increased the total roster of their respective games. For example, going from MH: Generations to MH: Generations Ultimate there was 20 new monsters added aswell and a new difficulty rating (G-rank), as the normal difficulty setting in MH are Lowrank and Highrank, and with each difficulty increase the monster get stronger, more hp and new moves. As of right now Capcom has only shown a handful of the new monsters coming to Icebourne (Although some are returning from past games) The current known monsters are, Beotodus, Banbaro, Tigrex, Nargacuga, Glavenus, and Velkhona.I'd like to close this off by saying that getting into MH: World was an amazing experience and one I wouldn't trade for anything.

There are good alternative but you chose the poopiest which is to block friends joining in story missions unless they've seen all cutscenes. And in doing so forcing people to jump hoops and do janky workarounds just to play with each other. Where's the fun in that. Does it even matter that theres 16-man room at this point? SOS flares sounds good on paper but people joining might as well be one-off NPCs at that rate. Just mindblowing why multiplayer is handled this way. Disappointing.

When I heard a new entry was coming, I just had to try it out. After giving it a spin, I’m happy to say that MH:W lives up to the hype. I was astonished by its beautiful graphics, amazing soundtrack, and the variety of monsters to hunt. There are some minor hiccups here and there, but I could argue that the pros far outweigh the cons, and it’s definitely an entry worth trying. Before we get into it, I just want to say that this review includes the .Whenever a friend of mine ask whether Monster Hunter is a good game or not, I used to say: “It depends, are you looking for a game with a story or not? Because if that’s the case, you’re better off playing God Eater.” Storytelling was never the strongest point of Monster Hunter games. However, MH:W delivers on the storytelling aspect. As a part of the fifth fleet you are tasked to investigate an oddity centered in the continent called New World. As you delve deeper into this newfound continent, you discover that the so-called oddity is not at all how it seems. Long story short, the plot is pretty straightforward, but I love how they presented it. The pacing was great, and while the narrative can be pretty dumb at times, the major reveal were spot on. , I implore you to play with the Japanese dub instead of the English one, as MH:W has a really awkward lip-sync when it comes to the latter. What MH:W brought to the table was a breath of fresh air to the old hunting system. Capcom took notes on how having to enter a loading screen each time we switched zones was a huge pain in the ass, instead they made one huge open world  for players to roam around and hunt. This seamless hunting experience was a brilliant move by Capcom and it made a more immersive hunts. Each locale had a beautifully designed landscape, from the breathtaking Great Forest to the snowy peaks of Hoarfrost. However, while the Great Forest was indeed a wonder to look at, it is not a favorable hunting spot due to the random FPS drops during hunts – which isn’t the case for the rest of the locales. Monster Hunter games always tried to simulate the ecosystem as realistically as possible, and MH:W is the fruit of their labor. At times, you can find large monsters having turf wars and many endemic creatures roaming around, there are even several achievements for collecting these rare “pets”  – yes, these tiny critters are collectible. Furthermore, Capcom upped their game by implementing dynamic transition between night and day to keep the hunting experience from becoming stale and also interactables such as vine traps and boulders that could help you on your hunt. These additions are what I love the most about MH:W.Now, for the juicy part of the game. MH:W made several quality of life improvements in terms of gameplay and online experience. Gathering resources is far easier and there is no need to use specific tools anymore. The Iceborne expansion introduces some new features to the slinger action called  and . I won’t deny their usefulness when it comes to hunting as they add another element to consider during hunts – applying wounded status to monsters for extra damage. However, it can be a bit annoying as you need to keep reapplying it. The new  was a godsend, this feature allows you to ask for help from players online midway into the quest. In addition to that, I love how they increased the maximum number of players that can fit in a single hub – making the area actually feel like a real gathering hub since in the previous entry one of them can only fit four hunters. Crafting armors is a lot easier with class restriction removed, when it comes to weapons, however, I feel like MH:W lacks its usual Monster Hunter aesthetic flair. While there are some unique looking ones, most of them are just the basic bone design slapped with some extra skin of different monsters.Layered armor and weapon crafting are back. Now, we’ve reached peak Monster Hunter gaming, fashion hunting. However, most of the materials you need can only be found in The Guiding Lands, which is an entire map dedicated to farming and grinding end-game materials. Labeling this place as a grinding hell is no exaggeration because it is separated into several regions, which have levels that you have to progress before unlocking specific monsters. The kicker is that when one region increases, the other region could decrease, so you have to find that sweet spot where all the region levels are balanced. MH:W, alongside the  introduces several new monsters and brings back several of the community's beloved ones. Capcom made the monsters' movement a lot more fluid and added a mechanic from Monster Hunter Frontiers, which is supernova - a finisher that some of them have. While I do like the directions where this is going as it tickles my love for the fantasy genre, some hunts are just pure pain. For example the , supernova of a certain end-game monster that forced you to do a DPS check using specific elemental damage; failure to do so will result in a wipe, regardless of what you do - this was pure pain.Monster Hunter: World is a solid entry to the Monster Hunter series. It inherited the soul of what makes a Monster Hunter game and made improvements in the parts that were lacking. With its high replayability value and beautiful graphics, it’s no surprise to see people willing to burn hours into the game. One thing for sure, MH:W took a step in the right direction and is most definitely worth getting, even at full price. See you on the hunting ground, future hunters!"

However, it's a fun grind (most of the time). I was pleasantly surprised by this one.If you're going to buy MHW, definitely get Iceborne too. The High Resolution Texture Pack (free) is also worth getting if your system can handle it.There are a few pros and cons I'd like to highlight. I'll start off with the cons and end with the pros:Cons:-There are arguably too many systems and menus. Assigned missions, arena quests, optional quests, investigations, event quests, special assignments, expeditions, SOS flares, deliveries, bounties, special events, item gathering and general management, abilities + decorations, set bonuses, charms, pendants, the various forms of crafting and melding, sieges, meals, ingredients, weapons, loadouts, radial menus, defense armors, layered armors, sphere upgrades, Palico management, augmentations, enlightening, steamworks, mantles, crowns, fishing, buff handling, capturing, cultivation, safaris, tribal friendships, treasure hunting, photo hunts, camp establishments, the Guiding Lands and its leveling system, crowns, room decor... it just goes on and on and on and on and on. You get hit with tutorial after tutorial throughout the game, and it never lets up. There's a lot to learn and take in. Maybe I'm just slow, but I felt like by the time I finally had a strong grasp on everything, I was several hundred hours in and the game was (mostly) over already. I can't help but feel that the game could have been simplified in several places.-Solo play is disproportionately brutal. Which is not to imply it's always too hard necessarily, but rather it's lopsided. This often incentivizes ""getting carried"" - where if you get stuck, you can just pop an SOS flare (or arrange a game with friends) until you get stronger players on-board, and then finish the quest + move on with all the rewards. Even though the monster's HP scales/increases as more people join, the splitting of the monster's focus makes it way easier to heal and easier to find openings for attacks. When you have multiple people hammering away at a monster with overpowered gear, the end result is often fewer player faints (and thus more rewards) and a much quicker fight. Meanwhile, if you go it alone, the fights will be way harder, you'll faint more often and get fewer rewards, it'll be harder to heal, and the fights take forever... it's a largely thankless endeavor.-I wish the fights were faster-paced. Swinging your weapon often feels sluggish, which is very frustrating when you're up against a monster that is jumping around all over the place. I'd rather have faster attacks in exchange for slightly tougher monsters. Pros:-This is a fun game, which is really the best thing I can say about it. The monster designs are really cool and I often enjoyed just  at them. It's neat that different monsters have different weak spots, and the progressions of certain fights are a blast. The fight against Raging Brachydios, for example - he starts off as a foreboding juggernaut of a beast... but by the end of things, you're underground in an active volcano area and the monster now looks like a beat-up overgrown piece of burnt pot roast that is fighting tooth and nail for its survival. The ground is blowing up and lava is raining down upon you, all while this huge monster is charging in your direction -- ♥♥♥♥ gets wild. Intense moments like that are fantastic, and those fights always end with a huge sigh of relief and satisfaction.-There is still challenge to be had even with the best gear. Whether you're going up against Alatreon, Fatalis, or Arch-Tempered Velkhana, these fights will require you to have mastered the game mechanics, lest you become deadweight and fail the battle for yourself or the entire team. This helps keep the game interesting, as you'll always have a reason to go back and replay a tough fight."

It is a pretty game.  It's definitely a game for people with more powerful rigs.  If you have never played a Monster Hunter game in your life before, this is superb.  Even if you've played Monster Hunter games before and want to get back into the franchise, this game reinvents and does away with many annoying mechanics.  No more paintballs and no more loading into 12 different zones.  That's always nice.So, why is this game mixed?  Somewhat simple.  People don't understand how games these days work.Here's the lowdown on the mixed review.When the game launched on PC, it was met with a very unforgiving issue:  Multiplayer only worked when it wanted to at best.  You could never start this game with the expectation that you'd be playing with your friends.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  We had to try dozens of placebo fixes in the remote hope of ever possibly playing with our friends.Today, August 22, about two weeks post PC launch, this issue was patched.Now, instead of people changing their minds about this, they're angry it took two weeks.  I work quality assurance for a small company and I inspect developer work.  It is not unusual for something to take a full week to pass QA sometimes.  There is a lot of testing that has to go on and be reproduced that often goes underappreciated.  People are so used to day one patches that they don't realize that day one patches or patches that soon follow a product release are often things that have been caught by QA/Dev prior to launch and have been worked on before it actually hit.What I suspect happened with the connection issue is that it honestly went unnoticed until launch.  Granted, that's a pretty big problem to have go unnoticed, but sometimes things go through to production that maybe shouldn't.  Bugs happen.  It takes time to fix these bugs.  Two weeks isn't unreasonable for what seems to be a beguiling intermittent bug that can be observed, yet not reliably reproduced.  Even the large userbase of players that were so disgruntled couldn't find an extremely reliable way of reproducing it other than ""It just happens"" and ""I can't connect at all.""  Things like this can take a lot of work to try to figure out the underlying cause.  It's just a nice thing to have watched the SteamDB page show that their dev repositories were constantly being updated -- they were actively working on fixing it for the whole two weeks, not sitting around with their thumbs up their rectums.Now, two weeks post launch.  Connection issue is fixed for the most part.  According to the devs, it's still occuring in some cases, but their fixes have reduced the frequency of it.  Chances are you won't see the effects of this review bomb go away, which is unfortunate.  Without this connection issue, I could see this game being at least in Very Positive territory.  Only very positive because there are still outstanding issues with the game's graphical issues.One thing you need to be very aware of is that Monster Hunter is a pretty game.  Many pretty games aren't very well optimized to run on all hardware.  This is very much the case with Monster Hunter.  Do your homework and look for the minimum spec, because this game is about as hard on your computer as an Ubisoft title.  Lots of horsepower is required to get this game running nice and pretty, but I've made it work on three different computers.  One with a 1050Ti and an i7-3770K; one with an i7-7700HQ and a 1070; and one with a Ryzen 1700X and a 1080.  The 1050 Ti needed to be put to low graphics settings at 1920x1080 to achieve a good, playable framerate, but I don't think it could manage a silky smooth 60 fps.  The 1070 machine can run the game beautifully at high settings with no real issues.  Perfect smoothness on the i7-7700HQ/1070 build was achieved by turning volumetric fog to low or none.  Finally, the Ryzen 1700X/1080 build managed just fine on max settings, though volumetric fog was turned down to help assist in certain frame spiking situations.With that said, your biggest enemy to performance will be the volumetric fog effect.  It looks pretty if that's what you're used to, but turn it to low if you want to keep it.  The difference is minimal, visually, but the FPS impact is very significant.  Turn if off if you don't like fog in the distance.Now, the last performance hitch of note is the lightning effects.  Heavy lightning effects occurring on screen, especially from player-based attacks, tend to drop frames for no understandable reason.  Avoid having more than 2 people in your party using lightning-based weaponry, or you'll start to get into unplayable framerate territory.  I have faith this issue will be patched in time, but as of the time of writing this on August 22, it's still ongoing.Finally, one last major gripe I'm sure you're going to see coming out of the bag of negative reviews is that the game uses Denuvo.  You'll hear all sorts of horror stories about it destroying solid state drives and killing your CPU performance.  It does no such thing, and such claims are unsubstantiated.  I will agree to the sentiment that most games I've played that run Denuvo DRM tend to hurt on the CPU performance side.  You will find that people have articles up about how Denuvo tanks performance, but you often find rebuttals about it.Point is, Denuvo sucks.  Maybe in a decade it could lock you out of the game if it goes under or support drops or whatever.  The bottom line is this:  You will not be playing Monster Hunter World in 10 years.  You just won't.  Games For Windows Live was dropped a long time ago, and some computer games 10 years back were still using it.  When is the last time you touched a GFWL game?  Very likely you haven't in the past few years.  Stop worrying about Denuvo maybe someday making this game unplayable.  When that happens, you'll have long moved on from this game.---Would that I had more space to write about the actual game, because there's a lot ado about this game.  Check the positive comments that offer proper reviews on what the game is made of.  Monster Hunter titles are exceptional fun.  I wrote a few paragraphs in this review before being interrupted by the character limit here.To sum things up, Monster Hunter games are about bringing low very big and powerful monsters.  To help with this, you have a very wide and fun arsenal of weapons and hunter tools to go about this job.  You must track monsters, find these monsters, then target their weak points while addressing shortcomings of your own, such as elemental resistances, to take them out.  There is a wide variety of them to hunt and it is difficult to get bored in this game.If you've played other Monster Hunter titles in the past, this game is more streamlined than its predecessors.  No more paintballs, no more zoning in to a dozen different spots.  It's all interconnected.  You have scout flies that loosely guide you to your hunt mark.  There is a shorter list of monsters in this title compared to others, but QoL improvements here make the game worth it.If you have any pressing questions, feel free to comment on the review and we can chat."

Overall if your not afraid of grinding and are up to 30 min to an an hour fights then your good to go. I also highly recommend the DLC, there are monkeys :3"

Although It is better with friends, I pretty much played the game solo for 700 of the hours, since my friends stopped playing with me around the 300 hour mark, and it was still incredibly enjoyable. I've 100 percented the game's achievements, and I have also caught ALL endemic life including the Great Fishes. The only thing that awaits me now is Iceborne come January 9th, which will almost surely bring me another 1000 hours at the least.Let me say this, I am a long-time Monster Hunter Veteran who has played all previous Monster Hunter titles, and a lot of the things Veterans complain about are the dumbest things. People complain about difficulty in this game being too easy, but are blinded by nostalgia that in older games, enemy AI was about dumber than a box of rocks, and not even Terrible hit boxes could make Freedom Unites monsters harder since first of all in Unite flash bombs and shock traps/pitfalls were OP. Those items worked perfectly and the monsters did not have resistance build-up, that means every trap and bomb lasted just as long as the very first one thrown/set and these traps and flashes last WAY longer than they do in Monster Hunter World. That alone is enough to cheese 90 percent of the game barring elder dragons, who also can't be trapped. Not to mention in Freedom Unite, it doesn't matter what rank you fight the monster in, there are no variance in the move set of the monsters. its exactly the same in low rank, high rank, and g-rank in the older monster hunter games. The only thing Veterans complain about that is right is about how dangerous mobs are in the old games. The little crabs, vespoids and all dromes are incredibly annoying, and proc status way too frequently. The little crabs also have a unique move that only they have (not even the crab bosses have this move), where they move at the speed of inter-continental homing missiles to your location and smack you onto your ass, where bosses then follow up. And then there are Bullfangos........For the most part Monster Hunter World has its fair share of difficulty just without all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that existed in the older Monster Hunter games, and the removal of ultra aggresive mobs is quite a welcome one.CHANGE is GOOD! there are tons of new things to be excited about coming from older games. Movement while drinking potions and items are a welcome one. The ability to re-stock items from camp is also a good one. Re-newed move sets from the main series games, that offer great and enjoyable changes.Another thing Veterans always complain about is that they want to find monsters by themselves and that the scout flies are being too hand-holdy. Ok.....hold on....so these veterans are telling me they would rather spend more time just looking FOR the monster instead of just fighting the monster???? if you know exactly where the monster is, that means you get to fight the monster faster! In Monster Hunter World monsters have several set spawn points that are spread out across a map, and *knowing* where they are immediately instead of having to run around and paintball or waste time using a Psychoserum/ waving at the airship just to find a monster is way better than the previous games.THINGS TO NOT BE EXCITED ABOUTKUSHALA! This monster is so ass in monster hunter world, I would rather fight the Lvl 140 Guild Quest, 200% HP, Black wind Kushala from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. The normal version you fight in the story is ok, not to many problems there because you have flash bombs, but the Tempered one, and the Arch Tempered ones can suck it. The monster creates Huge Tornados on the area that it attacks you with, and not only does your framerate drop after 3 big ass tornadoes, you literally can't see ♥♥♥♥. When the monster is almost dead it flies to its nest where if it enrages, it forms 3 BIG ASSS ♥♥♥ tornadoes that along with its own tornadoes its already spamming everywhere. I literally got stuck between a wall and and 2 tornados once, and couldn't get out, pretty much just awaiting imminent death.LUNASTRA! This monsters name might as well be ""F***ing trash"" because it does damage over time, that cannot be blocked, it cannot be dodged, and it also Windpresses at the same time. Also since the Stun mechanic still exists, you will get stunned at the worst moments. Unlike Teostra it also has no tells for certain moves like its tail-swipe. It sorta just comes out of nowhere and gets you immediately. her basic attacks also leave huge areas of effect blue flames that constantly tick your HP down, and her SuperNova unlike teostra's explodes twice, and it also windpresses twice. You will find yourself doing the saving grace dive or the superman dive A ton when fighting her. Her fight is the worst fight the Monster Hunter team has ever re-designed. The only reason I've killed her so much is because her AT equipment is great for my main weapon, Gunlance at end-game.DECORATIONS, they pretty much swapped farming charms with farming decorations from previous games, and now charms are crafted while decorations are farmed for. Absolutely terrible choice, in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, and 3 Ultimate, as long as you had decorations, even on bad charm tables you could make quite powerful 4-5 skill sets with the skills you wanted, but in Monster Hunter World, if you want certain skills like guard, artillery, and certain other skills, expect there to be absolutely NO variance in the equipment that you can use to fill those roles. Literally everyone has the same exact looking sets, there are no unique sets anymore since everyone needs to use the same pieces to get certain skills, and making special sets with mixed skills become even harder since certain decorations will NEVER seem to drop for you. I've done so many investigations the counter has literally stopped counting at 999 investigations. It was only much longer after reaching 999 investigations did I then get all the decorations I wanted for my sets.But even with the terrible decoration grind, and 2 Monsters re-designed so terribly, I still love this game, they weren't enough to steer me away from how much good there is to enjoy in this game.ICEBORNE IS COMINGA huge number of my complaints regarding the decorations, will be fixed when Iceborne comes, and that is in the form of the new decorations. Dual skilled decorations that contain many of the essential skills that players need like artillery and guard jewels come in Iceborne and are gotten quite easilly this time around, instead of the terrible grind in Base game. Even jewels that contain critical are mixed into these dual slotted decorations can be gained quite easily just playing through Master Rank, as I have observed many players going through Iceborne's main story getting many decorations with attack jewels mixed into the dual slotted decorations from even early master rank bosses. I would rank this game as my second favorite main series game, with Monster Hunter 4 ultimate as my number one favorite game in the series."

However, these game does not utilize purely cosmetic pieces very often at all. Pieces that appear purely cosmetic often require little real work to obtain, and can even have some mechanical benefit at times.Monster Hunter is a game where you spend a little time in combat getting your a** handed to you as you learn your enemy's patterns and timing (much like Dark Souls, whose combat was inspired by the original Monster Hunter). The game also lets you play however you wish to play: do you like using environmental traps and calling local tribal peoples to your aid? spend some time discovering them all and ""contacting"" those peoples and you will have just what you wish for. Speed running is also a method of play: build armor and attachments (called decorations) to focus on the elemental damage a target is weak against, or just get your crit chance (called affinity, and ill admit this ones a weird naming choice) and crit multiplier up and wallop the beast's softer portions.The story leaves a bit to be desired, but this is not the Monster Hunter game for a story experience. If you prefer Story, then please be patient for another release of Monster Hunter, as previous games in the series (Monster Hunter Dos and Monster Hunter 4U, to name a few) had outstanding stories and gameplay, while other games (like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate and Monster Hunter World) are more for the player experience and the devs testing out new ways for the player to enjoy hunting dangerous beasts."

First of all it's absolutely mind-blowing and impressive the amount of options and attention to detail put into this game. The game is really fun and was a joy to play with my friends.Kill za monsters and then use their body parts to get better weapons and armor and then fight better monsters and use their parts for better weapons and armor. This is the gameplay loop.I'll be honest this game is hard , some of these monsters will open a can of whoop-ass on you and you'll just be sitting there crying on the floor. You literally cannot spam any of your combos on the endgame monsters , how do you beat the monsters then? You learn their moveset , and when they take a breather after a strong attack and find a window to attack and punish their dumb ass. But if you get too greedy the monster will punish yo ass. Learning the patterns , dodging and punishing at the right time , the game forces you to master a fight , and it's really rewarding when you are belting a monster than tortured you for 10+ fights.There's many playstyles and weapons you can play in this game , like greatsword : slow af , big hits , insect glaive : you have a vaulting pole you can maneuver easy , lower damage compared to GS , long sword : weeb katana. There's many more and many things the game won't even tell you like jumping off mushroom ledges and new attack combos.I would say , if you can play with a friend or a group of friends , go for it. I would say it's a masterpiece , story is bad , that's not what it's for , The gameplay is gawwwd. Thank you,A fellow monsta hunta playa"

The game is, unsurprisingly, about hunting monsters. There is a story in the game but it is average and more a backstory for the sake of the gameplay. This game is very much boss-fight centric and if you like the boss fights in games like Dark Souls there is a very good chance you'll like this game too and many similarities in mechanics carry over, but this is still very much it's own game and distinct from series like Dark Souls.There are 14 weapon types in this game, the weapons in this game are among the most satisfying I've ever used in a third person action game, each is highly unique and very different to each other, each varying in complexity and having their own unique mechanics and combos, you have the Longsword with swift and graceful precisely timed combos, the crazy over-engineered Charge Blade with an answer for every situation, the hardhitting tanky Gunlance with explosive burst damage, the Insect Glaive that allows you to take to the air like an acrobat, etc, there are ranged weapons like the Bow too unlike ranged weapons implementations I've seen in other games. The weapons in this game are all relatively easy to pick up and learn but have extremely high skill ceilings, a lot of the satisfaction in this game comes from mastery of the weapons, and some players get into competitive speedruns for monster kills to demonstrate their mastery of the weapon and the monster fights. (Tip for new players: At your first opportunity, try out ALL the weapons in the training room, you might not be enjoying the game if a weapon doesn't click for you or you find it boring, but with how varied and unique each weapon is changing weapon can make a world of difference.)There are a total of 71 monsters to fight including the Iceborne DLC which I highly recommend any player gets as it more than doubles the content in the game and adds lots of high difficulty challenge, there is also a lot of mods for this game too, some of them add new fights. If I were to compare boss/monster difficulty to Dark Souls I would say MH:W is easier on average, in-fact I would say there is almost no real threat of outright failing a mission to the majority of early game monsters, but the peak challenges and endgame bosses are significantly harder than Dark Souls, in Monster Hunter you have 3 carts which are the number of shared lives you as a solo player or your team playing co-op have before you fail a mission, boss fights are more of a Marathon than a sprint, while Dark Souls bosses are generally very cheesable and have WR kill times of under 60 seconds for even the hardest NG+7 bosses, MH:W has much longer fights and will demand you learn the monsters and master each fight if you want to survive the more difficult bosses, not all attacks will have clearly telegraphed wind ups or tells, monster health is deliberately hidden in this game and you must pay attention to it's behaviour such as if it's exhausted, drooling or enraged. I have thoroughly enjoyed the monster fights in this game with the very final boss, , now being my favourite boss fight in any game I've ever played.The core gameplay loop is great, there's a huge amount of story quests and even huger amount of optional and special quests stuff including stuff like raid boss monsters intended to be tackled by a full team of 4 hunters and Arena quests with premade loadouts. There is a decent amount of grind in this game and it is somewhat core to the gameplay although it is far more generous and less time consuming than other grindy games I have played, it is entirely possible to get the best possible endgame loadout setup for multiple weapons within 300 hrs of play from new game. There is no player class or level-up system in this game, your character remains the same at end-game as you were at start, instead what changes is the weapons and armor you use, along with the item and tool loadout you carry + the skills you developed. All armor pieces in this game have skills associated with them that can have a multitude of effects which can be further customised with slot-in items. You hunt and maybe farm strong monsters, then you'll use their parts to craft weapons and armor from that same monster to prep for the hunt of the next stronger monster. Monsters can inflict a variety of statuses and ailments and have innate weaknesses and resistances to different elemental types you can attack them with, preparation for each hunt can be important with the items and armor skills you'll bring. e.g. You might want to bring poison resistance for the monster that inflicts lethal poison or evade window for the monster with large AoE attacks.The World is semi-open and the biomes are beautifully designed with large sprawling areas to explore, between hunts there is chill downtime to do things like gathering and foraging for items, fishing, or finding secrets on the maps. This game has so much character to it, the art design and soundtracks are incredible, the co-op in this game is also great and it has one of the least toxic and most positive communities I have ever encountered in gaming. Co-op in the main storyline can be irritating with some hassle and obstacles but beyond that it's a mostly seemless experience. You have things like crazy gestures, sticker emotes and customisable auto-shoutouts you can use to goof off in co-op and with the Iceborne DLC you can craft transmogs for your weapons and armor to make your character look how you want with some crazy variety in armor choice varying from edgelord badass to cute or sexy, this game has a bit of an anime aesthetic to it, might be a negative for you, maybe a positive. Monster Hunter is a franchise with developers that loves their fans, there is a lot of attention to detail in this game and a huge amount of free post-game updates and content were released during it's support lifespan. At the time of writing this review a newer portable release(Monster Hunter cycles between console and portable game releases), Monster Hunter Rise has come out, Monster Hunter doesn't have sequel games but instead has new titles each game with a new focus, the devs aren't afraid to experiment and innovate, they listen to player feedback between games and continue to innovate and improve with each release, I can see this franchise becoming a lot bigger in the future and I'm definitely now a fan! (Final tip for new players if you decide to purchase this game: Don't use the default opt-in defender/guardian weapons or armor on a new playthrough! They were added so returning players could speedrun the base game to get to Iceborne quickly, but they are incredibly OP and will be better than anything you will find for the entire base game story even 50 hours in, it removes any challenge and ruins the experience.)"

But  changes a little bit of that by adding some more of the ""hunting"" aspect. You need to follow the monster steps by observing footprints, analysing mucus, etc. This, combined with large open maps with lots of details to explore (with no loading screens between the zones), endemic life, plants and gathering points makes the experience more immersive and fun than just going to kill/capture a creature. Of course, all of that changes rapidly after the player starts to get more experience on hunting — it becomes just a way to find the monster faster through the maps — but it's also a great way for newcomers to the series get into the game. When you find the monster and the combat begins, this is where the game shines: epic confrontations with engaging and fluid battle mechanics, traps, lots of artifices to help from bombs to literally poop... all of that with a variety of weapon types, each one with different refined movesets and combos that are satisfyingly amazing to pull them off — absurdly tactical, but also strategic. The combat, environment and encounter designs are top-notch, with excellent pacing and great presentation overall.After that, with the materials collected on the hunt, you craft some gear. Crafting is also way more convenient but still not intuitive at first glance. There is a massive amount of options to customize and make your build so it will consume some time to fully understand the mechanics behind it and even more time to craft it. Congratulations, you completed the loop... now you just need to prepare for new/harder monsters and do it all again! did a great job ""dumbing down"" the most complicated features to welcome beginners and adding QoL changes that are absolutely worth it for veterans as well. If you've never played  before, jumping into  is an amazing chance to get in!: If you are new to the series or just wants to start fresh,  utilise the Guardian/Defender equipment. These weapons and armour are extremely overpowered at the beginning, making the game not challenging at all and probably not fun as well, since you will never have anything better to craft until the mid-end game. Also, you will not learn how to ""play properly"" if you can tank it all without needing to dodge or even use potions (although it's a valid playstyle, it's not the best for someone who wants to get into the game). The Guardian/Defender equipment were designed primarily for players from other platforms who wanted to sweep through the base-game campaign as means to access the  DLC expansion content quicker (because the PC version launch lagged behind the consoles).: this game really needs your time. Although you certainly can love the first 20 hours of it, it doesn't mean you won't like the game if you don't. What this means is that the core gameplay loop is present early, but the real challenges and the  are present late, and they make a world of difference to the fun.

The monsters are a joy to fight, which is important when that's the main draw of your product.  The atmosphere of each environment is engrossing, and the monsters really feel like they belong there.  It can be surprisingly relaxing to just head out on an Expedition with no quest or goal in mind and wander aimlessly through each zone, collecting materials for crafting, doing some bounties, catching some fish, or going after the monsters that happen to be in the area at that time on the fly with no faint limit or time limit(aside from when the monster itself decides to leave the zone).  Each zone being one contiguous location instead of chopped up into several smaller bits like previous entries really helps give it a lived-in feeling, like coming upon the remnants of a turf war between two monsters that happened while I was busy halfway across the map with something else is a neat touch.  Monsters, especially the notorious Bazelgeuse(Bagel Goose), often get wrapped up in your fights with other monsters, and can sometimes provide a much-needed distraction or deal a hugely damaging blow to the one you're focusing on.  The weapon systems are extremely varied and unique, with many weapons using completely different mechanics making them akin to fighting game character selections when you pick which to use.  I personally have only ever used the Greatsword, there's something so totally satisfying about landing that last overhead wallop with it that sends a monster crashing to the ground, stunned.  I have heard from other folks that pretty much every other weapon system is fun to use and engaging.  Collecting materials to build and upgrade each weapon can be difficult and the requirements of some extremely rare drop items for later high-end craftable gear can get super frustrating to acquire, unfortunately.  Same goes for certain consumables, though there are alternative options such as the Melding system to acquire rarer items you need using lesser-desired items you already have.  I run the game on a pretty beefy system, but even at lower settings I've heard the game runs pretty well.  The only complaints I really have about the game running well is it's a big CPU hog, and the textures in cutscenes can be real nasty, but I hear that's a bug that's set to be fixed in an upcoming patch.  Otherwise the game runs at a buttery smooth framerate, dynamically lowering object/texture quality ingame to keep the framerate steady, and the load times are basically nonexistant.  The longest load time is when you first boot up the game, and even then it's like 15 seconds tops.  Every other load time is so fast you don't even have time to read the loading screen tips.edit: I should mention I play the game entirely solo, I have never done multiplayer.  I am not a fan of the faint limit being tied to all players, so one goober can ruin it for everyone else if they're bad, which I've seen plenty of times on streams.  The Palico system, your cat-shaped AI buddy, is very helpful in fights, acting as a distraction, support, summoning helpers, looting extra monster parts mid-battle, etc.  Plus dressing them up in the various goofy or cute outfits is nice.  I just wish there was a dog option.  A Palicorgi, if you will.  Odogaron's armor makes them look like some sort of ancient japanese wardog thing, but other than that it's all cats all the time, which sucks.  I'd totally buy dog-shaped AI buddy cosmetic DLC.Overall, Monster Hunter World's been a real surprise.  I'd caught some streams and felt it would be worth trying myself once it came to PC, but didn't expect to fall so far into it, I think as of this review I've got 150 or 170 hours in it, beaten the story, downed every optional quest, found every food item(except a few different boozes), captured/slain every tempered monster, and still have fun playing it.  I heartily recommend this game, and can't wait to see what new zones, monsters, and systems they add in future updates/expansions!"

Monster Hunter World has disappointed me, honestly. Both in terms of gameplay, and on PC and new generation consoles it can be quite old, given that it needs a lot of grinding, although I know that the Monster Hunter saga is characterized primarily by the mechanical one, but I just don't like it , I can't do anything about it, on a portable console, during my frequent weddings on the train and in the car it wasn't a problem, they blocked the travel holes, but on PC I can't accept it, but it also disappointed me in the setting, these ""small"" hunting areas in which it is divided have not satisfied me at all, on the contrary ... I think it was my Achilles' heel, which led me to abandon it for many months. But why do I recommend it? Why am I going back to playing it now and is ""enjoying"" it? because playing in company entertains me ... and not only that, monsters are cool, they are well made, perhaps made with too much care, I really like weapons, armor, they are really aesthetically beautiful, I really like the soundtrack, despite a rather sparse narrative, the story manages to catch you and although it is very far from a crystalline narrative, however you manage to enter into sympathy with certain characters and with whom less, I like to see that during a hunt some monsters collide with each other, changing and making the fight dynamic. I understand very much why Monster Hunter World has conquered many people ... and not only, I understand why many people defend it against negative criticisms, in fact my criticisms are extremely subjective, but I really believe that Monster Hunter World will become a classic going forward with the time. Graphically nothing to say, I love the yield of forests, deserts and more, I also love the character design, very ""rough"" that manages to highlight the robustness of these monster hunters, intelligently giving up the classic character design that makes the characters come out of Victoria's Secret, which I think has always been out of tune, if you want to make a video game of this genre, the appearance of the characters must be hard, rough, you have to make it clear that they are dangerous. So yes ... I highly recommend Monster Hunter World, albeit with its flaws, which however will not spoil the game experience."

Lots of whining about motion blur, mouse acceleration and ""terrible controls"" is just hilarious. A lot of new players who probably never played a monster hunter game before and just button smash on enemies get frustrated and leave this game a negative review. Reading things like ""ANJANATH IS OP!!!1111"" and ""I get oneshot everytime"" just doesn't trigger me anymore, it rather makes me smile.I was looking forward to the PC version due to the ridiculously short loading times and the better framerate. Having played the game on ps4 for hundreds of hours, I just gotta say that the PC version is more enjoyable due to that. The PC controls are very well made for a port and it's quite easy to play any kind of weapon, even the ranged weapons. It takes a bit to get used to it, but once you are, it feels very fluid.Of course if you're new to the game and the monster hunter series, it will be difficult to get into it and probably be frustrating. The key to win in this game is to learn when to attack and when to retreat. Learn the attack patterns of the mobs and their behaviour in normal and enraged status and you're getting closer on being successful. Always eat before a hunt and be fully prepared in terms of equipment and consumables. Being greedy might work sometimes, but most of the time you get punished for that. Especially in the end game, you usually wanna play optimal since any mistake may lead to death. Only use your fully charged attacks, if the situation makes it safe to use, e.g. when the monster is stunned, paralyzed, exhausted, mounted or laying on the ground.Oh and as a fun fact, did you know you're invincible when you're laying on the ground? See a monster charging at you while you're at low HP? Just jump in your camera direction and play dead, even if the charge hits you, you won't get any damage! This may safe your ass especially against mobs like Nergigante with his Spike-attack dive."

This review isn't for you. For everyone else, especially PC-exclusive gamers, I have to tentatively give this a thumbs down for two reasons. The first is what can only be described as an assinine multiplayer system that is so convoluted I can't being to understand what they were thinking: storyline missions can't be attempted together as a group without first watching all the cutscenes in a mission, abandoning the mission, and then rejoining a group. It's 2018 and Capcom can't figure out multiplayer. The second is that raw mouse input isn't supported, meaning a controller is HIGHLY recommended. It's 2018 and Capcom can't figure out raw mouse input.I love the monster hunter series and will continue playing this as a solo game until the high rank missions, where I'm assured it gets better, but until these issues are fixed I can't recommend the game in good faith."

Allow me to start with a quote from the game's producer, Ryozo Tsujimoto; """". The PC release comes seven months after the PS4/XBONE version and it's fair to expect a polished release based on Capcom's own statement. Unfortunately, the PC version is absolutely riddled with bugs and annoyances that bring down the whole experience.It took Capcom two weeks to fix a major network issue that made it nearly impossible to play multiplayer. It was difficult to complete or even find quests to join because the game would constantly disconnect. During this time, I had completed everything in the game up to Hunter Rank 50 almost entirely by myself. That is essentially all of the worthwhile content in the entire game. This was not a serious issue for me since I enjoy solo hunting, but for everyone who purchased this $60 game expecting to play with their friends, this was a major slap in the face. This issue seems to be mostly  by now but some people have reported that they are still having trouble staying connected.The PC version suffers from some serious performance issues on certain hardware configurations and many people are reporting massive frame drops even with top-of-the-line hardware. There are some pretty common frame drop problems with particle effects, particularly with Teostra's supernova attack and any weapon that uses lightning effect particles. Modder,  has stated that the game, for whatever reason, is using over 100 threads which creates massive CPU overhead and is ""the most insane piece of software he's ever looked at"". This is always a highly unpredictable aspect of PC games so just keep in mind that this game may not run to your expectations until Capcom does what they said they'd do and  the game. Alternatively, you could try Kaldaien's mod but I haven't had a need to, personally, so I can't endorse it.The game also doesn't even have graphical parity with the PS4/XBONE version. Textures are currently bugged and many character/equipment/environment textures are stuck on low resolution regardless of settings. Ironically, this is the  looking version of the game at the moment. Most of the game looks really ugly and blurry and I find it incredibly distracting. Digital Foundry mentions this in a  comparing the PC and XBONE versions.The keyboard and mouse support for this game is so bare-bones that I would personally consider it non-existent. There's a lot of keys that can't be assigned because they're reserved for things that the game seems to have arbitrarily decided you're not allowed to change. The mouse controls are laughably imprecise and I believe it is just emulating analog stick movement because it doesn't feel anything like proper mouse aiming but a fix for this is . I would recommend using a controller and I assume many veterans will gravitate towards that control scheme anyway since it has changed very little outside of the addition of the radial menu.. Many people reported a save corruption bug after beating the final boss of story mode but this turned out to be a case of a cutscene failing to play due to the system not having a . Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the game just came with the necessary codec so it's not really an excuse. Keep in mind that your game may crash and you'll be unable to load your save until you track down whatever codec the game expects. It might also be a good idea to manually backup your save every once in a while anyway just in case any save corruption bugs  occur.My final issue with this game is one that probably won't effect many people outside of those who have played a lot in these few weeks directly after release. The PC version currently doesn't have any of the extra content already released on PS4/XBONE. That means no Deviljho, Kulve Taroth, Lunastra, or Behemoth, along with any of the events and equipment released alongside these monsters. Since the only thing I have left to do is grind the same four monsters over and over again to get to Hunter Rank 100 and pray for the right decorations to finish my build, I'm pretty disappointed that I have to wait for this content that should have just been in the PC version from the beginning.The Monster Hunter community is full of obnoxiously zealous fans who would beg you to look past all of this and claim that anyone who rightfully criticizes this release is being unreasonable. I wouldn't blame you for thinking that you stumbled into a cult. This is more of a personal gripe and I wouldn't let it influence my overall recommendation but I felt it was worth mentioning anyway. I won't be updating this review as these issues are resolved since I think there is value in looking objectively at the state of a game at its release. I will allow Steam's recommendation system to do its job and separate all reviews from recent reviews as time goes on.Anyway,  the game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥' broken and Capcom completely failed at what they set out to do by giving us a ""great optimized PC experience"" but for anyone with low standards like myself, there's still about 150 hours worth of fun to be had here for anyone looking for a sort of reinvented Monster Hunter experience or for anyone who wants to experience Monster Hunter for the first time."

Takes a few seconds upon hosting the game. and when you choose a mission, they have to also choose the mission and TADAA!All story missions with cinematic scenes are solo, which scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. But the moment a boss appeared I could choose between:1. Send up an SOS flare and get random help2. Go back to town and rehost the quest, at this point it is no longer a solo mission and you can do it with your friends.A lot of peopl are complaining about disconnects from the multiplayer lobby, it's only happened to me twice in my 25 hours so either I'm lucky or these guys are spoiled. I've seen people complain about the game feeling sluggish - that's monster hunter, try a different weapon. I personally think it's a great port, it switches from keyboard to controller with ease.

This game beats every other monster hunter game including Rise in every single way. BTW like others have suggested, I suggest for new players do not use the defender armor, it gives it to you for free but if you use it it kind of ruins the experience by vastly reducing the time of the grind by greatly boosting your stats, which makes the game lose some of its appeal imo.. its kind of like easy mode since the normal game is pretty difficult"

The game itself counts with a lot of weaponsYou have the Great Sword, the Sword & Shield, the Dual Blades, the Long Sword / Katana (wich I use most of the time), a Hammer, a Hunting Horn (The Support weapon), a Lance, a Gunlance, a Switch Axe, a Charge Blade (The most complicated melee weapon in the game) it's a sword and a shield but both transform mid-combat into a giant axe, Insect Glaive, a Bow, a Light Bowgun, and finally a Heavy BowgunSo there are 14 weapons in total, Monster Hunter is well known for giving the player a lot of weapons and you can change it before any mission if you want (but don't forget to enhance them so they do a good dmg)And there's still one important thing left: ArmorsIf you never played Monster Hunter before, what makes this game really adictive is getting the parts of the monsters you hunt, and those parts of course are used to craft monsters and boss armors, and of cooourse they look cool as ♥♥♥♥In this game, they implemented a new mechanic called ""Scouting"" to find the monsters around the map, they usually leave scratches and footsteps on the ground and you can act with them to track down the beast you want to hunt, then a green trail guides you in the direction of the monster.There are 3 levels of Scouting in each beast of the game, and you level it up by simply Scouting (interacting with the footprints) once you have reached level 1 the green trail will guide you to the first footsteps of the monster and it helps a lot at the start, level 2 tells youi where the monster is on the map, and level 3 adds stats of the monster on the map and not sure if something else.Monster Hunter: World is more focused on Online than other games of the franchise, this being the easiest of them all if you want to play with friends, the game will always try to put you on a ""Online session"" but you can always play Offline, so don't worry.And that's itIf you like the franchise I would say it's a 8 or 9/10If you didn't it's a good game to try againAnd if you are new to MH, you can just like it (7/10) or love it (9/10)But of course this is just me guessing and my personal opinion about itYou can always tell me if you did buy it and what did you liked about itThank you for reading it all, hope it helps <3"

I've done both and the game doesn't work and won't work until they patch it.The annoying part is that this is happening because capcom is using a third party for their game's DRM and anti cheat. So either the anti cheat update they've done, or Denuvo is making the game unlaunchable.This anti cheat by the way was the same reason the game had so many problems at the launch of iceborne, which made the game largely unplayable for another large part of the playerbase due to framerate problems that didn't exist prior to the update. This problem affected players even if they didn't buy Iceborne.Edit: Crash on launch issues fixed for players for whom adding the game to the exception list hadn't fixed it, but players can't complete raid content because the game keeps either crashing or disconnecting users from the online thanks to it's great anti cheat system and DRM.Players who couldn't launch the game were given a wooping 15 days where they either had to play something else or got a Totally Legitimate tm version so they'd be able to keep playing the software they paid for.10/10 would play again."

If you plan to buy it and play with a friend or solo. Sure, its worth it what are you waiting for?? Get the  expansion too! You will never regret it since the Iceborne expansion is GOAT. Based on the stats,  Everyone whom finished the base game should get ICEBORNE as it brings out the most of game, both gameplay and story-wise. Word of advice, don't SOS on every monsters. Try to conquer it yourself solo, learn about the monsters, then if you failed the quest for over 5 times, feeling fed up and want to continue. That's when you should call for the help of the gods (hunters who cleared the game and reached godhood). Defender equipment is ugly but strong, the hunters have mixed feeling about this armor.  Unless you tried and failed a quest a lot, still wanna solo the quest instead of asking the help of the gods, then sure defender is the way to go.Game is good. 10/10See new monster-> tries beatin it-> beat/fail-> craft new armor from new monster/ farm equipment to beat monster-> SOS if all things fail->"

This game's whole experience for me was learning and mastering the charge blade, and that weapon is HARD to master (at least for the poor pea-brained me), yet it was one of the most fun things i've ever did.If you really want to master an weapon, look for guides on youtube, because all of them have secret bits and bobs of info that could give you the edge on any future hunt.Do not hesitate to call for an S.O.S. flare. Hunters togheter, legends forever. And you might even meet new friends as you do so.Overrall this game's gameplay is fantastic. Heavy weapons feel heavy, light weapons attack fast but it's a death by a ten thousand papercuts.

Combat joy. See below.- Fights that require learning and improvement.- Progression through gear *and* personal experience+skill.- It looks great. (even at low settings)- Plenty of weapon styles.- Monster Hunter language for speech available. 10/10.- All weapons are great. Except Longsword because ♥♥♥♥ everyone using it. Including me.- High variety and decent depth of tools and their respective uses.- Lots of gear building.- Inspiring soundtrack.- Long grind and lots of stuff to do.(the stuff below was added because a dumbass made a good point)- You have a pet cat that sort of talks. It fights with you in duos/solos if you allow them.- Cats have armour and weapons.Cons : - There are bad players, beware. (reviews about how the monster 'predicts' your attacks)- There are bad players hoping you can wail on monsters just because you dodged.- Some of these players did not just give up and are still playing, BEWARE.- This game is not for potato PCs. Seriously.- Low settings can take awhile to get used to. (still looks alright to me,  but it is a bit of a downgrade from high/medium)- The AI is pretty scary if you're not prepared. (If you want a punishing beat-em-up, go to Dark Souls, instead.)- There is a long grind. It's what this game is about. Grind for parts, make stuff to grind for more parts.- Disconnection issues may have been improved upon, but are still there. (possibly caused by Steam, rather than MHW?)- Again, this game is *seriously* taxing on one's system. Potatoes be warned.Summary- I am having way too much fun.- Soloing is easier, don't let scrubs mislead you on this. They're just bad. Multiplayer is dealing with a harder AI to read and way more HP to break through with reliance on teammates who may or may not be good.- This is not a game for people who believe that if you outplay the monster by dodging, you get free hits. All you did was dodge. Now find your damn opening, because dodging me spitting at you doesn't mean I can't still punch you in the teeth."

It has been an excellent experience and I can't wait to play more in the series if it comes to PC. A plethora of combat options and a world that truly feels alive. Every monster is a joy to learn its weaknesses and take to school with your weapon of choice. The beasts all feel like they really occupy space and have weight behind all of their attacks. Everything is difficult without being cheesy. I am told this game has the least options and is the most watered down of the Monster Hunter games but for a new player, you would never know it. If you ever wanted to play something like Dark Souls but against giant monsters and nothing else, this is your game. As a mostly PC player, I played the whole game with a mouse/keyboard without any issues at all. The controls felt responsive and fluid and I never felt hindered by my control choice. The menu options aren't ideal for mouse/keyboard but you get used to them fast enough. My only gripe is that I wish there was a way to turn any armor into a 'layered' armor set as by the end of the game, most armors are rendered obsolete which limits the ability to play a version of fashion souls as you might do with Dark souls.

Went from being on the verge of refunding it to putting in many hours in just a short period of time and purchasing the DLC. Unique combat system that reminds me of Dark Souls (dodging mechanics, reading monster's wind up animations, etc.) However, the overall flow of the combat is very different from the Souls series. Absolutely adore how there's no punishment in wanting to switch weapons. There's no ""respecing"" or anything like that, you really only have to farm material to craft other weapons. Each weapon offers a unique play style: everyone can find something they like. It's  I selected weapons that didn't fit my play style, and that's what drove me to dislike the game initially.HOWEVERBoy... does this game have issues with it's online play... With co-op hunts being such a huge part of the game's selling point, you would think that multiplayer is seamless. That's certainly not the case. Between all of my friends, we've had problems such as the following:1) game freezing when someone faints2) random disconnect from online sessions 2a) subsequent forced withdrawal from quest3) quest difficulty not readjusting due to the forced splitting of party 4) inability to rejoin each other's quests due to player cap reaching limit before forced splitIt's made my experience significantly less enjoyable; in fights against any elder dragons, tempered monsters, arch tempered, etc. this terribly frustrating. Please be aware of this when purchasing the game, especially if you're planning to play with friends. If changes can be implemented to make online play better, this game would be in a really great spot."

I think the series was starting to feel stale, but they changed a lot in this iteration which made for a new and refreshing experience. However, this game seems poorly optimized and while they made a lot of good changes, some are questionable. I'm also annoyed with how they changed the controllers shoulder/trigger button functionality and the lack of controllers options to fix the issue. With that in mind I just decided to play with the keyboard and mouse instead which seems to be working well enough. It feels like it lacks content compared to some of the previous entries like freedom unite and a lot of the weapons look really similar because they reused a lot of the models instead of making new ones for each path. I enjoyed this game, though I don't know if I enjoyed it much as some of the older games. I think the 2nd and 3rd generation of monster hunter may have actually been my favorite, but this one's good, especially if you're new to the series. The mechanics are explained a lot better, its much easier, has better collision, but even with those improvements its just lacking something the older games had. The monsters in this game lack variety compared to the previous games, it feels like they all share too many similar moves. I also think the movement and combat being so fluid now with the forgiving collision just takes away from really having to learn each monsters attacks, look for openings, master good positioning and timing, etc and most fights are too easy now. I don't like that the game has 2 DRMS (Steam and Denuvo), one is plenty. But at least it seems to work without an internet connection which is a big plus considering a lot of newer games don't. GAMEPLAY:If you never played monster hunter, the gameplay is 10/10. Monster hunter has always been about the intricate combat system that rewards knowledge, creativity and skill. Combat is very similar to dark souls. If you like boss fights in games than you'll love this. Each monster has different attacks they telegraph that you have to find ways of dealing with while also looking for openings where you can get some damage in. Each monster has different strategies depending on which of the 14 weapons you use. There's a lot of replayability in trying to master fighting each monster with all the weapons types. There are also a ton of items you can use against them like traps. Winning a fight against a new monster is exhilarating, and when you get back to town you always want to rush to the smithy to see what new equipment you can make to further customize and improve your character with. It's all very enjoyable alone or with friends. CHANGES:My favorite change is the visual weapon tree that shows all the branching paths so you can see what's good without having to look it up online while you play. You can also downgrade weapons which refunds your materials making the upgrade system much more forgiving. That's something I think the series needed for a long time.Gathering is now much faster and fluid so it doesn't interrupt the pacing of game as much. They streamlined EVERYTHING which is good and bad, but I think they went a little overboard in some areas. The new the graphical user interface is less intuitive than the old one and not as appealing. I was really skeptical about the new tracking mechanic until I fully understood it, but I think it's a good improvement over the old paintball system. They removed the loading zones between maps which changes gameplay in a few ways. The new maps are really big, complex and beautiful, but can become infuriating labyrinths at times. All pieces of armor seem to give you a skill instead of points toward a skill which seems like a good change.Charms are no longer farmed but crafted which could also be a good change since it alleviates some of the farming and RNG. Performance:I haven't experienced any crashes, but it seems poorly optimized for a AAA game. I've been playing on basically lowest settings(textures aside) and get an occasion hitch where the game freezes for a few seconds. I'm running it on windows 8.1 with an i5-4670k processor and 760 gtx video card. This is the only game aside from PUBG I can think of atm that makes all my fans run at high speeds to keep my pc cool while playing on lowest settings. TLDR;I'd highly recommend it to anyone that thinks they might enjoy it if you have a good PC that can run it. Like with all steam games you're probably best off waiting for a sale to save money, but it's well worth the full price imo."

With some story, more or less.I do believe its content is disappointing compared to older monster hunters, but the QoL changes more than make up for it. I love the game even if i'm not that very good at it. There's a weapon type for almost everyone, there's also a lot of gimmick builds. (Wish the damage builds would be nerfed to make room for other cool stuff though.)Most of my complaints is going to be fixed in iceborne, so there's no point complaining about it.I hate its forced narration, unskippable cutscenes ( I know you worked hard on them, but still), weird co-op intergation.The game also doesn't tell you things as well as I hoped. The leap of faith is never really explained (I believe?), and stuff like mount damage isn't  but it's a lot better than older monster hunters still.Also, I very dislike how delayed the game was and how terrible it was at launch. Mouse controlled like a trackpad and disconnection issues were off the charts. Content was also 'accelerated' to match consoles, but there were months where we didn't get anything for a long time, even if we suddenly get a month of jampacked stuff..Overall, not bad.

First of all - controls are messed up. If you were going to buy this game and play on mouse+keyboard, i cannot recommend you to do so. let me explain why:  The game in its essense emulates a gamepad. In case of mouse it emulates right stick. The word 'emulate' is not an exaggeration. Your mouse has acceleration always on and has capped max speed. You cannot turn fast no matter how fast you move your mouse, you cannot target something precisely because inertia in emulated stick movement. it feels HORRIBLE.  The game has lock-on system and you switch targets with a mouse. Oookay, but do as much as lightly touch it and your screen goes all over the place, switching all the targets possible 3+ times each. Apparently developers never heard of 'dead zone'.   Radial menus. You think one would press Q, mouse over something and use it. Wrong! You have to use WASD to navigate radial menus, which is ... bad. At the very least it's practically impossible to drink a potion while moving. You can use F1-F4 and then 1-9 instead, but it's not very convenient (mostly due to pressing F1-F4 buttons beforehand, try pressing F1 then 7 very fast).   And now we get to keybindings, which are implemented horribly. Once again, emulation. If 2 actions are on same button on gamepad, they're on same button on keyboard. You cannot detach them like in other modern games. For example, on gamepad Special Attack and Interact are both on B, if i want to move Special Attack to side mouse button for example, i cannot bind interact to E separately, it moves to side mouse button as well.   Now that we're done with controls, let me also mention low graphics quality for 2018 in form of multiple low resolution textures (on max setting, mind you)  and mid 2000-s lighting. It's just not on par with other modern games.   Another weak point is multiplayer which is derived from old mobile (PSP, 3DS) ad-hoc parties. You have to join open session with up to 16 players, none of them you can see anywhere in the world, and then may form parties with them for specific quest. This design feels wrong and outdated.   Also, you cannot play co-op with your friend, because game does not allow you to join your friend on story mission you did not complete solo (or with somebody elses help) first.  All in all, the game is decent, combat is fresh and interesting, monster design (gameplay wise) is good, but overall quality of this port detracts from the experience big time. That kind of quality has no place in this day and age. I would recommend to buy it on a 50% sale at least, it's not worth full price."

If you as a dev are not competent enough to make a save system that works properly ALL of the time, then either build your own damn backup contingencies, or at least let us save the same file in different slots so we can stagger-save.From what I've found out about this issue, even steam cloud saves might not have saved it, so that particular brand of hindsight is extra useless.If you want a game that might spit in your face for daring to love it, that might demand you start fresh if you look at it funny, be my guest and roll them dice, but don't blame me if you experience the same incandescent rage that I do right now."

I really hope Capcom will still fix it ASAP despite my positive feedback.What I enjoy from Monster Hunter World despite this is my first game of the franchise are :- Good difficulty progression, at first you will meet normal-hard version of the monster then harder version then hardest version of the monster. All in good step progression.- A lot of things to do, not counting the grind for the end game which really optional. There are alot of things to try, whether you want to collect all armor, trying all weapon, collect all palico's gadget.- Co-op is really optional. As for me I always try everything solo first because of the challenge then after If I want to co-op I can hunt with  my friend or just use ""SOS"" feature to help random people- Good for Casual player and Hardcore player. Casual can just play the game as it is until reach tempered version of monster, both solo and co-op. Hardcore can aim for min-maxing the equipment through endgame. It's really up to you.- Endgame Grinding is optional. Unlike MMO which something you need to do if you don't want lag behind. As for me once I beat all monster solo until tempered elder dragon I feel satisfied enough. I don't really attracted enough to find all decorations and augment to complete my gear set. I'm still gonna continue tho to try other weapon, but probably not as intense as usually I play.What I dissapointed from the game :- Lack of Raw Mouse Input. This is the only reason I don't try range weapon. I don't like playing range using controller, but when I try using K+M the mouse really feel weird. Alot of suggestion how to tweak but I really can't get it enjoyable. Capcom really need to fix this.- Texture bug. My rig is not the best, but for texture I usually can get the highest option. Despite that it's still not look too good- Network Issue. This is the only reason preventing people playing co-op and why it's worth to give negative feedback for this game. - Not enough explanation for some feature in the game unless console player told us. Yes I'm talking about radial menu customizationMixed feeling :- Amount of Monster, I feel it's good enough but after I read some of comment about number of monster in previous game I feel like MHW can get more too. Hope Capcom will add more monster other than the one they release in Console version"

Having fought hacked quests for increased difficulty such as Tripple furious Rajang in an arena, amoung many others. Having loads of hours into this game as well as top 30 in speed runs for a few monsters, I can state that the game itself has allot of pros and cons to consider before purchasing - PROS-Quality of life changes ( gathering can be done on the run,crafting simplified, Armors not needing rare gathered items often times making no sense. Such as several rare beetles that can only be found at volcano in a single spawn on a 7% chance.)   ^-Attacks from players no longer send you flying backwards ( gunlance shells, etc ) This allows for most diversity in the weapons that are usable online.^^- An interactive map that allows markers and waypoints to be set, it also shows all events in real time ( small monsters moving around, plants and gathering materials etc)^^^- waypoint traveling at any time not in combat on maps, as well as access to change your gear and item box during a mission, you can also eat food on a mission as well. -Smooth combat, terrain based attacks add a nice new element to the game, this often allows for interaction with the enviroment to pull attacks off that normally wouldnt be possible. For instance trapped against a wall and a monster is rushing at you? No worries, if this is one of many walls that you are able to run up, you will be able to dodge a charge from an angry diablos and turn the tables with an arial attack.All weapons mostly viable- Despite what you will hear from allot of players, all weapons are mostly viable across the board. There are certain weapons that are niche situations however all have decent across the board balance for the most part.-All the weapons are in a single game with updated move sets, and terrain based moves.-Terrain traps are an interesting addition to the gamewith addition of the terrain came traps, certain areas have these that can be triggered in a number of different ways, each resulting in a specific effect. CONS-Game based cons-- End game RNG grindHaving been a 10 year veteren of the series, I am certianly no stranger to the grind in monster hunters. However gems for your armor are now only obtainable through melding( specific low tier gems can be crafted through melding) and randomly after a mission. After hitting an HR nearing 100 and 4xx missions under my belt, I am no closer to finding any gems that I have been looking for. ( these are ofcourse among the dozens of gems that can not be crafted and only can be obtained through RNG) This RNG is further made worse by the augment system in endgame, requiring random drops from special gems specific to your weapon type.-Roar into xxx true comboThis is honestly the first monster hunter in which nearly every monster has a Roar into XXX move, be prepared to get that evasion + or ear plugs, as it will save you a load of frustration.-Poor hit boxes on large number of the monsters--Many of the monsters have rather perplexing hit boxes on their attacks. For instance often times at the tail of a rathian/rathalos durnig the standard run attack you will be hit, to the left or right of the tail slightly? -still hit - The rule of thumb is treat all monster attacks with movement as a giant cube, you will find yourself less confused and hit less often.-Monster physics?-momentum is overratedIn Most all of the monster hunter games, aside from X ( astalos) Monster hunter monsters were generally bound by at least their own weight class. You were able to see a heavy large monster move like it had weight to it, and its speed and acceleration would show accordingly. However that does not seem to be the case this time around in world. Many of the cast move like this was dragonball z fighters. For example, teostra has a leap in which he instantly accelerates to break neck speed from a leap nearly teleporting to a location, and seemingly stops standing like he had been there all along. This becomes rather difficult to guage the pacing of a monster when they do not abide by their own physics at random times in a fight.-Hallways and more hallwaysThe game has moved from large open areas in which to fight monsters, and instead chosen to replace it with terrain revolving around many channeled hallways. There are more open zones in the maps, however a vast majority of each map are a series of tunnels or hallways in which the fights take place. Fighting azure rath shooting fireballs down hallways is something I could do with out.-Lack of monsters move diversity-Most monsters share a large majority of their move set, for instance rathian/rathalos is a standard for most games, however many of those movesets such as tail spin/ tripple fireball, tripple run, are shared across a vast majority of the cast. Elder dragons all share the right and left paw swipe, amoung other moves, making it rather stale after some time.-No G rank-For long time fans of the series we all know what comes with G rank, much harder monsters, larger defense values ( or Hp pools) and most of the moves 1 shot. However with this trade off comes armor that allows the highest tier of slots and skills, This allows for numerious amounts of builds and sets that would not be possible at high rank. This G rank level often times allows weapons such as hunting horn or other lower damage weapons the ability to make sets that help the weakness of low damage or other such weaknesses of weapons. The game does have a psuedo G rank option of augmentation for your armor, however it is still nothing close to the experience of true G rank.-Difficult to communicate with othersIn past monster hunter games you could rather easily send text to other players you had on your huntercards ( friend list ) In this game however sending anything to another person is nearly impossible if you do not know them in real life. The system of simply sending them a notice or a small sentence is a thing of the past.NON GAME BASED CONS--Delays and more delays---The PC version of this game is already vastly behind in content due to its near a year long delay compared to the console. The updates are coming in slowly, if at all. Many monsters have been pushed back months when capcom has told the community that it would be recieveing events at a faster pace than console in order to make up for lost time. The inverse it true, console is getting events at a faster pace.- Poor Online support-- ( AMENDED-ISSUE FIXED FOR MOST PLAYERS)For a AAA title, having the online hosted on potatoes is unacceptable, even after the ""fix"" patch you will be hard pressed to go for any period of time with out running into errors and disconects. As it stands currently the SoS flare feature ( access to recieve help from other players during a mission) is nearly non functioning. 10 million copies sold, one can only assume that at least $500,000,000 has been made on monster hutner world. Paying a small amount of that to purhcase your own servers rather than skimp and use free hosting is unacceptable. - Lacking graphics options standard to PC gamesAs seen hundreds of times on many other reviews FOV, Advanced graphics options such as motion blur, bloom, acceleration on the mouose, ect ect should be included in a PC release. ====UPDATED- Motion blur toggle added, Direct mouse input added.The main reason for the negative review is the lacking of online, as well as graphics settings. This review will change when these issues are fixed. As a long time monster hunter fan, it pains me to do so, however a title that has sold 10 million copies should learn its lesson for next time, to not pinch pennies on servers for the community that has purchased those copies, or wait nearly a year in delay with nothing to show for it."

That  is an abomination, a creature that not even Lucifer himself could love, a bizarre entity that you just cannot get rid of, making you claw at your temples until skin and flesh tears off, hoping the sweet embrace of the void comes quicker. Do not say her name."

These issues persisted for a little while and are now the result of steams heavilly mixed reviews. Now with all the online multiplayer modes being mostly fixed, up and running, hopefully we'll see all of that change now because honestly this is a game that's worthy of much more credit. Whether you're new or a veteran to the series, there's plenty to be enjoyed with this charm. The combat sytem is legenday with various different weapons to chose from, which all function completely differently with their own set of combo's and tactics to learn, making learning them all the more rewarding. Fights may be intense, especially the deeper you get into the game and may not be for the faint hearted as you will be punished hard if you slip up, but it's that kind of challenge that makes the monster hunter series so entertainingly addictive.With additional DLC including new maps and monsters expecting to be added to the game in future, it leaves one with plenty to look forward to."

I've played ALOT, like ALOT. I really enjoy the combat, I love how you have to earn every step forward. The multiplayer is wonderful if you've got 1 to 3 friends who play games with you. If you're looking for a game to have near endless hours of fun and you've never played a game that challenges you to ""get good"" this game will do it.The only drawbacks I can think of are the limits placed on sieges (raids), it can sometimes make it difficult to party with friends, but that can be easily overcome by hosting your own session. Also the story is a little cheesy, but it does bring a sort of entertaining hack and slash naivety being, you're murdering these giant monsters to make cool stuff from them. Meanwhile all the NPC's are positive and smiley about it. Final drawback being occasionally you get disconnected from the sessions and are now solo fighting the monster instead of ganging up on it with your bros.Like many games MHW has a base story line you play through then extra end game content, part of that is building your multiple end game sets much like Diablo or Path of exile it can become a gear grind to build your ultimate sets; for some like myself, this is a plus. However if you're a casual gamer that doesn't enjoy the satisfaction of building your ultimate set, you'd prefer the game just give you stuff this probably isn't going to be as fun for you. Think ""Call of Duty kill grind"" to unlock attachments vs ""Legend of Zelda"" I found the thing now I can use it and all of it's capabilities.The multiple weapons in the game give you a variety of play styles and even then you still get a variety within the weapons themselves of play styles. Which is wonderful because it gives you many different ways to tackle the next big bad monstie.For me going on safari in the monster hunter world to collect all the different pieces of parts which allows you to make the ultimate armor then adding to it decorations to polish off the skills I want is super satisfying.To summarize if you like skilled game play with lots of ways to customize play style with the satisfaction of collecting pieces to build the ultimate god tier hunter then you'll love this game. Oh and the mulitplayer is hella fun but not required so you don't HAVE to have your bros on to go hunt you get a little partner to assist you."

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

It is quite honestly, one of my favourite games of all time, let alone one of the best games in this franchise. I have 1500 + hours in the PS4 version + Iceborne as well. - With 14 weapons to choose from and varied, enjoyable to play around with move-sets, coupled with a fantastic combat loop due to great animations and fun-to-fight monsters, once again, MH hits it out of the park on this front. No weapon is truly bad, all of them bring something to a hunt. Whilst it's fun to main (and I implore you to join the swag-axe crew) a weapon, I'd encourage trying them all. Clocking in 200 hours with a single weapon and then going to use another will honestly, feel like an entirely new experience. The monsters may not change as your weapon does, but how you go about fighting them, will. - Whilst not the sort of game where you'd find yourself adding music from the OST to your regular playlists, it still manages to nail the music thematically, for both the monsters and their regions. Sound design is top notch too, the roaring crunch of a GS user landing a True Charged slash, as well as the power from a Swag-Axe enthusiast letting off an elemental discharge sound fantastic. Monster roars / noises sound great too. Voice acting is okay, the lip-syncing doesn't match up with the English VA at all thus, it'll look weird during cutscenes. - Probably one of the weaker areas in the game when talking about weapon design. Armour and monster design as per usual are great, but for some reason, many weapons fell prey to Iron / Bone design with a monster element thrown in, akin to a topping on a pizza. There are some stellar weapon designs here, just a shame that many look rather basic. Regions all look good, nailed their themes. - What you get out of Monster Hunter is ultimately what you're willing to put into it. You could complete LR, HR and the MR and do a couple of hunts / investigations outside of the main path and be on your way. Many of us though will continue the hunt, the grind for parts to fill out our collections and pamper our dopamine receptors, all whilst engaging in a fantastic game-play loop. There is plenty here to feast on, but it ultimately comes down to you.--- - Amazing game, worth every penny at full MSRP let alone if on sale. I personally prefer World to Rise and would sooner play World or MHGU over the newest instalment."

If you never played any other MH game you’ll absolutely love it. It’s a great one for beginners. However it’s really annoying if you’ve played them before, there’s a lot of handholding. And I mean A LOT. Constantly when you’re out and about you’re led by “scoutflies” which are glittering paths leading you right to your target. It takes away the satisfaction of feeling like you’ve actually tracked the monsters. You can even see them on your map all the time which takes away half the fun. The music is nice at times but gets lost outside the villages. It’s all fanfare most of the time. But then again nothing's ever as good as the Pokke Farm theme. I still wish there were more non-orchestral pieces.The story is easy enough to ignore. It doesn’t have many striking or engaging main cast members really. There are some interesting ones later one once you get past the first two environments. It doesn’t read like a MH game in the way it’s so in your face; on top of that the writing is mediocre. In the older ones the story was in the quest descriptions so it was more a background deal. Writing really isn’t a strong point for these games.The environments are visually pleasing, the variance between locations is massive. When they say World they really mean it.The new monsters have a lot of character and are unique. Very pleasing aesthetically and don’t seem out of place in the MH universe. While they have a lot of variance and creativity in their attacks, the combat still feels the same between all of them. It’s extremely easy to find materials for armor and weapon upgrades so the difficulty margin doesn’t feel like it increases from one monster to the next. All of them feel very at level if not slightly below. The three times I’ve fainted in combat didn’t feel like I’d deserved it. They were all a result of unavoidable attacks and waiting on the recovery frames. Overall great for beginners to MH, but the excitement for those that have experienced Freedom Unite/Generations will ultimately be a bit dissatisfied with the combat. Definitely worth playing even then, I’ve still enjoyed it to some extent.Honestly I can see myself going back to Generations after a while. I’ll give MHW:4/10 Music4/10 Story7/10 Character design9/10 Environments10/10 Monster Design6/10 Combat and gameplayIf you haven’t played MHFU or Generations, grab yourself a 3DS and get to it."

Picking a weapon and actually understanding how to play it helped me a lot! As soon as you understand the basics of how to use your equipment it's a ton of fun! The world is engaging, watching the monsters interact with each other, fighting or hiding and all that, is very interesting. Progressing through the game will bring you into contact with most of the monsters naturally, just by following the main and side quest lines. The late game contains more challenging versions of all the fights. I had some frustrating moments, where I just could not find a plant I was looking for or where a monster constantly pulled off a move I could not yet deal with or interference in a fight by other monsters. So I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to my friends about it, which had them laughing at me for being so ragey about silly stuff, but all in good fun, I never felt like giving up or dropping the game ^^There is just a lot of content and things to learn about, items, NPCs that sell or do things for you, systems and menus in the game and all that.I really enjoy the graphics and designs of the world you're in. Especially fun to play with people online. You can just post/join a quest in an online session with people and they can join you for the hunt. Or you can send an SOS signal, which then opens it up to people from everywhere, not limited to your session. It definitely has grindy moments, when you're trying to get a very specific piece of armour or a weapon (which you should to be honest, there's certain effects that will greatly boost you, depending on your playstyle/weapon). Great fun! Put some time into character creation so you feel good about your character and then see where your journey takes you :3"

Monster Hunter World is truly a new world in your own computer, every day, every hour while playing this game you will learn something new or notice something you haven't before, whether it be a new sub species of little critters you can find during your hunts and expeditions, a structure or pathway you've never taken, or an interaction with the monsters living in the various areas, Capcom really focused on the small things in this game that will leave you awestruck at the absolute amount of effort put into the game, overall, the environments and level design in this game is top notch, something that's very rare and should be experienced.              The gameplay design of this game is very repetitive and extremely grindy, you will find yourself fighting the same monster over and over again, in usually the same place, you'll need to forage the land and do it all again for as many times as you can take it, there are additions in the game that allow you to over time passively gather resources that you'd have to forage for which will make the game a much better experience, it will also give you a sense of power creep, which is the satisfying part of playing through the game.              The beginning of the game is very lacky, the story is very forgettable and kind of annoying seeing that it is mandatory in order progress and find new monsters and areas, that being said, the fights are still crazy fun and a good start to prepare you for hard mode, which is where you'll spend most of your time fighting the various monsters in order to progress your weapons and armour. Farm, craft, repeat.              Gameplay wise [The combat itself will be judged in a separate paragraph] this game is repetative, grindy and only for those who are willing to farm the same thing over and over and over again, though once you're around HR15 the game opens up to a whole new variety of things / monsters that will really balance repetition and content.              Lastly the combat and monster design, the reason the game exists, the bois you will be constantly farming and dying to, the huntees. Im too lazy to write a paragraph large enough to put into perspective how well designed the monsters are, so you'll have to see for yourself, the character, in game render and overall concept of the monsters rivals that of any other game i've played, these things are truly like beasts in another world that live in their own environments, interacting with the things, people, other monsters around them, its pretty amazing.              The combat in this game is like dark souls with a rogue twist, you can use your weapon to hunt, you can use the environment, you can get other monsters to help you hunt your monster, the possibilities are almost endless with what situations and environment you find yourself in. The weapons are well put together, each with their own flashy fighting style and design, if you don't like what your weapon is capable of, use one of the other 10+ weapon types that fit your playing style, the animations are smooth and the combat is very satisfying and well executed for a ""I hit the thing until it die"" kind of game.Overall TLDR:"

The PC release had a rocky launch in terms of online stability and some graphics related issues (the issues I experienced were related to poor framerates in specific game environments, and major framerate drops and game stuttering during thunder elemental attack effects, which not everyone was experiencing. I'm playing on an i9-7900X CPU @ 3.30GHz, 32 GB RAM, GeForce GTX 1080 Ti). Online stability has vastly improved for me playing both in random online sessions, and with friends across NA and EU, since the first patch was released a couple weeks after the game's launch. I have faith the remaining issues will be resolved as the franchise's first PC release continues to grow with the huge success of this game across all platforms it's been released on so far.In terms of the game itself, I'll include my experience of the PS4 release of MHW combined with the PC release, because it definitely feels like to me, the hours I'm putting in on PC now are complimenting the 400+ hours I played on PS4. As my first MH game, even hundreds of hours into the game, I'm still finding myself learning new ways to play, whether it's figuring out a new way to use one of the 14 weapon types available, or discovering a new strategy for any of the (currently) 31+ large monsters available as hunting targets. The behavior of the monsters varies enough from hunt to hunt, and across multiple environments, to keep me on my toes when I start getting a little too cocky or comfortable. Many aspects of the game remind me a great deal of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen, another Capcom game I very much enjoyed.As the PC release of MHW catches up a bit to the content released on consoles up to now, I have plenty of confidence that my enjoyment of this game won't diminish for many hundreds of hours to come. And to me, that's absolutely been worth the purchase across multiple platforms."

It's already hard enough to play with friends due to the requirement where you have to get to the cut-scene before friends can join you... but I've wasted so much time recreating lobbies due to disconnections and getting ejected from the game that it just isn't worth it. There needs to be some form of handling D/Cs and automatically reconnecting players to the host--ejecting players from the game instantly and blocking them from rejoining if their ping fluctuates a little is not acceptable for peer-to-peer connection. If that's fixed, then I will gladly change my review."

Back then where the great sword was slow and just a beginning tool its now the most damaging weapong and super fast due the aerial mechanics of the game!

Playing with an Xbox controller everything feels just as smooth as it should.Keep in mind that the first hour of this game is almost entirely cutscenes and moving from A to B.   That's allotting some time to create your character and palico, so your 2 hour refundable ""trial"" if you are doing that won't be much time to experience all the game has to offer.. The game is alot more fun if you have a friend or friends to play with, though the multiplayer allows for randoms to help you and talk to you, and there's some auto-chat messages in combat to help you know what your ally's might be up to e.g. ""Mounted the beast"" or your Palico informing that they need to heal you. But yeah, as of writing this I have 6 hours so this is more of a first impression kind of review, but so far I have nothing to complain about aside from some monster fights becoming a little tiresome after a bit."

Monster Hunter: World combat its just great, the combat mechanics in the begging can be a litle hard to learn and use in the best way, however with the time you will become better and better, starting to do the combos, etc... Killing more easily the several monster that you have in front of you.The map it's not huge, but we can say that is big, being divided in zones that after are divided in areas, this can sound a litle bit confuse, however it's just that, per exemple in the forest zone you will have several different areas, starting with the 1 and ending at the 12.I really liked the co-op implementation to the game, it's just a way that the desevolpers found to don't let the players leave the game soo easily if they have some friend also with the game, it's obviously more fun and a awesome aspect of the game.I loved the costumization of the game, it's just something of amazing, you will get items killing obviously the monsters, and after you can forge new weapons/gear to you and your litle cat or upgrade what you already have, and that is just something of insane, you will have different family trees that will lead you to different buffs, fire, water, etc... thinks that will help you really much in your hunts.Talking about costumizate your cat, yes you have a cat that will really help you, in the bigging I thought that the cat was just a stupid implementation that don't really help us in nothing, and I found that I was terrible rong, the cat is the reason that I just died 3 times in my full experience, he helps you a loot, attacking the monster (not giving much dmg, but helps) and giving you heal, and that yes, will save you a loot if times, image yourself against a powerful mobster, and without heal pontions, say thank you to your cat for saving you.Let's end the Gameplay topic with the cherry in the top of the cake, let's talk about the hunts, I loved what the game done, Monster Hunter: World don't just show the monster that you wanna hunt, you literally need to hunt him, following his footsteps and his marks to find him, it's just soo immersive.For more impressive that this can sound, about gameplay I don't really had any trouble bugs, glichs, none.I hated the story, I just played the first half because I was soo frustrated that I don't even wanted to play the rest of the game, I was waiting for something of amazing, and I don't received that, I will not say that is a terrible story, but I will not say that couldn't be better.Probably other players that don't played the other franchise games understand better than me the story of Monster Hunter: World, because I just understanded 3 thinks, I hunt monsters, I'm in a new world and I wanna find Elder Dragon, just that.In terms of characters, I just liked the cat because he helps us, the others are just there making place. In other games with great stories, we start create inside of us kinda of friendship with characters, however in Monster Hunter: World if they all die, you will litlelary don't care.I really think that the story becomes better after the first half that I played, because you start being a high rank hunter and that really makes the game more interesting, because it's when the co-op implementation starts being really useful and it's also when the game really makes you explore, so you can hunt what you want, to explain better what I wanna say I need to give some spoilers, and that I really don't want to give. So basically the story becomes better after the first half, so don't become like me and just finish.I will be really honest, Monster Hunter it's fun, and don't fun, it's that kind of game that is just too repetitive, with the time you already know the full map and the hunts start being every single time the same, however if you play with your friends, in my opinion the expirence isn't not even close the same, it's just one hundred times better and more fun.Monster Hunter: World it's without any question AAA game, have one of the best gameplays that I had the opportunity to see and enjoy this year, however the game could not be soo repetitive, having other modes, and could easily have a better story."

The gameplay is a lot of fun. The story is interesting. And it all looks really beautiful! It's fun to play with your friends and its one of my favorite games! But there are some downsides to the game as well. For example the game is very poorly optimized, for example it uses about 95 to about 100% of my CPU, while I'm running a GPU that's a GTX 1060 6GB. I know that's just a little above the recomended GPU, and my proccesor falls inbetween minimum and recomended requirements, but 95 - 100% that's just crazy! Also if you're looking to play story mode with your friends, don't bother, you have to have seen all cutscenes first, why they decided to do this is a complete mystery to me. Another thing that is really bad about this game is that it has very bad connection issues. Every 10 minutes or so, I get booted from a lobby. When I alt tab I can litterely see my Steam connecting and disconnecting... (which is prolly why everyone gets these annoying pop ups of people playing monster hunter world every 5 minutes. I have a connection speed over 200 Mbps, so trust me I don't have a terrible connection. Something is very, very wrong with this game. Also the fact that they haven't released a patch yet is beyond believe. Very bad rep for Capcom if you ask me.Note that even with all these issues I still think it's an amazing game, and in no way am I trying to discourage the devs to release more monster hunters onto the pc. The game just needs a good patch that fixes the optimization, performance, connection issues, and also the whole cutscene thing needs to be dropped, I just wanna play story quests with my friends!  For now I'd say I give it a 5/10 but if these prolbems are fixed, I'm willing to upgrade to a 9 or even 10/10 since its one of if not the most fav game I got at this moment, so at the end of the day I would still recomend it! I'm just trying to be fair and not be a complete fan boy that ignores issues, besides, being a bit criticism might only help improve the game, if devs would ever read this (which they prolly won't)"

I got the game a fair back ago but never gotten into it due to my initial weapon of choice, so whatever you do - make sure you try ALL of the weapons to find your gameplay style. There's a lot of them and combat changes drastically with every new weapon.With that out of the way, the game offers exactly what the title says - you're hunting huge monsters that are very detailed, have fantastic interaction with the environment and require preparation to deal with before each encounter. Gameplay loops are solid and there's a clear indication on what to do and where to go. The story itself is ""meh"". No real NPC backgrounds and it serves its purpose to drive you forward into new zones and new monsters so it kinda gets the job done - but don't expect much from questing and character backgrounds.The absolute worst part of the game is the UI. It's a clunky mess of tens of different UI elements that in different menus serve the same role. For example - managing inventory / quests / items is done via a scrolling interface in one context, then via a paginated menu in another, and finally in a tabbed context in the third one.Finding your friends and joining coop sessions is a PITA and it will have you jumping through menu hoops for quite some time before you get it right. Then there's the gear craft/upgrade system that has a whole different UI with some weapons inside submenus, while some are right there in the main menu making the whole thing extra confusing until you actually get familiar with all weapon types. The ""esc"" menu is also a submenu hell just as the UI parts that you use to transfer items between your bags and storage. Sometimes you need to click the amount of items transfered, and sometimes it's already pre-selected so if you click by muscle-memory you will simply deselect it and go back to the main menu...However - even with the horrible UX flow, Monster Hunter: World has that ""mmo"" feeling to it that will always make you log back in and do ""just one more quest"" while trying to land that massive combo with the awesome animation as you slay yet another huge monster.Oh... yea... and there's cats...

It's seriously a lot of fun to ignore the missions for awhile and go on ""Expeditions"", a free-roaming experience where there's no time limit and you're encountering NPCs with little quests around the area. Doing small quests gets you points and upgrade runes for your armor, too, so there's a lot of reasons to do them alongside the story. The main storyline itself seems lighthearted enough, too. Not really doom and gloom so far, and not really in your face either.英語の勉強のために英語版買いました。キャラクターのセリフごとの微妙なニュアンスもちゃんと翻訳されていて納得です。(ただし優しい英語ではないです)勉強になりますね。難易度は高くないと思いますが、十分楽しめます。 {enjoy your weekend by watching this ridiculous singaporean short video.}"

The maps are varied, and I find the verticality of them really fun to traverse through. The combat is satisfying, and you get to play pretty dress up. If you want to rush through the story, high level players seem to often jump into low level SOS requests. My main gripe is that the co-op was implemented a little awkwardly. My husband and I were playing through the story together, but it doesn't let you start missions together until you've both seen the cutscene(s) for the mission. Not really sure why they went that route, but it wasn't a huge deal. I don't recommend Iceborne unless you're good with some ridiculously difficult end-game fights."

Having to rebind is problematic, since you are binding vague classes of actions, not actions themselves. Getting melee and ranged comfortable to play requires them to have wholely different, and still unintuitive at times, control schemes since it requires buttons to be moved for one mode and not others.--- Online is broken. For a team game whose PS4 online implementation was essentially bulletproof, but not flawless (parties that would be consistent through runs, rather than having to disband every. damn. time.) the online just doesn't work. You will constantly get disconnected, you will constantly have failed to joined quests even though you are on Discord with your friend. You will get dropped from lobbies, you will have lobbies entirely disappear and dump everyone in them out into their own offline instance. You cannot attempt to rejoin aside from failing your mission then going back to town and manually trying to reconnect and rejoin. After PS4's multiplayer made MH so good to play in groups, this is a horrible thing to do to a great game.-- Obviously a port. Sometimes keyboarding works. Sometimes it doesn't. Enter generally works when you need to confirm somethine, backspace and esc are less likely. So many ""This button does 4-5 things"" situations when we have a whole keyboard we could use for binds. And then the keyboard version of the radial menu (which isn't enabled by default, which is BS) is entirely unbindable.Verdict: Playable if you enjoy the series and game. If you have the option, keep playing it on console or hold off buying until it's fixed. If you're a solo player, the broken online won't matter and it will just be an annoying to control game instead of a vast disappointment."

YOU GUESSED IT! Hunt monsters.Though the story is relatively bland, it's far from the key focus of the game. The repetitive grind-fest that Monster Hunter becomes late-game is ironically what makes Monster Hunter so great. You'll not only be grinding, but you'll probably enjoy it and the progression that comes of it! You'll have the option to use various different weapons and armor as well as nifty trinkets and gems, all of which add bunches of variation in accordance to how you hunt each monster. There's also plenty of events and unique items to unlock as well.The game has had its' fair share of glitches over-time. Generally speaking, it's well known that Capcom doesn't give the same ""love"" to their PC port as they do their console port. Therefore any problematic glitches on this PC port will more than likely take that much longer for Capcom to address. They do address most of these issues at some point in time, though again it's simply no where near as quickly as they address their console issues.8.5/10- I still love Monster Hunter: World, despite the issues it has faced over time. It's a game I keep coming back to, even after not playing it for months at a time. The replay-ability of the game is great and the fact it's fun and addicting make it the epic game that it is."

I had a few friends who had already beat base world before I bought the game at their recommendation. This game is very welcoming to series newcomers and was an absolute blast to play both solo and with friends. I am amazed by the lack of toxicity I have encountered while playing and happily beat both world and iceborne. With friends this game is nothing but a good time. On your own it is still a fun experience that gets the adrenaline pumping while still providing a challenge that hooked me to the franchise for years to come.The only negatives I can give are the connection errors in multiplayer and that, if doing a hunt for the first time, YOU are required to watch an in-game cut scene before other players can join the hunt. The lack of scaling for both 3 and 4 players as opposed to 3-4 being combined also sucked when I had two friends online and we knew that we would be fighting a monster that was scaled for four people. Overall, if you are thinking about trying out Monster Hunter then world and iceborne is probably the best place to start at square one."

Thankfully, most of these problems have been fixed and I can confidently say that the PC port now delivers the best Monster Hunter World experience. ·The game loads areas super fast (5 secs vs. consoles' 30+ secs) ·Maintains a good framerate even on high settings (60FPS vs consoles' 30~50FPS)·Has the option to play with controller or mouse and Keyboard·Can play online multiplayer without having to subscribe to PS Plus or Xbox Live  ·Mods·Peer-to-peer multiplayer connection can sometimes be wonky·Release of additional free content is behind by 1~2 months compared to consoles·Performance varies by PC specs; a crap PC will perform similar or worse than consolesGameplay-wise, Monster Hunter World is an action RPG where you fight big, bad monsters and collect their loot to craft weapons and armors that will help you fight bigger, badder monsters; this is the core gameplay loop of the game and what others might call ""the grind"" but the combat is so enjoyable it hardly feels like a grind. The combat system is deep with 14 different weapon types that vary greatly from each other - each weapon type has their own nuances and quirks that it sometimes feels like a different game when you switch to a different weapons (check  for a basic intro of the 14 weapons). Mastery of your weapon type determines the success of your hunts much more than just having better gear. Mastery is the most rewarding aspect of Monster Hunter - as you gradually get better, so too will the success of your hunts go.Asides from hunting monsters, there are many other activities in MHW to keep you busy - finding ingredients for the canteen, collecting and catching native wildlife, befriending the local tribes of humanoid cats, gathering resources, and fishing. Most of these activies will also help you in your hunts in some way so it doesn't feel like a waste of time when you do them.The game is tons of fun playing with friends online, and playing with randoms is also very easy as you can join anyone that fired an SOS flare (or fire one yourself). Playing solo is also an option and the whole game can be soloed."

Mostly the whole lack of being able to play as a prowler, who wouldn't want to play as their awesome cute palico (cat) companion and do awesome quirky abilities? Right?! Anyway, I obviously did give it a chance, and after 450+ hours, I think it's safe to say I enjoy the game. I miss some aspects from Generations (beyond the aforementioned), but all and all it's a nice game. It does have some aspects that I can see a few people not loving, namely the grind elements that it seems all Monster Hunter games entail for you to build your armor and weapons. Not sure how they could improve upon this to be less grindy and more fun, but hey, it is what it is. MHW has a lot to offer, and looks and sounds great, wether you're a long time Hunter, or new to the series, this is a great game to jump into."

This is one of my favorite games and I urge those who enjoy it to leave a positive review to combat this wave of negativity.

Shouldn't have taken so long to fix some very inherently broken parts with the game (scaling monster health when someone DC's). Variety is great, there's tons of content. Don't really care too much for the story, but you hunt monsters so who cares about the lore. Some monsters are unfairly punishing in the sense that if you get stunned you can just be locked in tot he point that you're just dead, but it's a double edged sword. Palico's are still useless as they almost never help you at the right time. They almost never hit you when you're stunned, and they insist on random Vigorwasp deliveries to you almost right after you heal up. Also the point of having a health bar for the Palico is almost useless as they can't die. Overall it's a great game to play with friends and they seem to have fixed a few things in Iceborne that are awful in the normal game, such as health scaling, but connection issues and rejoining is still a pain that plagues it from time to time."

Can't they see it?!"" and with my disingenuous looking (received this product for free) text I'm sure people will hesitate to read this anyway. The games have always been challenging and incomprehensible from the outside, with people asking me ""Surely you don't JUST hunt monsters?"" Monster Hunter: World bridged that gap though. In previous games in the franchise, it was mainly just about hunting monsters and that was what I loved. Yet here we are, Capcom added features to Monster Hunter World to keep you hooked for months. On top of this, the Iceborne expansion is setting the standards for DLC in the industry. But why?Firstly, I want to express that the game is designed near-perfectly to represent fantasy ecosystems. The engine has had a rough time before with my PC(s) but fortunately Capcom has fixed that. The reason it had a problem was probably because everything is living and breathing in this game. The attention to detail of the flora and fauna that live alongside the monsters is staggeringly good, as well as realistic. As a result, there are immersive environments and landscapes that enhance the experience, and as you become a better hunter you learn to use these areas to your advantage. It emulates a real learning curve of exploration and discovery, and that is why I love it. I cannot think of a single other game that does this at all, let alone to this extent and detail. The hunting is great. Each monster boasts attack patterns that become increasingly more difficult as you scale the ranks, but all are possible to beat. When something isn't, the game forces you to reflect, to take a step back and go on an expedition to hunt other monsters, gather materials and build something to better defeat the hurdle you come across. This system is used widely in MMORPGs, but Monster Hunter: World still adds a touch to make it unique and engaging all throughout the game, into endgame, and somehow even beyond that. The monster designs are possibly my favourite of all Monster Hunter games, due to the attention the creators paid to emulate evolutionary traits. Finally, we can speculate how Elder Dragons might be related, the similarities within the monster ""families"" (for example, Brute wyverns sometimes have similar attacks, and once you learn how to defeat one you become more familiar with the others by default, even if they look completely different and have other moves).There are in-depth reviews on the combat system so I won't divulge on that too much besides saying I love chargeblade and I can imagine my character sleeping with hers. Seriously, its an artform.The issues I have had with this game aren't too bad, but I will warn others despite my bug reports usually being dealt with in patches. Firstly, the support for a PS4 controller's buttons aren't in game. It defaults to a microsoft controller, presumably because of Steam's integration, but I would like an option to change this. That being said, every controller I've tried gets input lag sometimes. The keyboard and mouse controls are great in this game, but I played about 200 hours on PS4 so I neglected to learn them, I do use them when I play ranged weapons though.The game is CPU and GPU intensive for the reasons I described; it is a BIG game. There's shadows, v-ray reflections and complex lighting that used to mess with my framerate (they patched that, runs okay now). It still is completely intensive on my PCs though, despite them being high-end. Sometimes I think this causes the input lag, and on newer fights (with many particles), there is a very rare chance of lag. This could still cost you a whole hunt. But I digress. With the introduction of Iceborne, most of the issues have been fixed and clearly there is work to keep fixing it. I have yet to see a game that has been ported to PC that patches as effectively as Monster Hunter: World, the dedication to the PC playerbase is great (despite the waiting time before launch). The PC version outscales PS4 pro and Xbox as the best platform due to the improved loading times, the far better graphics (even on a lower end PC) and the overall immersion.I seriously recommend this game to new players, the community is amazing and you will inevitably make friends through this. There's a strong sense of community if you're struggling, and a lot of resources to help you both in-game and amongst other players. If you're a Monster Hunter boomer like me, you'll love it (if you're not nose-deep in it already). The odes to older players within the game are just brilliant. I hope other people love this game as much as I do, as it makes me happier than any other. Thanks for reading."

Powered through for IB expansion as that's where the game  begins for those who love difficulty! If you own Iceborne then I highly recommend using the Free Defender Weapons & the Guardian a+ armour set as they are OP/better than anything you are going to craft in MHW Base game but it's completely up to you if you want to take it slow through MHW - IB as there is much to complete to upgrade certain items or acquire them like Mantles, unlocking canteen ingredients or Botanical Research Harvest Box ect. ;>This was my first MHW game so I say this from experience! Take your time to learn about elemental/builds, weapons (Move sets) armour, monsters, items! Have fun and don't let it overwhelm you! - I'd go off fishing at times when I needed to relax having my *** handed to me by a monster and then come back later and show it who's boss.. xDPROS;CONS;Why are you still reading this?

It is my game of the year for sure. I played the Xbox version for over 500 hours (nearly 100 %ed it) and looking to do the same with this one. Even after doing pretty much all this game has to offer I will still play it. I already have way more friends to play with now that it is on PC, and that’s great!If you know nothing about Monster Hunter it is essentially a game where you hunt monsters. Constant mini raid bosses that can take up to 50 minutes sometimes. The leveling up in this game just unlocks more quests, not stats! It is long endurance fight for parts to make a variety of weapons and armors. It honestly makes the grind fun. Even though you are hunting for all these parts the game is essentially relying on your skill. A skilled player can beat this whole game without wearing a single piece of armor. The armor is just to make things interesting with the combination of skills you can come up with to customize your playstyle. The game rewards using items to make fights easier and almost feels like you are planning a hunt any time you come across a new monster. Each monster has unique strategies to learn and plan for. The game rewards reaction time and learning the movement of the monster like real hunting as well.Everyone is welcome here and it is awesome! If you are new to Monster Hunter this is the one to get into! The game is much easier to learn and get used to. Older Monster Hunter games took like 20 hours before you go “oh yeah I got it”. This took about 4 or so from what I seen with the newcomers I tagged along with.  If you are a veteran of Monster Hunter you will most likely love it if you can accept change to a more modern game. I still go back to old ones and play them for that unique experience but this game is so worth it! There seems to be a split in games now, which is totally awesome in my opinion. Old school vs new school. This monster hunter is the modern new school and if you are old school you can fit right in as one of the cool kids. Before you buy you have to remember some things. The beginning will seem overwhelming if you never played a Monster Hunter, but if you stick with it you will find a great game I feel. Each weapon has a learning curve, some easier than others. But each with a depth to be found and enjoyed. Most weapons are super unique and change the way you play the game completely so if you aren’t enjoying one, try another. The game can be soloed (I soloed or did duos with one friend most of my first time through the game), but it is so much better with friends. The online community for Monster Hunter has always been welcoming so if you don’t want to solo you can easily find a group willing to do hunts with you. Since I am a bitter old man I only like to hunt with my friends. I will solo before joining randoms. Some quests have to be started solo and if you are playing with friends, that can be annoying. Once the cutscene is triggered it its joinable though. So just have your friends back out and join you or vise versa. Other then that just take your time with it and learn the game at your own pace!Now if you own the PS4 or Xbox version and want to double dip like myself I highly suggest it. I was blown away in the first few minutes of this game. The game looks gorgeous. I played on an original Xbox One and the graphics were acceptable (Monster Hunter has never been about the graphics so I didn’t mind) but oh my god. It’s like receiving a random nude from your crush at 4 in the morning when I opened this up. It’s beautiful. I may get ripped a new one here but frame rate as long as it’s higher than 30 doesn’t ruin a game for me. As long as it’s fun it rarely bothers me. But the uncapped frame rate here is just like taking my favorite dessert and saying “HEY NO CALORIES WITH THAT BAD BOY, EAT UP!”. I also have way more friends to play with on PC cause a majority of them have PC’s over consoles. So, if you have few good people you want to make a hunting party with then go for it!Like I said this is my favorite game of 2018 and its going to take a miracle of a game to beat this for me. I gladly will buy this game twice… which I did just to experience it with a PC coat of paint and more friends. TLDR: interested in it? give it a shot. It has a learning curve but not as bad as previous installments. Owned it on consoles? Buy it again anyway cause this game is a great PC port.A veteran afraid of “new” MH? I was willing to accept the modern twist on it. The old ones will always be there to experience again."

Endless matchmaking errors while only trying to play with friends. Haven't tried to play in an open lobby once.So, this game I bought solely for the multiplayer experience with my friends is built to be a 1/3-solo experience as it is, because you HAVE to play a large chunk of the game solo, and even the rest of the game where I should be able to play with friends is mostly a solo experience because the connection fails every other hunt if not more often.If the game is updated and the devs say, ""We fixed the matchmaking issues!"" and it proves to be true, I'll happily recommend this game, because it is fun when it works. But for now, no. I've spent several hours trying to force the matchmaking system to work just to play with people on my friends list, and I'm just sick of even trying to play this game at this point."

The overall game is amazing and oozes with quality, but you have to invest a lot of time and engage with the mechanics. Farming is an awful overall affair, which gets worse starting with master rank, where monsters get tons of HP and Damage. When I started to look at some drop chances I got sad and wondered if I need to finish this game with my bad gear, or if I must waste dozens of hours killing the same monster again and again.(I dropped the game after getting my ass handed to me a few times too many by the Tigrex in Iceborne. INSANE HP values and random oneshots make this fight impossible for me.)Overall I would say the game was amazing and extremely fun, if the difficulty wasnt that inflated starting with Iceborne. (Although I dropped the game I would still recommend the base game to anyone and Iceborne only if you are extremely frustration-resistent or have too much time on your hands.)"

However, sadly Capcom has seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over the PC port and they do not deserve to be rewarded for this behavior.First off, the game was delayed ~7 months from the console and it was reported that the delay was to make sure the port was the best port they could possibly make. That was absolutely not the case, the PC release was crippled with connection issues, mouse and keyboard issues and texture problems. Months later while the connection issues have largely been solved the PC still cannot display textures on High without mods and a number of keys cannot be rebound. However the biggest issue and what caused me to finally not recommend this game is content. As previously mentioned the PC port was delayed over 7 months and unlike every other game ever they decided NOT to release all of the already released content for PC and instead opted for ""accelerated release"" of that already completed content. However that accelerated release was nothing but a bait and switch. The only monster we got early compared to the console was the Deviljho, over a month ago, and since then? Nothing. They were mum on the Autumn Festival until the last minute leading many to believe we weren't even going to get it, however what we did get is a SHADOW of the amount of content the console. The PC got exactly one new quest from the event and no new monsters or events beyond. Literally the entire event can be finished in about a half hour to an hour. Now, today Capcom has revealed the PC won't be seeing Kulve Taroth, the big raid everyone's been waiting for until sometime in November. That means for another month the PC will have nothing the the base vanilla content for another month for a game that's been out for nearly a year. Absolutely unacceptable. The game is a total blast and I've loved all my hours in it but I cannot honestly recommend this game given Capcoms handling of the PC. We're missing so much content, our holiday event is neutered and there are still numerous bugs romaing freely. Capcom doesn't deserve your money."

I can hunt a monster a hundred times and I won't get bored, simply because this game is heavily skill based when it comes to dodging attacks and sneaking in a potion or two. This game keeps me on high alert when hunting for Monster bosses!Let's not forget the cats! Oh my god they are IRRESISTABLY ADORABLE! I cannot skip the Canteen cutscenes, these cats are just so... Damn.. Cute.. I squeal in delight every time I hear their little meows! What a perfect touch to such a game!Fortunately, the quality overall of this game makes up for it's very, very minor flaws- such as the targeting system and the delayed attacks(by this I mean you have to wait until your attacks are finished before you can turn around or move in SOME cases). It would be lovely if they added some sort of attack cancelations besides the sudden dodging. Overall, however, I rate this game a 10/10. I can't wait to see how much more it progresses!"

With every update, they seem to break a portion of the community's ability to play it. From insta-crashes, to stuttering issues, to massively high CPU/GPU spikes - every update breaks something for a decent sized portion of the player base. Just go to any of the discussion threads on it and see for yourself - a lot of people have no issues, but there is definitely a lot of complaints about performance problems. Even if the game runs for you with no problems, there is no guarantee it will do so in the future. Of all of the games I've played, this is the only one that continually breaks. But if it runs, the game is a massive amount of fun. While it may be a little grind-y and the monsters repetitive, it's entertaining to get together with a few people and take on the challenge. If Capcom can fix the performance issues, this game would be a 9/10 easily. But with all the problems it has and the lack of communication from them on those issues, it's  a 0/10 because it may not even run."

Feel free to laugh at them when you do the following:Turn off TAA. (Because there is no Motion Blur.) Turning off the Volumetric Fog also really sharpens the image.Also giggle about the fact the game has mixed reviews largly due to the fact that end users turn everything to highest without understanding what the settings actually do.This was a near perfect port, Enjoy, I'll see you on the hunt ♥!Game works fine. If your controller isn't working, brute force it through the Steam controller settings to override the binary scramble.Or find a tech support Discord server and have them explain it.

Before you jump to conclusions and figure I'm just another person mad at Alatreon's Escaton Judgement, cease. You would be completely wrong.Having first disliked the game (never played MH before or heard of it) I got a friend to buy the game in April of 2019 and went on to no-life it with him for the next 3 months, I was hooked on it, and even that's an understatement. The game seemed like one of the best games I've ever played in my life (and I've played a lot of games, both ""difficult"" and casual). I could see it being praised by basically everyone, all the mainstream reviewers, even reviews on Steam were decent (obviously skipping the people mad at the game's horrible launch). Base MHW's endgame was *garbage*, I know it, you know it, we all know it. But at the time, I didn't think much of it, blinded by unreasonable adoration. There was one thing the base game was better at than the expansion, I'll get to it later though.As content for World ended and Iceborne was announced I was thrilled, absolutely thrilled. I mean, my ""favorite game"" was getting even more content! There wasn't anything not to like. When the betas came out for PS4 I tried them both and had mixed feelings, but still had an overall positive opinion of what was in them (Hoarfrost + Tigrex, at first I didn't like Velk much).Now, having been left in the dark in regards to Iceborne's PC release I needed to find something else to do, I wasn't much of a public multiplayer type of player and my friend that I previously no-lifed the game with got bored of it and uninstalled. With time my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to try the older games (all of them from Gen 2 to Gen 4, with a focus on 3U and 4U). Naturally, having started the game in generation five, filled with quality of life updates such as rolling backwards, mobile item usage etc. the older games left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.I was shocked, people played like this? Why would anyone defend this? Yet I kept playing them despite my, at the time, complaints. After some time something flipped in me, and I started appreciating these mechanics I used to question so much.Here is where ""base game was better at than the expansion"" part comes in. Something truly polarizing among the community, the ""Clutch Claw"".As I started Iceborne's story I immediately noticed the spike in difficulty, at first it was a bit overwhelming, but after that it was manageable. Something didn't seem right though - hunt times went on to be around 25-30 minutes, now obviously at first I thought ""well I'm in low tier MR equipment, it'll probably sort itself out later"", but no! At around later M2 or early M3 I started forcing myself to incorporate the claw to my style of play and voilà, hunt times went down to 15-20 at most. Now this left me in a very, very ambivalent mood. Was this good or bad? I couldn't really make up my mind at the time. Keep in mind I was a regular mantle user, kept up Temporal and Rocksteady as long as I could, usually putting them on before even engaging the monster (something I nowadays find as absolutely absurd, not just the act but mantles in general) up until I reached around MR100 and killed that god-awful Nergigante variant. Clutch Claw is the worst thing to come out of Generation 5 besides sieges and it needs to go. It ruins the flow of combat and is horribly implemented, being based on move hitboxes, creating absurdities like Kushala knocking you off its head when it does a paw swipe that doesn't even touch its head.Huge, huge improvement over base World's endgame, I mean *literally anything* would've been better than farming the same couple elder dragons over and over. I really like the system, but even that isn't without flaws. Having to level regions up and down just to get different materials is tedious at best, I get where it comes from - it's there to entice multiplayer among players but I refuse to accept it. It's great for MR levelling too, but let's be honest, it doesn't even matter in this game, as explained more in my next point:In the old games we had a lot more quests, sure we got investigations in exchange, which make farming rare parts easier than ever but this isn't the point here. I am absolutely appalled by the fact that a damn Black Dragon is doable right after Iceborne's Story, and something much, much easier (Ruiner Nergigante) is locked behind MR100, it just doesn't make sense, not in the slightest. I prefer the old way of gating certain quests (Elder Dragons and so on) behind MR thresholds (going by the example of Elder Dragons, it'd usually be MR35), however this doesn't always end up being the right direction to choose (see: locking some of the better fights in the game: Metal Raths/Brute Tigrex etc. behind MR70), I have to say the developers absolutely failed at pacing the game here, again: why is something as powerful as Furious Rajang or Raging Brachy accessible to people who just did  when they probably aren't even able to do it?Another disadvantage of the game's current pacing is that with new content updates and meta shifts, doing certain old monsters becomes absolutely useless, therefore shortening the gameplay loop.This is something I'll never accept. Having left MMOs for good after over 8 years of constant play, I wished to never ever return to mechanics I despised (as someone who always played a healer), mechanics such as: DPS checks and instant team wipes. Now, again as I've said in the beginning - I am NOT angry about Escaton Judgement, in fact I see it as a balanced attack that can be countered as long as you understand the mechanics, that doesn't mean I accept its presence in a game like Monster Hunter.Honestly despite my passionate hatred of what I and many call ""MMO mechanics"", I have even more hatred towards time-gating content, something that the brainiacs at Capcom thought was a good idea when developing World, previously all DLC quests were available upon downloading them and it was fantastic! You could play them whenever you wanted and removing that by creating ""festivals"" (renamed seasonal events that are [surprise!] also a MMO trait) was a horrible decision that is inexcusable.A classic feature of older Monster Hunter was putting together mixed sets, because armor actually mattered! This has been thrown into the dumpster in Monster Hunter World in exchange for RNG based decoration grinding, just great. You don't even need 90% of the armor in the game, cause so many skills come from decorations, this shouldn't have become the case and hopefully they get the memo in the sixth generation.We have way too many armor skills and are overall too powerful, it's like Capcom gave up on balancing in Iceborne. Why? No one knows. And don't try to say it's not true. Easiest examples to back this statement are: Aquashot Sticky Spam and Guard 5, 3x Shield Mod Spread HBG or hell even spamming ZSD on Switch Axe while clutched to a monster.The social aspect of Monster Hunter was also thrown into the dumpster, the SOS system is a HUGE step back from the old 4 player hubs and should also be reverted. No one sticks around after SOS flares, no one stays in the Gathering Hall expect when it's siege time (again, yuck). Why? Just why would they go for this approach?Overall, it's not like this game is bad, hell if you're only starting this franchise you'll probably love it like I did or maybe you won't, I don't really care. I have gone through many burn outs and many breaks, but eventually my nerves popped and I cannot recommend this game after all it's been through. It has lost a lot of its identity through westernization and hopefully the rest of the franchise doesn't end up this way."

I finally decided to give this game a try. I mean - if a whole bunch of people are hating the game for obviously unrelated and stupid reason - it must be good. And it is to be honest. I've completed main storyline and halfway through Iceborne expansion and I think I can finally write my opinion about that.But most importantly - this is a game about . It will require lots of your time, careful planning and precise execution. And with amount of content it posess - this time will easily be filled with LOTS of fun and challenging fights.If you're into slow and methodical approach against overwhelming odds - then welcome aboard, Hunter.

I was incredibly wary of it given all the things I heard about grinding as I am generally very anti-grind. Despite these reservations, I just could not hold back and had to buy to the game. And I am so, so glad that I did. It has been an utterly superb experience. I've sunk almost 60 hours into it by the point of this review and I'm still jonesing for more. It is rare for me to be able to get 20-30 hours out of a game before I get bored. I've still got so much more content to go and I'm really excited to see it still.The gameplay is really fantastic. It is weird at first, especially the combat can seem clunky, but it really isn't once you start to figure it out and learn the ins and outs of fighting the monsters. It becomes second nature and just a great deal of fun. And with there being so many play styles due to the varied nature of weapons in the game, you've got a lot mileage with regards to finding a weapon style you'll like and also being able to just vary things up if you get bored with any specific weapon style. Outside of the weapons, there's so much you can do to use the environment to your benefit with fighting the monsters. There's just an impressive amount of interaction that lets you really control the flow of combat if you just take the time to study the world around you and use it.Visually, the game is stunning. The characters are amazing. I just cannot get over how good they look. The world itself is nice, colorful, and visually intriguing. There's a lot going on around you and it really lends a sense of a living, breathing world.The story is fairly barebones, but it is delivered well enough and it is charming in its own regard. I wouldn't go into this expecting some grandiose plot that will hook you. It just mainly serves to pull you into hunts. Despite that, it is just a very charming little world they've crafted here. I like the Monster Hunter world. It is almost comforting in some ways. I deal with a lot of depression and anxiety and the game helps to put my mind at ease when I can't do it on my own.Ultimately, I love this game and I think everyone should experience it. It is very much worth a shot!"

It's quite an action packed series and this game lives up to it for sure. You can expect big monsters, big weapons and quite the challenge. This game is the newest in the series and is getting a new dlc very soon. This dlc will add a bunch of things to the main game and from what I've seen on ps4, is really darn good. So there will probably a lot of you wondering if you should get into this series. And I'll tell you right away, that if you like action games and monsters. Then this is the game for you, but in world, the developers also added a whole world for you to explore. There are several maps where you can discover different ecosystems, from small creatures to the big ones you're actually fighting. This game keeps you excited throughout the game and made me scream in joy when beating some of the bosses. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to get into the series as well, this is probably the easiest game to get into from the series since it's more user friendly than the old games. Now I'll rate some aspects of the game.Graphics, the graphics in this game are absolutely stunning. (10/10)Story, I don't think the story is anything to brag about, it could've been a lot better. (7/10)Gameplay, there are tons of weapons to choose from and monsters to fight. (10/10)Maps, the maps in this game are quite complex and detailed but don't go expecting too many maps. (9/10)Music, the music in this game is really good, also the in-game sounds really work well to improve the overall experience of the game. (10/10)Bugs, haven't had any issues myself except for bad connection with friends a few times.Duration, the duration of the game really just depends on you. I got about 140 hours out of the base game, but some of my friends got way more (or way less.) Overall this is an easy 9/10 for me. Especially with the new dlc coming up, this game and the dlc will be 60$ together which is a really good price for what you're getting. There is one thing you should take note of however. You have to grind a lot, like a lot. These boss fights are really hard for the average person, I managed myself but if you're having trouble you'll have to grind to get new gear. But you shouldn't have to worry about grinding too much in the main story, however post-game you'll have to start doing some grinding. I hope this review helped you out on your purchase, if you have any questions or want to share with me what you thought about the game, then feel free to dm me about it!"

The Denuvo DRM means that even third party patches won't be able to fix my video issues for a while.Launched it today eager to play with friends, and although it says it supports 3440x1440 it pillarboxes it with giant black bars at both sides. 3440x1440 fullscreen with the latest driver on a 1080 lags even with these huge black boxes it doesn't need to render. [Edit: See footnote for graphic lag.]Gamepad support is about what you'd expect from five years ago. If you have an Xbox controller you can play as long as you don't want to remap keys. Check the steam forum for issues people have with steam controllers.I couldn't even quit the game during tutorial or hunt because I guess it was designed so that you could hit the playstation button to exit? I had to end task with Task Manager.Wait until it's been patched, I'll update the review when I can play. Games that don't support gamepads or 21:9 should have warning labels on steam just like games that don't work in Windows 10.Edit 1: The default for the 1080 is ""highest"" graphics settings, which I found to drop below 60 frames during expedition. Reducing the Volumetric Lighting quality to medium fixed that. I didn't have to reduce any other setting from highest."

Then we released it without the dlc updates available on consoles not to mention the servers and terrible optimization.Capcom manager: no problem I have a plan to fix this. Let's use the money from PC sales to make events exclusive to consoles.Capcom staff: FACEPALMSEDIT:Seems like a few fanyboys have misunderstood the context of my review.So to avoid any further misunderstandings let me explain why I've given it a DO NOT recommend.Firstly let me say that i am a big fan of the game and the series and it's not my first monster hunter game but i'm not going to ignore some of the issues I faced during my 300 hour playtime.If you played the game at launch then you will be familiar with the error code 50382-MW1. Want to play with a friend? sorry get disconnected.Want to help a someone through SOS?nope sorry MW1 incoming, want to play alone? guess what? it's your buddy 50382-MW1.Such a big issue should've been fixed within the first week itself but it took Capcom 3-4 weeks to patch this.This is the main reason why the game has lot of negetive reviews.That said,they HAVE FIXED the issue and there's no complaints on my side regarding server issues anymore. So if you're considerding not buying the game cause of server issues then let me tell you they HAVE BEEN resolved.On the same note you can ignore the reviews complainting about mouse issues as well.They HAVE also been RESOLVED.So if you like the base game(killing the sht out of monsters) and were on the fence of buying cause of these 2 issues.Then you can safely jump over the damn fence and get game already cause the issues have been resolved.So why did i give this game a thumbs down??Here are my reasons1.can't join quest until host has watched cutscene(WTF??)2.Horrible keyboard+mouse optimization.3.Graphics performance. It's looks worse than Witcher3 and yet does not run as well as the Witcher3 which was a 2015 game btw.4.Events and updates not included. There is no reason why they shouldn't have included all the patches of consoles in the PC version upon release.I don't believe that the developers should go without criticism when they take 7 months to ""optimize"" a game and yet release it with such glaring issues.If no one complainted about the servers then we probably wouldn't have got a patch in 3 weeks(which itself is a long time).Similary I believe if no one complaints about the events and additional content they are going to take longer than we hope to see new content being released.Once we start catching up to the consoles.I will change my review to recommended."

Now if you only have a PC and really wanna play this, me and a few others did some research and found out a few things you can do to help with the problems their settings are having, that should last you until they actually fix it.You need to completely turn off all of the following settings:~V-Sync~Volume Rendering Quality~Anti-Aliasing~Z-PrepassYou also need to do the following:~Play in ""Borderless Window"" instead of full screen.~Set your Frame Rate to ""60"".When I found these fixes out, I was then able to play on the highest settings (minus the above obviously) and have things like music, Twitch, Discord, Pandora, or YouTube running in the background.Now the game itself is amazing.

After that, there's hundreds of hours of fun in getting better equipment, honing your skills and mastering your weapons, but even if you end up only playing 20 hours, I still think you'll leave the game satisfied.I would recommend getting some friends together, single player is more of an acquired taste.

If you have friends to play with, it'll be even better as the co-op is a great experience here. PS: Some people might claim this game has generic MMO roles (tank/healer/dps) but that's a huge lie, the focus of the game is improving the hunting by hitting and not getting hit, these so called ""support builds"" only make the hunt take longer and it's suggested to be kicked as soon you see them (a real HH user will play monster's requiem while smashing its head instead of hiding on a corner so pay attention). Aside to that simple fact, play with whatever you want and have fun :^)"

I've heard about the previous installment being good, but I couldn't be bothered to play it. Then Monster Hunter: World came out for the PC / consoles, and because I owned a PC, I figured why not try it? So after giving it a good 40+ hours and getting far into the game, I can safely say .... There's a lot to tackle in this review, so i'll try to narrow everything down to the best of my abilities.This game offers a lot, and I mean a LOT of variety when it comes to your weapons and armor. To start things off, the game allows you to pick  off the bat, each with their own trees. Like, it's one thing to have so many unique weapons, but each weapon having multiple trees based on the monsters you've harvested? Now that's awesome. There are so, so, so many different looking weapons and armors depending on the monsters you've hunted down and the materials you have collected. As the game goes on, you unlock an altnerative look to armors so now you have 2 choices or more among the monsters you've slain. Each weapon path causes it to change form, and the more you dive into that path, the more your weapon begins to change appearance. I can't even explain how many choices you have, it's enourmous.The world map is quite big, and each area can take you awhile to fully explore. Even then, there's other beasts and monsters roaming about, not just your target. Hunting down a monster can go on for a bit, tracking down it's footprints, gathering it's scales / feathers / ect. and finding out where it lives. Once you find it, all bets are off when the fight happens. It can go smooth or chaotic at any moment, and other monsters can intrude on your fight what's called a ""turf war"". Really fun to watch, and rather exciting. You can do multiple combos with your weapon to either weaken the monster, break apart it's armor plating, cut it's tail off, assist your allies by slowing it down, tank the hits with your shield- the capablitlies you're offered is again, impressive. So much thought was put into how to take down these monsters, hell they give you over 99 items to use, all with a useful purpose in helping you take these baddies down. Oh and you don't have to always kill them, capturing them can not only help you understand their weaknesses, but you gain more loot as a result.I'm happy to say, there's a lot of them. Each unique, stands out, and will definitely take time fighting. Even though some monsters look 'identical', they will have different animations or have abilities that are different from their counter part. You can read up on how they behave, see how they interact with the world around them, even watch some monsters eating other monsters. The beauty of this game is, you really feel like you're hunting a beast, not a demonic force that's over the top. It's just an animal that's wild, and you're putting your skills as a Hunter to the test. I love the way each enemy has a particular weakness and how they act when on the verge of death (they limp away, cry, try to fly away or do things that feels immersive). Gotta hand it, there's way more monsters than I imagined there to be, and it made me satisfied.A few big issues revolve mostly around online co-op. Day 1 was really bad, people dropping from servers constantly while during mid fight, people would disconnect. While patches have made the game's servers more stable, I sometimes run into this problem. Another issue that irritates me, is that you must see particular cut scenes to co-op with people. You can't just start a mission, you must activate a cutscene before you join / play with someone. Only people who have seen it all can join anyone's server, but if you haven't seen a particular cut scene, you can't have co-op until you've seen it. Then there's the fact you have zero reason to make another character. Because you have access to all the weapons / paths / armors / ect, you have no reason to try making another character and because you CAN'T skip cutscenes, it would be a huge pain to watch them all over again. So it's best to stick with one character. Another problem is certain bosses can one shot you, even if you're blocking or dodging. The hit boxes aren't always great so you will find yourself getting ripped off at times. The difficult curve can spike depending on the bosse's combos and how well equipped you are.My review is pretty vague and I didn't get to cover everything I wanted. But, there's so much to do in this game. Gathering materials, helping your base research species to improve your armor / gear, seeing how beautiful the world is, astounishing fights and epic fights all about, even the grinding is fun because you're hunting down Monsters without the game ever feeling dull. I haven't gotten bored or tired once, so that's something. Character creation is alright, and the lip syncing is meh since it's a Japanese game translated / subbed into English, but if you can look past that- it's no big deal. Monster Hunter: World has a lot going for it, and I love this game. I will continue playing it because each bounty / mission gives you a lot to do, and co-op just makes it all the more alive. Game is a solid 8.5 / 10 for me, 8 sometimes when the game's server gives me a hard time. But it's worth buying."

Lots and lots of improvements have been made on a lot of fronts that I have noticed in my 100+ hours.  There is a lot of quality-of-life stuff added here that just hasn't been a part of any other installment prior --- but don't let that trick you.  There is a rabbithole of complex things for a newcomer to navigate.You no longer have to load between zones.You no longer lose money when you faint.You no longer have to build whetstones (am I remembering this right?).  Crucial items seem more plentiful.Farming the same monster over and over again is not as necessary as before.New Hammer spin attack is great.  New environmental ""wall run"" areas are great.Farcaster is nearly unnecessary since you can just quick travel back to camp (as long as you aren't under attack).You can eat once out in the field.You can resupply once out in the field.Elemental resistances for meals have been lumped into 1 category (less meal variety needed).Cat gadgets are seemingly much more helpful and interesting.You can upgrade and forge equipment while others are able to ready up for a mission.Animations are true to older monsters revisiting.  You'll know what to do when you see that Rathalos about to do some signature moves.The game looks incredible.The new locations are more fantastical.Optional Quests sometimes give really useful stuff.Health boosts and attack boosts stack with food.You can cultivate things you have zero of.There are plenty of missions to drop in on if you have no friends available at the time.I've seen 3 monsters in one location before with 4 players simultaneous and it was great chaos.The new chef is amazing.Of course, I have my gripes, too, but they're small and I forget I even have them.  Learning how the lobby and flow work is awkward.  There is very little reason to go to the gathering hub, which used to be the only way for someone to connect.  The early game is more annoying than late because you and your friends have to be caught up on cinematics to do the main progression.  Once you have a number of those missions under your belt and it isn't so pressing you can do a lot of investigations and optionals, though.  I really dislike that there's no bell sound when someone else posts a quest.  It used to be very helpful. If you're going to post a quest and someone else posts a quest, you won't know until you back out of that menu.  Mounting seems to have been made much harder after the first mount, which sort of nullifies the Insect Glaive to a degree.  Monsters resist certain statuses exponentially each time a new player is added - if you want to use a hammer it is absolutely required to place Slugger (x3) in your gear if you are wanting to KO the monster more than once per fight.  In my 100+ hours I have only gotten 1 attack gem, and haven't seen a single Tenderizer or a few others I have been farming for.  Those gems basically feel like they were removed from the game they are so amazingly rare.Unskippable cutscenes are a real drag - especially if you want to make a 2nd hunter.Kirin seems a lot more annoyingly tuned than the original Kirin, and is incredibly chumped by ranged.  Kirin just feels kind of in a bad state.  Thankfully I only have to fight it at key points.  And the damn Bazel.  Bazel has shown up in 99% of my missions for the last couple days no matter what area I've gone to.  That just seems excessive and takes away the allure.The majority of my run has been great, and the patch has fixed 100% of my connection issues.Bring back Zamtrios.  Bring back Zinogre!  WOOOoooooooo love it, keep it up, Capcom."

Little did I know at the time, that I would gradually get hooked.At first I felt overwhelmed, because not only is this my first time getting into the series, there is a lot to learn as the start of the game throws a lot of information at you. Of course it's not all intruding, so you can play the game at your own pace. The learning curve is quite huge (especially for new players to the series), sooner or later you'll probably realise that there just isn't enough explanations for everything and one may find themself looking up guides and videos frequently. There are plenty of weapons to choose from (14 in fact) and they all have their own unique combat style/techniques. Monster variety for you to slay/capture is also plentiful, so you'll always have something to pick a fight with. Playing the game solo is pretty fun, but I think battling monsters with other people brings out a lot more excitement, so if you have friends, do invite them to tag along! is a great game, especially if you enjoy JRPGs and 4 player co-ops. And if you do, in due time, you will find yourself logging dozens if not hundreds of hours into this wonderful piece of work."

The massive amounts of tutorials and ""tell, don't show"" can get very overwhelming. Many times in the start, I wanted the game to show me what to do, instead of just telling me. That way you'd learn faster. Learn by doing, after all. However, when you get through most of the tutorial (The story, really), you're greeted with a world where you've unlocked most things and you're free to to everything you want, and it's magnificent. After the story is where the game really shines. Harder versions (Tempered/Arch tempered) of monsters unlock, from which you get better rewards, to get better gear, to kill even harder monsters even faster. The grind/farmfest in this game is real, but it's done in such a wonderfully rewarding way. Killing big monsters with your oversized anime swords or other ridiculous weapons feels good. Hitting the monster on its feet until it dies has never been more exciting.From a gameplay perspective, the game is amazing, and it's the most fun I've had with video games in years.From a technical perspective, the game is a mess.

They've clearly not done anything at all to optimize this game for other OS, as my friend went from 40 FPS and stutters to flawless 60 FPS after upgrading.The mouse controls like an emulated joystick, the keyboard controls for ranged weapons are.. Questionable, and the multiplayer errors are frustrating to say the last.But through all this garbage lies a fantastic game that you will kick yourself for not trying. They're working on the mouse controls, the keyboard controls can be rebound, the multiplayer got a patch just yesterday, and they're gonna keep fixing it. It's much better now than it was. Not perfect, mind you, but way, way better.Overall, the game is amazingly fun, and you'll do yourself a favor by trying it out. Don't let the reviewbombing scare you off, as the main issue has been fixed.Also you can dress up your cat and it's the best thing about this game.***EDIT:  fps drops has been fixed since I posted this review."

Multiplayer is super weird and I wish it was different but there's almost nothing else to complain about which is great. Fair warning if you're new though, the guardian armor that the game lets you pick at the start is SUPER strong and wearing it is basically like activating god mode, so I recommend not wearing it unless you really need it because it makes the early and mid game way too easy."

If you're looking for a challenging and exciting hunting experience with a variety of unique monsters to track and take down, then this is the game for you. The maps are beautifully crafted with a refreshing variety, from lush jungles to creepy monster graveyards, and you can even catch and keep all sorts of creatures as pets. The graphics are stunning, making this the best-looking Monster Hunter game yet, and the combat is well-balanced, making it accessible to players of all skill levels.However, if you're looking for a co-op game or a lot of new and different monsters to hunt, then you might be disappointed. The multiplayer aspect of the game is lacking, and it feels like you're fighting the same monster over and over again with only slight variations. The story also feels weak and outdated, and the need to constantly eat to boost your character can be a nuisance.In conclusion, Monster Hunter World is a great game for fans of the series and for those who enjoy hunting challenges. The maps, graphics, and balanced combat make it a must-try for any fan of the genre, but be warned that it might not be for everyone. Just don't forget to eat properly and"

Not too many microtransactions, not pay to win, just a good looter with fun combat. People like it, others have their complaints. The monster roster was lacking, it was too well optimized, the endgame was too rng, there should be more layered armor, were some of the biggest. Well, and expansion is announced, people were hyped (I sure was). There really isn’t a good notion around the term expansion, with tons being released with very little content, and not actually expanding on the game. Well these devs went all out. They 100% have been listening to the community from the beginning. They added more monster variety, improved the endgame, slowly but surely, made every single piece of armor and every weapon a layerable piece, and basically doubled the size of the game for only $40. It wasn’t too optimized at release, but it surely improved and the rng decorations still existed, but it doesn’t seem as tedious, at least to me. I think this game’s biggest strength, besides being fun, especially with friends, is the amazing dev team. Listening to the community and genuinely providing the player with meaningful content. In today's gaming industry I do believe this to be diamond in the rough. If you like looters, making builds, fun melee and gun combat, rpgs, or just want to pick up a game to play with your friends, I do believe this to be a good purchase. With 100s and even 1000s of hours of fun, there is no mistake to be made. While getting into it at first can look daunting, once you get into the flow, trust me it gets good. I do recommend you play this with someone who has played before or watch a couple videos on the game because unless you like reading the little tutorials, it's gonna be a minute before you truly understand the game.  If you want to just get a taste, you can’t really go wrong with just buying the base game. If you think you are gonna like or really want to get invested, you should buy the master edition, which includes the base game and the expansion. All the other versions you can ignore unless you want some small cosmetic items. You sadly are not able to skip story cutscenes, which makes playing this game throught with friends pretty hard. Another issue is the often occurring disconnections. There are some fixes and how often you disconnect seems to be linked to your processor and how far you are from the host of the online session because this game is peer-2-peer. Besides this, there are minor issues, but nothing that really bothers me personally, just know that this game does get a little hard later, be ready.  Yes, just look at my hours."

Having played this on both PS4 and now PC (and having put hundreds of hours into the portable games), I have been very pleased with the quality of this console port... with a few footnotes. The first few weeks were chock full of connection errors that made it difficult-to-impossible to play with others. Capcom pretty quickly acknowledged the problem, and it took a little time for them to fix it, but fix it they did. Although this game is completely soloable, playing with friends is hands-down some of the most fun gaming I've ever had. I realize that, as with any big PC release, there have been a wide range of experiences with actual performance. For me (with my newish CPU and oldish video card), it runs wonderfully, never straying from a rock-solid 60fps. The only change I made was to drop fog down a notch or two, which (subjectively) looks a lot better anyway unless you like a LOT of fog.This is a game designed around controller play, and I'm finding my experience with a Steam Controller to be excellent. Gyro toggle on left trigger soft pull makes kinsect/bow/bowgun aiming SO nice and fluid. Mouse-like joystick for the right touchpad feels very smooth and natural. Keyboard controls, on the other hand, are... well, they're bad. The mouse emulation feels so ""wrong"" that I cannot play it more than a few minutes without getting severley nauseated. I hope for KB/M loyalists that Capcom improves this soon.As for the game itself... well, if you've played any Monster Hunter games, you (mostly) know what you're getting into. World doesn't have the breadth of content of the portable games (yet), but I feel its quality-of-life upgrades, and the whole ""World"" bit (living zones full of endemic life and environmental tools/hazards), more than make up for this. If you have never played a MH game, I'm not sure how to explain it with any brevity because this franchise is really quite unlike anything else out there except for that new kid on the block, Dauntless, which definitely takes queues from MH but feels so shallow in comparison. My gripes are relatively minor and mostly aimed at the questionable design decisions Capcom sometimes makes. The Gathering Hub is a nice place to prep with your group, but since it doesn't have access to all facilities, I hardly ever go there. Session IDs feel like a kludgey way to handle private groups. Steam Group integration is completely pointless right now.I personally feel like Capcom did an amazing job making a modernized, full-sized version of this long-running, mostly portable franchise. It's far from being just an upscaled copy of the earlier games, too. They obviously put a lot of thought and effort into making a game with potential for mass appeal that still feels very true to the franchise. It WILL NOT be for everybody, though. Monster hunter games are very challenging and take some dedication, but when things start to click, it's a uniquely satisfying gaming experience, especially when you can play with friends."

It feels like I can actually play the game without dropping to 5fps everytime, It's like jesus blessed my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for once in my lifetime, but I won't make a biased as ♥♥♥♥ review because I played this game like a console pleb.First things first, when i saw the port at first I thought I was playing Umbrella Corps. It's a bad port, especially if we wait for 8 months to get a proper PC release and it feels like they pulled this port from their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This causes literally everyone that doesn't have a Titan X SLI + Intel i9 Extreme edition to literally get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by changing every single setting until you have a proper smooth fps experience and good graphics. Which is in my opinion unacceptable. It just shows how lazy Capcom is and how much they obviously care about their players and upholding the name of an extremely popular Nintendo franchise. All the issues I have with this game is just mainly lazy optimization and a literal copy of the Umbrella Corps Port that Capcom made. The game itself however is amazing, I played it on console like I said before and it has been enjoyable as hell. And for me playing this game finally at a smooth framerate is like heaven to me. It is enjoyable and the hunting is really fun. I really can't wait for Nergigante to spread my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wide open and just penetrate me with his T H I C C horns. The diversity in weapons gives every type of player a chance to enjoy hunting some big plebs. The storyline is.... well lame af tbh, I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about the story really. Is the game good? Yes Is the game well optimized and has a good port? Lol no. The decision is up to you whether you buy this game or not (although 60 dosh for a crappy port and optimization is kinda a huge meh factor right there) If you are someone that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about every port and optimization and that 100-120 fps is not enough for you then don't bother with this game, If you are someone that just wants to play a game where a Nergigante literally assrapes you then be my guest.

With the live service portion of this game's lifespan essentially over, I can confidently say that MHW is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have ever had the pleasure of having. While the story and characters are fairly bare bones, the actual monsters in this game completely make up for that lack of personality and then some. Complex move sets and masterfully composed theme music make each the monsters feel unique, wild, and alive, making subsequent hunts even more entertaining against more challenging or even aesthetically pleasing monsters, depending on one's taste. On top of that, there are 14 weapons types in this game, all with unique niches and move sets. Mastering your favorite weapons' mechanics, as well as understanding the myriad of ways in which those mechanics can interact with all of the monsters, is consistently challenging and rewarding as the game's difficulty naturally increases over time. The only criticism I can offer is that this game is not one you can take lightly or dip your toes in from time to time so to speak.

A number of players set out to track, kill or capture, and  use the rewards to make new gear.One thing that is very unusual with the game is that it's open-ended. Albeit the main quests have a definite end, there is no real end to the game. It just keeps going, which is very unusual indeed. Ok let's deal with the bad...1. The control system is horrible. Basically they haven't changed anything from the console, so you get ridiculous skill menus, and just insane key sequences using as few keys as possible rather than making full use of the PC keyboard.  And everything is just plain stupid.  There is no logic in the control structure so <esc>, for example, can mean different things at different times. Not only is this very confusing but it can also end up in you getting lost in menus where you have to stop and read the screen to get out, rather than just hit <esc> a few times like in other games. 2. Optimisation? There isn't any of that in here! It sure do run slowly. I have a pretty good PC yet I don't think I have seen it hit walking pace yet, let alone running. With a 1440 screen you really need a top-end graphics card.3. Gear is confused. Even after hundreds of hours of play I still don't understand what philosophy has been adopted by the developers towards gear. Often new gear becomes available but there is no clear reason why you would want it. Gear just has too many attributes that have been seemingly randomly applied. Often you find that items have one or two strengths but a large number of other attributes that are all over the place, and that makes choosing very difficult. For example, bowguns have many different ammo types and each ammo type  has different fire rate, recoil, magazine size, reload time. All these values are different for each different gun. To make matters worse each gun supports a different list of ammo types. Not only that but all these attributes can be modified, but the degree to which they can be modified is different  for each gun. This makes for a bewilderingly complex system. There should really cut down on the complexity by limiting the variation. Each gun should have a set of basic attributes which are added to by specialist guns rather than varying everything all over the place without purpose. 4. The character feels sluggish and cumbersome, especially playing solo. Most of the time you are fighting the game not the monster. This is not even slightly a PC game. It is a console game. The port is atrocious. They have completely failed to take advantage of the  PC. That's fine if you like console games but I hate them so this review is doomed from the start!  Having said that, it is still a good game.  If you are a console player then yes, sure, buy it, but this isn't a review for consoles and I am afraid on the PC, Monster Hunter disappoints.The good thing about this game is that it's insanely fun and addictive! Why? I really don't know. It just is.  It's a very unique game, that undoubtedly has a lot going for it. For a non-mmo it has a lot of gameplay for the money, and it sure is very addictive. It also seems to be well balanced in that it's not too hard nor is it too easy. Honestly, I am on the fence here as to whether to give it a thumbs up or thumbs down. I think I have to give it a thumbs up, but for many people it will undoubtedly be a thumbs down. I wish I could give it ""Mixed""."

Oh joy how long I've waited for this game to reach the savage frontier known as the PC market. Year after year, i had to suffer through not absorbing hundreds of videos, news articles and guides giving this game high praise and showcasing many of it's features to instead go into it blind in order to write the most neutral review possible as someone whose completely unfamiliar with the monster hunter world universe as a whole - AND someone who haven't had any of it be spoiled.Unfortunately after nearly a year of delay, this game has now arrived on the PC in the most atrocious, technological train-wreck of a broken state I've seen for a game in the last 5 years.. And that's saying a lot since I'm active on Steam. To not make the incoming wall of text be too much of a discouragement, I'm gonna segment and number my current gripes with this game below.To put it bluntly, this game needs another 1-2 years of polish and development before it's anywhere near ready for the PC market. The servers/connectivity system is as of right now (still ongoing since release) a complete, spam-disconnecting clusterf*ck which you've probably noticed if you had even a single friend play this game as they will be CONSTANTLY disconnected and then immediately reconnected, over and over and over and over again. This was a reported issue on the PS4 but has since then been patched.. Meaning, the PC version is literally an outdated pile of cràp. To prove it, here's a picture of a chat-window after 30 minutes of me playing this:Unfortunately, the technicalities doesn't end there. Ontop of being dysfunctional, the game also completely lacks even the most basic (and arguably most important) options, such as being able to disable mouse acceleration (currently a boot-legged autoaim clunky console garbage system) while most graphic-options simply aren't even working right now, like snazzier textures refusing to load or, hilariously enough, people being completely unable to change keybinds on their controllers despite this being a console port with console controller buttons being littered across most menus & the UI for extra salt in the wound.Perhaps the worst part of anything is the fact that, and I shìt you not now:YOU CANNOT CO-OP THE MAIN STORY QUEST due to whoever's joining getting this rètarded message:REMOVE. IT. NOW.You may or may not be aware of this already but this game is infested with a particularly dogshìt ""Digital Rights Management"" software called Denuvo. It is a piece of DRM that has been bought for an excess of 100.000€+ from the game's budget (that could have been spent on sorely needed polish) that the game developers then had to spend tons of time, energy, effort and manpower to integrate it into their game. Much like a tick, Denuvo requires itself to be injected into and around another DRM in order to try and protect it for 'slightly' longer while also requiring an equal amount of time and effort to removed later.. If ever.All worth it to keep those naughty pirates at bay though, right?.. Well..This is a displacement study commissioned by the European Union for 360,000€ that statistically shows (and proves) that Online Piracy (video games included) have no negative affect on sales.. If anything, they have a positive effect on them through word-of-mouth and free advertising. Meaning: DRM has been proven now, almost a year ago to be pieces of completely unnecessary shìt that does nothing but punish the paying customers through decreased performance, inconvenience, breach of privacy, increased download & install times and more. When DRM's like Denuvo was first coined, they were spewing out mounds of garbage like, and I quote: ""OH SHÌT VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY, LIKE 95% OF PEOPLE USING UR PRODUCTS ARE PIRATES, YO!!! BUY AND INSTALL OUR DRM!!!!"" with no studies, research or scientific bases whatsoever.Denuvo's release was 4 years ago and since then, gullible producers (and developers) like CAPCOM continue to gobble these lies up head to toe and regurgitating it back out for another eating on a daily basis and today, we are still suffering through this shìt for no excusable reason whatsoever and their greedy behavior only seems to be getting worse that they are now also selling day-1-DLC for a full-priced, console ported game. This shìt has to stop.For more info on Denuvo, visit: To put it bluntly many pure design systems in this game like the online portion for this game are shìt-caked, putrid, convoluted f*cking piles of garbage and they don't have to be. Here's a sub-list of some pet peeves I've currently got with the game.a) Online sucks through and through. Restructure it ASAP.b) The control scheme is REALLY confusing and convoluted. 3-4 buttons for sheating a weapon, what the actual f*ck?c) Wheatstones for... Sharpening hammers, that are literal huge round chunks of iron or bone. Get off the bottle, CAPCOM or more preferrably, remove the stupid concept of weapon durability alltogether or replace it whereas you can sharpen weapons to do more damage instead of having 95% of their efficiency flat-line in a game that's already riddled with ginormous HP pool mobs.d) Hitboxes can be 'REALLY' lynchy depending on the monsters you're going up against with X/Y weapons.. And this is coming from someone who poured hundreds of hours into Dragon's Dogma & Dark Souls.e) Currently, the character creator lets you make things like this:  and while hilarious for some, it smashes the immersion for others.f) Despite me having all the options to the lowest possible and my specs being in-line, this game inexplicitly tends to freeze up for 2-4 seconds randomly (even in SP, probably work of Denuvo) while also randomly making my GPU run incredibly hot for no reason.g) The lock-on system REALLY sucks a big one once there's more than 1 monster on the screen as it will begin to wildly fling in-between everything it can get it's crosshair on from the smallest of twitches.h) Forced motion blur? Are you f*cking kidding me right now, CAPCOM?i) Monsters (especially flying ones) simply leaving the locale mid-fight and otherwise. What kind of cocaine addicted, head-bashed developer pitched this at a meeting and everyone said: ""Hmm.. Someone fighting a monster for 30+ minutes and then having said monster leave mid-fight with no loot and rewards to speak of in the exploration mode that advertises a 'Take your time' mindset?.. Put it in!""j) Lack on cause & effect when breaking monster parts. If i spend an exhorbent amount of effort, grit, time, weapon durability and general pain & suffering to break a specific part of a monster, say, wing(s) or leg(s), the last thing I want is for said monster to use that broken bodypart like nothing has happened to it. STOP (or SEVERELY cripple) A LIMB'S FUNCTION IF IT'S BROKEN. Don't leave it as some incredibly shìtty, low-effort whack-a-mole stun spot.k) Multiplayer scaling is completely defunct. If someone joins your game (or you join someone else) and either one of you gets disconnected and put into separate matches, the monster scaling will stay the same as if it was for example, a 4 player game, giving mobs basically 600% health permanently. Limb/tail breaking is also made borderline impossible which means that if you need a tail or X part from a creature, you're basically forced to do it in SP.I could go on, but Steam needs to buy my day-1 review DLC first while i splooge this out way too early."

They hold your hand a little bit by giving you a high grade beginners armour but overall if you're new and have friends that play already or you just want to get into the multiplayer a little quicker it's a big help. The game offers a lot of free content at the start, old event content and care packs you can download are great. The multiplayer isn't dead and I think even after Rise releases there will be people still playing this. I know I will. This is one of them games where it can be fun with or without friends, I haven't met a player in MH world that was mean or tried to ruin a hunt. Maybe i've been insanely lucky to not meet those people in 197 hours of playing, who knows.I honestly think that the Iceborne DLC is required because it adds some great quality of life improvements to combat (clutch claw, extra combat moves) that the game needed. I think that would be my only criticism of the game overall, that the DLC is needed for you to really open up the late game enjoyment.The other cosmetic DLC isn't required at all to enjoy the game, unless you want to change the handlers appearance. Even then the Handlers appearance changes depending on which seasonal event is happening so you never need them.All in all Capcom did right with the game, they recently removed the copy protection bloatware completely, all the event missions are live at all times so you don't have to wait to hunt specific late game monsters, they give you a lot of free stuff at the start to help you out. Good work Capcom. This game shows that FOMO isn't needed to keep a player base active."

The New World has so much to offer.Gameplay is broader than you'd first expect if you've never played a Monster Hunter game before, I only played a bit of Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii prior to this, but this game captivated me so much more as the world feels more alive and I can play with my friends.Your main hub is Astera, a nice little village assembled from wreckages of ships from the Hunter fleets, here you Craft, Buy and Upgrade equipment and take Bounties and Quests before going out into the wild.Gameplay in the wild is comprised of Hunting Monsters, Dead or Alive. The Skill, Speed and Technique needed for this, depends on the kind of weapon you select, I advice testing most of them out before settling on one. Don't disregard the Hunting Horn though! I use the Kinsect Glaive and Dual Blades myself, as I like fast paced Hack & Slash gameplay. The Hunting Horn is an underestimated support weapon though it requires some tweaking to use solo, but it's more fun to play with friends either way~Other than that, there's Gathering and Exploration you can do in the wild, mining materials for armor and weapons, gathering plants for potions and buffs and even find new camp locations so you can pick different spawn locations when on a Hunt! The game is well optimized and run at a smooth +45 FPS (Not much, but good enough for me.) on my old 2GB GTX 750 Ti that's like... 8 years old by now or something. Overall, I highly recommend this game."

I played nearly 400 hours Freedom Unite and I honestly loved its difficulty and hardcore feeling to it as well as its huge number of monsters, maps and weapons from the previous titles and new ones and the addition of the G rank... it was a blast! let me tell you.Since then I've been trying to get my hands on a Monster Hunter title but couldn't decide until I saw this as the perfect chance to revisit the franchise. Now the big question is , did it live up to its expectations? Well, yeah.. but I can't wait for more!Environments in this title are probably its strongest point, each map really gives you this sense of immersion to it thanks to the different ambiental sounds and different little kinds of animal and fauna that mimic and portray nature to a higher level than previous titles, even though Monster Hunter games have always been famous for making the most out of the platform that they are released on. It's a shame that we only have 6 maps to enjoy though, being my favourite the ancient forest.Speaking of weapons, I love that they included all different types of weapons this time around but I could've hoped for a better and wider weapon design, weapons feel the same from each other more in this title than any other and there are really not that many. On the other hand, combat is awesome and feels fluid and great, which is something really important considering we are in for some hunt.Monsters in this title feel real and physics are fine, (as much as you could hope for a pretty old engine). They brought back to the series main important monsters like Rathalos and Diablos and Elders like Kushala and Teostra and added new ones too, they also interact with each other which feels as a nice addition. Despite monster´s improved AI, I can't help but feel that they wasted the chance to present us the new generation of monsters in a bigger way, with a wider arange of new additions, and that feels a little bit lackluster I'm not gonna lie, I really was hoping for much more original monsters.Quests are fine in this title and they add new events from time to time but Astera (the village) could've had a better farm and much more new things, it feels that there are not much things to do in Astera.The difficuly in this title is average, it's not hardcore like previous Monster Hunters, you can play and end this game without having too many problems and the hardcore content this time around is fighting the same monsters in its strong form (tempered) which doesn´t feel all that hard to be honest. In Monster Hunter Freedom Unite you had to struggle just to get resources and Monsters really felt tanky and strong, you could fail missions because the monster didn´t die. This time around, all monsters die within 10-20 minutes, even tempered ones, and you won´t have trouble farming for materials.Summing up, Monster Hunter World is a great title that will give you around 70 hours of fun just for completing its many different quests, (some are occult and will give you new equipment). The end game is basically fighting the same monsters in its strongest form (tempered), which gives you gems that you can use for further upgrading your equipment if you wish. If you have friends to play with, the game gets even more fun and don't you think that this title is bad because of its negative reviews since they are mostly from network issues in its first couple of weeks which are solved now.I can't end this review without thinking this title definitely had potential to be bigger, Capcom didn't go all out, but after seeing that the title did great on sells I hope the next one has more of everything: more maps, more weapons, G rank (more difficulty please, I know you want to aim for all people but the difficulty is the main charm of Monster Hunter games), better village, more quests and more duration. This title could've been a 9 out of 10 but stays at an 8 for its lack of content compared to previous titles (8.5 if you dont compare it with other MH games). It´s still 70 hours of fun and an experience that you won't regret.. but this is Monster Hunter, we are talking about high end game content titles.UPDATE// Kulve Taroth mission is a nice and original siege of 16 people on separate groups of 4 in the same session, which is brilliant since it makes you join a session with other players and have some fun together. It also adds quite a few weapons just like deviljho and lunastra, which were monsters added later for free.Behemoth is a TRUE challenge and I´m really looking forward to G rank. Keep it up Capcom!"

For starters, the fps in this game can TANK from a stable 80 to 20 or under in some scenes (certain monster attacks that spray particles or extreme bright light are when this normally happens) also TURN THAT FANCY LIGHTING OFF, it will grant you around 15-20 frames more ensuring you stay in the 60s most of the time. The only reason I make an issue out of this is while the graphics are good, they aren't good enough to warrant the frame drops (as I mentioned in my 7 Days to Die review)Now, moving on to disconnections, for me personally I rarely got disconnected, but when I did it was FRUSTRATING as all hell, the simple reason is, if you are in a team of 4 people hunting a monster and you get disconnected, you are left ALONE to hunt the monster, BUT you are fighting a monster that has had the difficulty scaled to 4 players...by yourself, for the same rewards, which can be a serious pain. My controller ALSO did not work when I first tried this game, but restarting my PC fixed it.Other than those gripes? it's a DAMN good game, If you've played a MH game before you'll be familiar with how things work, pick one of the many weapons, practice with it, choose which one suits you, kill monsters, upgrade weapon, repeat. However MH: World has some quality of life changes mainly being able to ""track"" monsters, saving you from running around the map like an idiot searching for them like in the earlier games, this makes hunts alot less tedious and allows you to get the job done with far less faffing around.The crafting system in MH: World seems daunting at first but it's really simple and there are SO many things to craft so GRAB EVERYTHING YOU SEE!. There are many guides online to help you get started in this game which can seriously help give you a less rocky start, so get googling/youtubing guys!Overall I LOVED Monster Hunter: World, ESPECIALLY the music, it is simply amazing! I like the Tzitsi Ya Ku and Arena battle music the most. The online is also awesome, providing you don't get stuck with a team of imbeciles it's pretty enjoyable as a team game, and multiplayer is a big part of this game, plus you get your own individual LOOT so no fighting over materials. Another thing I liked was I kept thinking I would grow tired and bored of the constant repetitive quests, gathering etc but I didn't, I still loved every minute of it hour after hour, this game is VERY addicting.Technical issues aside, I definitely recommend Monster Hunter: World, but I also advise you do some research into it, this game is NOT for everyone and the 2 hour limit for refunds really isn't enough to get to the meat of this game, so be ABSOLUTELY sure you're gonna like it before dropping £50 on it!. However, if you DO end up liking it? KISS YOUR SOCIAL LIFE GOODBYE, the only social life you'll have from now on is joining multiplayer hunting sessions.But seriously...social life is overrated...Monster Hunter: World however...IS NOT!"

This is just me writing a review with my current thoughts and opinions for this game. I love this game! And as much as I want to recommend it to someone, it isn't a game for everybody. So I guess I'll start with my pros and cons? Monster Hunter always had a variety of weapon choices and each one of them has their own unique playstyles. When I get bored of one weapon, I would spice it up by using another. The game has great graphics and most importantly multiplayer! Even if multiplayer isn't a big selling point for you, single player can still be fun and challenging. You can always try to beat your best time/record by learning the monster or ""cheesing"" it. Comparing Monster Hunter World(MHW) to other monster hunter games, MHW has so much quality of life. For me this is a game changer because everything is so easy to organize/manage.Now then to what I don't like! Its really hard to play multiplayer as a new player. I think this is my biggest turn off starting the game. I would be unable to play multiplayer if I have not seen the ""cutscene"". The storyline of MHW feels like a tutorial than a story and it honestly sucks. Once you completed the story, its a grind fest.(I enjoy this but others may not) You grind to power up yourself so you can kill monsters easier is the gist of it? This game is also easier compared to the other monster hunter games and I think its because they are targeting a new player base. MHW does have plenty of mods that can step up its quality of game. If you like to be a fashion hunter, there are mods that makes you look super spicy! With that being said this is just a summary of my summary. I hope you guys enjoy the game as much as I do! Happy Hunting!"

And having a lesser product on PC after waiting half a year is outrageous for the price. And the worst part was the incredibly bad netcode, with constant errors and random connection failures. Add the random bugs / bad keyboard controls and you can't really recommend the PC port as something positive (even if the game is amazing and you enjoy it as i do)FYI Also double check DLC issues before buying it"

Yes, the original reveal was terrible and gave the impression of some completely different game, merely wearing the skin of a monhun game. Yes, you can run while chugging potions and won't flex at the end. Yes, mantles are an absolute crutch.All of that rubs me off in a bad way. I certainly don't agree with some of the weapons changes, either.However, this is finally a monhun game officially on PC! No emulation! By GOD have I waited for this day where I wouldn't need to claw grip a PSP or... whatever you could call the way I held my 3DS for monhun.Just keep in mind that as a PC player you'll be rated as a second-class citizen by Capcom. No content arrives together or close to consoles on PC. Even though the PC version is currently paired to console in content and has a larger playerbase than Xbox, consoles will receive the shiny new expansion with all the goodies like monsters, areas and G-rank this September, while PC is merely slated for ""winter"", which could very well mean not even this year. Do take that with a grain of salt however, as that might change over time since both PC releases of REmake 2 and DMC5 released on the same day as consoles since the MHW PC release.All in all, Monster Hunter World is a great game and certainly deserves to be bought at full-price.I also highly recommend using something like ReShade to boost the color and black levels of your game so it doesn't look like some soulless AAA shooter from the past generation."

Honnestly I wish I had more grinding to do so I would have an excuse to play this game even more. I honnestly cannot wait for iceborne to come, and I most highly recommend this game to anyone that didn't pick it up yet.

People seem to forget that this is a 'MAJOR' upgraded version of the oldies and yet people are still complaining like no tomorrow.

It has always been a wish of mine that this franchise makes the leap to the PC.With Monster Hunter: World we have exactly that. World is a great starter for newcomers to the Monster Hunter franchise as it has plenty of tutorials to show you how the variety of weapons function. The addition of the Training Area where you can test out weapons to your heart's content is a wonderful addition. These luxuries were certainly not present in the older games and therefore took some time to get into.In MH: World you can get right in and slash away at a monster with your starter Longsword or shoot it in the face with your Bowgun. The power you feel when you release a charged attack with your Greatsword or Charge Blade is immensely satisfying.Monster Hunter is exactly what the title implies. You hunt, get materials and craft better gear. There is no character leveling which give you increased stats like in an RPG. Damage output is dependent on what weapons and armour you bring to the fight aswell as your own skill in handling that weapon and anticipating attacks. That encourages training and results in great moments when you succesfully dodge an incoming attack and are able to release a well-timed flurry of attacks right afterwards.This time around you are able to play with randoms through the SOS system and not just only when you are on the same online session. If your friends did not buy this game, the thrill of hunting cooperatively can be experienced just the same with this system. The ability to matchmake into an online session with randoms is also available.Unfortunately there are still rare disconnections during hunts or in an online session which dampen the fun factor. A hunting party of 2 or more results in the monster having more health balancewise and when a disconnection occurs, the health stays the same. This results in a lone hunter having to deal with a monster for much longer as it was balanced for 2 or more players, which is quite frustrating.Optimization-wise, I had occasional pop-in in the town and some texture-loading issues in some levels. Fortunately these are not things that will sting the eyes much as you are mostly concentrating on the monster instead of the world.That doesn't mean to say the biomes they built are dull, on the contrary. When I first explored the different biomes MH: World has to offer, I was amazed. To see all this in HD after playing on the PSP was wonderful. The verticality and colour of the Coral Highlands or the densely overgrown Ancient Forest were a thrill to go through the first couple of times.The variety of monsters here is somewhat lackluster compared to the older games but definitely enough for a newcomer to the series which will see you sink 50-100 hours in before it gets too repetitive. The good thing is that Capcom can build (and is building) on the existing palette of monsters and introduce monsters from older games which were so dearly loved. I really hope World can stand next to the likes of MH: Generations Ultimate in terms of monster variety one day, for endless hunts.Endgame-wise the gameplay stays the same but instead you hunt for decorations and items to augment your armour and weapons to get even stronger. It is very satisfying when you finally defeat a monster that has killed you and your friends countless times. When you are able to slay that same monster in under five minutes with your hard-hitting endgame build, that just feels so **** good.I can whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys solo or cooperative play where personal skill comes into play alot and you want to wield ridiculous weapons to make a monster come crashing out of the sky.

This can be played on mouse and keyboard but I prefer it on and would recommend it on gamepad.Been aware of the Monster Hunter series for last decade or so, never played due to not having the want to play consoles. I always said I would check it out when it finally came to western PC.It clearly was worth the wait as I put in like 48 hours in the first week XD.I have read there have been some changes and quality of life improvements of previous games in the title. The graphics are vastly improved over all titles and there is no loading screen between zones now.Monster Hunter is just that you hunt monsters, gather materials, get new weapons, hunt new monsters, repeat.I'm currently 58 hours in and have got so much more to do. There are 14 different weapons to try all with there own unique play style (SNS GANG! lol). There are 31 large monsters and 17 small monsters all with unique fighting styles and weaknesses.You can play through the story, hunt freely in expeditions, take missions for specific monster hunts, hunt with friends, help random strangers via SOS flares, fight in the arena, grind supplies to make weapons and armour, harvest and grow plants for potions, complete your hunting and research guides on monsters.I love the Palico companions they add so much fun and charm to the game. If you like cats you will love them. Your loyal palico will follow you into battle and buff you or provide a great distraction for the monster.The Iceborne expansion is on the way which promises to add a massive amount more of content with rumours of it doubling the base games life which can easily breach 150+ hours.Again its great to see another Japanese company embracing the Western PC culture with a “Predominantly Japanese only release” With SEGA giving us gems like the Yakuza series and Super Monkey Ball and Capcom giving us Monster Hunter etc. The PC gaming future is looking great!"

Awesome Graphics , Great new mechanics , Story is okay , although from time to time i still get disconnected which is a downside. Overall its a good game great for people who are new to the series.Post Icebourne Review:The Clutch claw really changed the fighting mechanics. With a wide range of new monsters,regions,mechanics and a whole new endgame. The PC port is awful. Still. Months after release. Although they maintain the player base with free updates like Events or New Monsters.An Immense expansion, aside from disconnecting just often enough to ensure almost every play session ends in frustration. A rewarding gameplay loop even though it can get repetitive sometimes. Others may experience some significant difficulty spikes when jumping into master rank. Overall great expansion 9/10.

Yes, the controls with Mouse an Keyboard are not the best, but I never saw so many review complaining about essentially requiring to use a controller one other games, for example Dark Souls, which itself is somewhat unplayable without a controller. And for me, playing as an archer, the K+M controls are solid enough, after doing some slight remapping._Grapics_Overall, I like the Graphics and the generell look of the game. I have to admit, there are some framedrops here and there and the optimization could be better, but thats nothing that can´t be patched. Just a quick note: None of my friends nor me have a high-end-pc, most of us have something in the mid-range, around 3-4 years old....it still runs good._Gameplay_Hunt big stuff, kill it or trap it to get the parts needed to build better equipment to hunt even bigger stuff. Repeat. Thats it basically. And its glorious!_Multiplayer_Yes, you can make things unnecessarily complicated, and CAPCOM went pretty much miles and miles in that direction. Want to play through the Main quest with your friends. Nope, not until the host has seen the cutscenes. Want to open up a lobby with a password? Nope, you have to send around this cryptic session-ID to have a private lobby. Wanna have a clan? Nah, just use the steamgroups, even though they don´t offer the same amount of features like the squads on consoles (as far as I read into that matter). Just come to terms with that or wait for a patch, its not the end of the world.Now, let me say my short opinion about a few reviews I read so far, all of them negative by the way:""I tought, this is a RPG"" - Well, its not and is hasn´t been marketed as one. Don´t thumb down a game because you didn´t inform yourself before buying the game.""Its to grindy!"" - Again, inform yourself about a game before buying it.""Just play Dark Souls"" - Nope, those are two extremely different games to compare. ""The Monster keeps running away!!!! What is this crap???1!!!"" - Its called a HUNT!Overall, I like this game very much. Now excuse me, I have a wyvern to skin. :)PS: English is not my native tounge, so please excuse any errors you may find :)"

And it feels SO GOOD.The weapon variety is great, with 14 different weapons to choose from and all of them feeling extremely different and with different nuances to master.Definitely get a group of friends to play together. It's extremely satisfying to go through the missions together as a squad of 2-4 people, chasing down a monster and slaying it."

(The time I reviewed this game, I still loved it.)Game is really fun to play. It's also addictive where it made me spend most of my time into this game. I've played Monster Hunter Portable 3rd back when I was still a kid with my PSP. When I heard this game was coming out, I was very excited. Later planned to buy this game but happily a very kind friend of mine gifted it to me. So now, to the pros and cons.Pros :- Amazing scenery.- Variety of monsters. There are so many different types of monster you can encounter that will keep you out of boredom.- No pay to win features. I love it.- Variety of weapons. You can also try so many types of weapons.- Helpful guides and very helpful starter kits. They basically give you all types of weapons at the start so all you have to do is to choose what kind of weapon is suitable for you.- Events. Oh boy this keeps me awake!- Turf wars. Watching two monsters fight in such an unique animation is just satisfying. For example two horned monsters beating each other with their horns.- Cute pets. Yes. Cute pets. Pigs, cats. What else do you need?- Multiplayer. Really fun if you get to play with your friends.- Musics. I love the musics.Cons :- Horrible, ridiculous, terrifying hitboxes. Yeah it's a joke. Hope they fix it in the future.- Unskippable cutscenes. Wastes too much time. Real gamers wouldn't want to spend their time watching some animations would they?- Long introduction of the game. Like I said above, waste of time.- Low quality voice chat.- Terrible server issues. Don't be surprised if you ever encounter an error during the game. It's just Capcom's bad server issues.- Badly optimised for medium spec gamers. (Personally I don't really know since my computer is a high end pc but the information given from a medium spec gamer, seems like it's true.)- Palico AI. Absolutely horrible. Probably one of the worst Ai coding done in a high quality game.- Default settings are a joke too. Especially when you are on a pc.- RNG. I mean mostly everyone hates RNG right?- THE HANDLERSo there's my review. Hope you enjoyed reading it. I personally do recommend you buying it. Although, on a cheaper price. Honestly even 10 dollars off would be a suitable price but 60 dollars? That's a no no. Wait for the sales.P.S. The DLC ""Iceborne"" is pretty costy too."

Overall the game is enjoyable, and if your like me and don't mind a good grind, you can skip the Defender/Guardian gear. However, I wish that it was noted in-game that it was meant for an Iceborne rush. At the time I didn't own Iceborne and the in-game guide suggested to get it regardless. Which ruined the learning curve for me. It wasnt until I reached the next area did I realise my mistake.The game IS fun. And i'm sure the other reviews have a much better time pointing out the positives, with that being said...Learning curves. the game misses out on many in-game tips about the available mechanics. - The absolute Importance of the Canteen- Firing Torch pods at the ground clears Effluvial damage around you- How the damn Clawshot works, Yes there is a mission to guide you through this, but I wasn't even aware    until my friend pointed it out to me.- Stacking decorations with armor to boost skills- how to capture monsters (this one it does technically tell you, but assumes you do every side quest or just   so happen to pick the right ones)- Grimalkyne Tribes that unlock palico gear and tailriders- and likely more that I am yet to find out.It could be because I'm using a keyboard, but the controls for ranged weapons are absolute garbage.I feel that the two handed weapons are under-powered. There is no point using a weapon that does an extra 10-15 damage if you can pick a much lighter weapon that doesnt lock you in an animation.And when it comes to animations. Stuns and Paralysis lasts way too damn long. By the time your character even starts to stand up again the monster has already eaten you, your palico, and your ugly handler.Honestly there is so much wrong with this game that I don't know how to keep it in order.6/10would be a  7/10 but minus 1 point for dodge not working half the time."

The setting, maps, and the atmosphere definitely add a lot to the overall experience.It’s also super fun to learn and get to know the monsters, as well as the weapon types, and environments.Finally, the character progression feels very rewarding and the urge to grind for that last piece of ultra cool equipment is gargantuic.Totally recommended"

And it's probably an amazing iteration if you're already a returning Monster Hunter player - but you'd already have known this if so. Monster Hunter: World, unfortunately, can quickly become a downright boring game if you're new to the series and don't fancy its game structure. Pretty much every quest in this is a boss fight and there's not much variety other than that - that's what the series is about. The problem is that the game can feel highly repetitive and even exhausting (if you aren't quite as skilled) that makes it difficult to enjoy. Its end game is essentially made up of farming the same monsters over and over again for a chance to drop rare streamstones that you need for augmenting your gear - and the worst part of it is the RNG.This is a great title and it was fun for me initially. However, the fun factor drastically went down as I progress towards end game. Halfway through this game, I've already found it to be a chore - perhaps it's my own pacing of the game. I don't think this game is for everyone, and I certainly find it difficult to recommend it to players who are just looking for some casual fun."

Has online capability + Single player , It isn't the typical MMORPG where it eats into you when other players are cashy or too strong. It does not force you to stay on multiplayer too , Unlike MMORPG where Dungeons must be run with certain amount of players. In MMORPG , normally you would have to retrain your character from scratch just to be able to try out another weapon/job/class. In Mhw, you could simply switch out weapons and be able to try them out or even change your main weapon easily without having to retrain from scratch all over again.If you are looking to complete the storyline gameplay , It would roughly take you <48hours or way less if you know what you are doing.

However, this series has some major concerns. From my perspective, the biggest concern is the performance issue, connectivity issue, and MHW weapon designs. MHW performance has become inconsistent through every new patch launched. The performance varies between players, some people experience a severe performance issue and some are experiencing smooth gameplay despite they both having the same specs in their PC. Secondly, even though I rarely had this issue, some players reported got disconnected very frequently inside the game or unable to participate in the current live event. Thirdly, is the weapon design. One of the reasons I hooked to MH and why MH is very satisfying to grind is because of those gorgeous weapon designs. I tend to collect every weapon from all of my favorite monsters in the previous series. However, MHW has some weapons that just been re-designed from the base weapon such as the bone or iron weapons. We can take an example from Zinogre great sword (Severing Bolt II) which shares a design with Banbaro GS (Mammoth Greataxe II), and Great Girros GS (Naaga Guillotine II). Another example is Glavenus GS which has the same design as Nargacuga's GS. Capcom has the potential to create its original design based on the previous generations and I understand based on the video ""Making the Monster Hunter"" that the developer is trying to make realistic weapons that have a philosophy revolves around the monster itself such as its monster's elements. However, this develops a less encouraging and satisfying grind experience. In addition, in my honest opinion, sometimes I found the clutch claw mechanics to be painful and inconvenient as we have to wound the monster's part to deal more damage but on the other hand, the clutch claw is a really interesting and unique addition to MH series. Overall, I love this MH series and would like to keep playing the game while waiting for the next MH series."

You hunt big baddies with fun weapons, and can also go into freeroaming to collect plants and fish and butcher innocent, largely defenseless animals.

The combat is fun and interesting, though you'll need to try out the different weapons for a while before you land on the one you'll enjoy - I thought I didn't enjoy the combat very much after the first mission, but it's just because I picked a weapon I didn't end up liking (there are over a dozen weapon types). On top of all this, almost the entire game is coop-capable.There are a few minor issues I have with it:* Motion blur (not that bad, but can't be turned off)* Some kind of mouth smoothing thing (it's a little strange, and unnoticeable 95% of the time, but can't be turned off)* Going on expeditions (free-roam) with friends is kind of annoying to get to (you have to do a mission with them first, so you can't rejoin an expedition nor can you join an existing one)And some extremely miniscule gripes:* Fishing isn't really engaging* As far as I can tell, there's no way to transmog gear or otherwise customize its appearance* Headgear visibility has options of ""visible,"" ""invisible,"" or ""invisible during cutscenes."" I would have liked an ""invisible in the hub"" option* The menus take a little bit of getting used toIf you somehow think that any of these things cripple an otherwise amazing game, then yeah, avoid it.

It seemed like a fun and unique game that I personally haven't seen in a long time. I held off on purchasing this game initially due to PC reviews being less than ideal. I decided to forego this precaution and bought it. And boy was I glad I got itThere are three games that I can name that has sucked the life from me when I first played it. The original Combat Arms when I started my FPS childhood. Team Fortress 2 that has basically defined who I am as a gamer for basically my later half of my life. And now Monster Hunter World which has enticed me to sink countless hours into a game that has never stopped being fun.From the humble Sword and Shield to the staggering and sluggish power of the Greatsword, there's a weapon for everyone. And what's fun about a weapon without monsters to smack around.I'm unsure if people are aware but yes, there are monsters in this game. Shocker.It's no surprise that the monsters in this game are near lifelike for what they are. Movements feel fluid and natural (as natural as fictional dragons and lizards go) and the attacks are well telegraphed to feel fair when combating these beasts. I haven't really had many times outside of a few certain monsters where I felt frustrated. And when you are hunting down these beats it makes you really FEEL like... batman... wait.I haven't played any other Monster Hunter games other than this one. This being either a blessing or curse I would say I highly recommend this game to any boys (and girls) who feel like hunting down beats with oversized weaponry."

Everything from MHW's core mechanics to its sound design is nothing short of triple-A quality.  This game is an absolute joyride and while it definitely isn't perfect; you should sleep in peace knowing that Capcom actually understands how a $60 game should be made.  This is one for the history books.I'll only be addressing the gameplay section since it's the only part where I feel as though quality has any dipping.Monster Hunter: World remains faithful to the franchise as it focuses on the thrill of the hunt, making tweaks to keep the game's mechanics both fresh yet strikingly familiar to returning players.  For new players, the game's well-paced campaign ensures that first-time hunters do not fall behind the learning curve.Monster Hunter: World shatters the norm by giving each of its weapon sets entirely different and unique mechanics, which, coupled with near-perfect balancing, allows all weapons to be effective and viable.  Players are given a plethora of weapon choices from the get-go as well, allowing them to explore the playstyle which suits them the most.  As such, the core combat mechanics of MHW, though deceptively may seem very similar to games such as , actually finds similarities with a slew of other games such as Devil May Cry.  In the five-course-meal of a game, however, the combat itself is just the dessert.  Monster Hunter: World brings the thrill of the hunt to a new level with sprawling maps and biomes--each with their own fitting wildlife.  Expect to trek through sludge, toxic gases, or cross gaps swinging along a vine as you track your target with the help of your scoutflies, passing other monsters along the way as you follow the food chain up.  The game feels exactly as advertised, with your surroundings dynamically changing with the fight and monsters interacting with each other: a true spectacle to behold.  Only hunters who successfully track down their target and make full use of their items and skills can take down a monster after 20-to-30 minutes of fighting, having to track it back to its nest where it retreats upon realising it is no longer the king of the jungle.The condiments to this delicious meal are the way Capcom designed MHW's gearing system.  Hunting gear is forged using materials gained from skinning kills, meaning the more you kill, the better chance you'll have at taking down the next biggest thing in the jungle.  There are just enough required materials to make the grind for the materials needed for the upgrades a challenge, without making it feel like a painful, boring grind such as with cases like Diablo 3 where a player could spend hours accomplishing nothing.  Instead, MHW ensures that the player makes steady, but slow progress with the eventual promise of good loot, as opposed to the blind gamble of most grind-for-gear, dungeon crawlers currently in the gaming industry.Overall, Monster Hunter: World proves that despite having a rough couple of years, Capcom still has its touch and is a breath of fresh air.  Despite it being a port, the game runs without much worry, though I would still recommend a beefier setup (follow the game's recommended system specs, perhaps) to get the most enjoyment out of it.Alas, nothing is perfect, and we finally have to address the game's shortcomings, which come in the form of its highly unstable servers and confusing multiplayer design choices.   Make no mistake, Monster Hunter: World is absolutely not an MMO, but rather, a very well-balanced multiplayer experience which does not intrude with the player's experience, unlike how Dark Souls' instantly makes the game a cakewalk.  Instead, the issues like in Capcom's decision to make connecting to multiplayer both frustratingly difficult and infuriatingly unstable.  Not only do online sessions drop out quite often, the game confusingly requires players to put down everything they've already set in motion in order to connect to an Online Session.   I find it frustrating to always be shown the error message notifying that I no longer have the ability to send out SOS flares to call for aid so other players in the session can help when I'm about to get knocked around until the next time I visit the hub world--ostensibly entailing that I'll have to completely drop the hunt if I hope to get any hunting companions. Please, Capcom, the game is damn near perfect.  Fix the servers and everything will be well on its way to being flawless.Overall, the game is a stunning visual and mechanical masterpiece.  Monster Hunter: World boasts a game of legendary quality truly worth every cent and more of your precious money.  Yes, it's expensive, but for $60 you get an incredibly crafted world with detailed animations and design, and a living, breathing jungle filled with bigger and bigger monsters to hunt and kill as you climb your way up the food chain to become an apex predator yourself.  I have never recommended a game in a Steam review more than this.  Happy hunting."

This game has an incredible amount of replay value  you are invested in what the game is about... . The story is lackluster with a few moments of annoyance. The handler is absolutely useless and the palicoes are adorable. Each weapon has different mechanics/combos/animations so it really feels like a completely different experience for each monster hunt. There are RPG min/maxing for builds that are available to absolutely nerd out over. ORYou can opt into basic defenses and skills that orient towards survival and play with the same high end gear on essentially every fight. It's pretty intense at the later stages... but if you get there yourself.. you'll be prepared. However if you find or make a friend that is into this game, proceed to get carried by that friend, and expect to just man handle the harder fights...  Well. Just try it, and remember this review. Of course you could be an absolute chad so f me I guess. No matter what, becoming a master at any weapon will require lots of practice and situational awareness."

It's been cool to see it go from a fairly niche series to what it is today. And World is a worthy title to bring the franchise into a new era. You don't need to have played through previous games as MH has always been light on story and they don't have a continuing story line past a couple references to older titles. This is about gameplay first and foremost so if you're looking for a deep story line driven game this probably isn't for you.To start off i see a lot of the negative reviews for this game are based on performance or networking issues, i haven't had any problems myself so i won't be speaking about them, the game has ran perfectly fine for me though i know many have had legitimate issues. Capcom have done a decent job of patching the game and ironing out problems. I'd also like to note that this game can be played co-op or entirely solo(a select few bosses may give you trouble on your own but that's about it), i enjoy both a lot so don't worry about needing others to play with.For those that have not played a MH game before the series put into simple terms is kill large monsters, carve them up to make better weapons/armour and repeat as you work your way up fighting more powerful monsters. Ranging from very easy to extremely challenging in the late game. Sounds simple enough but there is so much more depth to the game than meets the eye. Some other tasks you will be doing just to name a few: Exploring zones, gathering resources and managing your farm, fishing, mining and of course upgrading your gear and making builds.  The main strong point of MH for me and i believe many others is the combat and World is no different, in my opinion having the best combat to date. Monster Hunter combat is not spamming or hack n slash rather more comparable to Dark souls, attacking when you find an opening and part of the fun is learning the monster attack patterns and how much you can get good at abusing those openings. World has 14 different weapons to use and each feel satisfying and distinct in their own way, the heavy slower weapons feel like they have a lot of weight to them and you can really feel the impact on each attack where as the faster weapons give you the fun feeling of unleashing large combos while still retaining the satisfying feel of hits. There is no class system in the game so you can freely swap to any of the 14 weapons. There are skills that can change the way you play however, skills come from the gear you are wearing and can vary from improving how many i-frames you get when rolling to something as simple as being able to gather more herbs. Either way you can be sure that you have a variety of ways to build your character and this will be what you spend a lot of time doing in the end game.Each Monster has a different moveset and abilities it can use which is what makes learning attacks patters so enjoyable as you have a new task ahead of you each time you fight something new. Then add in that each fight can feel vastly different depending on what weapon you are using and you have a good recipe for engaging gameplay that can feel fresh after many hunts. The core gameplay loop of hunt>craft gear>hunt is a tried and tested formula that the series has been successfully honing for over a decade with World being arguably the finest iteration yet. World brings the the most quality of life changes and small tweaks the series has seen to date. Add in the signature MH charm such as the Felyne Cats or scoffing down comically huge plates of food mixed with some relaxing downtime when you go back to your Town hub or just chill in your house and you have yourself a unique experience i don't believe any other game can offer.At this point you can probably tell if this is the sort of game that could interest you. Even though i didn't even touch on half of what Mh has to offer a lot of the fun comes from learning the game mechanics and nuances of which there are many.Main Positives+ Massive amount of quality of life changes make World the best MH game for new players    by a long shot+ Best Combat in a MH game to date and top class for Action RPGS in general.+ Challenging and engaging content that can be difficult to find in a time where lots of games    prioritize *cinematic experiences*  over everything else+ Fantastic Environments, they did a great job making each area feel like a living ecosystem.+ Easily 50+ Hours of solid content, way more IMO this is being conservative.+ Monster designs are top notch.Minor Negatives(mainly for veterans of the series) - Since World is effectively MH 5 in all but name the monster roster can seem small   compared to Gen 4, though this is being improved upon with Iceborne coming this Winter.- Weapon visual design is probably the worst of any MH game, many weapons just look like   bone/iron with monster fur coming off of them instead of unique models. The weapons that   do have unique models however are top quality, they are just too few and far between.- Maybe a controversial point for some but very end game content Arch-Tempered Elder   dragons are severely lacking interesting mechanics, a lot of the time just making them   annoying to fight rather than a harder but fair approach. Some are way too easy and barely  change the fight (Kirin) and some are hard just because of frustrating mechanics                (Vaal Hazak, Lunastra). - Monster Hunter games have always had an element of grinding in them, not a personal   negative for me but if you really hate grinding then that is something to keep in mind"

Those days were awesome, teaming up with random people and helping each other is so much fun. I'm happy to say that Capcom have absolutely improved upon the Monster Hunter format in this installment. Buy this and engage in jolly cooperation! Is what I would say if their matchmaking system isn't atrocious. Maybe this is just my experience, but it is very hard to find a lobby in this game, let alone a full one. Maybe it's just because i'm late to the party, but it is really discouraging to see only half a dozen lobbies opened in a game this big and how non of them are even full. The only reliable way I can play with others is through the SOS system that they implemented.  That's the only gripe I can think of for this game. If you've played and enjoyed the previous installments, then you'll enjoy this too. But then again, I'm biased af since I've been playing the Monster Hunter series since it first came out in PS2. So here's the verdict. If you are new, buy this if you have friends or if you are willing to complete the majority of the quests solo."

If you’ve ever felt the need to bash in a dragon’s head with a hammer that looks like a flower, then this may be the game for you. With those initial thoughts out of the way, I welcome you to my in-depth review of Monster Hunter World.I’m going to get this out of the way first, because let us be honest here, you aren’t getting this game for the story. That being said, you find many spoilers here as the story is quite bland and doesn’t have much variation. You’re a hunter that has been sent to a new world with a bunch of other people to investigate a phenomenon known as the elder crossing. Though there are some cutscenes and story specific quests, they’re basically just filler content to get to the monsters you’ll be fighting. Most monsters are introduced, because your handler (an NPC who works with you) can’t get her priorities straight and decides that food is more important than her life. It’s either that, or her utter reliance on the fact that you’ll save her after running headfirst into certain death.There is so much to choose from in this game when it comes to armor and weapons. You can build armor out of various materials that you collect from the environment and by defeating monsters. Each armor has its own specific bonuses and resistances to different elements. In the early game you’ll mostly just want to mix and match armor components in order to get the most defense points you can. Later on you may want to grind out quests to build specific armor sets. Most of them look really cool and it feels satisfying to build the armor sets. Overall there isn’t anything too difficult here, just go for the best set you can build.Weapons are a different story. There are lots of different types of weapons, all with their own unique movesets and use cases. I’ve only ever really used two weapons regularly, that being the hammer and the charge blade. It feels incredibly satisfying to master a weapon. You’ll find yourself pulling off all sorts of cool combos and dishing out massive damage. However, you will most likely have to look up a guide, find a youtube video, or know someone to give you tips and tricks on how to use the weapons. Some weapons, like the charge blade, have lots of different combos and mechanics which you need to know to dish out the maximum amount of damage. While learning combos through the practice tool is possible, some of them require specific time frames and it's easiest to find those time frames by looking up guides. Weapons also have way more advanced build and upgrade paths than armor does. There are several types of base weapons and you can use different monster materials to upgrade them into the more defined variants. These variants usually have different elemental aspects which allows them to do more damage to different types of enemies. And of course they also have different overall appearances. Overall, I love having so many different types of weapons and it really adds another level of complexity to the game that you wouldn’t have otherwise. That being said, it's also really easy to switch up your build at any time, even if you mostly play from far away, you can easily pick up a hammer and just go full melee mode. You don’t have to dedicate to any one build.This should be quite obvious, but the entirety of the gameplay is focussed around fighting monsters, be they big or small, your task is to kill (or capture) endemic life. There are two main ways of going about this, either by doing quests, or by going out on expeditions.Expeditions give you the open world experience. Just choose where you want to go and walk around. You can collect materials for making health potions, or special ammo. There are smaller enemies to fight in order to get some simple early game armor. And of course there are the large monsters with the most rewarding loot. Most monsters will not attack you if you don’t attack them first, however there are some exceptions to that rule. Also since its open world, it's very possible that you will be fighting one monster and another will join in and start fighting as well. This isn’t necessarily one sided and usually results in a big three, or sometimes even four way brawl. However, you probably won’t be doing many expeditions outside your first few times within an area. The better loot and rewards come through completing quests.Quests give you an objective to complete such as slaying a monster, or gathering a certain number of materials. It will also associate a time limit with the task and put a cap on the amount of times you can faint before failing a quest. This can be completed with other players either by randomly having people join you, or by specifically inviting certain friends to join you. But more on that later.All the monsters are relatively unique in their moveset and appearances. You’ll get to know some better than others and it really is a work of art to master fighting against a specific enemy. You will start to learn when to roll, when to hit them, and when to run away. Enemies get progressively harder and more advanced as you go through the game, but so will you. With all the different weapons and moves at your disposal, you will learn how to take care of each one.That being said, there is an obvious learning curve to this game. It's not something you’ll be able to figure out immediately, it's not exactly intuitive, and there is a good chance you’ll still be learning new tactics even after you’ve spent many many hours in game. Once you get over the steep learning curve though, you’ll have a lot of fun and you’re definitely going to want to keep playing.This game has lots of potential and if you give it a chance you will spend many hours in this game. There is so much to do and the challenge is very real. I love playing this game and though I feel like I’ve put a decent amount of time in, I still have way more to discover and look into and I’m certainly not getting bored. This is more of a personal point, but I’ve reviewed a decent number of first person RPGs and this is the one I’ve spent the most time in despite only buying this a month ago. There is a lot to love here and even though the story is quite dull, the game really shines in what I consider to be the most important, the actual gameplay. The cool graphics and good soundtrack are an added perk and really add up to make this game feel amazing to play. You will not regret buying this game, especially not at this price point. And if you love the game you can get even more use out of it by buying the Iceborne DLC, although it definitely isn’t necessary to enjoy the game. Playing with friends makes the game even more fun and I highly recommend getting together with a group of four to get the most out of the experience.I hope you found this review to be helpful and happy hunting!"

Having been a fan of both 4 Ultimate and Generations, I have a bit of experience playing the core games, which set up my expectations for MH:World. Things I was expecting: * fighting monsters* Palicoes of varying levels of helpfulness* loooooots of micro-managing* agonizing over which combinations of armor pieces would create the best set* Trying to figure out how the hell to upgrade my weapon to get what I want* That feeling of despair when the monster flees your area and you forgot to mark it with a paintball* A maybe-not-quite-immersive-but-still-fun and reliable multiplayer experienceHaving said that, this game has taken my expectations and thrown them in a blender, for better or worse. I've seen some comments/reviews from other people complaining about the amount of foraging and micro-managing there is in the series. This is a series staple-- it's to be expected. Embraced, even. There's still monsters to fight, and they are challenging. Palicoes in this game are not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but they are invaluable supports that can dig you out of a tight spot. The actual hunting feels AMAZING. While there aren't as MANY locales to explore as there were in past games, they're incredibly dense, immersive, and are full of all sorts of things to explore. Even when you're looking for a monster, finding a shiny gathering point or a new endemic creature to add to your collection of pets is a joy. Best of all is the tracking. In past games, if you forgot to bring paintballs to mark the monster, you were SOL if the Rathalos you were just fighting flew off to another area. In MH:World, tracking has been made easier and more immersive. You really feel like you're stalking a dinosaur through a jungle, rather than just checking your minimap for a big pink dot. Actually fighting the monster you've been hunting is also a delight. Damage counters are a delightful new addition and really help you keep track of what parts are more vulnerable than others. I've really only tried using the Hunting Horn in this game, but even just that feels weighty and satisfying to whack things with.This game has taken the idea of armor skills and weapon upgrades and simplified the process significantly. Gone are the days of lamenting over the fact that you couldn't get enough points in Evade Dist to actually get a useful skill. ANY points in ANY skill will leave an impact. Being able to visualize the weapon upgrade trees is a godsend.Overall, the game is fun as hell. disregard that, this has been fixed. I'd still like to see LAN support though. At the very least, this information should be on the system requirements.Overall: 10/10 gameplay, when things go wellEdit 25 August 2018: Game's been fixed. After playing for a good few hours on the newest patch (as of writing this review), I have no further issues with this game. A+ game, would highly recommend. Stayed up way too late playing with Boyfriend and now we're both extremely sleepy and satisfied with our purchase. Apparently, changing the rating to ""recommended"" also clears out steam user ratings so I want it to be on record that this review had a rating of 348 ""helpful"" and 43 ""funny."" I'm a very delicate person and I need every bit of validation from strangers to make life easier for me. Waaaah. Great game tho, definitely worth the loss of internet points. (end edit)Also I found The Handler to be obnoxious. Bring back Guildmarm."

A part of the Monster Hunter series, it was released worldwide for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in January 2018, with a Microsoft Windows version in August 2018.In the game, the player takes the role of a Hunter, tasked to hunt down and either kill or trap monsters that roam in one of several environmental spaces. If successful, the player is rewarded through loot consisting of parts from the monster and other elements that are used to craft weapons and armor, amongst other equipment.The game's core loop has the player crafting appropriate gear to be able to hunt down more difficult monsters, which in turn provide parts that lead to more powerful gear. Players may hunt alone, or can hunt in cooperative groups of up to four players via the game's online services. is an open-world action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. Similar to previous games in the series, the player takes the role of a player-created character who travels to the ""New World"", an unpopulated land mass filled with monsters, to join the Research Commission that study the land from their central command base of Astera.The Research Commission tasks the Hunter to hunt down and either kill or capture large monsters that roam outside Astera to both protect the Commission and to study the monsters there.The player's character does not have any intrinsic attributes, but instead these are determined by what equipment the character is equipped with. This includes a weapon, selected from the series' fourteen archetypes (such as long sword, bow, or hammer), which then further defines the types of combat moves and abilities the player can use, and pieces of armor, which can lead to beneficial or detrimental combat skills if matched properly.While some basic equipment can be purchased using in-game money, most equipment is built from loot obtained by slaying or trapping monsters, rewards from completing quests, or items gathered while in the field. This creates a core loop of gameplay that has the player fight monsters they can beat to obtain the right loot to craft improved weapons and armor to allow them to face more powerful monsters and the potential for even better equipment.After taking a quest in Astera, or after choosing to simply go on an open-ended expedition, the player is taken to a base camp in one of six large regions that make up the New World. Each region is made up of numbered zones, but unlike previous Monster Hunter games, these zones are seamlessly connected, and there are  when moving between zones.The player must traverse zone to zone, though they can quick-travel to any of the base camps in that particular region when outside of combat. From camp, the player can acquire limited provisions, rest to restore their health, and new to World, have a meal that provides limited-time buffs to the player.The player sets out to track down monsters, which in World is aided with the use of Scout flies, which hover near tracks and other signs of large monsters, or highlight resources that the player can collect such as flora, ores, bones, and insects. Investigate the traces of the monster leads to improving the Scout flies' abilities for the quest, eventually enabling them to lead the player via their glowing flight path towards the monster they seek; further, investigating these help the player to gain research towards the monster that helps them gain insight on its strengths, weaknesses, and behavior.The PS4 Pro and Xbox One X players gave you a tough choice where you could either prioritise visuals, frame rate or resolution – depending on your preference.Even when you opted for framerate it was clear the consoles were at their limit. Playing on the PS4 Pro though, you can still notice drops, even when you set it as a priority.On PC you’re free to tweak the settings to your heart’s content, so in theory, if your hardware is up to it, you can have all three and play Monster Hunter World with its graphics maxed in 4K at 60fps-plus framerates.Finally a  avaiable on PC - 9/10They fixed many connections error issues like some of the most commons like ""E_FAIL : hr"" and various matchmaking error, BUT they didn't completely resolve them, as they said:- Fixed an issue where error messages would display and kick players offline while playing multiplayer.They completely fixed every single connection error issue."

Just saying though, the game is in a far better shape than it was at the time of writing this review, so crank the score up a notch!As an absolute MH fan this game is a blast, finally seeing some quality visuals. As someone who is discovering the series ? It's probably a good starting point, definitely the most accessible title of the MH franchise so far. Objectively speaking though, it suffers from quite a few issues. I'll list both pros and cons below in no particular order :Pros :+ Gorgeous graphics, the most obvious one (just compare to older titles and the upcoming MHGU which was the latest entry in Japan before MHW)+ Easy to pick up and play, the convulated systems of the previous games are much more simple now, and everything is explained.+ Training grounds to try your weapons on a static dummy.+ Ability to revert some weapon upgrades (as well as getting the materials refunded)+ This one is subjective, but I love the verticality and complexity of the maps in this game.+ Slinger and specialized tools are nice additions and don't feel gimmicky in that they have actual, consistent uses.+ Very short loading times (in comparison to stock consoles). My game is installed on a SSD and I have 4 ~ 5s loading screens.+ Ability to see the entire upgrade tree of any weapon instead of resorting to 3rd party resources such as Kiranico or the MH Wiki+ Quick access items / Inventory wheel. Beats having to scroll through your entire list of consumables before finding the right item any day mid-quest.+ In the same vein, a lot of information was made readily available in-game, although a lot of it is still vague (but at least it's there). It's more than enough information for the casual player to soak in and make educated decisions.+ Most weapons have revamped, more practical and streamlined movesets.+ More tasks to do in-between quests, more rewarding systems, etc...+ Expeditions (free play in the maps of your choice, no time and death limits)+ No more needs for consumable tools to collect stuff, and collecting and carving in general is much smoother (also hooray for invincibility + super armor carving at the end of a quest)+ Some more details that'll speak more to veteran players than newcomersCons :- Connectivity issues, the most obvious one. Despite having (at the time of writing) 62 hours logged into the game and greatly enjoying it so far, I have without exaggerating spent 7 to 8 hours trying to join friends' sessions (or them join mine) and abandonning quests midway because someone disconnected.- Menus. I find they're a massive cluster**** for a reason I can't fathom. This however might be because I'm very used to the old games' menus, which were very similar to each other and have changed very little over time.- Performance issues. Although my PC can run the game just fine thanks to my specs (above recommended), there were niche instances where everything would stutter or the frames drop. This has only happened during the last Kushala phase with its tornadoes and tempest weather. Might have happened a couple times during VFX-heavy moments where 4 players and the monster would use their flashy moves at the same time.- No one uses the gathering hub (multiplayer hub where you see other players before questing). You can do everything from Astera's lower levels directly and don't need to access the hub to host and start multiplayer quests.- I'm nitpicking on this one but I find it annoying to spawn at the front Astera gate after a quest. I'd rather spawn at the 1F elevator so that I can skip running through the first floor to get to the canteen, or otherwise still have the same distance to run to the 1F NPCs if I have business with them.- Why is the Handler so derpy...- Multiplayers slots remain filled when someone leaves mid-quest or get disconnected so you can't ever have a full party anymore during the remainder of the quest if that happens. Super annoying with the recurrent connectivity issues.- Game is easy in comparison to older games. Also indirectly related to the fact that there is currently no G Rank.All in all, I'd say the game is great. A lot of the needlessly complex systems are much simpler now or have been straight up removed, The game simply suffers from a few - but glaring - issues that must not be overlooked by Capcom. The thing is, as it stands, a unpolished gem and I sincerely hope the game gets fixed sooner rather than later, both to save face towards the new players and making the experience as close to flawless as possible.As for whether I recommend it, I think I've successfully made 20+ people that were on the fence about getting it, buy it, and so far no regrets.Arbitrary score : 7/10"

First off this is a time consuming game, and expect to spend at least a hundred hours into for endgame / true ending. If you play games mostly for the stories and not its gameplay, than this game isn't for you. The game is graphically incredible; the armour, weapons, monsters, characters are all beautiful. MonsterHunterWorld has addicting game-play with a well implemented crafting system. Your character progression is achieved through your own ability getting better, learning the monsters, and upgrading your gear. This all makes for a very rewarding experience. The endless number of collectibles, and the complexity and strategy around how to attack the monsters , and presents an engaging challenge. The game is content packed and also has frequent updates and free DLC.I was hesitant to buy the game at first, there is quite a bit of negative press for it. A lot of issues with connectivity and fps. And now the connectivity issues are largely fixed. The gameworld is rich, with a intense level of detail right down to ants sometimes walking around - there are many item sets to collect, many weapons to master and enough content to keep everyone happy, whether you prefer playing solo and co-op, there is something for you here. The game is absolutely worth every penny. I recommend this game to anyone who loves adventure game, play with friends, build a guild or join one, and share your adventure to the world, these will double the fun and increased the value of the game by ten folds. There's a reason it's sold as many units as it has, and that's because it deserves it. It's not a perfect game, but it's the best in it's series in almost every way, that's exciting. I've never played a Monster Hunter game before, but I'm glad I picked this up. If you are on the fence about this one - buy it! You will not regret it. See you on the hunting grounds!"

UNARMED!- (LAUNCH ONLY) Connection Issues which REALLY get frustrating if you were to play with friends.- It kind of gets tedious when you always have to button mash your way through a conversation with 3 lines or more to talk to interact/talk to someone like a Smithy, Quest Giver, etc.- It would be better to have the main Hub as where you could see players instead of being forced to the Gathering Hub to see others.- Doing story missions in Co-op/Multiplayer could really be a hassle sometimes honestly.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final Verdict: 9.5/10~Note: Honestly this could easily be a GOTY for anyone who enjoys this type of genre, but aswell that but honestly not everyone is gonna like this game and not everyone will.WARNING LAUNCH DAY ONLY, DO NOT BE SUPRISED FOR THE AMOUNT OF CONNECTION ISSUES IF YOU WERE TO PURCHASE THIS GAME AT IT'S CURRENT STATE, THIS WILL GET PATCHED SOON AND CAPCOM AND VALVE ARE WORKING ON IT."

This game is perfect for anyone who likes to sink hours into a game. even once you're done with the main story, you have the freedom to just complete any quest you feel like and it remains fun since the game is rewarding, and it even gives you small epilogue quests. While i'm planning to take a break from the game for the moment, I look forward to returning to the game at some point to complete the Iceborne DLC. My main complaint about the game is that it can be a little overwhelming with the amount of little extras that i found hard to figure out such as the decorations. but this is only minor and i sure this wasn't too bad for other.easy 10/10 thoroughly enjoyed my time"

A great single player and coop game. The DLC is kind of expensive but without it I would probably give this game 6/10 just because it would be missing the core of a true Monster Hunter game (Even with it it's kind of debatable).Gameplay   Deep, satisfying, responsive combat, but some parts like traversing for 10 minutes through vines like Tarzan get pretty tedious and annoying.Graphics    Cool monster hunter art style, lighting, effects all good. Textures are a bit funny in places though.Sound and Atmosphere   Amazing emotional soundtrack, great and diverse monster soundtracks, good hit sounds.Content with DLC , without DLC . A lot to do but no huge variation in difficulty and without personal motivation to slaughter an annoying monster like the old games makes it feel a lot less rewarding. For casuals and newcomers it'll be more than enough though.Overall, a great game for beginners but to me this is missing several parts of what made the old Monster Hunter games so great. Much less challenge, worse progression, much less satisfaction as a result. Crafting is pointless in a lot of places and there is no anticipation for getting a great new piece of gear because it's just marginally better and the same in almost every way. Enjoy all your fully upgraded armour being completely worthless compared to the worst armour from the next tier in difficulty too lol. However I am jaded from old games, new players at all interested should really enjoy this game, the combat alone makes it worth it. I think a fair rating is:Without DLC , with DLC .My subjective opinion is probably: No DLC 6/10 and with DLC 8/10."

If you are new to the series then expect to be turned inside out from your own poopoo hole, but this is ultimately what allows this game to give you one of the most satisfying and rewarding feelings once you have mastered a fight after what feels like hours or even days of suffering and rage. This game also has some great soundtracks that'll motivate you on your journey to turn every monster that has ever bullied you into your ♥♥♥♥♥. Another thing I should bring up is that there are 14 different weapon types that you can choose from and a good majority of them will feel awkward or slow at first, but over time you'll grow an attachment to your weapon or weapons that'll make even the slowest of weapons fun and addicting to use.As someone who loves attention to details in video games in both mechanics and visuals I can say without a doubt that this game has a large amount of detail in it's world, visuals, and mechanics. When I first played this game I had a joy spending hours just walking around the beautifully designed maps that aren't as big as in an open world game, but are filled to the brim with details like tight paths filled with vines that you'll be pushing through, little animals all over the maps that can be captured and kept as pets, hidden paths that'll lead you to another breathtaking area, and breakable environments such as giant boulders that can be dropped on a monster. Before this game was released Monster Hunter wasn't known for having stunning visual details, but now the developers have pushed themselves with the visuals this time and it shows. If you want to appreciate the detail in the world and monsters I highly recommend taking long walks around the maps. Now when it comes to the mechanics in this game I can confidently say that it puts every other game out there to shame because there is sooo much stuff in the mechanics that the game will never tell you and you'll have to figure it out through testing and a lot of math(Or you can just watch videos where big brain individuals break this stuff down). An example of this is that if the middle part of your blade hits the monster it'll multiply the damage dealt by a tiny percentage.Even though I play solo a majority of the time, I still have enough experience playing with others to say that if you want to play this with others then you'll still have a blast, but you'll probably deal with some irritating things like the story quests which require you to view the cutscene before anyone can even join your quest. Despite this it is still great since playing with others and it will lead to some fun experiences even if your team isn't the best. I recommend playing with friends over randoms any day because some will just bother you or try to force you to play how they want. Lastly I suggest you bring a brace jewel so your pals don't keep flinching you by accident with their big weapons when they all decide to go bonk on the monster's head.If this review has not expressed how much I love this game then certainly the +3000 hours of playing this game from a combination of both my characters from PS4 and PC will. Buy it loser."

The game is exactly the same of course, with a few differences that are good and bad. I quickly plugged in my controller because I was just used to that, but go with whatever style suits you. With fourteen different weapon types to choose from and a ton of armor and ability options, it's hard to say not to go with what suits a person personally. Enjoy the hunts, and don't worry if you can't take down a more difficult monster. A few failed missions, and you will learn a lot more than taking one down in a sinlge go. Have fun, don't stagger your friends, and good luck hunters. TLDR: An amazing game with a thriving community, active devs, and beautiful scenery/gameplay."

The story is pretty much their own thing and (at least in the base game) pretty much all the monsters are brand new.MHW tells the story of a nameless hunter (the main character) on an expedition to the “New World”, an unexplored new continent of the MH universe and their adventures and struggles in the new world. Be aware that even when this is the Monster Hunter game with the biggest and most compelling story of the franchise. The story is the weakest point of the experience and can be easily ignored. I will go more in-depth about it later on in this review.At the moment of writing the review, MHW has been out on PC for around 6 years and chances are that if you are an “old school Monster Hunter” fan, you already own it and you already have your own opinion about it. This review is going to be oriented towards those players that are brand new to the franchise or started on Monster Hunter Rise (MHR) and want to check out the previous title.One final warning for players that have never played any Monster Hunter game and are interested in picking up this game: these games are full of weird and complex mechanics that require a lot of time and practice to understand and be competent at them. If you don’t like how that sounds, don’t bother with this game.For me this is the best Monster Hunter game that you can buy on PC. Sure it’s slower paced than MHR, but this game is actually challenging and immersive. I really like MHR but I love MHW. From the more methodical combat, to how the maps feel like a real place.Just be aware of how annoying some parts of this game are. Try to find a group of people that can give you tips and help with the more challenging monsters.Rating: 9/10"

The issues it has don't have an extreme effect on the enjoyability.It looks really good if your rig is good enough to back it up. Some of the armor sets look cool but sadly the most efficient way of playing usually clashes with the most fashionable.I'm a big fan of the music, it can make a fight feel really intense. The sound design is also cool.On mouse and keyboard the controls are alright. My main complaint here is about the radial menu that can be a bit of a pain to navigate. I've heard that it's unintuitive on controller as well. But the most important thing, the movement controls and weapon combos, feel good in my opinion. They just take some time to learn.It's acceptable. Not a game you're gonna want to play for the story though. I have to say that the Handler really grinds my gears, she's incredibly annoying. Luckily, once you're done with the story she doesn't do much anymore. There's not much to say about the remaining characters.Just a quick overview of the gameplay loop first off: You hunt a monster, gather materials, occasionally explore a new map, farm some materials and so on.The start of the game may feel a bit overwhelming because it throws a lot of tutorials at your face and it's a lot to take in at once. It'll take a bit for you to get used to everything but there's nothing that's exceptionally difficult to understand or anything so there's no need to worry.The best part of the game is the combat. Fights can take a while but they don't get boring unless you have to farm a single monster's materials for a very long time, which is rare. It almost feels like every fight in this game is a bossfight, except that it's generally not super difficult. The final boss in particular isn't very challenging but some of the monsters can give you trouble if you're not used to them. The game also picks up in difficulty once you're done with the story, though some of the difficulty just comes from the enemies having more HP and doing more damage.Speaking of the monsters, there's a lot of variety, excluding the few subspecies, and there is a good amount of monsters. Though they're not that many compared to other monster hunter games I personally still feel that there are enough in MHW.What's cool about the monsters is that they feel like they actually belong in the game's world. They have territories, they get tired, get hungry, they sleep and they interact with each other. Most of the realism is lost in favor of better gameplay however, so don't expect the monster AI to be *too* complex.Often times, while you're fighting, another monster might show up and also get into the fray, spicing things up a bit. The environment also plays a role in combat because of height advantages and hazards you can use to help you in your hunt or get caught up in yourself. The world feels rather ""purposeful"".The large selection of weapon types provides a lot of variety because they make for totally new ways of playing. Some of them are easier to learn than others, but they all have a use and there's something for everybody.There are also tons of different individual weapons and armors you can craft. Unfortunately, few of them are unique enough or strong enough to be relevant in the meta once you reach the endgame. The same goes for all the skills in the game. There are so many of them but 90% of them are totally useless and the rest are extremely strong in comparison.Some items have ridiculously low drop rates which means that you'll have to spend a looong time farming if you're a completionist. This is one of my biggest issues with the game.The best examples of this are Kulve Taroth weapons and decorations.Kulve is a raid monster that can drop many otherwise unobtainable unique weapons (literally hundreds of them) and for a lot of weapon types the best one in the game is dropped by this monster which makes farming it very important if you want to make fully optimized sets. This is just terrible. It's like the devs wanted to make getting the best weapons as monotonous as possible to keep people playing for longer. Keep repeating this one single quest and then hope you get the weapon you're looking for. Oh you didn't get it? That's too bad, time to go again...Kulve is probably my least favorite part of the whole game because of this, even though the fight itself is actually pretty good (the first dozen times you do it).Decorations are just as bad, maybe even worse than that. You can get them from many different quests which is good but the problem is that the drop rates of the most powerful jewels can be abysmal. I've seen people who, after playing for more than a thousand hours, still don't have all of them that they need.Fortunately there are mods out there that let you avoid the heavy grind, if that's something you're willing to get into.The multiplayer is mostly fun, especially with friends, but playing with random people can sometimes end in frustration since the limited lives in a quest are shared between players. And it's a bit depressing to have one person mess up and cause everyone else to lose, whether that's you or someone else. So I advise on only playing with random people if you're not super-serious about a quest. Only use the SOS system for fun. There is some beauty in playing with randoms too. Sometimes when I meet someone who uses the same weapon as me and I see them pull off a nice combo or have it interrupted I feel some kind of special bond between us because I understand exactly what it feels like when that happens. Or when you meet someone who makes room for you when the monster is knocked out so you don't interrupt each other. Very nice moments to be had every now and then.I personally haven't noticed any noteable bugs at all yet, I think the game is pretty polished. It also runs well enough.Overall, you can get a ton of playtime out of this game and even if it does get repetitive at some point, you can switch to a new weapon to change things up again."

The community I found was also very supportive, and there'll be lots of experienced players around to help you with hunts you're struggling with, teach you the fundamentals if you're new (although it mostly comes naturally as you play more), or just be there to mess around and have a good time. If you've got time to spare and want an exciting and immersive game to invest yourself in, Monster Hunter World is definitely worth it!Can't wait for Iceborne!"

There was no pre-load ability, no 21:9 support, no SLI/Crossfire support, bad optimization, cannot disable motion blur, mouse acceleration or depth of field, playing with a friend is a nightmare due to co-op restrictions and the keyboard and mouse controls are horrible, voice acting is limited, and the graphics are equal to that of console. Another problem is with the Denuvo DRM program that is giving some PC's major problems even launching the game. Denuvo is also making it difficult for the modding community who're trying to fix this broken mess of a game."

Another issue with the game is compatibility with Nvidia gpu drivers which causes game crashes. This issue can be fixed by playing in borderless window mode or rolling back to a previous driver, and I believe Nvidia is working on a solution for this as well. I understand these issues can be game breaking for many users. This is the first time any of the Monster Hunter franchise games have been released on PC, so I have chosen to be patient with everything.and WOW. I am so glad I have been patient.This game is phenomenal.I don't often leave reviews, but this game. This game. THIS FREAKING GAME. All the yes.Monster hunter world is a beautifully done RPG for those who love exploration, beautiful monsters with stunning attack animations, unique weapon and armor customizations, and for those who absolutely adore dragons. You can use your environment to your advantage during monster fights such as hiding in tall grass so monsters don't see you, leading monsters to one another to cause turf wars that inflict massive damage to both monsters, leading monsters to paratoads to stun them, and natural disasters such as a massive avalanche of water that will cause crazy amounts of damage to whatever you are fighting. You can craft bombs to sit on monsters faces and set them off for large amounts of damage, you can daze monsters with flash bombs, you have to sharpen your weapon during fights to make sure you maintain optimal damage, and the amount of detail brought to each fight goes on and on. You also get an adorable little Palico to fight alongside you. You can gear up your palico buddy with buffs to help other players, or status effects to help poison or stun your enemy more frequently. You gear up according to monster's weaknesses and you can cause status effects to other monsters according to your weapon like stun, poision, etc. There's pages and pages of items you can craft to help you during your fights. You can also take on monsters with friends via multiplayer.To those who complain about this game being too repetitive and grindy the whole purpose of the game is fighting monsters. What did you expect? If you're not into fighting monsters to make gear and advance then don't play the game. Simple.This game was also released on console and the company continues to release free content like adding more monsters to the game and adding events like summer and halloween. These events have happened on console but I expect them to be coming to the PC version soon. Releasing free to play content along the way is rare in this day and age for gaming. Most games release DLC content which must be payed for, so I am super excited that Monster Hunter World will be releasing additional free to play content.I give this game a 10/10. Beautifully done. Definitely worth the price of $59.99"

Local area man wanders into an island with his bi-pedal cat pal and smacks down monsters to wear them and use their skin and bones to defeat even bigger tougher monsters. And so the cycle continues until eventually monsters that used to take you 30 minutes to kill now take a mere 5 minutes. It's a journey of growth and self improvement and there is no greater satisfaction than when everything clicks and you're able to conquer old foes. It's pretty much a game of nonstop boss fights with some farming and gathering on the side (note there are literal farms you can utilize to reduce the gathering needed) as well as a dress up sim with your cat and character which you use the parts of the monsters you've hunted to craft youself new gear.I love this game so much that I previously owned it on PS4 and decided to buy it again for PC to play with friends and experience better load times, etc. At launch there were definitely issues with connection but I have not experienced disconnects in a long while now. Maybe it is different for other players.Load times are nearly non-existant. I have already surpassed my PS4 save (I stopped before Devil Jho came out in anticipation of replaying on PC) with less hours played! It's amazing. The world is so beautiful and this is truly Monster Hunter at its prime. I went to play Generations Ultimate for the classic MH expereince again (I played MH3U and MH4U in the past) after World and the quality of life (QoL) differences were astounding. I missed World immediately. Faster gathering, infinite whetstone and gathering tools, one giant field map instead of zones with loading screens, etc.  I'd say the only real downgrades are less monsters and not being able to play as your Palico - boo! The new monsters are pretty awesome but I do miss the likes of Zinogre, Brachydios, Tigrex and more.Oh, also being forced to play the story again is kind of annoying. Cutscenes really should be skippable in 2018, come on Capcom. The way online is handled for story mode is also rather stupid. If you want to play with a friend you have to each start the mission separately, watch the cutscene, then one leaves and joins the other. However this was a design decision on the Ps4 version as well, equally dumb then. Once you complete the story its not really an issue anymore and MH Vets like to say the story is the tutorial and the real game starts after. Not wrong, really!After the story is completed the world is your oyster really in how you choose to spend your time. Grind for those decorations and augment stones to spoof up your builds and imrpove your kill times, help out others in any ranks, take on tempered monsters,  raise your rank, play with friends, take on the arenas and challenges, and my personal favorite -- experiment with new weapons and builds with all the excess materials gathered!Most people associate PC with hackers; I have only seen one hacker so far and he was harmless - a HR198 yet clearly had not yet beaten the story (only had one tool) and he just hung around the session. The hacker problem isn't really as rampant as one might think and a majority of people want to play the game legit.Overall, if you never played a Monster Hunter game before but have been interested this is the best one to get into thanks to all the QoL changes introduced. And if you played already on console or classic titles I'd still recommend this if have a friend group to play with or would like to meet a new community of hunters.10 outta 10 Palicoes recommend the game."

Just the fact that you can alt tab and open a window to completely bypass the unnecessary anti-cheat they implemented which takes as much or more CPU than the actual game itself is comical.I expected more than a rushed port after the stunted launch of the base game, But I guess the lessons learned were cast away as soon as it was finished because knowledge of PC ports is forbidden black magic in Japan.The base game was great though, I would wait until the bugs are ironed out for the expansion and then it will probably be great, I'll update the review when the port is actually finished and we are done beta testing it."

I had to rollback to 398.36 to fix this issue. Apart from that the game runs good for me, but it definitely should run better than it currently does.Furthermore there's currently a bug that makes textures appear at a low resolution from time to time (especially noticeable in cutscenes).I couldn't bring it over myself to give this game a thumbs down due to the core game being so good, but wait until the first patch arrives and online works properly before you buy this game."

Lots of content and cross over events that keep things fresh and interesting for everyone.9.7/10 :)Edit:It's been a few years, I still play this game. My mother never got better and has passed away. I still play it to take my mind off things. There's a lot to enjoy about the game, and the people you meet can be extremely endearing and amazing people.

Yeah...About 10-15 years back I remember playing it for PS2 (or PSP?) Can't recall. It was an endless kill the same monster over and over until you got enough feathers or bones to make a new weapon, then farm the same map for stone. I played it plenty though, something about those repetitive actions kept me coming back for more. I figured I'd give it another go thinking they HAD to have improved upon the previous versions. They have - though not in a way you would think, but a weird Japanese port from consoles into a heaving mass of keyboard shortcuts, menus inside menus inside menus, customizing like 20 different loadouts. NPC's yelling HEY at you but looking at the map you see hundreds of little icons of where you picked that plant up last time or that rock. Sure, you can turn all of it off but good luck trying to figure out how. It's all there, but using traditional Japanese gaming style is literally buried somewhere in a place you'd never think to look.  Very simiilar to trading guild cards, or joining an online session with some friends or helping a person in need with an SOS signal. everything is overly complicated and complex. It took me twenty minutes just to figure out how to get my grill out and BBQ some fresh meat. If you've played ANY previous MH games, then this will be alright for you - just get yourself a controller otherwise it will take a couple of hours to figure out just where everything is. All of the things that make MH a decent game is there. You get to kill big ass dinosaurs with over the top weapons all while gearing your kitty cat up and making armor from the skin, scales, and teeth of your fallen prey. The graphics are decent though everything has a washed out look to it (Could be my TV I'm color blind) I'm getting no lag and framerate is smooth. I've not had many connection issues with random groups, just people I want to join. Therein lies another issue - I finally got into the game but he played two hours more than me so we couldn't do any quests together, but went on an expedition instead. Overall if you're chomping at the bit to smash in dino heads with a gigantic hammer made of bone, then go ahead. For the lot of you and new players, I'd give it a month or three to see if they're going to iron out any of the connection issues. I highly doubt they'll do anything regarding the interface or the literally five story town with one guy on each floor that you have to talk to everytime you come back from a quest but never tell you who. (or it will say talk to provisions manager but you have no idea where he is located)I do recommend it though because once you get going - its definitely Monster Hunter. EDIT 9.14.18Ok so the connection problems are virtually gone, though you might encounter one or two in the course of a ten hour stretch, nothing that joining a new room or restarting your game won't fix. Also, the menu system is easily solved with a controller. Trying to play this with a keyboard and mouse is beast mode. It can be done, but it's busy. I usually hunt until my controller dies then use keyboard in town to do nonsense stuff like craft or make armor. PLAY WITH FRIENDS! I cannot emphasize this enough. If you are getting this game thinking you can just join MP and have fun you are wrong. The player base in this game is toxic to the touch. People will abandon you if you die 2/3 times or berate you in voice chat for not being elite enough. I shut my voice chat off because I couldn't stand the 15 year old screaming because I didn't roll out of the way fast enough. It's ridiculous. When I play with my core group of friends though - it's hella fun. We die, a lot. We fail, a lot. Our runs take 30 - 45 minutes and none of us care. Learning as you go is half the fun, but there are a lot of hardcore ""rushers"" who will down a monster in 3 minutes and scoff because you couldn't. Playing with SOS (You can call for help and randoms will join your group) groups you will have the one guy who didn't buff or has no clue what he/she is doing and they will waste your time, or they will scream at you and demean you to no end. My favorite is the high HR who comes in just to up the HP of the monster and then stand at base or run away leaving you high and dry. Head over to the steam forums and take a look for yourself at the viciousness if you don't believe me. GET THIS GAME WITH FRIENDS or PLAY SOLO. Still recommend because it's Monster Hunter.Edit: 9.30.18Almost 300 hours inAlmost HR 100 (91)Playing the PC version of the game, you will hit a wall and then you will hit a plateu. I don't think they thought of endgame content. Let me explain:I play with a bow, and there are crucial decorations needed in order for your ""Build"" to be suitable for dmg/def in a group setting. You have to ""farm"" the endgame content for these decos - bu the drop % and RNG system in place make it vittually impossible to attain certain decos. Unless you are super lucky - you will put in 300 hours and maybe have half of what you need - but you will have killed the same monster at least 100 times. Which gets old...like, really quick. There are no shortcuts other than modding the game itself, so if you want to have the best possible build, you're going to have to put the man hours in farming these ""elders"" in order to attain it or be labeled as a cheater because you don't want to endlessly grind for something that will increase your attack by 2%. That's their endgame. LIterally. They did give an another monster in an update, so that was nice...for 50 times, and this new monster has a higher % to drop ""augment stones"" for your weapon which allows you to improve your weapon beyond what it's capable of. Cool.The only problem is you have a 1/14 chance of getting the stone for your weapon and you need multiple stones in order to augment your weapon, and if you make a mistake augmenting your weapon, well, now you're back to square one. So that means more grinding. But then take two minutes to put in some actual thought. Say you farm everything you put in the 100's of hours and RNG has been kind to you and you have all the decos and augments that you need for your build to be it's best. Then what? Everything the game throws at you is literally no challenge. The goals are gone. The game is basically over. Until they release new content - and then you will do it all over again. To me this isn't a game. It's a job that serves no purpose. It's the single reason I left MH on PS2 way back when. Sad that it took me again for a ride. I will see it through - to HR 100 because that's my personal goal. After that, I'm gone regardless of whether or not I have the decorations to fit my build. They announced that they will release another update this coming week, and with it is a promise of new assignments, items, and a free change your character look ticket. That's great, sure. But to me this isn't how an endgame should be. But that's just my opinion. Some people literally worship this game like it's god. I prefer to win and feel satisfied when I play video games. You will never be satisfied in this game as the whole premise is to keep you playing, endlessly in a virtual loop.Hit HR 100 Last night. I'm officially done with the game. Final edits on this lengthy review:After 283 hours logged, I can truthfully say this game is super frustrating. Even getting to 100 literally felt like a job. I managed to get the decos I needed for my build only by modding the % of drops. Then, when I finally completed my awesome build...there was nothing to fight while using it. I spent a good 20 hours just in the training room shooting a post. So bear in mind that this game is FOCUSED on you spending countless hours trying to raise your attack by 5 and then not giving you anything to use it on. They dropped two updates - one with Deviljho and the Harvest Event. Both of which are about 2-5 extra hours of new gameplay.Good Luck."

That being said I adore this game and all the new features that it brings to the table. A whole lot of the features from past Monster Hunter games are returning as well in new flavors such as Palico Quests coming back as the Tailrider Safaris or Moga Farms reappearing as cultivatable items. This is the perfect jumping on point for new players, with easy to learn controls (Even on the PC!) and a slew of new beginner friendly features that only serve to enhance gameplay for veterans, like the scoutflies and the SOS beacons. Tracking a monster and battling it through each distinct environment as both the world and monster accrue battle damage and you gives you a true feeling of accomplishment that few games can pull off and with that I wholeheartedly recommend this game.Graphically the game can get a little intense, your PC might chug a little bit on higher settings but the game will look beautiful if you can manage it. Aesthetically I love the game, each new environment and monster is very unique. The servers have been having a little bit of an issue, if I were to give this game one bump and it would be a huge bump it would be the server stability. I rarely get disconnected from games but I have ungodly amounts of trouble connecting to them."

My boyfriend and I are trying to do the main quests together. One of us can join in, only after cut scenes. Then, there are expedition main quests between regular main quests, and it splits us up again. You can only do a few things together, and it is a huge bummer. You also can't see each other unless you are in the gathering hub or join their quest, vice versa. It is a very strange, backwards way to do groups of 4, or 3 or 2. I would say, either make a game co-op, or don't. But don't make it so you can play together sometimes but not always. It is frustrating."

Monster Hunter World is a game where you are first being introduced into the Monster Hunter Series, the older games are much...harsher on you where as this one isnt, its very convinent and comfortable to play, only problem is....if you buy Iceborne which I do recommend you will be given the Defender Armorset and Weapons.   The Defender Weapons is meant for one thing... kill monsters quickly in the base game for you to get to the Iceborne Expansion quicker and I highly disagree with that.  I got through the base game with the defender guardian armor and hardly took any damage till I got to harder monsters like Bazelgeuse and Deviljho, you dont really get to...fully experience the base game because you can grind alot less and thats kinda the core of Monster Hunter,  you kill monsters to get a certain weapon or armor piece that you want, but with the Defender Armor and Defender Weapons you can just run through the game with not much trouble....till you get to iceborne.

Hello, if you are actually a vet, then you'd know standard MH release practices. If not, please don't complain. Don't go shoving hours into my face expecting me to be impressed. If you know the franchise, then you'd understand this is a VERY good game, and a great rebirth of the series, with plenty more to come now, since the smashing success of world.Also, I understand the frustration with PC issues, from my understanding, some of that falls on Nvidia as well, and that's extremely unfortunate. I hate the knee jerk reaction of the general public to be negative about anything, without expressing positives. I sincerely hope everyone interested give this a fair try instead of being massively frustrated by the walls of negative reviews.

Its value lies also in the scalability of the experience that - it is true - is not yet perfect, but certainly has taken a questionable path.Let me talk about the stuff that pisses me off and the type of problems should not exist in a type of game like Monster Hunter1- [Animations]2-[Co-op Problems]3-[Story]1-The amount of times I have died just because of a stupid [A S S] animation that doesn't make any sense because my character takes 3 billion years to finish a small animation like lifting back up his sword 2 inches, it still baffles me how this exists. The amount of time its takes to drink a potion is stupid, I can go take a [S H I T] and come back and my character would still be drinking his [K A K] potion.2-The co-op gameplay is amazing and should get all the praise it deserves but the cutscene stuff is whack and spoils the fun. I recommend getting a buddy to play with, the sheer fun I had when we saw this big[A S S] Monster, and just staring in wonder and thinking what did we just see.I really wanted to love the end game , I am a big end game fan and I love min-maxing my characters in games like this, especially like in Borderlands, and no I am not comparing Borderlands to Monster Hunter , each game has its own identity and I respect that, I am just talking about the end game element.3-If you enjoy story-driven games or story-heavy RPGs, you may not be interested in this game. Again, that doesn't mean it's a bad game or that it doesn't have a worthwhile story to tell, it's just not anything to write home about either.Monster Hunter: World is a very good game that deserves the praise it's gotten. It's just not for everybody, and it's important to realize. I also enjoy climbing on top of a monster and riding it while attacking, or enlisting other monsters in the hunt. But enough said.Final Verdict : 7.5/10"

The gameplay is by far the biggest hook to this franchise as each entry has built up improving graphically and mechanically from the last and WorldBorne coming to PC an consoles opened up a bigger window for players to experience. The games combat has so much depth to it, i would say it has the best combat In a 3rd person action RPG ever which may be a bold claim to some. You can choose up to 14 different weapon types and they all have insane amounts of depth  and combo potential with every weapon having their on unique movesets and playstyles, some weapons are ranged with a ton of ammo options, some are fast and are able to build up statuses really well and some just deliver a massive amount of damage in just a few swings. Each weapon type is viable and accessible which leaves a large amount of weapon variety and build opportunities open to any type of player. The Monsters of Monster Hunter are what make the game what it is, Epic fights with large Monsters ranging from Dragons, Wyverns, Beasts, fish monsters, Dinosaur like monsters and giant bird Monsters all with their own unique and interesting movesets as if they were fighting game characters. Monsters when kill or captured give the parts as carves or rewards which the player can use to make armour sets which provide skills and resistances.There is so much to this game from the Monsters, weapons, armour, gathering resources, locales, and the general aesthetic to the game that shows how much love and care the Monster Hunter team at Capcom put into the series that it really does put to shame other publishers in the gaming industry that it goes to show you can keep a game growing strong for years with free tittle updates, bug fixes and a beefy and affordable expansion without having to bleed your players dry of their money for a multitude of In-game cosmetics and terrible underbaked DLC's / Expansions that offer little to no content.sorry if the grammar is bad or it looks rushed i just really love this game and it has made me a fan of the series. I'm excited for more to come from Capcom in the future and I've already been playing a lot of Rise on the switch and it is fantastic.Just get it already c'mon"

So, this is my introduction into the series. Ive never played a single one before now, and I was unsure about it when I first got it. When I started playing, I was instantly struck by how GORGEOUS the game is. The looks and sounds are so on point, and certainly memorable. I enjoyed everything from the first cutscene, and on. The story is somewhat shallow, unless you have followed the series beforehand - but as someone who loves deep stories, this didnt bother me at all.I know this is SO overused, but I have to say it - the combat in terms of limitations and movesets is very DarkSouls. You have to time your moves properly otherwise you can wind up leaving yourself wide open for attacks. Every encounter feels badass, and full of excitement. The mounting system is absolutely awesome, and the dynamics with crafting are pretty sweet.My only real complaints with the game is more so [] to be on Steams behalf - disconnection. I disconnect so much from other players in multiplayer so often... I know it will be fixed, so I dont let it bother me, but it can get really overwhelming when you face a Monster buffed for CooP by yourself.All in all, I seriously reccomend this game if you enjoy adventure, crafting, varied battles, replayability, and general mayhem. I am stoked about this title, and honestly can say I really hope for more."

It's a good-enough first step into the PC platform, and content, even if it's catching up to the console, is rapid and consistant.It may not be the flurry of new monsters people are used toIt may not have the wide and wacky variety of weapons and armour (Though we do have some!)It may not even have the same lovable cast that many of us grew up with (Though I'm sure in a few years people will talk the same of handler as we do of our own)But it is solid gameplay. More fluid, Gorgeous-looking, and has it's own premises it lays out and accoplishes. For the first PC entry, the Multiplayer is one of the best so far. While in previous games, you found a lobby, (of max, 4 people) and entered on a mission, now you can find a lobby, (of upto 16 people!) And find either people doing what you want, OR, and this is the huge improvement now, you can head into your mission and fire off an SOS flare, allowing anyone, anywhere, to hop on in and help you out. No need to finagle with lobbies. You still can't replace people who drop out mid-match, but hey. It's progress, and very welcome progress indeed.The major complaints people have about the game tend to be about the things it doesn't have. The variety of monsters, the lack of a larger variety of equiptment (Partly in cause due to the limited number of monsters) the 'few' locals (I do wish there was an ice biome) and the, ah... 'Simplicity' of the weapon designs we currently have. Some also balk at the combining of gunner and blademaster sets into armour everyone can wear, but no-one really complaines. We all know it was needed to survive in the new world.I don't see these as a problem. I see World as a solution. While I whole-heartedly agree, it sucks to not have my favourite monsters in World, and in all likelyhood, will never seen them in World. MH:W provides it's own stomping grounds which prove perfect for the PC-only crowd to get their first taste of the game without being buried by features they can't understand, and have long-since been accepted as 'the norm' by the console crowd. The weapons take on their own style, of small, modular upgrades, and because of that, World also allows you the freedom to rescind said upgrades, to focus your efforts elsewhere.This game is a solid 8.5/10. The game has it's flaws, but it's actively supported, and most the things I find wrong with it, that I so dearly wish to see, are only problems because I've loved and followed the series for most my life. I will never get to swim in the new world, and I've come to accept that. But there's still a chance to see my favourite beasts in the glorious World HD."

Let's start with the good things about this game. The monsters look kinda cool!Now to the real review. I dislike this game, a lot. Why?Well, for one, it's a bad port of a console game that cost me 55 euros, and I regret this decision every second that I spend inside of this laggy mess with sub-par graphics. The aesthetics, and the really weird atmosphere aside, this game is extremely flawed. From connectivity issues, that ruin any chance of you actually having fun with your friends, to unexpected errors popping up seemingly at random. Ignoring those, you start the game and the first thing you have to do is the tutorial, which in and of itself takes about an hour, because you can't skip the idiotic cutscenes, ever. Why is that, exactly? I don't want to look at this ♥♥♥♥, I bought this game to kill/capture monsters, not to listen to some stuck up peppy bit*h called the Handler, as if she ever handles anything other than sitting on her a*s all the time inside the canteen and telling you sh*t to do. But fine, you endure this hour of doing nothing but holding W and skipping whatever crappy dialogue the game throws at you (not fully voiced btw despite the price), and then you're finally able to do missions with your friends. RIGHT? OF COURSE ♥♥♥*ING NOT. They cannot even join you, until you watch another cutscene, every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ new mission. So, if you're playing with a group of friends, and you both start from the same time, you have to start the same mission, each and every one of you, separately, and then quit when all of the cutscenes are watched. Such great game design, holy sh*t. The game is an absolute grindfest for anything, and not in a good way. It's highly RNG based like some free MMORPG you find online, if you're unlucky, well - tough luck! Repeat the same mission over and over, because apparently that's fun and acceptable in a AAA game. Kulve Taroth was also a nice event, if you like getting f*cked over by this crappy design. You want one weapon? Well, either you get lucky, or spend around 50 hours getting it. (Or don't get it at all)The combat itself feels kinda clunky, and the controls are obviously not suited for a PC. Again, this is just a mediocre port that runs terribly on most systems. The story itself (if you can even call it that), boils down to every character being mentally handicapped, and spending their time sitting on their as*es while you complete the most boring fetch quests you can imagine. But hey, in the end you get to kill what's essentially a newborn creature, what a heroic feat. Oh, and I'd like to mention that the credits (which seem to last at least 20 minutes) are also unskippable. Funtimes for all. TL;DR: The story doesn't make sense, and Handler is an absolute b*tch. Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥, seriously."

It's a  Improvement!! (That's an understatement)Yea I know! There's not that much Content in MHW just as yet..

It still follows the style of the series, being a 1-on-1 style fight to the death with giant monsters with comically oversize weapons. However World is better as an ""introductory"" game for those new to the series, although veterans like myself would prefer the older gen style of games like 4 Ultimate and Generations Ultimate."

One thing is for certain, and that is Monster Hunter World introduces you to a whole new world you have never stepped in before. Clocking in at almost 500 hours, I can say for certain that there will always be things for you to do in this game (assuming you have the DLC). The many weapons you can use, the various monsters you fight, the different loadouts for you to create, there is a lot to learn. Completing a hunt by yourself with many minutes to spare or barely cutting it close by just a few seconds, you feel this different kind of satisfaction you don't get playing another game, no matter who you're fighting. Be it solo or co-op with randoms or friends the fun never stops. Not to mention the awesome community that you instantly become a part of once you start playing the game! If you ever feel you need the help or just company for your hunts you can send an SOS and people will join to help you no matter who you're fighting! All in all, I know this review isn't a very good one but I hope it's enough for people to give it a shot because it is definitely worth it.Rating 8-8.5/10"

I have hundreds of hours between platforms and I still see new interactions between monsters or find new ways to interact with the environment.The combat is incredibly well thought out and complex without being unbalanced. There is no optimum meta build that everyone uses because each and every weapon is capable. It's just about what playstyle you find fun and mastering it. It's your choice to be a slow hard hitting turtle or a quick dashing archer. Your choice to focus heavy combos or to unleash constant slashing damage. It's your choice to fly through the air on  a pogo stick with  a beetle as companion or to lay sick doots to cheer on your fellow hunters.

Joined many hunts to meet many kinds of hunters from different regions or countries. We met and became friends as regular teammates since the first released of Kulve Taroth I remembered. From a squad of 4 players slowly build to bigger group and created a family session at last after many recruited through long journeys, although some hunters joined in and left out.  We shared our thoughts, our fights, our knowledge, our success, our completion, our celebration, our suffered, our failed, our joy, our depression, our conflicts and surely including our carted(fainted). The more we carted, the more we stronger. Learnt from mistakes to improve ourselves, but importantly help yourself equals to help your teammates. Even though we added each other personal info in social media for further still able to contact together what if we might be retired or quit this game one day.

They keep experimenting, keeping everything fresh every single time, and never overstay their welcome in one success game by milking it.

Fashion hunter dreams come true!I recommend buying Iceborne for (more) multiplayer chances as this game is older now.Take your time :)-A gorgeous world, various weapons with different playstyles and a ton of costumisation options for your armor(-which can look good if you are a lucky fella-) await! And let's not forget about the monsters even a noob like me can overthrow (most of the times at least).Since I never seriously picked up an older game of this franchise I can not compare but I heard, that this game is rather easy. There are a few monsters I'd consider a challenge but I am not the person that should judge their strength for you. There are way more fit people for this task out there.I spend a decent amount of time in the New World and do not regret the joy I felt while exploring it. But remember: If you are not into grinding, that sometimes feels like a ridiculous gamble, the endgame will be a real pain for you (at least now without too many updates/additions).Edit1 about the game:With Iceborne (or some update?), you can now be the greatest fashion hunter of all time! No luck (except for the ingredients) needed!I am in love!The endgame grind I am talking about above is min-maxing.It's the hardcore endgame, to clarify. It has gotten better (Deco Quests always available) but also worse (more Decos in the pool) to obtain the exact things you are looking for. It's still a rough road until you can have a 100% optimized meta set (if that is your preferred playstyle. Otherwise: Do not be afraid to deviate from the meta path and mix and match along the way).Should this be your only reason to not buy this game, still buy it!Edit2 for new buyers:It has been some years and I am currently revisiting this game. It's still a strong recommendation, however I would advocate you to buy Iceborne as well if you are looking for the multiplayer experience (with random friends), as many people try to get to the (Iceborne) endgame as fast as possible.This game is somewhat ""old"" now (but still really pretty and fantastic), hence there are less people playing( - it is not a dead game, just not comparable to release). To increase the chance of meeting someone (of your level), you would need the World lategame or the Iceborne experience.Capcom provides you with a ""cheating"" armor (incredibly high stats) in World, to rush through the base game.NEVERTHELESS, I do not endorse to rush through the basegame with said armor, as you discover the New World which is big part of what makes this game so fascinating. It's a journey you can sink many hours into, but I guess that depends on your goals. If you have a mate to play with or do not mind some more solo action, definitely take your time to discover this masterpiece!"

The new mechanics are crazy fun and you can do some crazy things that are actually really fun! You can be flashy with literally any weapon and you'll feel like a badass slaying monsters with everything and anything...But that's also the issue I have with the game. You can do anything with anything! It's definitely easier when compared to the other games in the franchise, probably because of the fact that ""singleplayer"" and multiplayer are mixed into one in this game. The quests that you can do are the exact same whether you play solo or with friends- Therefore, farming a hard monster in solo is considerably easier than doing it in a party, or at least that's my experience!To give a practical example : in Monster Hunter Freedom Unite , if I wanted to fight a White Fatalis solo, I HAD to fight it in its fixed difficulty, because you can only accept his quest from a MULTIPLAYER Gathering Hub! So the quests were already in ""multiplayer difficulty"" making the game hard for solo players and enforcing co-op.In Monster Hunter World, you can do the hardest quest in the game either solo or with a party, but the difficulty when in a party increases ABNORMALLY to the point where monsters can one-shot you, whilst if you went solo they would not and you'd have a way easier time... so this is basically going against the ""hey let's team up to beat that hard quest!"" and actually pushing you towards a ""I'd better do this hard quest solo as the monsters are just too strong in multiplayer"".And I'm not even considering the skill of the players, because it's unbalancedly harder even if they're all good hunters!Tl;dr This game is Monster Hunter, it's great. Solo play and multiplayer are fun as heck and it's just gonna get better and better with the free updates that it's gonna get over time. My only complaint is that playing solo is way easier and you can complete all of the game without ever needing to party up.P.S. CAPCOM PLEASE HURRY UP, I WANT THE DANTE GEAR"

Plain and simple. Many people feel abandoned and partly cash grabbed. Content is just running out, making the game boring after a while. Farming gems for the same monsters you got them from is not fun at all.Due to the success of the PC sales I expect a lot for the future. Addition of the G-rank, ice map and bug type monsters would be epic.The later stages of the game get boring. Just too easy and too few monsters. The G-rank would be a huge help.It just feels that there is no point to fight the non-Elder Dragons. The normal big monsters need something.The raw mouse input should have been at the start... No going around it. Fix way too late.The game could be near perfect by fixing a couple of annoying features. (MHW has it easy to be honest unlike some other games that have had to do stupid amounts of work) That is why I think it is arrogant to say that fixes require too much work or *not worth*.Statements like that devalue customers who have actually bought the game by not seeing them worth working for.Some key points:-The hit boxes are awful at times, usually mediocre or semi-frustrating. Always room to improve :) (Tail hit boxes while monster charging etc.)-Let people advance through story together. Really mean it..-Some minor UI tweaks (i.e. Decoration reroll ritual sell button should not be green and big. Needs 'take all' button)-Use keybindings separately and not in a form of action groups as in (carve/special attack/talk) opens a possibility of utilising keyboard better-Let KB use the quick menu instantly by pressing a hot key (quick-crafting, emotes, items, etc) ""F1 to instantly craft item x""A decent game but it could be SO MUCH MORE.

A wonderful gameplay loop that you can enjoy with friends and strangers alike.First off, the game has 14 different types of weapon, each would requires hours to master and gameplay are somewhat different from each other. Some weapon types are divided down into further sub set of smaller customizations, which will make the gameplay more complex, more contents. And much like hero shooter arena, there is weapon for different type of person. You can be a range weapon user that prioritize safe, slow approach. Risk and reward with heavy hitter that make you scream the for the whole sword swing animation, hoping the monster dont interrupt your glorious big sword. Or simply madness rushing enemies to land as much damamge as possible in short time. The game has complexity, grindy, yet only if you wish to do so. For example: You can eat food to buff yourself before a hunt start. You can simply choose any pre-set available dish. Or you can dive down into the whole picking the correct food combination, fresh ingredient, doing optional quest to unlock best ingredient to further powerup you character. Yet, the differences between those are mininal, like getting killed by monster in 2,5 vs 3 hit. - Grinding for optimal gear is a choice, luck base, yet you dont have to get the best stuff to mounting down monster. You can becomes a badass with single set of armor, an optimal hunter with mix set to hunt down specific kind of monster. Or just forget all those ♥♥♥♥♥ and state your own fashion with either cosmetic item (to be released in future) or pick any thing you feel pretty and at the same times making the game incredible difficult. And while you would hunt a specific monster for its loot to gain specific stuff, every hunt has slight variation: You can see your target fighting turf war with other monster, you can kill non-target monster for more loot per run, you can lure target into bait or environment trap. Each hunt also allow you to gain ""track experience"" through finding other monster, which then create optional quest for that specific one. The more you hunt, the easier it becomes to track down, understanding the weakness. The variety is even more engaging with multiplayers and combination of other 14 weapons. And by the time you hunt every monster there is to be, you still have 13 more weapons to try out and master.The fun greatly outweight the problem this game current have.---PC version issue: as correct as August 2018- (FIXED) Game getting slow down the more you play: It is specific by save game. Reset PC might help but issues still persist- Inconsistent performance across different kind of hardware- (STABLE NOW) Server down time randomly: When it works, it is perfect. When it has problem, you cant even create or join an online session.- No option to turn off depth of field, increase field of view.- Forced lower texture resolution bug, not happen to me personally but many other people have.- (FIXED) Prone to crash or disconnetion when alt+tab- No widescreen support- Some graphic option does not work- Low level of sound quality (Unless you use headphone)PC version highlight:+ Rebindable for mouse and keyboard control, especially item wheel (radial menu)+ Smooth transition between mouse and keyboard to insta controller. + Raw mouse input is available (Oct 2018)"

Yes.Will I also keep complaining about the current issues? Yes.MH:W is a decent port with really distasteful cons.1. If you're playing with a keyboard and mouse you're going to notice the notorious 'input lag' & 'smoothing' issues with the mouse. Have fun dodging fast attacks when your mouse input feels like you're 0.5 seconds behind.2. Connectivity issues. I've spent more time trying to get into my friends sessions or the quests than actually playing the game. I've had to do some tweaks here and there like opening up ports to get it to work properly.3. Multiplayer is hardly enjoyable. The game forces you to go through the story line solo, and you have to get past the cut-scenes to be able to invite a friend. Even then it just ♥♥♥♥♥ up and you usually can't join anyone unless your friend has completed the quest first. Which means they have to play the same quests twice to be able to play with you.Hopefully they will push out patches to fix the issues listed above soon. Only then will this review change to a positive one.Apart from all the cons, the Deluxe Edition is not worth the money unless you like to be pretty in-game, so save yourself some bucks and get the standard edition.This review will be updated as I keep playing.Also for the people experiencing disconnecting issues with Steam/MH:W, I wrote a little guide which I followed to fix the problem. It may or may not work for you.Fixing steam disconnecting issue:(If deemed necessary, turn back to factory settings on your modem/router before starting this process.)1.

Playing on a decent rig.  Runs smooth as hell, havn't lost any frames.  The game is fantastic in every gameplay aspect.  A significant improvement over the PS4 version.  The load times are literally 50 times faster.  There are server issues here at the start, exactly like any multiplayer game at release getting bogged down.  It'll get fixed.  How fast?  The blink of an eye in the grand scheme of things.  This is the definitive Monster Hunter World, without question.  Bring a solid rig to play and it's golden.

The down votes are deserved, but not because this isn't a good game. Rather, there are some glaring issues that need to be addressed (and honestly should have been discovered and polished out during the delayed launch on the PC platform).Capcom, please:Despite the issues, MHW in my opinion is the best version in the franchise that I’ve played. It does a much better job at introducing new players to the game, though could still be improved. The graphics and sound are amazing, and if the issues above didn’t exist, it would also be particularly immersive.The most recent monster hunter game I’ve played (aside from the spin-off MH Stories) is MH Generations for the 3DS.

The game play is very fun! It is a mix of swinging giant weapons at a big monster and the strategic use of items, moves, and the environment.

You can run while using items, (cept for traps ofc) which is a HUGE help considering that a big-ass monster is always after you. Crafting is a breeze since you can automatically have things crafted as you gather mats. Gathering is also easier since you can just spam the gather button while passing by resources (although there are special nodes that could be mined a lot that requires you to stop).The servers aren't stable yet, but once it is, this would be a pretty fun game for enthusiasts and newbies alike. Just a friendly reminder, though, this game isn't easy. Don't expect it to hold your hand and the monsters could one shot you if you don't know how to dodge/block. To quote a comment I read today, this game isn't for people who think they are Rambo. I mean, unless you're a light bowgun user lmao.If you want a challenging game and you don't have the phrase ""I quit."" in your vocabulary, hop right in! This is fun!"

I pre ordered Monster Hunter World and was not disappointed, it has everything the old games have, and have many quality of life improvements, the fact that you can join people mid hunt being the biggest one. If you've never played a Monster Hunter game before, imagine world building and biology on or surpassing the Witcher 3. The thought and logic behind the biology and ecology of all the different monsters and how they interact with each other is the best i’ve seen in any video game. The zoology in these games is what made me interested in them in the first place. In the old games you had cutscenes to see how they interacted with their environment, nothing in game besides leaving the fight for a snack, in World you can see the interactions in the game, during and out of combat. The story of MHW is nowhere near the Witcher but the game play is some of the most rewarding, repeatable, and fun combat of any action game. There is no character leveling at all instead everything is based on your equipment. There are 14 different weapons that have been added and improved on in all of the previous MH games so in World each weapon type is deeper and more finely tuned than most combat systems of other games, and there's 14 different one all of the same quality. You can switch between any weapon at any time. Many of the monsters have been iterated on for 5 generations so like the weapons they are constantly being improved, and the new monsters are made with the experience of a 15 year old franchise yet still brings new creative ideas forward. The equipment and sets have extremely deep and complex systems working behind what you can actually see. The variety and fun wacky things you can do with your armor and sert bonuses almost has no end. Sure the current meta of Fatalis equipment for raw and 5 set safi for element with kjaar weapons. However this stage of the game is at the end and there's nothing stopping you from using anything else you want.This is my personal favorite game that I have ever played and you could argue that there are disappointing things in the equipment meta like how weakness exploit got crapped on if you don’t have Iceborne, but the game as a whole is so good that minor things like that are just insignificant in comparison to all of the great parts of this game. Infact Weakness exploit being nerfed so hard encourages people without iceborne to play with people who have it. Giving people an ingame reason to play multiplayer and make friends with real people. I highly recommend anyone and everyone should try Monster Hunter World and Iceborne."

I can for sure tell you that Capcom has definitely fixed a lot of quality of life issues with World for the better. That being said, and especially with Iceborne around the corner, there are some glaring issues that are massively holding World back from feeling like an authentic Monster Hunter experience. The largest issue World has right now, in my opinion, is the slap on, sorry excuse for half the weapons in the game.In previous titles, if a monster had a weapon in every weapon category, EVERY single one of those weapons would be a unique model that felt like it was actually crafted from the materials used to create it. Unlike in World, where we see scraps of the monster that you hunt poorly glued on to the hilt of any old boring bone or iron starter weapon. This is especially criminal when you've hunted an elder dragon, only to discover its weapons are pieces of the monster in question glued on to a bone greatsword. Not to even mention the existing designs for older monsters such as Barroth that have no excuse to not retain their old weapon designs, I'm looking at you Glavenous Greatsword...Considering Capcom has sold more than 7 million copies, this is completely inexcusable. Being able to hunt monsters and make sweet equipment out of them is a fundamental element and source of rewarding progression in the entire franchise. My only other gripe is that the game still does not provide a single-player option when trying to just solo. It feels very awkward, especially if you mostly play solo like myself. This is a feature that would be extremely easy to implement and it's just a shame that this has not happened yet.I know this post may seem nit-picky, but for someone who is very passionate about this franchise I've been playing for a decade, it's just extremely frustrating knowing that one of the main motivations and rewards for hunting a monster in the first place is lost. If this is your first Monster Hunter game, I would urge you to look at the old weapon designs for even something like Barroth, and come back when you see how well implemented and original the designs used to be.I understand that this is a process that takes time and effort, but I feel Capcom has more than enough recourses to fix this easily. Its something that has been done in every single MH game before World. Don't settle for less, fight for more.edit: what i meant by the offline, is that there is no existing option when your selecting your character to go into an offline mode. and the only reason i thumbed down this game is because i am disappointed with Capcoms lack of focus on what i feel is a core reward for MH games. When i was messing around with the end game of non icebourne content, i felt like i didnt have that grocery list of things i wanted to do like i had in other games from the series."

Funny enough, it's the first Monster Hunter game I've ever played. so you can count on me being unbiased and judging the game based on its own merits, instead of other games in the series. as with all of my reviews, I will be reviewing the game based on sound, graphics, and gameplay in its own category. This game has been played and reviewed using a Xbox One wired controller. Unfortunate to say I have not tried the keyboard and mouse.SOUND:  The Games soundtrack consists of various themes based on the location you happen to be in, as well as personal themes for each monster you fight. Each one does its best to make it memorable, but I feel sometimes it just doesn't hit the right kind of vibe with me. just do what I do, when you happen to get tired of listening to the music. turn on some personal music of yours, and fight the monster with your own interpretation. as for the sounds of everything else, the monsters sound absolutely frightening, as they should. The Ambiance does just what it needs to do to put you in the mood to go around and look for footprints and other such things as you Traverse around.GRAPHICS: many of the environments that you will be exploring are vibrant and wonderful to look at. from the beach to the crystals of Elders recess, to the graveyard of the rotten Vale, every place you visit will Often be a spectacle. You will definitely be happy to explore as Not one place is similar to the other. Not only this, but the monsters themselves are detailed very well, having fluid animations when they ready up to attack you with all sorts of different Elemental attacks. you will even be happy to take note of your armor, each one varying with a theme of the monster that you find In each tree. Expect to be dazzled with each encounter, as each one is more structurally complex than the next. of course not every monster is going to be easy for you to see from the backdrop, one in particular, which is a dragon made entirely of metal, can be hard to see Pieces of it falling off for you to collect. Luckily, they do have options for those color blind so do not worry. They thought of us.GAMEPLAY: the most important element, next to the video element in any game, is the game play. And I can honestly say that it's probably one of my favorite types of gameplay. one might think that monster hunter would be similar to Dark Souls in that you take turns Circling each other and striking when the time is right, dodging enemy fire with the Press of a button. I can tell you right here that it's probably even more complex then what Dark Souls had in mind. there are a variety of weapons from the sword and shield, to a heavy bowgun that will take some time to get used to, but is often rewarding with How heavy the combat feels. long-range weapons often have a special ability that you can activate by pressing a button, from turning your gun to essentially a sniper rifle, or a Mini gun that can produce a great amount of damage. melee weapons, like swords and axes are based on different types of combos you can Use to produce a great amount of damage. with these kind of weapons if you're doing good enough, you can essentially break off pieces of the monster, resulting in them greatly losing the effectiveness of a certain attack, or opening themselves up to even more damage of a particular type. my personal favorite so far happens to be a mix between the heavy bowgun, And the sword and shield. while it is generally a good idea to be familiar with a  specific weapon in mind, it's even more beneficial to familiarize yourself with Two or more different weapons. Not only does it spice up the gameplay a bit for you, but it is also a necessity as certain monsters are more vulnerable to certain Styles.You start the Monster hunting by eating food, which can be done by visiting the canteen either in town, or at the table When you first arrive in an area. Eating food will boost your health, stamina, and will often benefit you with various timed abilities that will help you depending on the play style that you choose. upon reaching an area, your goal  is to track the monster described in your mission, find it, and often hunt it down or capture it with a variety of different Traps at your disposal. This often means finding Footprints, scrapes on the ground, bits and pieces of the monster, or even animal corpses left from there snacking for you to find where they are on the map. Upon finding said monster, you must do as much damage as possible, and while it is much more rewarding money wise to take a monster out yourself, the game really shines when you have friends or random invites join your game to take down a monster with you. often times I find myself with a variety of different people, with a different weapon that they often use to make difficult encounters just slightly easier. upon killing a monster, you can carve them to get a little extra pieces for that special helmet you wanted, upon completing a mission, you will be rewarded not only money, but points that you can add to your total depending on how many items you have found and collected, as well as how many tracks you discovered, and they will be necessary for you to have as they can also be used as money in certain areas around the Hub world, but also they might be the only thing that the NPC you're talking to will accept. For such an example, botany Will be a major role in your Hub world as you can grow things that you find yourself not collecting as often as you need. such items are usually mixed to create new items like potions and damage Buffs that you will absolutely need in order to take down a particularly hard monster. Monster hunting is the name of the game, and while other people that are spoiled rotten in other games such as Skyrim might not look at this game as rewarding just by slaughtering monsters But they are doing themselves a huge disservice. and while most people would consider this game a real-time RPG, it's definitely Much more complex than that.OVERALL:  if you're looking for a game that rewards you for learning your weapon, and a fun multiplayer game with your friends that are into role-playing games, This is the game for you. While the price tag for this game being $60 is steep too many people, this game will have you coming back Over and over. With just one concept, it's surprising just how addictive Monster hunting can be. See you on the field!TL;DR:  As a person who's never played a monster hunter game until now, this is perfect to spend hours with your friends on."

Some people I know still experience connection issues occasionally, but very rarely, and I haven't experienced any.More graphics settings have been added since release, while the mouse movement issue is likely due to porting from consoles where controller is normal, things like bloom and motion blur can now be addressed.Gameplay still exhibits the same design flaws, especially compared to MH4U/GU, though this is likely because the game is balanced around Temporal Mantle, which is another balance problem in its own right. However, due to connection issues, the primary reason for the negative review, have been mostly fixed, I can recommend this game.-----------------------------Cannot recommend game in current state due to listed reasons. The game itself is good but the port has major flaws.1. Constant connection issues - Very common to randomly disconnect from online sessions/quests with no option to reconnect to the latter. Internet on my end is fine for all other applications running.When attempting to join via SOS, will also randomly return a failed to join error. In the main storyline, you are not allowed to join your friends unless you go in yourself and get through every cut-scene first, some of which are not necessarily in the beginning of the quest and may appear mid-quest. This is not very multiplayer friendly as well as their attempt to shove the storyline down your throat, both with unskippable and mandatory cutscenes even if you are playing on second or third character.2. Keybind options copied over from console - This leads to very counter-intuitive options that make sense on console but not on Mouse and Keyboard where you have access to more keys. You are not allowed to leave anything unbound, and certain actions are still forcibly tied to the same key, such as sheathing/unsheathing and sprinting, for example. A more personal issue is that I still cannot figure out how to use the radial menu when set to Keyboard after almost 20 hours of gameplay.As a bonus, you also cannot rebind the controls if you opt to use a controller. Controller prompts also used XBox control keys even when I was using a PS4 controller to test it out in the training area.3. Lack of very basic graphic options aside from the bare necessities - game does not allow you to toggle:-Field of View-Mouse Acceleration-Motion Blur-Bloomalongside other issues such as popping due to viewdistance and graphic options being very vague and possibly bugged.4. Gameplay Issues - Most attacks are telegraphed which is done well, but when you are not in a wide open battle arena, monsters will basically ignore their own telegraphs and break the laws of physics, such as rolling in one direction but actually sliding sideways, clipping through rock formations to hit you instead of colliding with the terrain, and more. A more personal issues is the constant yelling that force-stuns all players within vicinity that are not guarding and forcefully disrupts combat flow. I have had multiple occasions where I would enter a phase that lasted less than one minute, with about 10-15 of the 60 seconds being a barely telegraphed yell to force a halt to combat. A very frustrating and poorly designed mechanic, as this usually occurs during the beginning and end of a combat phase, as well as multiple times in between. Another personal issue is how certain monsters that kill you in two blows when the first hit leaves you stunned for slowed with how armor works in the game. To have access to any decent high rank armor, you will have to suffer through getting essentially one-comboed. This won't be a problem for veteran players but for players like me where this is their first Monster Hunter, it is frustrating. This becomes particuarly troublesome due to cinematic camera pans, as I actually fainted this way when I could not see or pan my camera due to forced cinematic camera when a new monster appeared, and I died in two hits after taking the first and getting knocked down. The game is fine but the port ruins the PC experience, especially the constant connection issues."

It feels a lot like they sacrificed gameplay in favor of graphics; none of the fights have been particularly challenging and a lot of the times it feels like monsters are just attacking the air around you. Environments feel a bit busy as there are often multiple large monsters on the same map which is cool, but it feels like they don't really matter because they don't do much. For me it just feels more mindless than other mh games. Granted all my friends enjoy it, and most of the reviews are positive, so it's obviously a good game. I personally don't enjoy it and wouldn't recommend it, but I'd definitely recommend giving it a chance if you're on the fence."

And now there's random stuttering in some places.Everything else wrong with the game?  Still untouched.2 weeks for nothing; thanks Capcom!: 2 weeks without a patch.Playerbase has halved and the connection issues are still completely rampant.Game is down to 38% positive reviews CAPCOM ruin yet another title with their incompetence.---EDIT: , can lose your save files instantly.EDIT2: Apparently it's a codec issue. ----The game has numerous CPU related issues (notable one is spawning 32 threads and crippling CPUs).  Use SpecialK to fix these issues and significantly lower CPU usage and increase performance on lower spec machines: ---.  (locked to 16:9)- This includes 4:3, 5:4, 16:10, 21:9, 32:9, and all multi-monitor configurations. -- : --- You have to restart the game to change window mode or resolution.---- You can't change a number of graphics options while in-game..  (default controls are very strange)- To further elaborate, the controls are nothing like any game I've ever seen before.  The most you can do is swap the L/R buttons so ex. R1 fires and R2 runs.  Additionally, practically , some which seems random at times, especially in menus and with certain weapon types.  It's  hard to keep track of.It is utterly asinine if you've played most action RPGs that exist. The controls are uncomfortable, confusing, and we have to deal with it because for some godforsaken reason they couldn't add gamepad remapping, be it ingame or via Steam.--  Dualshock users are shafted.Edit:  It was already in the game files and the Steam API presented the controller to the game. Capcom failed miserably at porting.--- Controller may not even work at all if Steam's native support for it is disabled.  It's borderline unusable.- See this video for example/explanation: -- Strangely the mouse operates just fine in the menus, with some slight input lag. Way better map control than gamepad.Keyboard control is sub-par, notably in menus, but otherwise usable. Expect to rebind stuff though.- There's no way to slowly walk with keyboard.-- Certain keys cannot be bound.Camera control keys hardcoded to OKL; and cannot be changed.Overall, it feels like a console game in design through and through.  Repeated ""saving don't turn off the game"" messages, menus are clunky with KB/M and take far too long to do anything, etc. You can't even exit the options menu without it prompting you to save, even if nothing changed, and if you decline it's just an endless loop.  It takes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minute to get to the main menu..  Some textures are LOWER QUALITY than the console version, presumably due to a bug. ,  This was discovered a month before launch and still isn't fixed..   It's  aggressive and 70% of the screen is regularly blurred in cutscenes.  Even opening your map the entire screen is blurred: - Denuvo is blocking attempts to disable DoF and Motion Blur.  #DRMFXAA and TAA only.  Both blur the screen to ludicrous levels and barely help the aliasing.  (Yet again another game that lacks the superior SMAA)Ambient Occlusion is low quality and produces a grid-like pattern on character models.  This is ugly and nothing can be done to remedy it besides turning off AO, ruining the shadowing.Performance is very poor for the 1:1 port this is. Volumetric fog chunks framerate by 20%, ontop of making everything look washed out.  Best to disable it both for performance and image quality (in most areas).  On a weaker system?  You're gonna struggle.- Water reflections only change the color of water in certain lighting and cause immense draw call increases, disable them too.- Screen Space Reflections are broken and do nothing but lower framerate, again disable them too.- Anisotropic filtering is broken and does nothing, must force from GPU drivers.- Load times are based on framerate.  Running at a high framerate significantly lowers load times.  RIP Vsync users (which should be everyone, because tearing is terrible).- Elemental effects on attacks cause stuttering and massive frame drops.  Someone could be on the complete opposite side of the map as you but your game is constantly stuttering every time they hit something.  There is no way to fix this.Voice acting is only used in certain parts of the game. Cannot go through cutscenes with other people. You have to be solo to watch them.- Gonna co-op with a friend? One of you needs to complete the campaign first! ..or start the quest, play up until you see the cutscene, exit quest, re-group; .  Just wtf?-- Lobby system is also terrible. Squads use Steam Groups, not anything ingame.  You can only see other players in the 'gathering hub', an area almost no one goes to.  There's a max of 16 people in one 'lobby' at a time, and most only have 1-3 people with only ~15 lobbies displayed in the lobby finder at a time.--- There are endless connection issues from the game servers being overloaded.  It's been over a week and all Capcom has said was ""we're working on it"".  Multiplayer is effectively broken. Edit: Patch 2 weeks later only fixed people disconnecting mid mission; still numerous issues.Item saving system is convoluted as hell and your item bar/wheels are saved to specific loadouts. The game never tells you this.Monster parts are listed as being separate for 'carve' and 'reward' options.  The 'carve' parts can all be obtained from rewards, misleading players into thinking they have to kill/carve the monster to obtain them (vs capturing).7 months to port the game and they couldn't do it properly, despite saying they were taking the time to do it properly.Now to wait and see how quickly modders fix it.Good thing there's $51 worth of DLC already."

I figure people want to know what the game is like, but also about how it compares. I'll try to do that concisely.The Game:Monster Hunter is a challenging game that rewards teamwork, creative thinking re: item and environment use, caution, timing, and positioning. It has a vast amount of equipment you can make in armor and weapons of varying damage and element types, and a wide range of weapons with (IMO) some pretty cool, unusual mechanics. Most of those require parts from the monsters you'll be hunting, so if you're planning to acquire a range of stuff, you'll be killing a lot of monsters. This is why people will tell you that it's a grind: the crafting.Ideally you're playing the game because you want to hunt monsters, so for me it doesn't feel like much of a grind unless I'm getting screwed by RNG - sometimes the rare-drop gems are frustrating to acquire - but in most cases the game gives you alternate ways to acquire things you need (cultivating plant/insect products, using the Melder to buy gems or other parts with tickets or items you're not using).There are a TON of quality of life improvements in MH:W versus prior MH games. Being able to move (even sprint!) while using consumables, not having to forage for your whetstones or paintballs, being able to access your storage and all of your gear at camp on a mission, no loading screens between zones - sometimes it's the little things that bring the most joy. :)Visuals are somewhat subjective. I think MH:W is a very pretty game, but YMMV.The Port:EDIT: As of this review, the multiplayer connection problems seem to have been solved. Yay!EDIT2: You can now set private online sessions for Friends Only and actually have it work properly, and there's 21:9 support, double hooray! I prefer using the controller even for the port. I have friends who have made the switch to KB+M. This is probably just down to personal preference. AFAIK there's no raw mouse setting, but they did add additional control options for mouse that are supposed to come pretty close to more traditional mouse control for PC. YMMV.Conclusion: This is a competent port if what you want from the game is for the game to play in a manner equivalent to the PS4, with RADICALLY better load times (10, 15 seconds for me, not over a minute, like PS4!) and 60FPS, on a PC, on steam, with your friends.If what you want is for the game to play like most FPS games on PC, with character movement that doesn't feel like it does on console, then you may be disappointed. It's very Souls-esque in that way -- it still has that weighty, Monster Hunter feel, even on PC. It is not going to feel like it's built on the Source engine."

It adds a lot of quality of life improvements, without changing or ruining the core mechanics of the monster hunter franchise.If you buy this just to play the main story, and then never play it again, I have to say it's not worth your 60 bucks.This thrill of the franchise is to learn monster patterns, and improve your play against every monster, while collecting armor and weapon sets.

So here's a short review of the game (PC VER.).ρՐԾՏ:• Pc port performance is quite good.• Incredibly deep and rewarding gameplay.• Beautiful and varied world with so much varieties.• Each monster is different and requires knowledge about the monster to actually beat it in the proper way this gives a feel of a boss fight every time.• Story is moderately good and engaging. • The dense wildlife sounds are so good and many monsters can be identified through their cries, footsteps, and other audio intels.• Combat is great controls might need some tweaking but it's great and weapon types and list is massive and diverse.• Tons of customization also character creation is quite good. • Environmental hazards are something you always have to be careful about as nature can ruin your day beside monsters.• Food cooked by cat chefs what more do you want man :pς๏ภร::• Troublesome design with forced online interactivity.• lip sync is totally crap.• Multiplayer matches can be fiddly to set up.• The new verticality of levels occasionally leads to frustrating AI pathing glitches.• Denuvo DRM I simply can never make myself to like it.• Some notable problems [Motion Blur Depth of Field Bloom/Glow Effects Mouse Acceleration] no way to turn them off needs fixing.• Might face problem with controllers.In the End this game is a must buy for playing coops because coop is the heart of this game. If you love jrpg just buy it. A tip **Try turning off volumetric rendering for a significant fps boost**.  Getting 60fps@Gtx 970 1080p  !!Totally RECOMMENDED!!"

This game can provide you a lot of things such as exploring the MH world, Damn lot of monsters, and mostly fun by experiencing them. If you have friends to play with, I highly recommand you to buy this. However, they had some issues with connecting error and disbanding your party with errors. Without these errors, it is perfect."

And I must say it is one of my favorites. I would rage when I disconnected but theyve fixed that and ive been very happy with them listening and fixing the game as soon as they can. For this being their first pc game i think they did a bang up job with this one ill tell ya that. All games will have their issues. I mean I didnt like monster hunter 4 but I loved playing monster hunter worlds. Ill stop rambling there's my two cents.

Don't believe the mixed review, those are mainly due to the initial period of the launch. The game is pretty solid, it has a good player base and quite friendly to new comers. Its a very grindy game, you Hunt, gather, craft gear, hunt new monsters, craft better gear and weapons to fight the next. Initially I thought repeating a cycle like that would get old pretty quickly, however the 14 weapon types choices allowed me to change things up every now and then. You can play can through this entire game solo should you wish, but I found that for a grindy game like this..playing coop with people was way more enjoyable. It doesn't matter if your don't have anyone to play with, since 90% of the time people are more than happy to lend a hand, especially those who are pass Hunter rank 100. Through playing a lot I saw a lot of familiar faces and ended up becoming friends with them as well, we'd hop on to do stupid things together like learning a completely new weapon mid quest and get wreck."

While I do not have great knowledge of the previous MH games, I believe MHW has streamlined a lot of realtively tedious systems while reserving the main draw and spirit of the series. The loop of hunting>crafting>improving kept me entertained for 300 hours so far. There are 14 different weapons providing a wild variation of combat style for the player to master. The monsters themselves have a lot of character and each fight with them is like a date to get to know them better. You would get a great sense of complishment when you have finally handling a previously tough monster with grace and efficiency. New to the series is the seamless maps where there is no longer loadings between zones, so the exploration feels smoother and more absorbing.The UI and control will need to get into and they are far from perfect. I do suggest checking out some beginner's guide and video to help, but slowly adapting and improving is part of the journey and really not that difficult in the end. The port had problems when it first launched but improvements have been made constantly in the following months. Connection problems have also been vastly improved. And these had been reasons to the majority of the early negative reviews.I've only started playing with other players online after like 250 hours of solo play, and I do agree that multiplayer does add another layer of fun to it. But it is definitely not an ""only fun with friends"" game.Bottom line, it is a modern iteration of a beloved series packed full of content well worth the price, can be enjoyed by fans of the series or newcomers alike. Norminating it for Steam GOTY 2018."

Not to mention you start with the hardest but the strongest weapon there is, which is the great sword. It's super strong but super slow and hard to master, and there for not the best for new players in my opinion. I started to play A LOT better when i switched to switch axe, which is my favorite weapon to use even to this day.There is a lot to learn in this game, what weapon fits you the best and how to master it, how each and every monster moves, what items are good to keep and to use in the future because the game doesn't really tell you that, and then what armor pieces you wear because they all have their own unique ""skill"" that makes you faster in certain things etc. (GET ARMOR THAT HAS EARPLUGS! Monster roars wont stun you and you get free hits on them while they are at it ;) Literally my favorite thing in the whole game.I love the game, i love the monsters and they are all adorable, but i still complain about the hitboxes sometimes. You get stunned or hit even when it shouldn't.I do recommend this game but... it takes some time to learn ok. Don't get frustrated or give up!"

ALOT.Well i waited like 3 months to see if a promo would come and it did so i get the game and tought to myself, well it was cheap if i can put something like 10hours and enjoy it would be worth it.Ok first impression with actually playing was ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this combat is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome"" (Bow)I got instantly hooked, and discovered the game is way more deeper than i tought, every monster is a differente battle and the story is cool too.The looks of the game are REALLY good, almost every weapon as a unique look and a unique feel to it.Better yet you can play as you want even in the endgame, you dont NEED to follow the meta, you can just enjoy the wep that suits you.Now the grinding, ofc it has the grinding its almost impossible to not have, but it is worth it? I would say yes, cause everytime you capture/slay a monster you DO get better, you DO know more about the monster and the feel of accomplishment grows as you progress your character.Anyway, the grapichs are kinda blocky sometimes and the game still not fully polished (I have a high end spec and sometimes it drops to 40fps)It has some little bugs (nothing game breaking atleast for me)My final review isStory - 7/10Graphics - 8/10 (at everything at MAX)Gameplay - 10/10Sound(Music) - 10/10Fun - 11/10I would say the price is okay, isnt that expensive, but it does get cheaper so if you still dont know wait up and buy on sale."
