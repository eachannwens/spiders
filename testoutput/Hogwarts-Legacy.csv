0,1,Tamaster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tho545454/,"3,795",46,1,81.6,Posted: 25 February,919,71,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/0e6d01dedd8b5a966fa0808a22bdbaf8332dd085.jpg,"Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the iconic Wizarding World setting created by J.K. Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. The main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.The world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. Most dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.Magical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. Combat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.Quests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. Challenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort."

Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don't even get me started with license games in general....Hogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.I don't usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of ""Harry Potter"" made me buy it in an instant.The following review won't contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.So far so good. It starts off with a generic ""You are the chosen one!"" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don't want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn't be able to stop reading it until the very end.Overwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.First off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.Then you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.Also: You don't get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.If you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the ""Floo powder"" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  Decorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! What would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. Fighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. For your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.The further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.As a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.There is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.I just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! Just wow!  Hogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don't even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.I play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won't be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!Simply magical!I also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!"

12,2,Kujar3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kujar3Player/,"1,069",19,1,58.8,Posted: February 14,"1,578",18,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/8d5aecf456aa5cefd6afd58d42985e64363ca954.jpg,"I could gush about this forever. The world is so well crafted and there was so much love put into it, it's kind of absurd. You start off in the castle, it's bloody massive, very faithful to the template you know, it's clear they tried their best to do a 1:1 replica. Walking through the halls and rooms in ecstatic, never did I feel that exploration is in any way forced, I was encouraged to explore and I have yet to properly utilize fast travel, it just doesn't get old and I still keep bumping into corridors that eluded me, still finding new things. And that's JUST the castle, the moment you look past the castle and take in the sheer scope of the world, it is possitively jaw dropping. The world is ginormous and the developers found clever things to sprinkle everywhere you go. Every now and then you bump into a small village out there, each one is different and again, very detailed and even tho they keep the same aesthetic, it never felt like exploring more of the same. It is honestly kind of overwhelming how much there is to find and play around with, this is a real work of art that even if you do not fancy the world of Harry Potter, should give you plenty of enjoyement to travel through.I jumped in on Hard difficulty as I was seeking some challenge out of this, however not much challenge is really provided. I keep being capped on my healing potions, rarely having to reach out for them. There are moments that test you certainly, large group of enemies are fun to tackle and the higher difficulty does not allow you to make many mistakes. Combat is satisfying, you generally play with a selection of 4 main spells you chose, from what you have learned, but you're not limited to them. You get up to 4 spell tabs for a total of 16 spells at the ready that you can switch between during combat at will. You'll learn combos of spells that work well together and swinging your wand around will feel really good. Enemies attack back with attacks you can protect against and ones you can only dodge, always visually apparent by a different colored circle around your head, it's a simple nuance but you'll trip up here and there, game doesn't make you feel invincible. Enemy variety could be larger, but it's not absolutely terrible, what's a bit of a shame is that you rarely battle more than 1 enemy type at the same time, maybe that's something that will be happening more later on, I can imagine that could spice up combat a bit. Every enemy type has some kind of weakness for you to discover and you'll be keeping mental notes.Beyond your spell selection, there is not really much else you can do to build your character differently, all gear slots are basically stat sticks that you can eventually augment a bit for specific situations but I feel like it's nothing too significant. Still they made the best out of what they had, maybe gearing being more casual was the goal here.The story is intriguing but nothing ground breaking, so far it stands on its own pretty well, without spoiling as this is in the opening scenes, you learn that your character can see traces of ancient magic which leads you on a path to pursue this calling, but there's a faction of goblins and their leader who are after the same thing, the knowledge of great magic that's only rumored to exist, very few people in the past knew of its existence and could wield it. The game presents sense of urgency while also intentionally slowing you down, but you can argue it is doing so for you to slowly master this magic and uncover the whole truth so I give it a pass. As for sidequesting, you have the usual fetch quests most of the time, that are made interesting by the possibilities a world like this can present. I never felt annoyed doing a side quest that was simply ""deliver"" or ""find and bring"" as it pointed me to places to discover, this is very much carried by the setting and the amazing world. Some side quests are more convoluted and eventually lead you to what could be described as collectible chains. The game slowly introduces collectibles and series of puzzles for you to complete through side quests and it kind of feels natural. The only time I wasn't happy with this was when the unlocking spell ""alohomora"" was locked behind one of those, multiple tiers of it even, as someone who wants to unlock every door, I felt forced to go on collectible hunting but in the end, again, I was happy doing so as it led me places... Did I mention exploration is fun yet?Flying! My god, getting your first broom and taking to the skies feels surreal. You could fast travel, sure, but why would you when you can fly? Game places very few restrictions on where you can and can't fly, practically the whole world is traversable on a mount, it's amazing.Room of Requirement. If you like creating your own space or ever found yourself lost in building a house in The Sims, this will be right up your alley, everything is customizable and by exploring you will find more items to place down,, but this feature got overshadowed for me by taking care of your own beasts. I damn nearly cried grooming and feeding the creatures, it's so adorable, I could spend hours just watching them in the space you get for them, this is my single most favorite feature.Beast catching. You have to catch your beasts so better go out there hunting, many types of beasts to catch and bring home out there in the world. Some are easy to catch, some harder, always having to find the best approach, it's honestly fun.Reputation system, honestly, the game allows you to cast unforgivable curses and nobody seems to care you do so. You can fling avada kedavra next to dozens of witnesses and most you may get is a couple of comments. I wish there were some drawbacks, if not in ""reputation"" then at least visually, think Mass Effect 2 where Shepard would look more scarred the more evil you'd be. I'd take anything.Points system, it's Hogwards, part of it is winning points for your house and while during some quests you get the ""points to *your house here*"" comment, it isn't reflected anywhere. There's virtually no rivalry between the houses as a result.Quidditch, please... The game comes up with an excuse to not have it but man, what a shame.And lastly, I would like to see some deeper relationship feature, building friendship with some important characters, outside of main quests. Doing things for them and maybe being able to take them with you on your exploratory adventures. When I think Harry Potter, I also think of the friendship the main group had going for them, it sometimes feels a bit lonely in this giant world.Performance is rocky, the game drops frames unexplainably, in cutscenes and in a few areas, this is something that can be fixed with patches so hopefully it'll improve.Voice pitch? Don't even bother, leave it on the default spot when creating your character. It makes your voice robotic, echoey and just plain weird. Been resolved, you now get 10 character slots.This game makes me feel like a kid again, I don't remember the last time I was this happy and eager to explore a world, this is coming from someone who grew up on HP, this is all practically a wet dream made real. I am overjoyed the be part of all this and despite knowing this could be a much better game, both improved in what it offers and in some of the glaring issue it has, I can overlook it because so much of this game has been crafted with a lot of love. Bravo, loving every second of it."

The story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.I have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.Outside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries. I believe a lot of people may enjoy playing as an Auror or a Unspeakable."

You play as one of the Hogwarts students learning the world and exploring its secrets. Dangers are at every step and it's up to you to become the most powerful witch or wizard Hogwarts has seen in a long time. Rate: ★★★★☆ Surprisingly the game has a lot more to offer than what trailers show. Combat feels good, with a large array of spells that controls the battlefield and gives you the freedom to do whatever you like.Learning new spells is done via side quests and main missions which oftentimes are pretty nicely crafted. In the game you are faced with a lot of collecting, puzzle-solving, exploring, and sightseeing.Although some areas of exploration can get a bit too much even for the ones that wish to complete the game 100%, the game can be fully enjoyed, and go through the main campaign and pick the side quests with a lot of enjoyment. Rate: ★★★★★  I've had a lot of fun exploring this game. Hogwarts is rich with fun areas to explore. The world continues to impress you and learning new skills and putting them to test is fun and rewarding.  Rate: ★★★★★ This game looks absolutely stunning and it would be without a doubt one of the best-looking games I've played this year. Ray-tracing adds up with a great umph to the overall look, but due to poor performance, it can be heavily costly on your GPU.The world and the key areas look distinguished, remarkable, and jaw-dropping. This game is a really pretty game and each screenshot I took I am not ashamed to share. Rate: ★★★★★Sound effects and voice acting are strong in this game and oftentimes feel very polished. I did find some skipped dialogues by the end of some conversations which may be a bug, but other than that, I think pretty much all dialogues and characters are well-voiced.I have to remark that there's a large array of English dialects, from African, possible Uganda, to Indian accents are well done and feels nice to be able to hear such differences.  Rate: ★★★★☆ Although the end of the game felt a bit weak and the villain wasn't necessarily defined very well, the whole build-up of the story is interesting until that point. Characters are fascinating and despite not being a fan of Harry Potter, I can say that the world and the people are extremely interesting and I was easily captivated by the visuals and the theme the game presents.  🔲  Short (1-8h)🔲 Medium (8-15h)🔲 Long  (15-25h)☑️ Very Long  (25h+)🔲 Unlimited  It's a fairly long game if you intend to finish this game completely and do all 4 houses. The main story alone takes a while and some side quests are too interesting to skip.   ☑️ Easy ☑️ Normal ☑️ Hard 🔲 Brutally Hard 🔲 Impossible  The game isn't too difficult and unless you wish a slightly bigger challenge there is something for you. By the end of the game, as you understand the mechanics of the game and how combat works you'll become a powerful wizard/witch. Hogwarts Legacy is by far one of the best Harry Potter games ever created and this opens up to new possibilities for this IP. As a non-fan of the franchise, I think the game offers a strong open-world experience without overwhelming you with lots of tasks to do, unless you wish to do them. Puzzles are rather simple, but fun and the whole world made me appreciate the game even more."

You should use different spells for different enemies, blocks\conter attacks. You can use the elements of the environment in the fight. Interesting animations of spells. You always need to play on the keyboard like on the piano. It's 10\10- Hogwarts Castle is breathtaking. It's alive, you meet students who do different things (trying to cast spells, craft potions, read books, or a lot of other things). You meet familiar places from movies and books, you find tons of secrets and easter eggs. Hogwarts is amazing- Some side activities in the game are interesting (like beasts hunting, finding secrets, plant growing)But what should be improved for becoming a legendary game:-add more types of the enemy. You enter the dungeon and you know that you will face spiders and in the end you will see the boss - troll or big spider. It's boring and after 3-4 dungeons you no longer want to go into them. People and goblins have different classes, but they are still the same types of enemies. You can add bogarts, wervolves, vampires, some magical creatures etc-Useless loot. All loot in chests is coins or equipment items. But the problem is that by the middle of the game, you will already have enough equipment to complete the game to the end. And there are no unique items or sets in the game. Because of this, you lose interest in exploring locations and dungeons, because you will either find useless glasses or gloves that will be worse than yours. In addition, the price for them is low and it makes no sense to even collect them for sale. It would be much more interesting to look for some unique Hogwarts sets, Deathly Hallows, or some cool wands with unique abilities. Unfortunately, this is not the case, all things are the same and differ only in skin and armor or attack indicators.-Strange economics in the game. You don't want to find some rare beasts or loot because it cost like one portion of the healing potion) The rare phoenix which is alone on the map costs the same as Niffler which you can find in any place on the map.- all of the above make the Hogwarts Legacy world investigation boring and trivial. You don't want to go to the cave because you wouldn't be rewarded for this."

I wanted to add a few more thoughts.My daughter who is closing in on 18, and my half century year old self have both been fans of Harry Potter and the Wizarding World. I read the books to her when she was younger and then on my own. We’ve watched the movies and it has always been great bonding for us.I preordered the Deluxe edition on Steam when it first came available. I knew my Desktop would handle it but had some concerns about the Steam Deck which has become my device of choice to game on when I feel up to it health wise. Luckily it got Steam Deck Verified before early launch.During early launch we spent about about 10 hours into the game. I put a couple hours in on my Steam Deck with no issues and it ran a solid 30 FPS except the very sparse drop to mid to high 20s on some cutscenes. Note that I made no changes to the stock installation settings. Also note that I play in performance mode as I am plugged in while in bed or on the sofa 99% of my playtime. My daughter had about 8 on our primary desktop which is an aging i5-7400 @ 3Ghz, 16GB RAM, SSD with a GeForce 1060 GTX and reported no issues either.At this point we have over 35 hours in with the majority of them being my daughter on the PC and me making up about a third of the remaining hours on the Deck. During those hours we each experienced one crash. For her it was a CTD for myself it was a crash that locked up Proton causing a force restart of the switch. Note both of these crashes were prior to the Day 1 patch and we haven’t ran into any further issues since.Gameplay is fun and a lot more interesting and in-depth than I expected. Learning the various arts like potion making, herbalism, and so long always gives you something to do. I am known for almost always turning off in game music but the soundtrack is perfect for reminding you what world you are in. There are more than enough side quests to keep you busy, to the point of falling behind and losing track of the main quest.There are puzzles at every turn that are both hard but not impossible. I have yet to have to refer to a walkthrough as much as at times I wanted to. This game really keeps you wanting to avoid spoilers and accomplish things on your own. You will meet a lot of classmates and others on and off campus, however there is really a fairly limited pool that you regularly interact with. That said you will quickly make close friends and even your own Draco Malfoy types who you will hate but might end up have a truce with.All in all my daughter and my biggest complaint is the lack of better character customization. There are a fair number of presets but there is no ability to adjust outside those presets such as adjust lips or cheeks, noses to your own design outside the presets slider. There is no hight or weight adjustment. I like the amount of control over skin tones and as mentioned there are a fair amount of sliders.However by modern standards it’s barebones. It’s sad when I have played phone f2p games that have better character creation when you can only really only see your character at the selection screen than a $70-90 USD that everyone is going to want to go all out on character design. It is for this primary reason along with my dislike of how hard on the Deck and I assume PC selection of Foo Flame travel points is harder than it should be. I watched my daughter do fast travel via KVM and it was smooth as could be. I do so on the deck and I eventually give up and fly or walk there.That said we still rate this game a very strong 9/10 and already call it GOTY for us."

But it is lacking in some small areas. Below I have listed the pros and cons of the game. I also listed what I want to see in the future, as well as what I don't want to see in the future! Keep in mind I am not a massive Harry Potter fan and only have seen the movies a long time ago. This list was made over the course of my playthrough during the 72 hour early access for Deluxe Editon owners, hopefully there is a day 1 patch out by now! Enjoy!• Good Performance (Could be better, but it is very good at least for me)• Great Immersion• Graphics and Art Style• Changing Seasons• Fancy Animation (With spells, puzzles, doors, and all that)• Great Music & Sound Design (Broom class kinda popped off with that music)• Engaging Story/Narrative• Fun Late Game Combat (Ancient magic is sick! Just use your spells and mix it up! It's pretty fun)• Exploration (Rewards you heavily for it)• Detailed & Big World (You can go into any building, find many secrets, solve fun puzzles, pet cats, and much more)• Interesting Characters (There are lots! The voice acting is sometimes bad)• Great Transmog (Once you get the item you keep its appearance for use whenever you want)• Great Quests (There are a ton)• Fun Skins/Outfits (Great outfit pieces, mount skins, wand skins, and all that)• Almost No Bugs (Visual bugs only, most are funny)• No Crashes• Accessibility & UI Options (There are LOTS!)• Graphic Options (Also LOTS!) • NPC Quest Speed (WOW, NPCs that actually move your speed on quests?! More games should do this!)• Room of Requirement (Fun to customize, can be daunting at times)• No Quidditch• Cramped Camera (Sometimes it can be at weird angles, maybe add customizable positions)• Character Customization (I'm referring to the customization at the start of the game, it's a bit iffy)• Voice Pitch (In the character customization menu at the start, every voice pitch besides the default one sounds robotic)• Voice Acting (Sometimes)• Repetitive Early Game Combat (Not a lot of spells to use but it's understandable)• Limited Gear Slots (Can be increased by doing )• Confusing Menu (At first, it was hard for me to get used to it all at once, I couldn't find transmog or my Twitch drops)• Useless Houses (From what I have played your house doesn't mean much)• Useless Wands (When choosing your wand, the attributes don't do anything from what I have seen, from a game standpoint it makes sense)• Small Enemy/Boss Variety ()• Graphical Stuttering (In cutscenes mostly, sometimes happens when entering newly rendered areas)• Lighting Transitions & Flickering (Sometimes the lighting can be blinding, or just straight up weird looking)• Door Loading (When traversing the castle, sometimes the game will show a loading icon on doors)• Robot Background NPCs (They pretty much don't do anything but walk and talk, with no reactions to spells or anything)• NPC AI & Animations (Sometimes it's a bit janky)• Multiplayer (At least Quidditch multiplayer)• Mod Support (Would be awesome, especially Steam Workshop)• Quidditch (They have the Golden Snitch and the arena in-game already)• Camera Control (Positioning, maybe increased FOV slider?)• Photo Mode (Please!)• Better Character Customization (More skin colors, hair, face shapes, and more)• Improved Voice Pitch (Better pitch shifter)• Improved Voice Acting (Most likely will not happen)• Bug Fixes (Lighting transition fixes)• Better Performance (Door loading improvements)• More Accessibility Options (Arachnophobia switch?)• Community Engagement (Free in-game events to win cosmetics, community updates and more! Ex. Dying Light 2 is a game that does this VERY well!)• Micro-transactions • Overpriced DLC• Radio Silence (No more updates, no communication, and all that. Would be a bummer)To conclude, most of the cons can be fixed easily, don't let the cons bring you down. I believe most of the cons will be fixed/addressed. Anyways, here are my PC specs and I ran the game at 1440p with consistent 120 FPS at almost all times!

Rowling’s fantasy world well. It is burdened by performance issues, a somewhat hollow world, and some small, though cumulatively bothersome design oversights, but with a passable story and mostly enjoyable gameplay it lands itself a generally positive recommendation.•	GeForce GTX 1660Ti•	8GB DDR4@1330MHz•	i5 9300H @2.4GHz•	HDD 7200RPM*Game requires min. 16GB RAM.Initially unplayable on low, changing system and game settings resulted in a fairly playable game at medium - low settings. A recent patch improved it a bit, and while there are FPS drops, there’s less freezing. Hogwarts’ architecture is breath-taking, and outdoor environments are varied and beautiful – some dark and creepy, others warm and vibrant. It’s a visual masterpiece, and the atmosphere of the Wizarding world is brilliantly captured. It’s absurd there’s no photo mode.Some house and dungeon interiors are repeated, which feels lazy, but you're only there briefly to loot chests. Important places you visit often are unique.Spells are colourful and vibrant, and particle effects are pretty, with light wisps, auras and ‘sparks’ lending a magical quality to the game. Performance aside, these are smooth and satisfying to watch, too.While not photorealistic, the artistic style is pleasant, and characters do have well-detailed faces and mostly good expressions.The cast doesn’t feel from 1800, but I’m not so bothered by this. It wasn’t sold as a historical game, and I didn’t expect realism. I didn’t buy this game , but .Our characters are disappointing, with creation based around presets with very limited customisation – worse than Cyberpunk. Female characters in particular look pretty bad. In the world, lighting affects your face sometimes horribly, though cutscenes show how it in better detail. Hogwarts interiors sometimes capture the grandeur of the place in their soundscape in those big open stairways with high ceilings, but I don’t remember losing myself in outdoors nature sounds. Environmental sounds were more remarkable indoors than out, I think.Characters are generally well-spoken which I like, and some personality does come through. Emotion is conveyed fairly well, but rarely to the point it moved me in any way. Our character (female for me) does a good enough job, but I wouldn’t say it was outstanding.Music is pleasant, although sometimes perhaps a little energetic. When exploring, it never made you feel like you were floating on a breeze in this beautiful world, like Skyrim did. It was often quite intense in a way that’s a bit much, though in intense moments it served well. Regardless, it did have a fantasy feel about it, and in that way it fit the game well.The stage is beautiful, but the play is empty. There isn’t much sense of being a Hogwarts student. Classes teach you spells, but feel like tutorials. Once done, you aren’t really a student anymore, and this becomes a typical RPG, lacking RPG features. Extra-curricular assignments don’t change this feeling, and come over more as challenges than student roleplay.You can’t interact with NPCs outside of missions. There’s no companions. Common rooms are lifeless. Mounts don’t stay, despawning when dismounting. At night, the atmosphere is lovely, yet there’s not much to do. We also can’t play Quidditch! They only strength with immersion is the graphics. Beyond that, the game doesn’t capitalise on its unique setting, and feels like any other below average open world RPG as a result.As an RPG it lacks a sense of choice or consequence. While there are different endings, most of the game is linear, and so the room for roleplaying is limited, as is replay value.Combat is challenging without being too hard. Because you have to match spells with defences, you can’t just spam your way through fights, and that makes them feel quite rewarding. So far, I like this, though the abundance of fighting in tougher missions can also be very tiring.I hate the spell toolbar system though. It takes 4 spells, and you can unlock 3 more toolbars, scrolling between them in combat. There are more spells than this though, and I kept needing to change, requiring a visit to the menus. Even with spells I have in my toolbars, scrolling through  is annoying.While overdone and abundant in the world to the point they can feel like mindless busywork, I do actually enjoy ticking these off to 100% the game. There is some variety across different types, so there’s  complexity, without being frustratingly difficult.Crafting isn’t instant, and without minigames, you simply have to wait for a timer up to ~10 mins. This is such an awful, boring design. Once the timer is up, the game won’t produce more either, so you can’t explore and come back to 50 potions, for example.One thing I love about the apparel system is the ability to change the appearance of anything you’re wearing to something you like more while keeping the stats.However, nearly every chest has a clothing item, yet you can carry so few. Upgrades don’t mitigate the problem. Yet I can keep several Hippogriffs in a bag, and brooms in my pocket. This is irritating. Returning to vendors so often is tedious, and destroying the clothes wastes money they could be sold for. It also requires going into the menus and then to return to the world, you have to escape through about three layers of menu. This is like a Ubisoft game - grindy. There’s many repetitive tasks, all of which you have to do to 100%. I expect 100+ hours.The narrative hasn’t moved me as much as I would have liked, but it would be unfair to say it’s bad. It is yet another ‘you are the unique hero who can save the world’ story, which is fine – it’s nice to feel important. But then you are sent on a plentiful amount of fetch and carry missions, and given you’re a young student, adults are quite willing to send you into danger, too.By almost 50 hours in-game at 57% total completion, the story introduces some unlikable enemies and some mildly likeable friends, but none are very memorable. The overarching story is compelling enough to drive the gameplay – there is a  to play on, but rarely do you  the stakes or care about the consequences, as it’s hard to care about most characters. The thing that’s moved me most so far is a mission where you rescue animals. Take that as you will.While I recommend this game, it is also symptomatic of the downward spiral in quality we see these days. It’s quite repetitive and shallow, but some of the sting is taken away by a beautiful world and the Harry Potter setting. Many criticisms I have are small, but together sap the game of charm. When the child-like excitement fades and the product is viewed neutrally, it’s not a masterpiece.The environments are lovely, the audio and puzzles are good, and combat is the right balance of simplicity and challenge for me. Roleplay and immersion are lacking, and the story is mediocre. For these reasons, while I recommend the game, it’s not an overwhelming recommendation. Ultimately, though, do I regret pre-ordering? No, I don’t. I like Hogwarts Legacy. I just don’t love it."

In most of the dialogue, you can choose what to say. We have many ways to complete the mission. Each mission is interesting and different from the last. We also have riddle games and good sidequests.Beautiful open world, giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore Hogwarts, caves, forests, mountains, and do much more. The map is very large. Herbalism and alchemy are important and help a lot; we can also upgrade equipment. We can have a real Wizard of Oz adventure. The fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocked by a small obstacle, but in comparison to other games, it is not very annoying.Each character has its own charm. The characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We can also choose the main character's path, whether he is a good wizard or a bad one (using unforgivable spells), but the game will not punish us for it.The graphics in this game are amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined; for example, when we move the grass, it moves with us. Graphics capabilities are used at 100%. The movement of water and clouds is very well refined. We can see falling leaves and changing weather. It makes a huge impression.The music and ambient sounds in this game fit great. We can listen to climatic music that is selected for each moment of the game. Character voices are not my favorites, but they fit the characters. There is a lot of music from movies.If you are thinking about purchasing this game because you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend it for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun will come from it. This is a well-made game not only for Harry Potter fans but for everyone."

For people who don't care about the harry potter world, but just like playing videogames, this is a solid, well-executed game on par with any good AAA game, and a pretty solid 7 or 8 out of 10 - better than anything Ubisoft makes, better than the LoTR Shadow/War of Mordor; but of course it's no Elden Ring. And that's fine, it doesn't have to be. Finally, for people who only care about what J.K.Rowling says on twitter... this game is not for you. Not due to anything in the game itself - it is actually very kind and inclusive and you *would enjoy it* - but because J.K.Rowling created the harry potter world ~30 years ago, you won't enjoy playing any game set in that world. That's fine. Please don't bully people online for enjoying things, and don't spread hate."

It is clear that a lot of love and labor went into the creation of the world. Considering previous titles Avalanche has developed, it is probably fair to say they punched above their weight class with this game.So why a negative review?Because the game is a very large, very shallow puddle. Hogwarts Legacy's world may be very pretty, but it's also a world that solely exists for you. Once the initial bedazzlement wears off, it becomes impossible not to notice how deeply infected this game is with the Ubisoft model of open-world design. Perhaps such a design would be tolerable if your choices actually mattered, but they don't. There are no consequences for your actions and it gets worse: your character is incredibly heavily scripted by Avalanche, occasionally blurting out things you were trying to keep secret in every ""choice"" you were given before. Aside from making one or two snide comments, you cannot make your character act like a jerk. Your character is going to be a pet-loving, tree-hugging, empathic goody-two-shoes no matter what you do.- Choices don't matter- There are no consequences to your actions.- There are no stakes! There is a supposed ""big bad"" who is interested in you and wants to capture you, yet you can roam the world however and whenever you like without any risk of getting caught. The story only happens when you trigger it.- At some point in the story, the interests of MC and a side-show villain become aligned. The side-show villain even says so and offers a chance to work together. I wanted to accept, but noooooo, Avalanche made my character decline and spew some moralistic BS at the villain, I was not even given a choice. UGH.- Totally missed opportunity on using the four houses as competition factions. There is no competition between houses in this game, there are no factions, there are no house points.- When it becomes night, everybody just outright vanishes. When it first happens it gives a kind of creepy vibe that seems almost suitable. But once you notice that this happens every night, and no NPC goes to bed, no prefect patrols the halls, and you become aware that you are essentially running around an empty level... well, it just takes your right out of the experience.- No social gameplay at all. No building of relationships between other characters. You're just going to be friends with everyone, no matter how you play, because Avalance says so.- Starting as a fifth-year IMO was a cop-out. A cheap narrative reason to be able to give the player some of the more mature spells. The problem with this choice is that it eliminates the potential to build a bond with any of the side-characters. Seriously, even just spending a couple of hours as a first year could have done so much to help set up meaningful relationships. Huge missed opportunity.- No classes or curfew systems. Some people think that having these would be boring. By themselves they could become boring or annoying, sure, but when there is a social cost associated with them, I think they could be excellent gameplay loops. Missed a class? Lose house points. Lose house points? Social relation with side-character X is affected, which in turn affects your story and the choices you are able to make. Or how about having to feed your secret Hippogriff pet, which you can only do at night, so you have a reason to break curfew. And if you fail and get caught? Who knows, maybe the Hippogriff abandons you. Risk and reward people, it's not that hard!I hope Avalanche will do better in the future. There is some reason to think that they will as modders have uncovered things like an unused morality system (which this game desperately needs), thieving system, and even things like GoToBed(). So Avalanche *did* think about some of these things, but for whatever reason they never ended up in the game.I respect the developers for what they've done. A game of this scale for one of the largest fandoms in the world is no easy task. It was always going to be hard for them to meet expectations. I can only hope they will learn from this game and will take the needed steps to improve upon it in some future iteration."

Get it when the crashes are patched, you'll love it. If you are neither, wait until they make the game more playable and interesting but avoid it for now.It starts off really strong, perfectly managing that honey moon period, plunging you into a really awe-inspiring world that turns you back into a snot-nosed twerp with that little hand-made Harry Potter costume, holding an HP-themed cola freezie pop in one hand and a patchwork deck of Pokémon cards in the other...And then you play for 5-10 hours and the magic is gone, you constantly try to force yourself back into that suspension of disbelief state, stopping by to smell the roses, but are then immediately pulled out of it when a neutral NPC doesn't react to you blasting a poacher to cinders with an Incendio spell right under their nose, or one of those voice clips you've already heard thousands of times already plays yet another time. Yes I know you invented Floo Powder, yes I know this is a Merlin Trial, yes, I know, that Hogsmeade is cozy.There are many areas where this game's truly enormous potential feels transparently wasted. Revelio and the quest markers being the biggest offenders. Why make an open world game if the player is not even going to look at the environment, due to being too busy looking at their map and at object silhouettes they see through walls as they mash that R button? Breath of the Wild came out 6 years ago and HogLeg also competes with Elden Ring.The backseating in major quests is also very aggressive, with NPCs or your own character already giving hints or even the solution  after the puzzle appeared. This is the first time a game makes me create my own character and then manages to make me hate him.What happened to making the player think? To rewarding agency and creative play? To giving weight to the player's choices?In terms of game design, : The Hogwarts house points system isn't implemented, you don't have to attend classes, the only meaningful differences between houses are cosmetic (+ the additional Hufflepuff quest) and the only consequential choices you can make are in Sebastian's questline, which is unsurprisingly the best one in the entire game outside of that honeymoon period I mentioned.Aside from this one, . You don't have to choose between gear pieces as there are no meaningful stats in this purely vertical system and 95% of the enchantments are pointless (but the game does give you an arbitrary, crippling inventory slot limit for no reason???), the talent system is just a glorified progression order and doesn't push you towards building your character a certain way as you just get everything over time, the max amount of potions you can carry is absurd (25 max wiggenwelds? I am already barely taking a hit and you're making me immortal?), you can carry all types of consumables at a given point, and can use all spells with the only form of actual character building being which spell you put in which spell set (which you can cycle through in real time so it's only an execution thing).The rewards also feel miserable, you will often spend 10 minutes exploring a secret area with a cool puzzle only to be rewarded with a blue piece of gear when you are two tiers above that.As for , it looks amazingly flashy and feels badass, easily the most fun aspect of the game. It feels like a diluted version of a character-action game and has a really high skill ceiling which it, unfortunately, barely explores. The duelling feats system is really cool and not nearly exploited enough, which is a shame since it goes so well with the fact that every enemy has weaknesses. The enemies are not very varied and could use more creativity across the board. Some are really cool, like the bossfight in the  though!The game suffers from being designed for consoles, with a terrible spellbar system: multiple sets of 4 spells you have to painstakingly cycle through during combat with a dedicated button. Having a button per spell type and then a second press to choose your spell, or MMORPG-like modifier buttons would've been way better. FF14 is even playable on gamepad and has so many more skills to piano with!The  contrasts a lot. It shines in some places like the worldbuilding and lore or the questlines of Sebastian and Poppy, while the main story quest is pretty... mediocre. Lots of inconsistencies, deux ex machina, blatantly evil and one-dimensional villains,  and again, no choices.And now the elephant in the room, the . My game crashed around 20-30 times across my playthrough, the lighting is completely f***ed in many places and throws flashbang grenades at you inside buildings, asset streaming destroys your framerate even if you are running on a Saxton Hale-grade PC, many places have entities that also delete your FPS when rendered (thank god for frustum culling!), crashing often messes with your autosave...And the bugs! Combat target-lock is bugged and can lock you onto corpses, the spell bar is a bug hive, NPC often get stuck etc.At launch? Sure no worries. We're over two months later and the situation has somehow gotten worse.It's amazing and terrible in equal measure, but the fact that the issues stem from gameplay and QA is what makes me tip towards a negative review."

The world design, music, story and characters are an overall fantastic experience. You do not have to be a Harry Potter fan to be able to enjoy the game, but it does add much to the game if you are. The graphics are fantastic. The user interface is informative while remaining simple and user friendly. The menus are fun to navigate and check the map, collections and progress. For the most part, Game play is mostly perfect. I am not a fan of the broom stick flight. The controls on the broom feel clunky and not user friendly on controller nor on keyboard/mouse. However, the combat is highly enjoyable. Spell casting, item utilization and potions are well balanced in player use. Difficulty on hard was not difficult in the slightest, but there has been an update and I am finding the challenge has been upped quite a bit. Fast reflexes and smart choices definitely are needed for a favorable outcome. I would not consider the game remotely as difficult as a ""souls-like"" experience. While the story is fantastic, it is the world immersion that makes Hogwarts Legacy shine brightest. The side quests, choices, progress in the main story and discoveries all add and change the conversations and interactions that the protagonist has with the other classmates, professors and even enemies. If you use certain methods in combat more heavily, your enemies will make comments on that, for instance. We are still not at a truly dynamic open world, but this is one of the best open world builds I have enjoyed in gaming.My biggest complaint is that the puzzles are all rudimentary. There is nothing mentally taxing in the entire game. With so many puzzles, the most difficult is solvable without any pause for thought. I could expound on all of this and more, but it is easier said that Hogwarts Legacy is a great foundation for a new gaming franchise. While I could nitpick Hogwarts Legacy in how the game can be better in many ways, it achieves what many games fail to even deliver. And that is an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience from start to finish."

I love this game. It's very clear that the developers have paid attention to details and have really put in love and effort to make this game. I should say though, after an explosive starting scene, it's a bit of a slow progression in the  beginning. You'll need to master some spells, meet around people, etc to really be prepared to start the actual journey. Even your brooms comes in at around 10 hours into the game. But it's definitely worth the wait. The gameplay itself is pretty good. Using different spells for different enemies. They have a pretty good variety and I'm not disappointed. The map is good, there's fast travel options, talent points to unlock new abilities, etc. The best thing about the game is the world itself and they've executed it perfectly. Even if I'm just walking around the castle, I find things which make me smile. Honestly, I feel like I'm s student of Hogwarts and I'm exploring this amazing place. The castle is the best place, but there are outside places too. Lots of sidequests, puzzles, dungeons, etc. Basically, it's everything you'd expect from the world of magic. But ofcourse, it's not perfect. There are certainly some flaws. There are a few glitches which affected the gameplay. And one was so huge and I can't progress a quest at all (Edit: its fixed now and I've completed the quest). The number of gear slots are way too less and I'm forced to sell most of my unused gears to make space for new ones. Some of the puzzles are just repetitive that I gave up on them being bored of it. But those are just minor things. I'm sure they'll fix the glitches too. But seriously, I love this game and I definitely have my money's worth. I'm around 23 hours in and I know that there's lots more waiting for me in terms of story and I'm going to have a blast. So final verdict, just get it. You won't regret it. PS: Just ignore all the hate for this game regarding the JK stuff. Just because one old woman is perceived as being inhuman, you're going to ignore the love and effort of hundreds of game creators? I mean, there are even lesbian couples and trans characters in the game (sure, it must be the marketing strategy, but it's still representation nonetheless). This game is not about the one person, it's about a group of developers who love this project. Just think about that too before you make a decision."

K. Rowling, is still popular. Since 2002, From that time until now, we have always been waiting for a good quality game from the world of Harry Potter. The Hogwarts Legacy is a role-playing action game developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Now we are going to review the whole game.This open-world game, which can be experienced in single-player mode, has created a closer and higher-quality image of the magical world of Harry Potter. However, this game does not tell the story of Harry Potter, and its story goes back at least a hundred years before the events of Harry Potter. You start the game as a new student in the fifth year of Hogwarts; However, the game does not give information about the reason for your late studies in the fifth year.The game's main story draws you in with beautiful twists and pulls you by creating a curiosity to discover the truth about your unknown ability. Although the story is not the boldest element in this game, the creators have managed to mix the game's not-so-complicated main narrative in the form of the magical and vast world of the game.In addition to the main narrative, hundreds of side quests have been designed for users to participate in according to their choice. The variety of side quests in the game is so great that engaging with them will sometimes be more interesting than the game's main story. Exploring the enormous game world allows you to play other magical games and challenges. Solve Merlin's trials, hunt magical animals, find hidden tunnels, and search for relics of ancient magic. The game is so big and rich that you'll find yourself exploring for hours and hours without even touching the main quests.To move around in this big world, you can use fast travel; by discovering them, you can move between different places in the game world without delay. This makes it possible to follow any desired primary or secondary quests quickly. In addition, you can also travel using a broomstick or other magical creatures such as a hippogriff. In each area of this magical world, there are tons of activities to complete your collection. All these areas and activities are accessible on the game map, and the game map is one of the essential tools for that, guiding the user through all quests.The Hogwarts Legacy RPG progression system is designed in such a way that you can collect XP by following the main or sub-quests. When these XPs reach a certain amount, your character's level will increase; for each level increase, more puzzles or stages will be available. By advancing the main story, you gain new abilities, and by doing the game's side quests, your skill in these abilities will improve; you can upgrade your character's talents in various fields, such as elemental spells, black magic, stealth, etc.The game allows you to create and personalize the appearance of your desired character by choosing the face, hair, skin color, and even facial scars. You will also be able to select your desired grouping in Hogwarts. The range of customization of the game extends to the selection of clothes, accessories, magic wands, flying brooms, and even your private room in Hogwarts Room of Requirement. Although these customizations are extremely fun, even the choice of school grouping does not affect the gameplay and is limited only to cosmetics. This also applies to in-game decisions. In the process of advancing the story and in relation to the characters of the game, you will have several dialogue options to choose from; But these choices will have practically no effect on the story. And in both cases, you will receive the same reward and output.One of the exciting places to customize is the Hogwarts Room of Requirement. If you have followed the Harry Potter series, you know that at Hogwarts, this secret room appears when students need it. In the game, Professor Wisley brings you to this room to study more on magic lessons and to create your work environment. In this room, minor details can be personalized, such as the frames on the wall to the desks. You can also keep your magical animals in the magical garden of the room. This room is perfect for crafting potions, practicing spells, and upgrading your character's cosmetics.The combat system of the Hogwarts Legacy is perhaps the most exciting part of the game. The game initially starts with limited spells and abilities, But gradually, by learning new spells and improving skills with the help of game points, the fighting experience turns into significant action. The game allows you to customize and combine different spells to create your own fighting style. This has made the game's combat experience extremely fun and addictive, despite the very low variety of enemies. These fights, which take place against black witches, giant spiders, goblins, zombies, and of course, trolls, sometimes become so challenging that you have to try many times to get past them. Another thing that needs to be addressed is the artistic graphics of the game. The Hogwarts Legacy game has one of the most beautiful magical worlds. Hogwarts school in the game is designed in the most beautiful way possible, and almost all the memorable places in the book can be found in the game.Despite all the positives, this open-world game has many technical problems. These problems, primarily seen in the game's PC version, have somewhat damaged the game experience. For example, many users of Nvidia's 30th and even 40th generation graphics cards face problems such as limited graphics RAM or multiple crashes when playing games. Also, long loading times and some graphic textures not loading correctly are other problems on the computer and console platforms. This issue probably makes it impossible to experience the game on old hard drives and HDDs.Overall, I can say that the Hogwarts Legacy is a brilliant magical open world of Harry Potter. This game has fulfilled more or less everything we expected. It portrays Rowling's magical world in the best possible way. Hogwarts Legacy is the best game from the Harry Potter franchise ever made, and if it weren't for the many technical issues with the PC version, I could have easily given it a full score in this review.Hogwarts Legacy is everything that Harry Potter fans have been waiting for. The game does not tell the story of Harry Potter, but by creating a magical world, it has been able to tell another brilliant story.If you are interested in the fantasy world of Harry Potter and enjoy the experience of exploring a large fantasy world, the Hogwarts Legacy game is what you need. Hogwarts Legacy has no obvious negative points other than technical issues. Therefore, it cannot be included in the list of games that I don't recommend buying."

Although the game is still rather good, as a friend of mine accurately pointed out, it’s all about the lack of competition among other major titles, focusing on one specific fandom, and an absolute lack of alternatives in this fandom. I've played through the game and finished it completely with 100% achievements, so I'd like to tell my personal opinion about it after all. ● There is . The ending will always be the same and there are no consequences of your actions. ● . Restricted areas are restricted just because they are meant to be restricted, not because you are not able to wandering there freely if it’s not about a quest, so feel free to come back any time.● There is . Yes, you can choose a bad “not-true” ending. Yes, you can freely study the Dark Arts. No, you can’t kill anyone, but bad guys, because it’s a good story and you cannot be a villain. ● Unforgivable spells are obviously unforgivable, which means that they cannot be used if you’re a good wizard, though nobody would stop you if you cast them. Any witnesses would only note something like “oh you’re not afraid of the Dark Arts”. But there are  at all. And no, if you’re interested, you cannot kill the bosses with Avada Kedavra. ● Sometimes, going between the sectors of a location becomes slightly frustrating. Before the door opens, there is . It would be better if there was an animation of some kind which could replace the time you wait staring at the door stubbornly while random NPCs go through the same door freely. Not to mention  what means now you are to force close the game via the Steam overlay or Task Manager and restart it.Vice versa, some cutscenes such as going to Undercroft seem to work worse towards the end of the game. Sometimes it becomes highly difficult to go, because after holding F, nothing happens at all. You have to walk back and forth and try again until the character finally enters the door.● The fact the player gets the last level after getting almost all the collectibles which, by my calculations, usually happens after going though the main plot makes . After completing all collectibles, there are no activities left in the game at all. So what’s the point of maximum 40 levels if 30 levels are more than enough to go through the main plot and even more?● It's not about your PC; it's just all about the game. 8GB (which is possible to play with), 16GB (which is recommended), or 32GB RAM – .● Poorly, there is  while on broomstick as well as there is  so there is no reaction from other characters if you barely knocked them down. It's not a catastrophe, but feels weird still. ● Obviously, there is no The Haunted Hogsmeade Shop PS5 exclusive quest in Steam version of the game. This is the quest (and it's a pretty good one) which allows you to open your own store and sell your belongings for a better price. However, , so now we can see the store's locked door in Hogsmeade. Thanks, I guess? ● You’re . Back in Resident Evil 2004, the player could shoot through the gaps in the textures, and this is a project with AAA price in 2023.● When a game has flight mechanics, you never know if it will be good or not. But here,  (except for the lack of collision animation). Besides, you're also able to  and find the one you like visually. Plus, there are three types of mounts revealing with the story progress. ● You can help random characters with extra tasks but you’re also allowed to never give back the things they asked to help with. Some of them need to get back their books and you are happy to help them, but some of them are Zenobia Noke, and I’ll never regret I did not give her back whatever she wanted me to find.● There is nothing special about the character customization menu at the beginning of the game, but  into any other outfit from those already found or received as a reward, is priceless. And it’s a real visual treat!● You can . If you don't want to see the mini-map or quest markers, or you don't need a spell bar, you can remove everything freely. Eventually, you can just turn off HUD completely and enjoy the game. It is quite a needed feature.●  is the witcher’s flair in the Harry Potter universe. It’s a night vision device in the magical world and also an invaluable tool for finding anything and everything. Revelio is a spell justified by lore of the game, the usefulness and convenience of which cannot be overestimated. Besides, Revelio has its own assign button, so this spell doesn't take any of much-needed space on the spell bar.● Although I didn’t like that only first lessons were interactive, since so many people told that the class system in Hogwarts Legacy would be similar to that of Bully: Scholarship Edition, the spells learning as a system worked out well. One way or another, . They won’t overload you and are quickly remembered.● From the ability to stealth to various spell combinations,  in Hogwarts Legacy are solidly implemented. Fighting is interesting even at the end of the game because it's not tedious. You always use different spells and try different combos. Yeah, it may not be the best combat system in the world, but it's well implemented which is just great.● There is , so you can not only finish the collectibles and achievements, but also complete unfinished side and extra quests.● If you forgot where we are, this is a real magical world, so grow flowers, collect herbs and make potions, and don't forget to pet and feed magical beasts. Everything is in real time, online farm lovers, even if the time periods are short and can get even shorter since you can use fertilizers. This is , baby!● There are , and you can pet them all. . There are lots of unnatural-looking things, given the fact this is England in the 19th century. After finishing the game, I still have barely anything special to tell about the plot. . Despite the fact I have mixed feelings about many things, or the fact Hogwarts Legacy has poor optimization and many limitations, and there is also no quidditch, I liked it. Hogwarts Legacy is definitely worth the money, and I got pleasure exploring the world, casting magic and finishing the collectibles. ."

Harry Potter fan, etc etc.Let me tell you the THINGS I DON'T like about the game:Sometimes the world feels very empty even though you find students and people everywhere. BUT THEY NEVER REACT TO ANYTHING YOU DO. There are beds and you have a bedroom BUT YOU CAN'T SLEEP IN IT. You DON'T even get a CHEST to put cool gear that you find and DON'T want to SELL even if you can make other gear LOOK LIKE the one you like. Sometimes we just like knowing that we can hang on to legendary stuff and keep it. You CAN'T SIT in chairs with other students and just watch them do their weird things. YOU ONLY FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PART OF THE WORLD DURING MISSIONS. That's the only time that NPC's react and interact with you. GREAT GAME for Harry Potter universe FANS. NOT SO MUCH for OPEN WORLD players who WANT AN IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE sadly."

But unfortunately the level of delight at the beginning is equal to the level of disappointment at the end. Lots of cool stuff. But everything feels unfinished. Animals, plants, potions. Useless.There are few plants. I bought all of them at the start of the game. Grew them once and did not come to them again. Save animals? Cool! But really you just put them in your bag. And then there is a bug when they just get stuck in a cage. Cubs do not grow and are no different from adults. There are many colors like in Pokemon. But they didn't do anything about it. They simply exist. I was expecting at least something from the potions. Maybe I'll add the ingredients myself? Or make your own potions like in Skyrim? No. It's about 6 potions. And only green potion is useful.Puzzles exist only for you to spend time on them. Without them the game would have been quite short. Tbh at start I liked them. But then i quickly realized that they are all the same. But on the map there are an insane amount of them. And at the end I got a bug that didn't let me complete the collections. 139/140 chests. Now they seem to have fixed it. But the taste of disappointment stayed with me. locks exist only for you to return to old locations. You will get the ability to open them in the middle of the game.The story is a complete failure. Illusions of choice. Empty characters. I don't even want to talk about the end of the game. This is a disappointment. I don't know who decided it would be okay.When I saw Hogwarts for the first time I thought that I would explore the world like in Witcher. Don't expect it. There is no mystery here.I would still give a like for this game. I spent so much time there. And the emotions that you get at the start are incredible. But the end made me so sad."

In most of the dialogue you can choose what to say. We have many ways to pass the mission. Each mission is interesting and different than earlier. We also have riddle games and good sidequests.Gameplay - 9/10Beautiful open world giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore Hogwart, caves, forests, mountains and doing much more things. The map is very large. Herbalism and Alchemy are important and helps a lot, we also can upgrade equipments. We can have a real wizzard adventure. Fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying.Characters - 10/10Each character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We also can choose the path of the main character be good wizzard or bad (unforgivable spells) but the game won't punish us for it.Graphics - 10/10Graphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. The movement of water, clouds are very well refined. We can see falling leaves, changing weather. It makes a huge impression.Sounds - 9/10Music and ambient sounds in this game fits great. We can listen climatic music which is selected for each moment of the game. Character voices are not my favourite but it fits into character. There is a lot of music known from the movies.Overall - 9.5/10If you are thinking about purchase this game, if you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend these game for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun comes from that game. This is well made game not only for Harry Potters fans, but for everyone."

It's fulfils that itch of being a wizard.- Riled up people on social media should not stop you playing this game if you really want to.- All the complaints I have about this game are minuscule, like the removal of Quidditch.- Never the less, I think they will probably add Quidditch in DLC, then we will have the complete package!- So let's go over some of the things I like and the minor inconveniences the game, first the negatives:- We have all probably noticed, the game lags at higher graphics, even on good systems, why is this?- Over all my searching, it seems like there is severe memory leak issues with this game.- More over, there are some backend bugs due to how the source code was implemented into the game.- Everything you can do to limit this won't fix that, you need Ascendio mod to have a chance to fix it.- Not sure if this will be fixed in future, but if you are fine with mods, there is at least a good fix for it.- As for gameplay itself, I wish you could reset talents, also I hope we get an increase in spell variety.- Really, the gameplay is fine, very fluid, could do with some touch ups in dodge indicators, seen it bug a bit.- Evil characters wont have THAT much consequences either, like Avada Kedavra is just like saying a swear.- Not seen much bugs, I did fall through the floor once which was weird, it didn't let me open my map either.- On top of that, sometimes rolling and climbing are a bit... inconsistent, you can end up in unintended places.- Take the Witches Tomb, there is a platform you can climb up, only a specific angle.... for some reason...???- Bugs and weird gameplay aside. They seem fairly minimal, let's talk about the forced ""representation"":- Every dialogue option refers to you as ""They"", I get it's due to 'modern times' but it feels very out of place.- In some dialogue it just doesn't flow well, it's like they intended the dialogue to have he/him and she/her.- Now I don't mind if they was an option, but the other two options should also be a thing.- Guess they wanted to avoid drama from the mob, at that point, was just a futile effort, same with Sirona.- Kindness and empathy may be the intention of the developers, but it just comes off as pandery after a while.- I do admit though, these interactions are not that bad and are far between. Doesn't impede the game really.- Let's talk about the unforgivables: OP, not as OP as you think. You will run Avada Kedevra all the time.- Learning new spells sometimes is a waste since you wont use them but more variety is always good tbh.- Every spell has a use but some overlap. I wish the Room of Requirements spells didn't need to be hot barred.- Difficulty is pretty decent, but you could go through this entire game without being hit once I think.- Oh also forgot, the stealth system is a bit  bare boned but it's also not the worst, needs expanding to be sure.- Very nearly every situation can be overcame with brute force, there are small required stealth parts tho.- Even then, these are scripted parts, not something you would naturally use in the open world as much.- Really... overall, these are BARELY nitpicks at all.- The combat is excellent and so many combos, load outs and rotations I've seen on youtube.- Hitting people with certain spells feels so punchy. The fantasy is there for being a truly powerful wizard.- I personally like to use expelliarmus to disarm opponents then use Magic to throw their weapons at them.- Sound is also great, every spell has a unique feel and puts you into that fantasy of being a wizard so well.- Game of the year contender to be sure. Though I suppose it isn't all that revolutionary, it's just plain fun.- Another open world game, but at least this time, you have a true feeling of fantasy and role play.- Minus some of the forced dialogue, the script for the game ain't bad, funny moments too with students.- Every npc seems to have some trigger that makes them say something at certain times or do something.- To me as well, the characters are great, already seeing people thirst over the Herbology teacher, jeez lmao.- Overall the charecterization of each house is spot on, I love the clothing, the areas and the students designs.- Until they allow Quidditch or house points, this can be expanded on, it's mostly cosmetic at the moment.- Common rooms too look nice, not any customization there, but that is what the room of requirement is for.- Hufflepuff has the best Jackdaw mission btw, they go to a very well known place in the wizarding world.- Great game.- Reccomend to anyone who loves the wizarding world.- All the things you expect are here, not rocking the boat but what we need right now.- Salazar.- Slytherin."

Developers clearly focused on quantity over quality, it felt like I was playing a Ubisoft game before I gave up on them;- You can't get the final cutscene unless you reach level 34 by the time you finish the main story, and that means you have to drag yourself through repetitive content to finish the game."

I waited 20 years for this. I'm every second of this, the atention to detail is amazing. And sometimes you get the Skyrim vibes. The OST is amazing and pays tribute to John William's with lots of variations from the OG.I gotta adress the elephant in the room tho: performance is not great. It boggles my mind that they chose to go with Unreal Engine 4 for a game of this magnitude, specially when one of WB's own devs have an amazing engine ""Firebird"" from Monolith (used in Shadow of War), which these devs could have borrowed if WB wasn't to give monolith the project for what reason may be (maybe because they are doing wonder-woman). My point is, UE4 is dated. It used single threaded performance so the 1% lows are disgusting and all over the place (12900K + 4090). The hardcoded TAA to mask the engine's limits and rough edges is vomit inducing at times.2nd- Complaint: They should have gone further with this project. NPC colision and interaction specially inside the school. Day and night cicle is there but there is no mandatory curfew and no eating schedule and classes are not times. So it all feels off somehow. They should have gone with an aproach á lá Kingdom Come Deliverance on this imo.Alas, no game is perfect, maybe the potterhead in me makes turn a blind eye to all the shortcomings in this game, because when at its peak this game really does shine and any fan will have goosebumps. The wasted potential may be mitigated with mods as i already seen some mods on Nexus and there already a mod loader (btw, theres a mod to unlock all PS5 exclusive content but requires a new save to get the mission, but potion works regardless)And there you go. im sure im missing a lot of stuff, but i recomend this game for all fans, and to non fans who like a RPG lite, story driven game. 9/10"

You can do basically everything: • Come up with your own combat style• Explore the world, which is pretty big• Put the coolest or dumbest costume on your character :D• Grow plants, brew potions, breed animals• Decorate the Room of Requirements (if you're into design, you can spend many extra hours in the game)• Learn unforgivable curses :D  I must say that I also liked the story and the characters.The only drawback for me was too much similar grinding (this is mostly about Merlin trials.)

Even though the setting is 19th century Hogwarts and most characters and plotlines are completely divorced from the main series, there are plenty of easter eggs, references and “he said the THING” moments to feed your millennial childhood nostalgia. Furthermore, we get to visit various locations and use a bunch of MacGuffins that directly reference events from the books (which kind of makes you wonder why a 5th year like the game’s protagonist is taking the same mandrake 101 class as Harry did in his first year, but I digress).You start out by customizing your hero by choosing your appearance, gender, voice (one male, and one female). Your avatar receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts as a late fifth year student. Enter Eleazar Fig, your own personal mentor, who will help you harness a newly awakened form of ancient magic. After an introductory misadventure in Gringotts and a Sorting Ceremony in which you get to choose your own House, you are free to tackle the magic academy and surrounding grounds (including the Forbidden Forest, Hogsmeade and other iconic locations). Later in the game you get flying mounts in the form of either a broom or a hippogryph, as well as a massive ground mount that can ram enemies and obstacles.Sadly, there’s no Quidditch, ostensibly because it got banned by the headmaster (Phineas Nigellus Black, a rather unpleasant fellow and Sirius’ ancestor), which limits the usage of your broom for map navigation, a couple of sidequests and popping collectible balloons. Just feels like a missed opportunity. You will gradually learn tens of spells during your schoolyear, varying from combat to utility spells and you’ll have more and more access to the map as you gain the power to destroy obstacles. There’s also a skill tree and as you complete your Field Guide (basically an album with all your collectibles) and complete Challenges you also unlock more inventory space, cosmetics and runes you can upgrade your gear with. For the most part, the mechanics used by the game are par for the course in the whole open-world action/adventure genre: you have stealth and the obligatory takedowns, there’s the whole twin-stick orientation lockpicking when you Alohomora a locked door and you have a form of basic color coding to complicate the combat a little bit (you have to cast either red, yellow or blue spells to pop enemy shield of their respective color). Enemies you fight can be spiders, goblins, dark wizards, trolls and a few other types, but for the most part are just fodder for your ever-expanding arsenal of combos and damage spells. Most of the time you’ll only use four quickslots, but you can unlock extra sets to accommodate a more versatile playstyle. The combat resembles Arkham-type dancing where you alternate your offensive strings with timed parries and dodges and try to sustain a high combo count by not getting hit. For the most part, these things feel like threaded ground and might even become tedious after a while. It doesn’t help that the game’s main story sports a couple of one-dimensional villains and the plot feels like a salad in which they wanted to include as many fanservice elements as possible (you go from visiting a vault in Gringotts during a goblin assault to revisiting memories in pensieves to trying to unravel the mystery of the Deathly Hallows). Despite the generous playtime (around thirty hours to finish the main story and about 70% of challenges in my experience), Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t take much time to develop its central characters. There’s a lot of diversity in almost every aspect but not a lot of depth - the stakes are higher and the drama is more impactful in Sebastian Sallow’s quest chain than the main story. On the plus side, the game looks absolutely gorgeous. There’s an almost painterly look and the gloomy weather really enhances the elaborate architecture and detailed models. If you wanted to explore Hogwarts in an elaborate, big-budget way this is your best chance - meeting ghosts, opening secret tunnels and running errands through huge, ever-shifting staircases feels like a wizard-themed playthrough of Bully. Little subplots and grievances you solve intertwine with classes where you unlock new abilities and tools, and there’s even a day/night cycle that affects available content (although in Hogwarts Legacy there’s no time limit to doing anything and you can’t skip classes). Speaking of upgrading, there’s a pretty elaborate crafting system that has you collect ingredients for potions from plants that you grow yourself or buy from vendors, and gear upgrades require stuff you can collect from beasts you grow and breed. To that end, The Room of Requirement returns from the book series and serves as your personal sandbox. The game does a good job of not feeling overwhelming or pressy about its open-world content. Even though there are dozens of activities, over fifty sidequests, puzzles of a wide variety and hundreds of collectibles, you can easily go through the story without touching them and won’t feel underpowered or like you’re missing out. Some of the content is locked behind spells, which you will learn by attending classes and doing assignments for your professors.Is Hogwarts Legacy worth it? If you’re a Harry Potter fan and aren’t tired of the framework these types of triple AAA sandbox actioners employ, by all means. You get around 60 hours of gametime if you want to collect everything (according to my estimates) and will enjoy a more than competent and varied (if not particularly well-written or deep) experience."

The immersive atmosphere and top-notch cinematics make you feel like you're really part of the wizarding world. The flying mechanics are also a standout feature, providing a thrilling and fun experience. However, the game does have some issues that hold it back. The lack of freedom is a noticeable downside, as it would have been great to have more control over your actions as a student. Additionally, the lack of optimization can be frustrating at times, as it impacts the overall performance and can be a distraction from the otherwise engaging gameplay. Overall, Hogwarts Legacy has a lot to offer for fans of the Harry Potter universe. While there are some areas that could be improved, the immersive atmosphere, thrilling flying mechanics, and detailed world-building make it a fun and enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of the series or just looking for a new adventure, Hogwarts Legacy is definitely worth checking out.PD: Don't be fooled by my playtime, I was mostly offline playing."

This game constantly introduces new spells and mechanics as you progress through the story. I'm a gamer who is accustomed to ignoring the story missions until 40 hours later - don't do that. You'll want access to spells and pickups before you really get exploring. I recommend PRIORITISE THE STORY MISSIONS THROUGHOUT. It is very hard to not get distracted along the way.Gameplay - It's all about exploring, finding collectables, opening doors, solving puzzles and finding secrets. Most puzzles give rewards. The Hogwarts castle is huge. The surrounding area is also huge. There is a LOT to explore.This game is NOT about making decisions and seeing changes from those decisions. Most dialogue choices early game are just for Roleplay, are you boastful or humble, nice or snarky?  I don't believe these have any impact. Near the end of the game there are a couple of quest choices that do have impact. Those choices are obvious, you get asked a question in a quest and you can choose one of two answers. No need to worry about saying the wrong thing through most of the game.Combat - there are four spell types, damage (slice, set alight etc), control (slow, cause to float etc), force (push, pull etc) and utility (light, repair etc). The first three are used in combat, and the spell types are colour coded. Sometimes an enemy can only be effected with a control spell, and after that you'll be able to do damage normally. There is dodging and shielding. I played on 'normal', and found combat to have a good flow. It is fun, challenging enough to not be too easy, but not frustratingly difficult either. You can't hurt your classmates or villagers with combat spells, only enemies.Stealing - nobody cares about stealing. Just pick locks right in front of people, it's totally fine.Stealth - There are only a couple of short mission sections that require stealth. Both are sections you can return to later, so no need to explore everywhere while trying to stay hidden. You may use stealth in open world for sneak attacks, but it's not required or necessary.Game resources - You can craft potions, and grow plants that can act like turrets or grenades. Honestly, the only potion I used in the entire game was the health potion, and I rarely remembered or needed to use the plants (on normal). You'll end up with more money than you know what to do with. I had close to 50,000 at the end of my game. The only one that I found really important was using the loom to upgrade items (unlocks a long way through the story).Performance - I'm running a 1080GTX and expected to be playing on Low, but I could actually turn it up to Medium, and I'm quite happy with the performance. Only occasional hitching is seen.Clothes - Clothes are important. You can tell this, because you'll complete a dungeon that's worthy of Indiana Jones, and in the big glowy chest at the end you'll find . . . dun dun dun . . . An Old School Uniform! You have a bunch of gear slots. Found items have defense stats and can have special abilities as well. This game DOES HAVE transmog, and you should use it. Put on your outlandish glasses, go back to the top 'Gear' screen and use the prompt to change the appearance of the gear to match any gear you have found/sold/destroyed so far in the game.Character creation - DO NOT change the voice pitch of your characters, they'll sound weird. If you DO change it, you can actually go to the audio options menu and change it back. You don't get to fully customize your character appearances. There are 30 head shapes to choose from (15 each feminine/masculine), 50 hairstyles, 20 skin tones (there's a mod if they don't go light or dark enough for you), hair colours, freckles and moles, scars, eye colour, eyebrow shape, masculine or feminine voice, and whether you sleep in the Witch or Wizards dorm.Dorms - directly from the books, wizards cannot enter the witch's dorms. In Ravenclaw, enchanted suits of armour with polearms will block the stairs, in the other three dorms, the stairs turn into slides as you try to go up them. Whether you want to explore the whole dorm, or experience the slides may influence your decisions. The Ravenclaw and Slytherine dormitories are basically mirror images of each other and roughly identical, you're not missing anything by going as a wizard. The Gryffindor witch's dorms are very different to the wizards and worth seeing. In Hufflepuff, the balcony area outside the witch's dorms is also worth visiting.Animals - There are lots of cats. You can pet them. You can also accio them. There are other animals roaming the world (angus cattle, chickens, owls squirrels . . . ), and there are dens where different Magical Beasts congregate. Later in the story, you can ""rescue"" the magical beasts.LGBTQ+ inclusion - this game has gay NPCs, a transgender NPC (with a transgender voice actor), and allows full voice/face/dorm picking options for characters.Violence - there is a surprising amount of murder in this game. You'll constantly be fighting Dark Wizards, Goblins, Wolves, Giant Spiders (there's a mod for that) etc, and you're getting rewarded for defeating them. If you want a game for yourself or a child with lower violence, this is not the game for you.Racism - so far I have seen zero evidence that the goblins may be a racist stereotype. NPC characters represent a solid range of racial backgrounds.Mods - this game supports mods. I have only used a mod that improves the vivariums, so far. There's a mod that makes spiders appear as burgers, and many other excellent options.Complaints:- The map does not show you the corridor detail, except in the little minimap in the corner. It's a bit annoying.- Only 4 character slots. My instinct was to create 5 or 6 characters, play them all for half an hour and then decide which to continue with. Nope. 4 characters only.- Getting inundated with too much clothing that I've picked up, and the puzzles to get more slots being a third of the way through the story missions.- Some of the mechanics are unintuitive, like using the map to its full potential (scroll out to see collectibles), figuring out how to change gear appearance.- Can't skip the tutorial prologue for new characters.- Bug reporting is a bit harder than necessary, you need to sign up on the WB website. They'll only consider bugs that get enough votes. I had a bug that caused a mission to be incompletable, I had to abandon the mission and start it again from the beginning. The bug report didn't get enough votes in their system for them to even look at it. *sigh*So, all just minor things really. It's a good game."

The graphics, the music, the ambience is near perfect. However this is where the praise ends, because this golden palace is filled to the brim with sh*t.The major problem:There is no immersion. You are a perfect Mary-Sue without any backstory, everyone loves you, there is no friction at all, there are no consequences, there are no friendships or romances, there is simply nothing that defines you and your journey through Hogwarts other than the fact that you are perfect and chosen. All other characters - bar Sebastian - are lifeless and dull, interchangable really. Almost every corner reeks of cut content (the mechanics for Quidditch are there, but it wasnt finished, Sebastian clearly is supposed to be a romance, the other three ""companions"" however werent finished at all, most noticably in Poppy and Amit.)Instead minigames and ""riddles"" are thrown at you at any moment to breath some life into this, but unfortunately it only breaks the immersion more. Again you are the only one to solve these riddles, because you are perfect.The other big issues:To this day I am having severe graphical issues. The first 2 weeks this game was almost not playable due to poor performance. Now the performance is alright, but textures dont load or load extremely slowly. Even on medium settings.The combat is fun for like an hour or so, then it gets tedious extremely quickly, because there are only like 5 enemy types or so.I dont even wanna go into detail when it comes to the overall storyarc. Its so bland, I just wonder how people like that can call themselves authors and how anyone can greenlight that crap. Overall this is the biggest disappointment since Cyberpunk for me."
90,10,Majordomo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/You_Found_The_Easter_Egg/,142,5,1,68.1,Posted: March 19,175,13,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/58a1382fe2dd681a75bf69f6567da0d0e276d902.jpg,"""Magic is no different from any other power. What really matters is the one who wields it.""- Eleazar Fig Hogwarts Legacy is the first instalment of the beloved Wizarding Universe since 2013, so it's no surprise that the open-world RPG blew up the market, with many series fans eager to embark on this new magical adventure. However, despite the stunning visual designs and a diverse range of creatures, plants, and potion recipes, the rich package quickly becomes stale, with some shallow formats employing the Disillusionment Spell to hide flaws.  The journey begins a century before the events depicted in J. K. Rowling's novels, with a custom-rendered protagonist who has just begun their fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The talented wizard has shown a strong affinity for magic over the past few months, and with the aid of friends and strange acquaintances, they will set out on an epic journey that could help them reach their full potential. Who knows what secrets they may uncover? Hop on the Jacobite steam train and find out for yourself… The main plot follows the traditional Harry Potter formula, with the protagonist discovering their calling that connects them to a greater purpose. The colourful cast that takes up the mantle of supporting characters further reinforces this factor as they are intertwined with your wizard’s personal growth and progress. But yet, with such diverse personalities and some solid chain quest activities, the overall narrative keeps falling flat the more you play the game, and the main reason behind this can be found in the dialogues. Since the Harry Potter universe has attracted players of all ages, Avalanche Software took the safest approach by offering a child-friendly experience. As a result, many times you either encounter NPCs that talk like children or, even worse, they are treating you like a child despite the fact that you murdered three wizards prior to the interaction.In contrast to its weak narrative elements, Hogwarts Legacy provides solid gameplay in both combat and exploration. The plethora of customization options and unexpected interactions between spells and consumables provide all of the tools needed for unique role-playing sessions, but this does not imply that they check every single box with equal efficiency. Avalanche Software faithfully depicts Hogwarts and the many regions that surround it, capturing both the beauty and the mystery that the Wizarding World is known for. The Hogwarts castle is the game's pinnacle, with many hidden rooms and interactable objects cleverly placed in crowded corridors or isolated locations, while the surrounding fields add an extra layer of diversity with various underground caverns, cosy villages, and mysterious forests. Although an overwhelming amount of beauty is bursting at your screen, the developers made sure to take things slowly by opening up to the numerous mechanics without imposing limitations. Consequently, you can adjust the pace of the progression according to your needs. The only deterrent to the aforementioned formula is the map. By having such a diverse world, I was expecting a much better navigation system similar to other big titles of the same genre. The 3D interface, for instance, offers zero functionality aside from being visually stunning because it cannot be customised to highlight particular points of interest, and the distances are frequently inaccurate, showing long path roots that could be avoided.While fairly simple in nature, combat is very engaging, as it opens the door to many combos and unexpected interactions. The six elements of magic used in spell casting, the most potent of which are the forbidden spells, are stationary. Your toolkit holds a total of sixteen charms that you can equip, but you can always quickly combine different abilities depending on the circumstance. The beauty behind spell casting can be found in two main parameters: the rotations and the cooldowns. In order to prevent players from constantly using Avada Kedavra, each spell has a time limit before it can be used again. As a result, your heavy damage dealers become somewhat limited, forcing you to plan ahead of time before engaging in combat. Furthermore, in order to maximise their potential, Hogwarts Legacy introduces weaknesses to your adversaries that encourage experimentation and quick thinking. Spiders, for example, are weak to fire damage, while Dugbogs become vulnerable when you expose their bellies. Finally, the clearly overpowered potions and plants you'll brew or grow in your workshop will broaden your lethal abilities, adding another layer of complexity. Besides the main story, Hogwarts Legacy is rich with puzzles, collectibles, and minigames that are slowly unravelled as you learn new abilities. The Merlin trials, for instance, were the most memorable of the bunch because you got to use the knowledge you have been honing so far in order to move objects or simply destroy orbs and pillars in a timed manner. Such activities were a welcome diversion from the main pump-action story sequences, but despite their novelty, they were clearly outmatched by the game's most prominent feature: transportation. Flying on a broom proved to be exceptional, mesmerising, and, most importantly, fun to such an extent that it could be transformed into a game itself with the necessary adjustments. Last but not least, I would like to touch upon the lack of sandbox elements that the overall experience could clearly benefit from. Regardless of how charming the world is, it unquestionably requires a moral compass to keep our protagonist from overrelying on forbidden spells. The absence of such an addition is a missed opportunity, especially given that both students and professors comment on your previous actions.Staggering visuals, neat animations, and colourful spells combine into a canvas full of passion and grandeur. The world is a love letter to the Harry Potter fanbase, creating a very faithful template to the original series. Even the smallest details have been meticulously crafted, with the falling leaves during autumn being one of the most impressive and breathtaking effects that left me speechless. Everything is tinged with mystery and magic, almost begging you to abandon fast travel to fully appreciate the beauty, which is why I consider the lack of a photo mode feature to be a crime. Even though I appreciate the fact that music and spell effects are reused from the original Harry Potter movies, there is nothing new in the overall mix. Sure, the environmental sounds are remarkable, adding lots of personality during conversations and cutscenes, but I still find them very lacking in comparison to the visual approach. The voice acting is superb, with new voice actors getting a chance to shine, but as previously stated, the dialogues can become quite irritating. After nearly 70 hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Hogwarts Legacy is by far the most promising fantasy world adaptation I've ever seen in a video game, paving the way for a new era of Harry Potter titles. The game is excellent yet not perfect, with both unexpected and twisted turns that, in spite of their shortcomings, prove to be mostly masked by the shroud of nostalgia."

As previously known, we start with the character in fifth grade and not as usual, as an eleven-year-old in the first year. And yes, as the story progresses it becomes clear why that is.The main mission series, i.e. the core of the game, has been implemented flawlessly, is absolutely creative and not only takes place in the open world.I was really impressed with some of the things the developers came up with, especially towards the end of the main story.In addition, the cutscenes are graphically on film level and the story is told in an exciting and interesting way. Also, there is no shying away from death and violence and you experience a lot of fan service with attention to detail and only rarely does it get overly sentimental.The character editor is solid but doesn't allow for an excessive number of options. You can only select pre-made faces and characters. Unfortunately, there are no other personalization options. Therefore, the number of assets is also noticeable in the game because in the castle you always meet the same people or very similar ones. Basically, the castle is not overly busy and it is noticeable that grades one to four, six and seven are not available at all.I can imagine that this is partly due to the fact that not so many character models should be designed and even more NPCs would probably have caused a stuttering orgy.I also have the feeling that the character animations have been cut back a bit and there are some clipping errors. Basically, however, all character models are really pretty and the coats, scarves and capes are designed great, even if they quickly develop a life of their own when moving and flap around wildly. If you overlook the few little things, you get an absolutely beautiful game that can convince with both the graphics and the spectacular scenery. The faces look alive and you can read the emotions that go with what is happening, and the overall animation of the characters is very believable.In general, the world is very harmonious and you quickly feel at home. The areas in the castle are strongly inspired by the films and outside they have detached themselves more from them, but still made sure to create a world in which one likes to move.You can tell on every corner that the developers put their hearts into it and you constantly come across lovely details such as decorative objects, scattered lore and one or the other side quest.And finally, the musical cherry on top of the sundae with cream.There's no direct soundtrack from the films, but the music is pretty damn close and really, really good. I also liked the fact that there is no excessive continuous sound and the developers have found a good mix of when scenes are “bombastic” accompanied and when things should be a little quieter.The overall result is a production that really convinced me and made me forget the real world for hours.The main missions are quite varied and the game world changes as they progress. There are several seasons that change when you reach certain story moments. The side missions, on the other hand, are not tied to the seasons and therefore cannot be missed.However, it can quickly become confusing in the quest menu if you only accept the challenges and never complete them.As far as the demands of the side missions are concerned, this varies greatly. There are classic ""boring"" collection tasks but also missions that lead you to hidden places that you probably wouldn't have seen otherwise. And for the fact that these are purely optional areas, some of them are really impressive. In the lessons, you can expect a wide variety of challenges depending on the subject. All the different types of teaching are all well implemented and the professors appear as believable personalities who take great care of us. After all, we have a lot of catching up to do and that happens with… exactly, homework. Sounds really bad, but it really isn't because it loosens up the events for a while and there are additional magic rewards.I think that with the spells, a lot of attention was paid to player friendliness, because there are almost no annoying elements and spells have a long range and there is no cooldown for them outside of combat. Flying with the broom, which you unlock after a few hours of play and use constantly from then on, was also implemented very well. The controls work great and I'm really not a good flyer in such games. You're fast in the open world and it feels great. The view you have is absolutely awesome and I like to fly a little longer instead of using fast travel. A little less spectacular but somehow even cooler are the flying mounts that you unlock a little later. Basically, these do exactly the same thing as the broom, although they may seem a bit slower and don't feel quite as agile, but there's something absolutely epic about it compared to a magic broom. Of course you will have to fight too. And these are great fun.We have a standard spell, a block-counter mechanic, and the different spell classes. Enemies create colored shields that can be countered with the right type of spell. The great thing is that each spell also has a unique ability and it's not just the color coding that matters. This allows you to try different tactics and quickly develop your own magical fighting style. The game still has a replay value because the main quest is played differently in the different houses and the students react differently to it. And since you often have the choice of how to decide, a second run is probably just as much fun because you can try out the unused dialogue options. Ultimately, however, it is up to each individual to what extent the passages then differ from one another.Even after the main story, it's still worth playing because the final exam of the fifth grade is waiting for you. So there's a good reason to keep zipping through Hogwarts after the credits roll, doing side quests and engaging in battles.The game doesn't reinvent the wheel and comparable fights, quests and open world tasks can be found in other games, but the creative and clever implementation of the story events in a video game design, coupled with the new game mechanics that are presented every few hours I was pleasantly and positively surprised. The game has many allusions to the Harry Potter world, but still has its own and new ideas that the developers turn into unforgettable game moments.Review date: February 11, 2023✔ long story campaign✔ magical and enormously detailed game world✔ atmospheric music✔ great fights through magic combos✔ lots to discover ✔ game mechanics clearly explained✔ letters give backgrounds to the game world✔ Harry Potter charm with lots of fan service✔ interesting side missions and collection tasks✔ world invites you to explore✔ countless puzzles and mysteries✘ quite stiff facial animations✘ no Morality System, Quidditch✘ sometimes very artificial-looking dialogues"

The universe is very well retranscribed and very immersive, the number of references, small details or lore are huge and you will be directly immersed in it if you are a fan of the universe.The story is very intriguing, you want to go on to know the continuation but also want to take your time and do the many other possible activities in the game.  The exploration is excellent, there are a lot of collectibles scattered in the open world that will allow you to unlock in addition to the lore, various cosmetic elements.  There are as in any open world, a good number of side quests, as well as a housing system very chill. If you like loot, you will enjoy it.I was afraid of the combat system but it is actually very satisfying, many combo are possible thanks to the different spells you will unlock during the adventure. There is also a possibility to play in infiltration even if it remains quite minimal.  The ""dungeon"" system is really cool too, there are a lot of side areas where you can find more loot and there are also many interesting puzzles but often spoiled in my opinion by the clues given a little too quickly.Despite its optimization which could have been better, I recommend this excellent game which if you are a fan of the universe but also if you are looking for an open world with a lot of content and a quite innovative universe will satisfy you."

I will lay the issues out. ISSUES:- Graphical Poppins- frame drops (even on rtx 4090)- NPC dialogue makes no sense (NPC conversations consists of asking each other random questions with no responses) - Unable to interact with NPCs (you literally walk through NPCs. I want to be able to cast random spells like levioso on students and have them react accordingly. Currently you are a ghost to everyone, besides supporting cast.) - OMG the Cats have no hair or textures. Like I said overall it's a fun game. I'd give a 7 or 8 / 10"

I have stuttering issues but it was playable.

In the end... I´m the hero. Neither the ending nor anything else apart from maybe learning the 3 unforgiveables feels like its up to your choice. Beeing rude to NPCs / extorting them / betraying quest givers. Nothing happens... apart from maybe a different voiceline, but then everything is back to normal. I literally chose to take the powers. I used all unforgivable curses. Nobody cared. I was the hero... YAAAAAAY.... Replay value probably 0 unless you want to see a different common room / play in different house colours and maybe have 5 different side quests... Apart from that. Character feels overpowered very very easily if you put the talent points in the right talents combined with the right gear enchantments. Which is very hard to avoid considering how many points you get vs how many points are even possible to spend in total..."

You can tell where the dev team chose to spend their resources, and those areas of the game shine. Combat is very fun, exploration and flying around the world is fun, leveling up feels good (level 22 so far), and you always feel busy and never out of things you want to go do.The areas where it doesn't shine are economy design, early game pacing, and RPG systems where choices don't matter and the world does not change to player feedback. You should think of Hogwarts Legacy being more of an Assassin's Creed type game, than Skyrim.There's a lot of content, and I still have a long way to go. It took me 12 hours to unlock my broom and room of requirement. That was going at a normal pace through the main story and completing a few side quests along the way. It takes a long time for the game to ""Open Up"" but once it does it's a thoroughly fun experience.Overall 9/10 so far. What works and is fun is exceptional. What it lacks definitely makes you think ""What If"", but for me that doesn't overshadow the fact that this is still a Very Good Game!"

Hogwarts Legacy is nothing more qualified than a Ubisoft title. Okay, maybe a little bit more than that. It's ridiculous how people call Ubisoft's copy-paste open-world content trash and praise Hogwarts' bland content just because it is Harry Potter. In Hogwarts Legacy, the developers tried adding some Breath of the Wild shrine-like puzzles (Merline Trials) which consist of 6-7 types and are no-brainers. You memorize them, and the rest is a matter of finding butterflies, or other objects needed to pass the trial. Simply, they are fetch quests rather than actual puzzles. Moreover, they implemented some of Elden Ring's caves (mini-dungeons) because they had to do that too after Elden Ring's success, which is fighting the same enemies and mini boss again and again for some not-so-rewarding randomly generated loot at the end. This definitely is not an RPG where you can make your own path despite the developers saying so. It's an open-world action-adventure game. Yes, you can upgrade and find new gear (if that makes this game an RPG), but none of your choices matter. Devs saying you might even be a bad guy is also untrue here. Regardless of whatever you do, you're the hero in the end. Here is an example from my experience; during the side quests, I first offered people help for free, but after realizing that it would not change anything at all, I began charging them. This is the first time that I asked for money in return from people, in any videogame I played. That's how serious this is. You don't give your character's personality a form. Your characters Bearsonal'ity is already settled and you are simply a boring NPC. What else? You don't get rewarded or praised for not casting unforgivable spells, or punished for casting them. There is not even a single dialogue that condemns you for using these forbidden spells. Even if you couldn't add anything for that matter, you could have just added an achievement that said ""Complete the game without using the unforgivable spells"". You should have done at least that, developers. You may wander in the forbidden forest for days and perform unforgivable spells all the time. However, none of your professors will warn you or say anything to you about that matter. The main story is terrible. The storytelling and characters are dull and lifeless, and the side quest stories are not interesting either. Terrible villain, like almost all games, who is not given enough attention. Another lazy design is how professors teach you spells in exchange for fetch quests. Bleh. There is a day and night cycle, but that does not affect vendors. They will always be waiting for you to shop. There are not many people at the castle at night, that's all. This game should have just been around Hogwarts Castle and not focused on the open world. Combat is fun at first but gets fairly boring after 20+ hours. It's because of the lack of spell and enemy variety, dumb AI, and a combat system that's not very exciting. Traversing through the map is also a breeze after you have acquired the broom. There is no danger that you cannot handle. All you have to do is fly up if you want to get out of combat, not like there is any threat for you in the map. There are no dragons, goblins that use brooms, or any other enemy type that can counter your easy way out of battle. So flying is boring too. The game's marketing led me to believe that this would be Persona but Harry Potter. Even if it wouldn't be exactly what I hoped, I would expect so much more to do as a student inside Hogwarts than what you actually can. I hoped for a game that you had to go to classes in specific times, where there was authority, a similar experience to Bully. That would have made the game way better. You cannot interact with any person other than a few predetermined ones. In addition, you can not spend time with your friends as much as you want, sleep, do homework (legitimate homework, not fetch quests), eat food in the hall, or explore the ""magical"" (or should I say unalive) castle of Hogwarts. Hogwarts Castle is visually appealing, however, it feels dead inside. You don't feel like you are a student, instead, you feel like ""I am the chosen one and the hero of this world"". Common rooms are useless. There is nothing to do inside them or any reason to spend time in them at all. Hogwarts Castle is filled with invisible walls. Overall a bland atmosphere throughout the map. There are no puzzles. I wouldn't call those no-brainer Merlin Trials or ""Alohomora"" locks puzzles. There are many collectibles in the world as well, which are obviously artificial game lengtheners. There is no immersion at all, wasted potential.Optimization sucks. How tf can this game use 23Gb of RAM at times? It's inexplicable. Constant frame drops and stutters all over the place. Graphics are okay, feels like early PS4 era at most, lighting is terrible.To conclude, the major issue with Hogwarts Legacy is its game design and the lack of detail almost everywhere. It doesn't do the player any favors to direct them in every mission with the minimap and various hints. That is not how you lead the player into exploration. I can't have fun in any long lasting 50+ hours long open world game after experiencing BOTW, RDR2 and Elden Ring. Not only is the open world very poor content-wise, it is also not visually appealing. I disagree with those who say there is great art direction in Hogwarts Legacy. It looks just like the Far Cry 5 map, full of copy paste trees and zero points of interest. In Hogwarts Legacy, where can the player look and say: ""What's that interesting looking thing over there?"" Just like how we all said in Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild. Regarding Hogwarts, because everything is already marked on your map for you, you just open the map, mark your next quest and follow the path by tracking the minimap with your eye. As a result, the urge to explore disappears. What's there to explore when you % 100 know what you are going to find? Developers, it's 2023, learn from the innovative and successful examples around you. Follow My Curator Page:"

Tereny jak i Hogwart bardzo dobrze odtworzony. Raytracing robi robotę (co prawda często się buguje, ale zostanie to naprawione w patchu)✔️Gameplay ciekawy, nie nużący po 70H, jednak w niektórych momentach wydaję się za prosty. Zagadki co prawda powtarzające się to jednak wymagające od początkującego gracza.✔️ Gra z godziny na godzine się rozkręca co uważam za plus, nie jest to typowe monotonne bieganie po mapie jak w niektórych innych tytułach z otwartym światem.✔️ Sama główna kampania na jakieś 30-35h, jednak rekomendowane jest wykonywanie pobocznych zadań relacji przed każdym głównym, aby przedłużyć i rozwinąć trochę główną fabułę. Zakończenie nie spoilerując jest raczej standardowe/klasyczne jak na grę tego typu (nie było jakoś zaskakujące).✔️ System levelowania jak i ekwipunek standardowy dla tego typu gier. ✔️ Ciekawy system rzucania zaklęć i odblokowywania ich, jednak ze względu na to, że do głównej kampanii nie ma za dużych wymagań co do odblokowań (gre da się praktycznie przejść mają tylko podstawowe zaklęcia) to psuje to trochę możliwości jakie twórcy maja przy tworzeniu róznych poziomów rozgrywki (stopień skomplikowania zagadek jest niższy niż w pobocznych, często wymaga użycia tego samego schematu zaklęć).✔️ Możliwość skradania się w grze, przejścia poziomów ""po cichu"" (nie jest to jednak zawsze możliwe, czasami gra ""odsłania"" gracza automatycznie przed przeciwnikiem/przeciwnicy nadal nas widzą nawet kiedy jesteśmy niewidzialni lub wymaga tego gra)MINUSY:❌ Moim zdaniem animacje postaci i mimika twarzy jest momentami za drętwa (w tych bardziej ""dramatycznych"" momentach).❌ Powtarzające się teksty i zdania wypowiadane przez główną postać lub też osoby trzecie (np. dwie te same kwestie przy każdorazowym wchodzeniu do Hogsmede, Pokoju Życzeń etc.). Uciążliwe po 70H.❌ Optymalizacja to jest sam w sobie oddzielny problem (najnowszy patch ma to natomiast mocno poprawić). 3090 w 4K (RT/Ultra) osiągała średnio 60fps z DLSS w Hogwart, 30fps w niektórych lasach, 40-45 w Hogsmede, natomiast z spadkami/stutterami co jakiś czas przy ładowaniu terenu itd. (32GB rekomendowane do gry).❌ Kilka niedociągnięć, błędów graficznych z raytracingiem (przebijające światlo przez ściany), cutscenki czasami nie doładowywały na czas tekstur w tle/cieni na postaciach co trochę psuło immersję w niektórych momentach. Błędy pokroju blokowania się postaci na jakiś ścianach/schodach powtarzały się dosyć notorycznie. Wiekszość z tych rzeczy zostanie na pewno naprawione w patchu.❌ Ten sam przycisk usuwania/ustawień w menu, przez co przypadkowo można było skasować save gry.❌ Z kilka razy podczas 75H gameplay spotkałem się z błędami, które wymagały wczytania zapisu od nowa (np. zbugowane zejście z miotły, nie dało sie z niej nigdzie zejść)❌ System ekwipunku mógłby posiadać kilka dodatkowych opcji np. blokowanie wyglądu postaci, aby nie trzeba było przy każdej zmianie ubrania zmieniać wygląd na ten co był wcześniej.❌ Niektóre elementy menu wyzwań niezbyt intuicyjne na poczatku (np. pamiętanie o odbiorze nagród za dane wyzwanie, za każdym razem kiedy je się wykona, co prawda gra przypomina o tym co jakiś czas na dole ekranu)❌ Model latania początkowo wymagający (pad), jedna gałka służy za skręcia lewo/prawo, druga za góra/dół oraz kamere co przeszkadza początkowo w locie (z tego co wiem, nie da się tego zmienić w ustawieniach). EN VERSION:The game is very interesting, I think a solid 8.5/10 is a good rating due to the inconveniences that I will describe below.PROS:✔️ ✔️ Audio-visual setting at a high level. The grounds and Hogwarts are very well recreated. Raytracing does the job (although it often bugs, but it will be fixed in the patch)✔️Gameplay interesting, not boring after 70H, but at some moments it seems too simple. Although the puzzles are repetitive, they are demanding from a novice player.✔️ The game is getting started every hour, which I consider a plus, it's not a typical monotonous running around the map like in some other open-world titles.✔️ The main campaign alone for about 30-35h, however, it is recommended to complete side relationship quests before each main one to extend and develop the main storyline a bit. The ending without spoilers is rather standard/classic for a game of this type (it wasn't surprising at all).✔️ Leveling system as well as standard equipment for this type of games.✔️ An interesting system of casting spells and unlocking them, but due to the fact that the main campaign does not have too high requirements for unlocking (the game is practically possible to pass only basic spells) it spoils the possibilities that the creators have when creating different levels gameplay (the level of complexity of the puzzles is lower than in the side ones, they often require the use of the same spell scheme).✔️ The ability to sneak in the game, pass levels ""silently"" (however, this is not always possible, sometimes the game ""reveals"" the player automatically from the opponent / opponents still see us even when we are invisible or the game requires it)CONS:❌ In my opinion, character animations and facial expressions are sometimes too numb (in these more ""dramatic"" moments).❌ Repetitive texts and sentences spoken by the main character or third parties (e.g. two of the same lines every time you enter Hogsmede, Room of Requirement, etc.). Nuisance after 70H.❌ Optimization is a separate problem in itself (the latest patch is supposed to improve it a lot). 3090 in 4K (RT/Ultra) averaged 60fps with DLSS in Hogwarts, 30fps in some forests, 40-45 in Hogsmede, while with occasional drops/stutters when loading terrain etc. (32GB recommended for the game).❌ A few shortcomings, graphical errors with raytracing (light shining through the walls), cutscenes sometimes did not recharge the background textures / shadows on the characters on time, which spoiled the immersion at some moments. Bugs like characters getting stuck on some walls/stairs were repeated quite notoriously. Most of these things will be fixed in the patch for sure.❌ The same delete/settings button in the menu, which could accidentally delete the game save.❌ Several times during 75H gameplay I encountered errors that required reloading the save (e.g. bugged descent from the broom, it was impossible to get off it anywhere)❌ The equipment system could have a few additional options, e.g. blocking the character's appearance, so that you don't have to change the appearance to what it was before every time you change clothes.❌ Some elements of the challenge menu are not very intuitive at the beginning (e.g. remembering to collect rewards for a given challenge every time you complete it, although the game reminds you about it from time to time at the bottom of the screen)❌ The flying model is initially demanding (pad), one knob is used for turning left / right, the other for up / down and the camera, which initially interferes with the flight (as far as I know, it cannot be changed in the settings)."

There is an obvious love for visual details in the game, but there is not much substance behind it. The common rooms look beautiful, but there is absolutely nothing to do in them, you cannot talk to the npc's there, you cannot sit in a chair or sleep in your bed... These are but  a few minor details, but indicative of a bigger problem with the game; there is no immersion, your character does not seem to be part of the world. You cannot interact with most NPCs. they do not react to your spells, the dialogue options mostly do not matter for the progression of the story, there is no real day/night cycle (There is day and night, but shops are also open in the night, vendors do not seem to sleep or go out of their shop).After a few hours the combat gets repetitive, there is not a lot of enemy variety, the number of brewable potions and of plants is low. There is no real excitement of which spells you will be able to learn because the UI shows you all the spells and their names from the beginning, they are simply not selectable. The ""unforgivable"" curses are totally forgivable, there is 0 consequences to using them, during missions you can use them right next to your professor and he won't care in the slightest...Most hidden areas just contain a single chest with randomly generated loot. Your gear slots are very limited so you will have to fast travel a lot to vendors simply to get rid of the loot. Your gear is upgradeable, but I never bothered to upgrade it and under normal difficulty there really seems to be no reason to upgrade it.Finally there is a ton of collectibles (field pages, chests etc...) But these mostly to have been put in there to artificially add playing hours which provide little entertainement.I had a few hours of fun in the beginning, exploring the castle etc, but after that the veil fell and I noticed how basic the gameplay is and how unoriginal the main story line is.

(pretty on the surface but cast revelio and you'll notice how very shallow it is)the world is big yes but feels really dead outside of Hogwarts, its just filled with very stupid repeatable ""puzzles"" that seem to never end. you did one of them successfully? well that's great now go fly elsewhere and repeat it 1000 times. some of different puzzles will be introduced to you during quests where you do one and then they tell you to do more in your spare time. if you do decide on collecting stuff then for exploration there is also a lot of backtracking, example you run around collecting stuff and end up in 1 room where there are 3 things to collect but 2 of them are locked behind closed doors (and you get the extremely-annoying-to-use spell for it later) or require some spell that you don't have right now. please come back again later lol.The game has an utterly pointless MMO-style (green-blue-purple-orange) loot system. you can finish it with the starter level 1 gear and its just mostly filling your inventory and blocks you from opening chests later because your inventory is full so either destroy it/sell to vendor or just ignore all chests, still you might want to collect some for the looks which you can apply to active gear.rather mediocre story (with a unisex main character without any backstory whatsoever) and even worse boring side quests. starting at 5th year - why? who taught MC about magic before? not important i guess. also the ridiculous scale of things, you're a 5th grader but will take on mythical monsters and deadly mages from organized criminal gangs in combat along the way as a pastime between classes - rather ridiculous.also Hogwarts in 1800s is more diverse than any place in real world lol... in addition to British/European professors there are also ones from Japan, Uganda, India, Persia? they even insert a Korean teacher during an idiotic fetch stuff quest for learning lock-picking... why not include native Americans?! i guess they are not on your representation checklist lmao) no morality system, you can just run around and cast ""forbidden"" spells while on a quest with your classmates and they will only give some empty comment like, oh looks you're not afraid of dark magic bla bla bla. why is it even so controversial to use ""dark magic"" anyway, you're telling me its bad to kill someone with it but is ok to blow them up to pieces with a fireball instead??? also the choices you make (and that's limited to being either nice or mean to someone - example, they ask you to recover something for them and you'll return and say im going to keep it etc) along the way really don't matter at all and everything will play out the same way regardless of everything you did.on the positive the combat system is quite fun and using different spell combos feels rewarding. Hogwarts does have this atmosphere like in books/movies. its the only >decent< game in potter universe. also the first for this developer i believe? hopefully the next one will be better. being a big brand with big backers behind it it should've been much more than this.as a slap on the face at the end i found there is one more ""main quest"" after the ending to do but my level was too low for that - well i'm not going to grind those stupid puzzles for that. bye.overall i don't recommend it for full price but is ok to get it for a discount later on."
110,12,Preator,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000207900/,42,1,1,84.3,Posted: February 25,"1,992",5,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/7b6478d646627514420279ac2fbe7193690072f9.jpg,"Hogwarts Legacy is a third-person action-adventure game with some minor RPG and exploration folded into the mix. Set in the Wizarding World universe, this game finally lets you explore the castle of Hogwarts and the surrounding area with near-limitless freedom. But did this game capture the magic of the Harry Potter books and movies? Let's find out below.Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the 1800s, a long while before the events of Harry Potter. You play as a self-named and created character arriving at Hogwarts for his first year starting in the 5th year of school. Almost immediately upon setting off for your year of school, the flying carriage you are riding is involved in an incident where the villain, Ranrok, is after something in your possession.This unravels into a scramble for answers and unlocks your powers as quickly as possible to help your new friends and Hogwarts survive this growing threat. With the help of your mentor Professor Fig and some of the other professors at the school providing you with special assignments to hone your considerable talents, your powers grow significantly and impressively quickly, as well as your understanding of your place in this story.For the most part, the story is actually well-written and provides a lot of nostalgia for fans of the WW series. But this is ultimately undone by the lack of fluidity, flow and at times, rushed plot points that litter the entire game. You finally feel invested in a storyline, blazed through in a single mission and forgotten. Pretty sad as this story could have been expanded and would have been sensational.Hogwarts Legacy has quite a considerable repertoire of spells you can unlock and use throughout the story and exploration. Some spells are best utilised for puzzles and activities, and others are more combat proficient.Spells also fall into colour categories which help differentiate them for their use, as well as their purpose in combat. Purple shields can only be damaged by purple or ""force"" spells, yellow shields can only be broken by yellow or ""control"" spells and so on. Falling into one of the categories, Control, Force, Damage, Essential, Utility and Unforgivable. Unforgivable curses are broken as they can break any shield colour and dominate combat quite easily.Exploration plays a large part in the game, even though you won't need to or get much time to explore until you're finished with the rather lengthy tutorial. The best items can only be located by exploring dark caves and dungeons.I have to admit, however, while exploring was fun and fascinating in the first part of the game, it became more tedious in the latter, and I tended to avoid it entirely.Flying!!! I absolutely adore flying around on the broom or on the back of a creature and experiencing the world from way above it. There is just something absolutely captivating about it!But Hogwarts Legacy also doesn't have Quidditch in it, removing the main reason people would want to fly around. With fast travel available that is lore-friendly, there is already a quick means of travelling the world. They just removed a reason to get good at flying.This is the part where I'm going to cover a lot of little annoyances and missing content that bothered me during the game.Morality.There is none. You have the ability to cast both light and dark magic, but nobody really cares about it. There is no downside to killing people outright with Avada Kedavra, just as there's no reason to avoid it.Day/Night Cycle.Time does continue to tick as you play the game, and day and night do come to pass, but these events don't mean anything either. When you wake up in your dorm there is nobody still in their beds, and you are all alone. The school empties out for a few hours, but nobody is roaming the halls looking for students.Houses and house points.Joining one of the four houses, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw should mean something, but really they are just a mild aesthetic kick and have no real purpose. You don't gain points for your house by being a good student or doing complex challenges, and you will win the house cup regardless of your effort.This title is beautiful. Landscapes will capture your breath, and the amount of detail put into the world's design and development is astounding. Probably one of the most impressive graphical experiences available today. Particle effects from spells and the overall ambience are above the standard.The audio falls into a very similar basket. The ambience of waves crashing against rocks, trees rustling in the wind and birds chirping as they fly by is brilliantly captivating. While the soundtrack captures nostalgia and wonderment that the movies did so perfectlyRunning the game on high and set to 2560 x 1440 resolution, I never saw the game drop below 60 FPS. Ultra RTX did cause the game to chug quite viciously, however, but was fine as soon as I turned it down to high. I also didn't experience any significant bugs or issues whilst playing the game, which is impressive.RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 58%)CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 13.4%)GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 70%)While I had a lot of nitpicks to say about this game, the overall experience wasn't bad at all. Was it worth the current price? No, not really, Was it fun? Yeah, it was, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was. If you're a fan of the franchise, give this game a shot, but I would suggest waiting for a decent sale as I don't think there's enough here to warrant the price."

I'm not a big fan of Harry Potter (I watched all the movies and read a couple of books) but I like the universe and I had a ton of fun in Hogwarts Legacy.The main story is quite engaging and the companion ones are also intriguing (I love the Sebastian story).Hogwarts Legacy combats mechanics are simple but really fun. Only 26 spells but it was enough and there is a plethora of spells combos.Visual ? I put everything to max (even ray-tracing) and Hogwarts Legacy is fabulous, but indeed, it requires a monster PC.Two interesting features in Hogwarts Legacy are :- Pokemon-like, there are a lot of creatures to catch-up and after, feed/clean them.- Housing. There is big room (which increase with story) where you can decorate as you wish. Furniture is available in the open-world chests.- Character creation is awesome ! Let's talk about the open-world. Well, it's quite generic like Ubisoft games but not that bad. You have a lot of places to explore, destroy poacher camps, visiting other villages, doing quests, etc... Lot of activities to do between main quests.I did almost all the side quests but the 'collectibles' thing inherent in the majority of open-worlds quickly bored me. For example, I only did a few trials of Merlin.Like Wo Long Fallen Dynasty and like the other recent releases on PC, Hogwarts Legacy is badly optimized. There are few guides around to improve framerate and stability but there are no miracles. The Reddit thread named ""PC Performance Tips - This got rid of low FPS dips for me and friends"" can work for you. It does for me, so you give a try.On Steam Deck : I locked to 45 FPS the game is quite playable but still suffer from framerate drops.Hope Avalanche devs will work on patches for PC version of Hogwarts Legacy.Yes, Hogwarts Legacy is a good RPG than will make busy for hours. Also, if you play on PC, there are a lot of mods for the game. It doesn't seem to be planned at the moment, but I hope there will be DLC in the future."

The rest is... serviceable- combat is better than expected- music- visuals- voiceacting- atmosphere (in Hogsmeade/Hogwarts anyway)Cons:- all the copy pasted open world garbage: It's all so basic and identical that I don't think you could even simplify it further. 'Cairn dungeons' is the phrase they use to describe a tunnel of 200m length with a chest at the end. They copy pasted the very same cairn 'dungeon' about 150 times. Spoiler: The tunnel has right, left turn. Don't get lost.- combat falls entirely flat towards the 2nd half. Same enemies, no customization and the stat system shows it's flaws: troll 3 levels above you will 1-2 shot you which is fine, but a troll 5 levels below you can't even touch you.- there's about 10 enemies in this game total. And that's being generous. Goblins/Dark Mages/Trolls/Spiders. These 4 cover 99% of enemies you'll fight.- performance is still fairly poor. It runs okay'ish on higher end hardware but nothing more. And on this point: The promised 'Day 1' patch came 1 week after pre-launch and did little to nothing.- Difficulty: I played on hard and was a breeze. I understand this isn't a Souls game. But there's difficulties for the casuals, where is the difficulty for people who like a challenge?- Controls are kinda clunky, both on controller AND M/KB. Consumable wheel especially.- bunch of minor bugs, but mostly non- consequential. The only notable one for me: unfinishable sidequest (Biscuit)- you spend way too little time in Hogwarts. And the game encourages quicktravel and following the map blindly way too much.- accessibility settings aren't well thought out. I wanted to play without minimap and assistances to stop myself from mindlessly going from one world objective to the other, but there's not even a compass without the minimap...- Hogsmeade? More like Alohomeade. Seriously, there's nothing here other than shops and about 50 Alohomora 'Puzzles'- doesn't matter at all what house you play- this would've been better as a regular RPG focusing on Hogwarts and its immediate surroundings. With a regular character experiencing Hogwarts first time instead of all these grandiose plots. But its Warner Bros, so of course you're some random 5th year who just so happens to be the best wizard of all time. Excelling at everything the moment you touch it.  Oh and your magic is special too of course, no one else has it.- ... and of course you're the hero too, no choices on that matter, no dark path."

This game is a  for Harry Potter fans, or fans of the Witcher 3's combat and exploration. This game is very similar to the Witcher 3 in a LOT of ways, from the style of the combat, to the four equippable spells, to the repeating side-mission-esque puzzles and minor boss fights.For everyone else, however, it's a thumbs down. For 60 euros, you're getting maybe 20-25 hours of actual content. The rest is copy+paste side-missions and exploration. Now, the team here has made a AMAZING environment, but its big heavy-hit is nostalgia. Without the nostalgia, the environment is impressive, but not nearly as much as it is for a fan of the series.The story is awful. I'm sorry, but I have to be honest here. It's so bland and childish it's kind of embarassing. And it leaks into the characters and conversations too. The protagonist literally massacres hundreds of dark wizards and goblins, as a 15 year old, and nobody, including themselves, bats an eye at this. The actual main plot is not explored nearly to the extent that I wish it was, instead giving you a moustache-twirling villain, with hopelessly under-explored motives.If you're here looking for the magical story-telling of the books, RUN! It's not here!This is really what ruins the game for me. As I will cover later, the game actually has good characters that I'd love to see more of, but you rarely see more than one of them at a time. You interact with them in the same way that a WoW character interacts with quest NPC's, and that's a real shame.What that means is that the main plot is mainly just you, the bland self-insert, doing literally everything. Sometimes another character is along, but it's just for the ride. You're the chosen one.The combat is good, very good, but it's not THAT good.In fact, the story ruins more than that, because it means that your main interaction with the beautiful environment is just... collectibles. The story utilises the awesome environment so little, in fact, often you are spirited away to completely separate mini-dungeons, where you then fight off boss-goons to advance.Just... why?Oh yeah, and of course, the actual story is also super short, meaning you get very little content for your money. And replayability? Forget it. There are no decisions here. All playthroughs will be the same pretty much, especially if you try to complete your side-quests.The other characters fit well into the Harry Potter universe, without being carbon copies of book characters. In general, I found most of the characters pretty memorable. My favourite was Natty. I just thought she was nice.None of the characters feel out place, and there is a pretty good selection of main characters to interact with. Sadly, only one of these characters really interacts that much with the main story, Professor Fig. He's the only one who is really there from start to finish, and even then only really as a mentor character. You really miss the shenanigans and shared adventures that the books portrayed. Sadly, this just adds insult to the injury that is how they are used in the main story. I NEVER, not even ONCE, felt like I needed any of these characters. Except for teaching me a few spells, I, the main character, do EVERYTHING MYSELF. You don't get the feeling of complimenting talents like you do in the original series at all, it's just you against the goblin horde, assisted by Professor Fig who does boring study-stuff for you.What a waste!The real attraction is the combat. As I mentioned, it's very similar in feel to the Witcher 3. Now, if you've played the Witcher 3, you know that all runes except the protective one are basically useless compared to just hitting stuff with your sword.So imagine the Witcher 3, but with awesome spells, and you have the combat in Hogwars Legacy. If you're good at cycling spell sets, you can do combos with an array of up to 16(!) different spells. The skill ceiling is insanely high on these, and it's a lot of fun to watch the fireworks so to speak, as you sling burning goblins into each other, back to you, set them on fire, and back again. It's A LOT of fun!Oh my goodnees, the environment! This is hands-down the most fun I've had exploring since... ever, probably. You get to bloody fly, and they barely restrict it! And it's awesome! There's so much to see, so much to collect. For completionists like me, it's both a dream and nightmare at the same time.Most places have little lore tid-bits for you to collect and read, and the environment is lovingly hand-crafted, with a real attention to detail. Especially Harry Potter fans will really appreciate it, but honesly I think it's impressive no matter who you are.The only thing that really ruins it a bit, is the population of this world. Similar to early Cyberpunk, the sidewalk characters do.... literally nothing. They just walk around aimlessly, or stand idle in their set positions. Sometimes they say some neat things, but it's generally pretty disappointing when we're so used to better in games these days.But otherwise, the environments of this game are beautiful. Graphically it's a bit last-gen, but the art direction is superb, and to top it off, it actually runs pretty well. At least, it does for me."

No one cares... you can literally cast Avada Kedavra right IN FRONT of your professors, and they do not even react, let alone cause you any consequences whatsoever.Hogwarts itself, while visually impressive to be sure, has zero point zero percent ""Sentient Castle"" feel... nothing... there aren't even the iconic moving staircases... they only fade in and out visually, but they are nonetheless 100% static, always connecting the same point A to the same point B.Room of Requirement also is a major letdown, as it has zero roleplaying value, it is simply a room full of resource nodes, and the Vivaria are just the same... sure, for a few minutes it might be nice to watch a Hippogriff young offspring frolick about, but that's all you're getting... the animals themselves are also just glorified resource nodes, all you can do is brush, feed, harvest, repeat ad nauseam.The stuff you can summon both in RoR and Vivaria is also just scene dressing... if you were thinking of actually entering that Cottage you spawned in your Vivarium, think again.... if you thought you could sit down on those comfy chairs you just summoned, think again.Same with everything outside of the RoR as well... think you could go to the Great Hall, sit down at your House Table and eat, interact with friends/NPCs of your house, etc? Think again.The few things Hogwarts Legacy does well, it does really well... but everything else, and especially the ending of the main story, where your choices make zero difference, with there not even being any Epilogue to speak of... it all feels very rushed, and the game pretty much in all aspects aside from Main and ""Relationship Line"" story fails utterly to live up to the potential that is there in abundance.On top of all that, there's the abysmal technical state affecting a huge number of players even on 4090-level gaming rigs, and the fact that the game is massively shorter than what the devs promised... if I hadn't gotten it for free, I would've honestly refunded it, or otherwise felt majorly taken for a ride.Given that the game puts our ""Legacy"" so front and center, there's very little communication thereof while you play the game... for the most part, there are literally ZERO consequences to your actions, it simply doesn't matter what you do or don't do, if you use the Unforgivable Curses or not, not even what you decide during the crucial final minutes of the story... and as I said above, there isn't even any proper Epilogue, nothing to actually show you how your choices changed the world around you, i.e. what your ""Legacy"" actually would be.Nothing at all. And that leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste... so much wasted potential... this game could have been a true masterpiece... as it stands, I cannot in good conscience recommend it for full price."

You play as a Hogwarts student who just recently got accepted into the school, and as a fifth year no less! While this may seem weird, as one would expect to start from first year, it's both explained in the story, and honestly allows the player to jump straight into the action, instead of going through the basics. Anyway, at the start of the game, you're just about to depart to Hogwarts alongside Professor Fig, who's been getting you up to speed with some basic spellcasting. Things don't go precisely well on the journey there, and you end up getting involved in the latest goblin rebellion. Honestly, I can say I enjoyed the story, though the best part of the narrative comes through the companion sidequests. While there's four main companions with a certain involvement in the main story (one for each house), only three of them get their own personal side story.When it comes to gameplay, it's an open world action adventure game with some light RPG elements. While there's dialogue choices throughout the game, they don't really affect your relationship with other characters, nor do they lock you out of content (well, you can choose not to learn the Unforgivable Curses). Combat is done through spellcasting, while at first you only have a basic cast, as you progress through the story you unlock new spells, including, as I mentioned above, the Unforgivable Curses. Now, the game basically allows using them willy-nilly, and there's no consequences for going on a murdering spree; of course, it can be excused as you're fighting Dark Wizards and evil goblins. Beyond that, you can also get a broom to get around the map (no Quidditch, though), or even a hippogrif mount. There's also different skill trees in the form of ""talents"", which give you different upgrades, and while you can craft equipment, you can upgrade certain pieces of equipment. Also, a great plus is that you can change the appearance of your gear to that of any other gear you've found, so you don't end up looking like a madman wearing mismatching clothes.There's lots of stuff to do in this game beyond the main story and the side quests; perhaps too much, at times, as it can feel a bit tedious going for 100% completion. There's different mini puzzles in the form of Merlin trials, broom races, and at one point in the story, you unlock the Room of Requirement, which works as a sort of ""base"" where you can brew potions or grow plants to use in combat. Plus, you also get to rescue animals and put them in your own personal shelter, treat them well, and they'll give you resources (of course, it can feel a bit morally questionable how you ""rescue"" animals to get their resources, but the game makes it look like you're at least treating them fairly, and you can even release them to the wild).Graphically, it looks gorgeous. Hogwarts itself is very detailed, as are the surrounding areas. And the map is huge, too; not only do you get to explore Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest and Hogsmeade, but there's also plenty of little hamlets spread throughout the map, all with their own little collectibles, merchants, and side quests. The sound design is also very good; the dialogue is well written and the performances are all very good, and the soundtrack is excellent; some tracks resemble the movies, but the game has its own style as well.Now, to talk about Hogwarts itself, it's fantastic. The design of the castle resembles that of the movies, but there's still many details you'd find only in the books, including characters; Peeves, the poltergeist, makes an appearance here, as well as the different house ghosts. Since you can go to any House, they all get a very detailed common room, and a positive I have to note about the game is how they made Slytherins not be complete jerks. Sure, it's always seen as the ""evil house"", but over here, while they're still very ambitious folk, most of them aren't hateful people, just a bit of overachievers. The professors you meet are also great characters, and while there may not be as many lessons as one would expect in a game that's all about being a Hogwarts student, you still get a nice taste of student life.All things considered, I must say I definitely recommend this game, and it's certainly a contender for my personal GOTY, though we'll have to see what else comes out this year."

I haven't touched anything related to the game since I finished all the OG books, but diving into this game brought back some fond memories from my childhood.I think the biggest part of this game that I loved is how it captured the vivid scenery of Hogsmeade as described in the books. The game also managed to deliver that first day of classes type excitement from year-to-year—albeit in a condensed late-bloomer 5th year package. So far, this game has been the best depiction of the wizarding world in game format. You honestly feel it the moment you get sorted and even more so when you first exit the school to travel to Hogsmeade! This game's open world is vast and beautiful, and I haven't been so happy to fully explore a game like this since Skyrim. In the blink of an eye, I noticed that 70h had gone by without me even thinking about it. If it wasn't obvious enough, I really enjoyed my time at Hogwarts.As far as performance goes, I recognize others with stronger GPUs had issues. Personally, I did not experience any major issues on my end with my RTX 2080. I maybe experienced stuttering for about 1-2 minutes total out of 70h of play, but relative to my peers I basically had a stress-free experience.The combat is beautiful and definitely has flashy moves, but I do think some of the cooler spells come a little bit too late into the story to fully enjoy. In that same breath, the ability to fly with your broom also feels like it comes quite late as well (or maybe it just felt that way because I was taking in the beautiful sights).When it comes to exploration, the huge amount of collectibles may be intimidating but they don't feel like a chore because majority of the collectibles serve a greater purpose than just non-essential pick-ups. Most of the collectible categories come with a good bit of lore to really enhance your understanding of that world, and the rest are polished cosmetics for either your character or base-building. It was actually fun collecting them all!My only gripe about this game which I'm sure will be fixed soon is that I am currently locked out of 100% because the Biscuit side quest's lock is bugged (I opened it prematurely) and won't spawn. I'm not too bothered about it though as every other element in the game was fun to play out through and through!! I know this game is very controversial, but even a bad parent (author) can raise an excellent child (story) that can outgrow them if given the right environment and attention. This game has grown bigger than its creator, and the developers+designers that worked on Hogwarts Legacy really put their love into it. It's really hard to create anything this beautiful if you come at it with a hateful heart. Give the game a fair look if you can be a partial person. Screw the author, but seriously the rest of the team did a great job."

As a youngster who grew up with Harry Potter books, I finally had the opportunity to visit the famous school of witchcraft and magic, and I am generally pleased. Almost every corner of the castle is actually full with nostalgia and magical charm that all truth fans might desire. The world is filled with details and exploring them is a lot of pleasure.But you can not get around and fly in the ointment: The Deluxe version was a horrible idea since allowing people to play the raw game for extra money is strange, especially because the game will recieve a first-day patch that will fix the difficulties the game had during first 72 hours, such as loading times and kind of bad-ish optimistation/performance even with 30 rtx series.It is truly wonderful to see such work being done by a company that previously only had expertise with Disney Infinity as a title of this size.

That's it, you are actually playing another ""RPG"" with the same formula commonly implemented by companies like Ubisoft, the typical generic structure that works as a basic rpg and that's it, don't expect wondrous features, special gameplay, none of what you are thinking will find it in here (the same generic structure that you could find not only at most recent Ubisoft rpgs -ACs-, but also from some games by WB Games as well, like Middleearth: Shadow of War).This game, that qualifies as a rpg because of this generic implemented formula, is a letdown, specially coming from someone who grew up with the HP saga (read the books and everything).Yea, you got Hogwarts to explore and everything, but you don't have the feeling of being a proper student at it, there's no class framework, you just attend one class for 1 or 2 times, then you are free forever to bs around the castle (expected something like famous Bully, from Rockstar, a system that makes you feel you are a student).Teachers that teach you spells that don't even belong to the classes they are teaching (Wingardium Leviosa, for example, a charm spell being teached by the professor in charge of Herbology, what?).Game lacks of spells tbh, and if you thought you could be a dark wizard (one of the main points some people bought the game, including me), it's all a LIE, yea, you get the three unforgivables, but the whole world doesn't react into you using them, you can't openly kill people, only designated enemies (other dark wizards and dirty goblins). No morality system what so ever.Even the main storyline, tricks you into choosing an outcome, but in reality, there's no evil ending, you can't be the Dark Lord Voldemort would be proud.Filling the whole game with collectibles in order to hide the fact that the side quests are kinda poorly written and boring, the whole ""mini game"" (let's call it that way) around taking ""care"" of beasts (felt like a cheap Tamagotchi attempt), how other students or even professors don't react if you start to cast around them in an unresponsible way, there's no crime/punishment system so to speak (like what Bully had for example).I could go on but that's basically it, a somewhat decent game by looks only, but with somewhat mediocre gameplay, an ""rpg"" game clearly designed to people who are not gamers, casuals and for potterheads who belong in the two previous categories mentioned. Expected much, much more from Hogwarts Legacy, just a *big* letdown. 6/10.Bonus Track: the whole thing about not including Quidditch was retarded as best, it's one of the main features any follower or HP fan will ask, and you don't need to read any book, just watch one of the frigging movies to realize that!"

Avalanche Games (not to be confused with the more famous Avalanche Studios) really came through. As a huge Harry Potter and Wizarding World fan, I honestly could not have imagined a more wonderful game based on this beloved property. Those initial trailers for the game got me really excited but if  taught me anything it was that a heavy dose of scepticism is often required when it comes to these AAA games but gee golly did Avalanche deliver. You can see that  was made by a team who really love and appreciate the property as much as any other fan.Hogwarts castle is massive (and when I mean massive it's huge) to explore. The open world is also really gorgeous and captures the look and feel of the movies perfectly.  Set at Hogwarts in the 1800's, your character is a student who holds the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart and for the most part the main plot is downright exciting to experience as a long time fan (that end boss fight was one of the most intense fights I have ever had the pleasure of playing), the games magical combat turns out to be deep and rewarding and the side quests are really quite brilliant (most of them revolve around class mates that you befriend at the Academy) and some are really sweet while others are really bitter-sweet depending on the decisions you make. Some are downright sad. Other side quests revolve around the classes you will attend where you will usually learn a valuable spell or two to add to your repertoire.Sebastian Sallow's is particularly good. I highly encourage any player to complete it as it really tells an emotionally engaging story. I even loved Poppy Sweeting's story arc (what a little sweet heart on her crusade to save all creatures from poachers) and Natsai “Natty” Onai, who comes from Zimbabwe, South Africa's neighbour, and being African myself I could really identify with her) proved to be a true friend in the end.I was in Gryffindor so I never got to see the other character side quests as each house has its own. This was honestly one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played and that $150 million Warner Bros. spent on the making of this game was really put to good use. I mean hello, it made over $850 million in its launch week. The only issue is performance is a bit spotty, especially in the castle, but I got 95% of my field guide complete with lots of exploring of the open world map hence the 121 hours, your playtime may vary so please don't let my duration put you off. Otherwise, as a fan,  was an absolute pleasure to play and I highly recommend it."

Hogwarts Legacy does a lot of things right. It really captures the ""feel"" of the HP universe, and the story, setting, and world are everything I hoped they'd be for a game like this set in a universe I grew up reading about. It really feels like you're a student at Hogwarts.The wand combat is a little easy - which is not helped by how dumb the AI is in a fight - but it flows incredibly well. Switching between spell sets is intuitive & fast, and it's very fun to watch. Most enemies in the game have mechanics that allow you to kill them with incredible ease, if you use the right spell/combo at the right time. Flight controls are pretty clunky and awkward to get down. The facial expressions are pretty 'uncanny valley' creepy at times, and the voice acting can be quite bad (and quite good) in places. My character sounds incredibly spiteful spitting out the incantation for 'Crucio', but when I get it cast on me in a cinematic, my guy sounds like the pain he's experiencing is on par with banging your shin on a piece of furniture. The main story is also nothing special; very generic bad guy stuff. The side stories are far more interesting. The first bad note for me is that replayability is nonexistent and your choices don't matter. ""Be the wizard you want to be"" for WB apparently equates to ""Be the cookie cutter good guy we've shoehorned you into being, but you can make a small selection of decisions, kind of, at the end of the game right before it ends and nothing else happens"". Decisions that should be impactful barely get a little end-of-story ""and then this happened"" blurb. Following that, HOLY HELL did they try to shove every time-waster they could fit into this game. HL is the epitome of collector games. ""Collect your magic sources, collect the balloons, collect the landing pads, collect the trials, collect the animals, collect the plants"". As a completionist, I haven't been this bored out of my mind since playing the first Assassin't Creed games collecting the 100 little flags or whatever. The amount of inane, pointless collection in this game is absolutely obscene to me, and easily 3/4 of my 60-hour playthrough was just going around collecting garbage. If I had just focused on the quests, this would've been a 15-hour game. If I just did the main quest, it'd probably clock in at a bit under 10. And that's the main reason for the negative review: even though the core of the game is good, there's way too much filler, and no game that is only good for one playthrough, that would take a reasonable person under 10 hours to finish, is worth $60. If this ever goes for half off, absolutely buy it - it was certainly a fun ~15 hours."

This was advertised as ""make your own path"" kind of game, yet it can't be further away from the truth. There is one path, and it's the one the game gives you. There is no becoming a dark wizard, or a good one... you're just the character the game tells you to be.The whole game is lifeless, NPCs don't react to anything you do, you can talk to some of them but that's it. You can go around casting spells, no one will even look at you or react the slightest. You can go and enter people's house after forcing their locks, go through their chests, they won't say or do a thing, they just act like you're not even there. Most of the time you can't jump to places, invisible walls everywhere, making exploration very linear and flavorless. Combat is fun, but I'm still looking for difficulty. Basically entered one of the most dangerous places, the Forbidden Forest, after 2 hours playing and defeated everything that came my way without breaking a sweat, there is no real danger or even sense of danger, and of course you can't attack centors, because yeah... you're not a bad person, so the game won't let you do bad things. You can fly on a broom, and again, it's slow, no sensation or feeling of speed, you can go into an obstacle at full speed and you will just stop, no impact, no animation, nothing. You just stop like it's okay to ram into a wall. The only decent thing about the game so far is the story. It's well designed, for now, but there is not much choices or decisions to take, and the only few really don't change anything to the story... you just go with it and follow the game's lead. It's basically a playable cinematic.So to sum it up, it is yet again a very expensive game that brings nothing new to the table, with empty promises and seemingly half finished features. Was expecting this to be a Skyrim with HP world, turned out to be a plain adventure game you can't even play with your friends.4/10EDIT: So... difficulty got better, after turning it to difficult, it gets interesting if you face multiple enemies at once. That being said, I still think it's a bit weird that our character, a 15 years old student, can take on dark mages and other such threats so easily, but that's just how the game was made I guess.I've just finished the story, it was okay, nothing incredible, not bad either...  Some of you have mentionned NPCs reacting to certain things.. so I went ahead and tried all that. So yes, you get a line of reaction here and there when you cast a forbidden spell, but that's honestly just not enough. Lines are always the same, and that leads to pretty much nothing. What I was trying to mention is more like RDR2 type of reaction. Stand too close to someone, they'll ask you to move, make a mess, pay the consequences, etc.Of course i'm aware this was not exactly advised, BUT. The description clearly says ""Be the wizard you want to be"" among other things, and the rest probably was just my expectations, yes. We're in 2023, this is an AAA game, it's advised as open world, RPG. I REALLY thought they would at least add some RPG element, and somewhat lively NPCs.I have read some people saying I was picky, talking about the broom, but in my opinion, such details are what make a game great. I remember people complaining that you could just get out of a full speed moving car in Cyberpunk, and your char would be standing on the road as if nothing happened. This is the same level of details. You can fly full speed on your broom and hit everything on your way, you won't be falling, ever.I also read from the comment that, at some point, you can make choices, etc... I've currently finished the main story, and yes, I did have some choices to make. But what good are they if they don't mean nothing to your game experience? Like... just go throwing forbidden curses everywhere, people will still greet you the same, everywhere. You don't exist to their eyes, and they don't give a damn wwhat you do, which is also exactly why you can spend the night roaming the forbidden forest instead of being in your bed at school and no one will ever wonder what you're doing and where you've been. You've got an ultimate choice to make at the end of the story, literally a ""Are you good or evil?"" kind of choice, and whatever your answer is makes absolutely no difference... that's just empty choices.I'm currently trying out mods, and some of them might just make the game a bit better.And lastly, it seems some of you got triggered because I kept playing the game despite my review. As it clearly says, I find the story decent, and I still wish to finish it. Also at no point I said the game was bad. I think, and again, this is my opinion, that it's too expensive for what it currently is, and that it could have been a complete banger if only they would have worked on it some more to add modern RPG features before releasing it. But it does have some good points, as mentionned, combat is fun, at least for now, and the world is well detailed, which makes it even more of a pity that there isn't much to do in it aside from the same old puzzles we've known for years.If you like the game, it's cool for you, honestly. This is just some point that made me disappointed in the game, expectations or not. Go ahead and tell me why you like it, instead of acting like I've just insulted your family.Good gaming people."

The game immerses you in the world of Hogwarts and offers a unique experience unlike any other Harry Potter game or movie.The graphics are stunning and bring the iconic Hogwarts Castle, the Forbidden Forest, and Hogsmeade Village to life. The attention to detail is impressive, from the spells you cast to the creatures you encounter. The game's soundtrack is also enchanting, setting the perfect mood for your journey through the wizarding world.One of the highlights of the game is the character customization feature, which allows you to create your own wizard or witch and personalize their appearance, abilities, and spells. The game's story is well written, and it offers a captivating adventure that will keep you engaged for hours. You will be able to explore the castle and interact with familiar characters from the Harry Potter universe, such as Professor Snape and Albus Dumbledore.The game's spellcasting system is intuitive and satisfying, and it offers a sense of power and control that is unmatched by other games in the genre. The combat system is also well executed, and it provides a challenge without being overly difficult.If I had any complaint, your character feels too ""solo"" at times, I didn't feel like I made many meaningful connections.In conclusion, Harry Potter: Hogwarts Legacy is an exceptional game that will captivate both fans of the Harry Potter franchise and gamers who love action-packed adventures. It offers an immersive experience that will transport you to the wizarding world and leave you spellbound."

They fleshed out the books and the movies of Harry Potter and made every aspect of the world come alive.  spent the first 8 hours of my time in just Hogwarts marvelling and getting lost while looking for collectables and lore. A huge thank you to Avalanche for making the game we all wanted. It was crafted with love by people who love the wizardling world. And it shows. This game is in my top 5 of all time, and worth your time and money. I am 30 hours in and have so much more to experience. Keep the hate and the politics out of your games, your life will be better if you just play games to have fun. That is what they are meant for.

These are all magical words, and they’re some of the few words I’d use to describe Hogwarts Legacy, so make of that what you will, or read the rest of my thoughts on this incredible game.Hogwarts Legacy has been, to me at least, a magical journey in the full meaning of the word. It has taken me back to my childhood, where my obsession with Harry Potter was a bittersweet escape from reality. It is a hard thing to pull off to centralize this kind of fantasy, and it has been a thing millions of people always dreamed of for decades, it’s understandably hard for any game developer to satisfy the immense scope of the expectations for a game that promises more or less an adventure as a student in Hogwarts, I had always been highly skeptical of this game as a result, point of fact, when I saw the first gameplay showcases late last year, I wrote this game off. I was like “yep, this is trash”. Suffice to say that I have swallowed my words since then, and I have been proven thoroughly wrong, and now count the game as one of my most treasured experiences in video games.One word; Huge. 120+ hours later I still don’t have its layout mapped in my head, and I’m still now discovering new secret locations even after combing so many parts of the castle many times. It has so much of the iconic locations from the films and books. The great hall, the iconic courtyard in front of it, the creaky wooden bridge, the grand staircase, and much more.Throughout my engaging playthrough of the game, the school itself was, for the most part, consigned to the background, while the story of the game unfolded, or while I explored the beautiful world. At the end, Hogwarts felt exactly just that; a backdrop. Most classes, what few there are, are just a cool introductory cutscene, from then on, the teachers will give you ‘assignments’ to learn more spells. The classes are more or less presented as missions rather than a routine activity or part of the school, and as I went more and more through the game and performed some cursory retrospect of my playthrough, I quickly realized that the time I spent in the school itself was but a minority of my entire playthrough.My experience with Hogwarts Legacy’s massive open world is hard to sum up it. Every time I thought I discovered most of the map, I’m immediately surprised to know that there’s a whole new uncharted realm that I haven’t been to. Idyllic glades and creeks giving way to the most charming of villages, mountains and ridges crowned with the ruins of long-lost castles, cliffsides pockmarked by mines, tunnels and caverns astride them, dense forests concealing ancient barrows, all consecrated in a whimsical atmosphere meant that I lost track of time when I was going through this beautiful world. It’s so full of amazing things to do or discover that I never felt a moment of tedium even after spending 110 hours into the game, most of which were spent combing this huge world. There are also 3 seasons, each isn't just a dressing, it adds some cool interaction to the world, like snowmen who fight you in winter. The open world features many of the famous locations from the books & films, the Hogwarts Express, Hogsmeade, The Forbidden Forest, etc. And it’s mindboggling how much detail and care was put into presenting all of these. Every iconic location is in of itself a world. There are 27 spells in the game, including the famous unforgiveable curses, and some consumable items like mandrakes (AOE stun) or Chinese chomping cabbages (ferocious critters that attack enemies) and the Thunderbrew potion which calls a miniature thunderstorm over enemies. The spells offer a pretty wide variety of combo possibilities, you can juggle small enemies in the air, tossing them back and forth, up and down, freezing them, transforming them into crates or even explosive barrels (which you can then toss at other enemies), and outside of the spells your character also possesses a special affinity towards “ancient magic” that allows them to just OHKO enemies either by calling thunder on them, blowing them up into smithereens, transforming them into chickens, pick up objects around the world & toss them at enemies, etc.The game pushes you into its story brusquely in the first cutscene, framing the background of your character who is capable of seeing and crudely manipulating the “Ancient Magic”, so off the start, your PC already has the “I’m the chosen one” badge. This might sound unappealing, but fortunately the game doesn’t go ham with this theme and handles it really well. Beyond core narrative, there is an adventure that awaits in Hogwarts. The PC will meet many students, form close bonds with them, and some of them are really, really well written and compelling characters (especially Sebastian Sallow). These characters will oscillate between being parts of main story questlines and being secondary/side characters, if you will get this game make absolutely certain to play their questlines because the writing is really *chef’s kiss* so good and I enjoyed their quests very much.The 3 main student friends you will meet in Hogwarts are Natsai Onai (Gryffindor), Sebastian Sallow (Slytherin) and Poppy Sweeting (Hufflepuff). Unfortunately for some reason Ravenclaw doesn’t have a major story character (though I enjoyed Samantha Dale’s quest very much). Outside of major house reps, there is a lot of other students you’ll meet and do errands for throughout the school. There are several compelling villains, some the player will bring the fight to, some will bring the fight to the player, some can only be fought in side quests. You will slowly discover more and more about them, and some aspects of them seemed to have been red herrings (which the narrative has a healthy amount).The soundtrack is  and is mostly inspired by the music score from the first two HP Movies composed by John Williams, but there are some tracks that feel more reminiscent of the 5th and 6th movies. Some tracks like ""Soaring Above Hogwarts"" give me goosebumps 90% of the time I hear them. There is unfortunately a dearth of player agency, though the game presents a long list of dialogue choices, most of them are for flavor, but some will have story consequences (such as deciding a character’s fate). There are 3 different endings (but they don’t have any requirements, it’s more like you decide what your witch or wizard will do with something they find at the end). Most side quests will have multiple options at the end. One of the byproducts of the huge scope of this game is that they added a lot of sandbox stuff to the side, mainly condensed in the Room of Requirement (RoR). It’s something you’ll unlock about 1/4th into the game, the game gives you a room and free reign to customize it however you please. You can collect or purchase hundreds of items, furniture, décor to put into this room. And the amazing thing is that it also iteratively grows throughout the game, adding several Vivariums where you can keep magical beasts you collect across the world, these Vivariumae, each unique and different, are in turn customizable with a different pool of stuff.It was hard to write this. When I finished writing my first draft of this, it was really huge. I'd write way more if I could but review char limit. Yes, you should get this wonderful game."

Stylistically the game is great. The castle feels pretty alive and and it has many of the environmental elements I would expect from Hogwarts. The environments/areas outside the castle are similarly polished.Unfortunately, such appearances only go skin deep. There is very limited interactivity with your environment outside of the scripted quests or the various treasure hunt type items. You can't interact with any of the people that aren't vendors or active in a given quest, can't sit down in a chair or on a bench, no real commentary on player actions whatsoever. I have yet to feel drawn into the world as none of the characters are ever really present to engage with. I have no companions unless they are needed for a quest, there are no rivalries to be had (which is rather more noticeable as I went Slytherin) and that's well before any of the immersion breaking progressive nonsense is added in. Short of it is, I don't ever feel like a student at Hogwarts, I feel like a ""Mary Sue'd"" outsider partaking in a magical murder mystery theater.Speaking of quests, they are also ""meh"" for the most part. The main quest line is rather engaging and keeps you moving forward to find out what happens next, but the side quests are quite boring and often just boil down to your standard ""go fetch"" type quests. I have not found any side quest of substance as of yet.Combat is one of the saving graces so far. Generally quite intuitive and enjoyable. Presents a decent challenge while also making you feel like a spell slinging bad-ass on occasion.Oh, and the loot.  Seriously the loot system and types of loot is ridiculous.  The mechanics aren't horrible, but the immersion break is.  My eyes ache from the rolling whenever, after traversing an ""ancient"" dungeon/crypt/cave, bypassing puzzles, slaying enemies, etc. I then spy an impressive looking chest, only to open said chest and be awarded with... a new scarf/house robe/glasses. -.-  Still have a ways to go in the game, so I'm gonna keep an open mind till I complete the game, but so far... Meh."

After almost 80 hours into the game, I've had a generally good experience. It's been fun so far, however, there are a few things that have left me disappointed. I was seriously upset over the broom system. I mean, all the brooms are the same, except for upgrades. You should have gotten a Nimbus 2000 and flown out of the Hogwarts courtyard, and THEN when you got the Firebolt, you should have been able to hit the afterburner and gone from map edge to map edge within a few seconds. But nope, that fell flat. And another gripe is the Merlin tests. After you solve each test, couldn't they have made a way to disable the Merlin animation?? I'm getting flashbacks of skinning animals from my Red Dead Redemption 2 days. That seriously gets old. And the cave layouts could have been better designed. Instead...you run a few feet, turn left (or right) then another turn and you're at a chest. Open said chest and back outside, then it's over. Yeah, some have a few puzzles, but the majority are the same ol' same. Also, where is the spell upgrade for Revelio? I wanted an option to have this spell be extended for at least a min. Instead, you're spamming that spell like there is no tomorrow. And I don't think I've used any of the potions (except Thunderbrew) since I had to brew a Focus potion and drink it for one of the class requirements. It would have been nice to have these extended too. Maybe doing more potion classes and learning to squeeze a bezoar with a side of a knife instead of slicing it...and then learning to extend the potion's effects for longer than 15 seconds?? Seems like you'd be spamming those things too in the middle of a long fight. That's one of the reasons I don't use them. After you get out into the big wide world, the grind becomes real, it seems. And another gripe...why didn't they have a 5th spell set for using it in the Vivarium as well. I mean, putting the bag, the feed, the brush, etc...on the vivarium spell set would have been nice. instead, you're having to move everything around to brush your beasts for that all-important hair/feather. I feel they could have tweaked the game more. And another thing, I just don't see the draw for skins/outfits unless they actually served a purpose. I played a sniping game where I got a ghillie suit. I thought to myself, ""Nice, I can be more invisible."" But it didn't do anything to help you in the game at all. The enemy could see you just as well with it on, as off. So with all the different hats/glasses/gloves in this game, I usually change the appearance back to a generic hat and don't use any of the different styles in the game. Skins just don't appeal to me. But after all this griping, don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the game, but the latter half is just monotonous."

Game has massive fps drops, memory leaks and occasional crashes on a more than decent rig, even after day 1 'performance' hotfix. Things that helped me greatly:1. Installing Ascendio mod from Nexusmods.2. Swapping DLSS version to latest with DLSS Swapper (free app btw).3. Turning off ray tracing and VSync in game settings.The story and puzzles are mediocre. Game is rather linear. Where it thrives for me personally is combat, it features some souls-like elements, spell combos, potion and plant usage. But I barely died in fights even on hard difficulty. Don't go for anything lower than hard unless you're a casual.Overall, for me as a HP fan, it's 10/10. You can traverse Hogwarts, discover secret rooms, talk to ghosts, use a variety of spells, learn unforgivable curses, get some relics, visit legendary Ollivander shop and much, MUCH more. All the things I dreamed of since I read my first HP book. For me as a gamer, disregarding my HP affection, the game is 6.5/10.I did greatly enjoy the game but do not wish to support devs releasing AAA games in the current state as well as releasing console exclusive content (you can open your own shop in Hogsmeade is you're a lucky owner of PS5, but for us poor PC plebs performance issues is the only exclusive for now), hereby leaving a negative review."

In Hogwarts Legacy you get to be a student in Hogwarts who holds the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart. You get to embark on an epic journey through familiar and new locations as you explore and discover magical beasts, customize your character and craft potions, master spell casting, upgrade talents and become the witch or wizard you want to be.Hogwarts Legacy is a potterhead's wet dream manifested into a wonderful experience of a game which offers a detailed and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and it's neighboring regions, which are packed to the brim with things to discover, things to collect and lore to seek and read.Some negative about the world building and everything in it, it's a collector's dream. That's not for everyone for sure, there is a lot of repetition and the map is quite big with not as much variety as there should be. I enjoyed the collecting myself, as I really like collecting things, but it's definitely something that you need to be aware of.There is a great amount of customizing when creating your own witch or wizard, with good range of skin colors and cosmetics and even a way to change the pitch of the voice options. Changing the pitch does make the voice sound a little bit robotic in my opinion, but it isn't too bad, and is a nice addition. You also have your own ""homebase"" that you can decorate and customize with a lot of options. The combat is nice and smooth, but can be easily exploitable, especially after you receive the unforgivable curses. There is a way to heal spam and the AI of the enemies is not that smart which makes the combat sometimes really, really easy. Sadly the named foes and quest bosses lack in uniqueness with no real variety in their combat abilities or behavior either. The story progression feels surprisingly smooth and portrays the growth of the main character very well where you get to hone your talents and improve. The progress of time is very well portrayed with the changing seasons and the day and night cycle. The main story itself is quite interesting, but has an underwhelming finale that leaves you wondering how your choices affected the other characters around you.There is also some inconsistencies that are minor annoyances, like if you use an unforgivable curse in public, no one bats an eye. Your friends do mention that they do not like you using them if you are fighting with them, but otherwise there is no real repercussions for them, which makes them less unforgivable.There is a great variety of side characters in the game that are very well built and are quite likable and unique from each other. The writing of the friendship quests is interesting and shows the growth of the main character's friends as well as how it affects the main character themselves.For me, the game took some over 90 hours to complete to 100% on normal difficulty, with all collections filled and challenges completed, as well as the few extra achievements that are given when you reach the map chamber with a character from each of the houses. I also spent a lot of extra time wandering around and taking screenshots, which boosted my hours a little bit. There is really no replay value to the game, since there is no different endings or choices to make. All of the collectibles can be acquired on one playthrough and the other 3 playthroughs only take about 2 hours each to reach to the map chamber.Is this game worth it then? Yes, absolutely. It's a fantastic game, filled with content and is definitely the best game made of the franchise up to date, in my opinion. There is certain political issues regarding the game, but you can enjoy the game and still not support those ideals.as an ending note, I wan't to add that be you a man, a woman or anything in-between or outside of, you are loved. You are appreciated by me and many others and I hope that you get to live your life the way you want to live it."

Even though a lot of the elements are filler and copy/paste content, we can probably give a pass to Avalanche Software and Portkey Games since this will probably be their base development product from now on.Let's start breaking down the positives and the negatives:• Hogwarts is spectacularly designed like it's supposed to. A lot of the people know that it's an immense and maze like school and they captured this feeling pretty well. There are a lot going on with little details here and there and representation feels like you've never seen Hogwarts like this before. Very well done and one of the key selling points of the game.• The world and particularly Hogsmeade and the Hamlets are amazingly designed that they make you wish like you were living there. From the lighting to the design of the houses are done so well that they capture the coziness of the world easily.• Combat is engaging in a way that you never expect. I was pretty afraid of the combat, combos and interactivity between the spells but in my opinion, using the wand and engaging in combat is pretty well done that they made me go into combat willingly. There are enough spells that you will need more skill slots like in MMOs, which would be spectacular since you feel the lack of slots sometimes. They embellish spells with Talent Point upgrades which you can further develop and increase their effects.• Fashion is something that you may spend pretty significant time because they nailed the looks as well. You have different outfits, robes, gloves, hats and face masks/eyeglasses to choose from. They're pretty expansive in options, so you won't run out of any combinations. It's good for people who want to RP and apply transmogrification to their appearance. Also, there are slots (enchants) and upgrades of the items which you can execute through Room of Requirements and the items you collect from your Beasts, tougb you can buy the materials through vendors as well.• Main side quests are wonderful. There are people who you friend with and their life kind of becomes additional side content in the game and I should say that they are even better than the main plot. Wish there were more, but still a good effort and I hope we can see the most of the game in this format if they ever develop sequels.• The Game will not run out of content for a while. I personally don't like this since they used the same stuff over and over but with the help of Room of Requirements where you can design your own rooms/Vivariums, capture Beasts and nurture them in those Vivariums which pretty much turns the game into Animal Crossing, so casual audience will definitely cherish. Other than these, the content in the world is pretty much the same with camps, Treasure Vaults, Crypts etc. which are basically copy/paste of each other.• They give the lore of Wizarding World through Revelio pages and I kind of liked it as it was refreshing for me since I was pretty much 9 years old when I first read the book and now mid-30s, so you can imagine the loss of knowledge. Seeing the items/content and then reading about them was pretty good, at least for me.• There are 603 collectibles for people who like to chase, so this is both a positive and negative aspect since they're too much and taking unnecessary time through copy/paste content. Still a positive though since you at least spend your time in the beautiful world.• Flying feels very good with a myriad of different options like brooms and beasts. I would say that they should have developed the beasts to be faster and made the animation shorter, so they become useable again because when you compare them to brooms, they feel slow.• Music is otherworldly. They captured the tunes of the main Harry Potter saga and developed from it. Sometimes the violins kick or a full orchestra takes over… it was a pleasure to listen, and I already played the whole album couple of times through Spotify and YouTube.• Graphics look good, particularly the lighting when the time is right looks wonderful. VA is manageable, some is very good and some is mediocre.• Main quest line and the antagonists didn't capture me. They were shallow, in-game cinematics (not CGIs) were kind of weird in a way that they either lacked the sound volume in necessary places or was underwhelming. Instead of the main 2, they could have gone in a different way and focus Isidora. Felt kind of empty.• Side quests are there just for the sake of being there. Some of them were still good I would say, but generally they're forgettable.• Side content is mostly copy/paste. There are 95 Merlin Trials which are nearly exact, lots of enemy camps which plays the same, Treasure Vaults that contains Common items etc. It plays like an Ubisoft game in that regard and generally wastes your time. • Itemization and the loot is horrible. You go deep in a Treasure Vault or solve a riddle to get to some chest and all they contain is some weird glove which you found in Level 5 or 56 gold. Endgame content doesn't exist at all, and after some point you realize that chasing the chests are pointless.• Vendors have no effect, they're just there for you to sell your trash items, which they can fill your inventory slots in the blink of an eye.• Performance on my end with a hardware like i9-13900K, RTX 4090, 32GB 7400MHz DDR5 RAM and PCI-e 4.0 SSD was abominable. I turned on DLSS 3 so that I can get more frames but the main problem is the stuttering. FPS wise I had no problem but when your games stutter like there's no tomorrow either in Hogwarts or Hogsmead, which are the places you spend the most time, it becomes unbearable. They never solved it.I generally liked what I experienced. There could have been so many different ways they could take like Respawn's Jedi series and make it a linear Single Player experience since the audience is casual enough to accept it, but they chose the open world formula, which I think didn't work well because they lack content even though the map is full. If you are a Harry Potter fan though, there's no game or content apart from the movies that will make you feel the Wizarding World which I think people were craving for a very very long time.I do hope that they will learn from this and use the game as a base for their sequels because they passed the hard part and now can come up with extra flavors that will turn the game into another Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2."

It has done absolutely nothing in the performance departmentLet me start by saying that when this game works it is fantastic and there are tons of people the game runs well for that are around my specs or even lower with 10-series GPUs. I am not trying to ruin that for anyone and I entirely understand why people love this game and are going to upvote in reviews or even get mad down in the replies. However this is not the case for everyone and plenty of others with high end systems are having problems and the game is truly impossible to experience with such horrendous stability issues. Performance problems are being spammed on their official bug tracker website, under their most popular replies on all recent twitter posts, and discussions from the community on Steam/Reddit. So downplaying it cus you want a hive-mind to circlejerk your favorite game is foolish. Ignorant comments from actual robots such as ""mUH gAmeE wORk sO uR cOmPUteR bAD"" are everywhere and completely useless to the discussion or finding out the issue/fix, these comments will be ignored and probably deleted.It is absolutely unacceptable to sell an early launch of a game as a product, make people pay more than base price, then have a large chunk of players with a massive range of specs and settings realize after the 1-2 hour tutorial when you finally get to roam around that the game is absolutely broken, unplayable, and unoptimized. If you have to wait for a patch or game ready driver then why even sell the early release of the game at all?My specs more than clear any requirement for this game as well as any others on the market, yet during cut scenes and exploring the school it is absolutely unplayable, locking my fps to 10-15 as well as slowing down my entire PC including wallpapers on my second monitor until I close the game out entirely.FULL SPECS:3080tiRyzen 9 5900x32GB of DDR4-3200 RamSSD (I have even moved the game to another SSD and I still get poor results)3440x1440 (Have tried lowering resolution as well)No, turning settings down does nothing before you comment. Turning off RT seemed to give me some extra performance temporarily however I still hit the wall of 10-15 FPS every playsession.I have also tried:Disable SMTEnable Control Flow GuardUpdating/rolling back drivers(Got the newest one from 2/8 as well)Changing to a new SSDDisabling second monitorUpdating DLSS manuallyMy review is going up negative and will stay that way until the end of time regardless of patches. It is horrible business practice to sell people a product that does not function for a large percentage of the user base. They even went the extra mile to charge people more for an early release, when the product you purchased refuses to work. You shouldnt have to buy something then do two dozen work-arounds that never even do anything as you try to do the devs job for them.Rant over."

It doesn't excel at anything it attempts, the story is mediocre with no emotional moments or pay-offs, the characters are uninteresting and as black and white as they can be, the story is very predictable. You have your typical villain and his lackeys, who are bad and yourself and your friends , who are jolly good. There is no depth to anyone. Your choices don't matter in the slightest, the only difference is you're either incredibly well mannered and compassionate, or slightly sassy. The open world is nice and shiny, but in a true Ubisoft fashion it is filled with countless repetitive, uninteresting tasks, which you have to do a hundred times over. Every 'treasure vault' is just a chest with a generic item. You sell 99 % of your items anyway, the tiers of equipment are useless, the mechanic of hidden attributes, which you have to uncover in the Room of requirement, is redundant. The lockpicking system is atrocious. The amount of craftable items is small and the game is easy enough to not really have a need of them anyway. Little events in the world such as a suit of armor destroying another one for humming happened every single time I went through the area. Because of that you can't appreciate it as a little secret/detail if you see it for the twentieth time. Facial animations are pretty bad. The puzzles are not diverse enough. Combat can be fun at times, but the variety of enemies is so small and they only have 1-3 attacks per enemy type. The order in which you do things doesn't influence any dialogue options, finding a fetch quest related item before accepting the quest isn't met with an alternative voice line 'Oh, I already found it', instead you have to go to the same place and pick the item up again to hand it over. The lack of thought that such situations could happen is what differentiates a great game from a bad one, it's all about the little details and they just couldn't pull it off here. Using unforgivable curses results in no consequences for you. Hogwarts legacy was all hype, it benefited greatly from nostalgia, but failed to deliver anything but a mediocre and forgettable experience, which offers zero incentive for a second playthrough."

From the very beginning of the game, I was immediately drawn in by the atmosphere, cutscene quality (especially the characters) and the background music. It gave me the feeling that this is gonna be a good game just from the first 10 minutes of play. After 15ish hours of the game (have not finished it yet nor do I think I'm anywhere near finishing it), I can safely say this is my GOTY pick for the moment. It's funny to think about, since before the game released, I was heavily skeptical of how the combat and the dialogue looked, but it turns out I was worried for nothing after all.There is one major complaint, however. The optimization is not great. For reference, I'm running a 3080 with 32 GB DDR4 RAM and a 7700k. The only outdated part in the list is the 7700k. Before the day one patch, my performance was a very unstable 20-80 fps at Medium-High settings. I've only done minimal testing after the day one patch, but my first experience was my game crashing alongside my GPU due to a VRAM overflow. Before the crash, I noticed that my performance was significantly better, so it was really upsetting when I ended up crashing after a decent first impression. After that I switched everything to Medium, which lead me to slightly better performance without the crash this time. I still have to do more testing to come to a definitive conclusion, but overall I do not think it's well-optimized, especially with how much VRAM it hogs for no real reason."

You can run through the entire story, by itself without other content the game offers, probably in a bout 10-15 hours depending on how good you are in combat and how fast you can access the fast travel system. That being said, I have almost 100% the game (achievement wise) within' the 60 hours I have played it. The combat is simple yet complex in it's hidden combos it hints at within' the dueling fates system. E.x. being, ""Slice a frozen enemy."" Besides helping you perform devastating combos with different spells though, there is no real use to the system besides getting a completion bonus for completing a certain amount of them. I don't believe this game has much replay-ability, which is fine for me, but if you were curious about a NG + mode, there is not one. The story is great, but I wouldn't play through it more than once. Side quests are fun yet simple and can be summed up like this- Find person in trouble, Ask what's going on, Be told someone else can do it and not to risk your life, Go however many meters to objective, Obliterate the enemy or collect the item they need, Come back and announce you pwned the quest, They act shocked, Then you can extort them for more of a reward or just say lol you're welcome. They do have some lore attached but it's only to the side quest that you're doing. Not much trivia after the fact if you catch my drift. One thing I love is the interactions with the NPC's after doing certain actions. They start speaking of your accomplishments as you continue to do things around the world. Same goes with enemies. An example being releasing a certain enemy type from spider webs, and then they start talking about it in battles with that enemy type for the rest of the game. Very cool the first couple times.... then they just repeat themselves and never stop mentioning it lol. A special feature that became old a bit to fast unfortunately. The open world is also filled with various puzzles and activities to do. After a while though, it almost feels like a chore and loses meaning once you obtain the challenge log's reward for doing a certain amount of whatever lies on the map for you to do. Speaking of the challenge log, that is where a lot of the fun lied for me. It's almost like a scavenger hunt that tells you exactly what to do at the start of it. There are five different categories, each being named after different aspects of the game. Exploration, Combat, Field Guides, ETC. Each has a said amount of tiers that award you with different things. Some being inventory space, others being cosmetics for your equipment (which you can change at ANY time ANY where in the game.) After you complete them, there aren't many achievements left to the open world besides doing every single one of the Merlin Trials littered throughout the region though. So for me, once I completed it, I sort of lost my momentum playing the game. There's plenty else in this game that you can explore and discover, and if you're curious but not sure to get it or not? Wait for a sale, always a safe bet. The game is worth every penny spent. Although I don't think I'd buy the DLC or deluxe edition. Not really needed in an RPG in my opinion."

Like many of you, I grew up with the stories, read the books, watched the movies, went to Hogwarts and never really left. I've read all the fanfics (in a general sense, not ALL fanfics of course) and every time I read about Hogwarts it's like coming home.  This game fails at almost everything it should do as an RPG. There is absolutely no depth to this game, the characters, or the story. The open world is completely pointless. Now that I've played it and experienced it, would I buy it again?Yes, but not at full price. Wait for a sale. That's why this review is marked ""not recommended"".Because, after all, it's still a lot of fun running around Hogwarts or Hogsmead; or just fighting enemies with magic. There's no denying that. Is it a game that I will remember? One of those you never quite leave behind? A little bit, but only because it's Harry Potter and I keep imagining what it could have been. Do you leave that aside? No, then it's not.All in all, the biggest feelings I have about this game are the following: Disappointment at what it is and sadness/longing at what it could have been. It's all right? Not the best I've experienced but definitely not bad either. It was original, I'll give the developers that. Don't think about the logic behind some of the things that happen and it's all good. It was entertaining.Really annoying for me were the interruptions in the narrations of the individual questlines.""Hey, something super important and really exciting is happening right now. We need to act right now!""""All right, great. What happens now, what do we do, who do I have to kill?""""I'll make a plan and then send you an owl. Until then this suuuper important and exciting thing will just have to wait. Bye.""""..."" Yeah, no. It's an RPG without the RP. Your choices have almost no impact. Learning the unforgivables? You're a hero! Blackmail everyone and be a total arsehole? You're a hero!!! The only decision that matters comes at the very end and decides which of the three endings you get. You start at Hogwarts as a fifth year. Everyone else has already been together for 4 years, making friends, creating their groups, and getting caught up in house rivalries. You  be the new awkward guy who doesn't know anyone and has only one job: To get off your butt and try to catch up with your classmates and maybe make some friends in the process.Instead, you're instantly good at EVERYTHING. Flying like a pro? No problem. Killing dozens of enemies left and right? Sure. Unforgivable curses? Yep. Brew potions, grow plants, and rescue and care for animals without fail? Absolutely! You're a Mary Sue character. The chosen one of the chosen ones.To sum it up: You make absolutely no sense and are definitely not human. Sebastian: ""Hey, you're new? Be my best friend. Here's my life story.""Natty: ""Hey, you're new? Be my best friend. Here's my life story.""Poppy: At least reasonably well written. The only character I somewhat cared about. You're a Slytherin? Natty  doesn't care. Still, instant best friends.You're a Gryffindor? Sebastian  doesn't care either. Again, Sebastian and Natty don't act or behave like people. They have no depth, no initial character arc, no real history. Poppy is not completely exempt from this either. Why does this game have an open world? Can someone please explain this to me, because I really don't get it. The world adds absolutely nothing to this game. It is full of pointless tasks without end. Take the Merlin trials for example. There are 95 of them. 95! And they are completely pointless. These trials are not hard, not engaging, not fun. They're just time-wasters with an unskippable ending-animation.Aside from that, the open world feels dead. Sure, there are smaller ""villages"" and enemy camps and such, but they don't really add anything to the game. At least for me, they don't. This is one of those of open world games that shouldn't have an open world. Strangely devoid of life. That's one way to describe Hogwarts. There are no students other than fifth graders, except for a few underclassmen as quest givers. Where are all the other students? I don't know, just disappeared, I guess.The NPCs that are around are dummies. They stand around doing the exact same thing over and over again. How many times are you going to run up the wall? All day, every day! The brawling armors have more character than these students. To be fair, there are quiet a few funny encounters between those students.And where the hell do these guys sleep? Not in their beds, that's for sure!And then there are the classes. Or what should be classes. Instead, it feels like kindergarten or something, but definitely not like classes at supreme school for magic.And rules don't matter to you. Magic in the corridors? Yes, please. Wearing a school uniform at Hogwarts. Boring!Pain. Pure and utter pain.You may be a wizard, but I guess you've never heard of backpacks with space expansion charms. Your inventory is almost always full. You'll either have to return to a merchant every half hour or start destroying stuff. I can't remember a worse game in this regard. And don't even get me started on the gear itself. I found legendary gloves at level 16 and didn't have to swap them out until level 36. ‘Nuff said. Just don't try to think anything through logically here. I mean, sure, it's magic and all. But still: ""Hey, you. My husband, a fully trained wizard with a lot of life experience, was killed by a troll. He had a locket on him. Could you, a completely untrained fifth year Hogwarts student, please go and kill the troll to get the locket back?""""Yeah sure, no problem."" ""So, character,  you really need to get off your arse and catch up to your classmates.""""Yes, Professor Weasley. Oh, open world. Bye Hogwarts.""  One: Alohomora. Why is there a freaking minigame for Alohomora. I don't remember Hermione getting out her gamepad and wiggling the sticks around to open doors. And the minigame isn't even hard, in any way! It's simple: you turn the sticks until the gamepad vibrates, hold that position for a while, see a non-skippable animation/scene change, and the door is open. Every single time. And there are a whole lot of locked doors. There are even locked doors behind locked doors. I've already mentioned the Merlin trials. The menus and transition sequences into the menu and between menus are really not the fastest either."

The game is boggled with meaningless side quests, and the story is lackluster. With the Harry Potter IP, so much more could have been done. I am just disappointed.I do not understand who made the choice to remove any actual sort of customization to a game like this. You select character preset, and change their hair, eye color, etc. That's it. No ear shape, nose shape, jaw, nothing. Seeing as most other games offer that at the bare minimum, it's hard to see why they removed it. They lock it into a sense of realism, which is weird for a fantasy game. If I want green skin, I should be able to have green skin. The main draw of the game, Hogwarts, is both a blessing and a curse. The animations of the stairs building, ghosts popping in and out, and the joyful music playing are probably the best parts of the game. That's all there is to it however, It just looks good. You cannot interact with any of the students. It's like an amusement park attraction. The only option is to walk around, observe, and eat an apple. The only other game I played set in an environment like this was Bully, and that game offered way more freedom than the developers here have allowed. It's hard to immerse yourself when you're pretty much watching a movie about your character, rather than actually playing as them.The story is nothing special. It's not bad, but I was not excited to keep playing it. Can't say much else without spoiling.I know I should not say the Witcher 3 side quests are the cream of the crop, as that is just overstated at this point, but it is what it is. I can't help to compare them to the cookie cutter ones we got here. Go collect 6 gobstoppers for this kid. Go find this obscure cliff from the mirror to find a chest with ugly glasses in it. Ubisoft-type missions and heavily prevalent. Side missions have no multiple endings, and they always end up predictable.In Hogwarts, you will get into plenty of scraps. a good ol' bout with some real scum. You will have to use your spells to blast your foes, so hopefully there's lots of them, right? Well, there's only  spells. Yes, you hears that right, only . That's without even mentioning that you can only equip 4 spells at a time. They took the Mass Effect Andromeda route of limiting your combat for the sake of, i don't even know. With only 4 at a time, I felt extremely limited in what I could do. The animations themselves are great, but when looking at a game like Elden Ring, who has  spells, and the game isn't only a wizard game, you realize that much more could have been done. Skyrim even has  spells. And just like Elden Ring, that game has much more than just magic. Also, after comparing the difficulties between hard and normal, it is only a health bar difference. Enemies will damage you more, and you do less damage. Underwhelming if you ask me, when you could have had them use more strategy in taking you down.I know people won't like this, but Forspoken magic looks a lot better than this game. No one has actually played it, so no one has actually seen how good it looks.This is by far the worst part of this game. Everything is locked behind a level based lock. most of Hogwarts Legacy is hidden behind locks that you must progress the story to unlock. You cannot explore at your own pace. I say it again, the developers choose when you get to have fun. It is a shame, as the world is beautiful. Riding the broomstick is amazing, I spent a lot of time just riding around. Mounts are great as well, love the threstral mount that I got from the deluxe edition.This one is a little nitpicky, but the doors feel weightless. Your character just pushes them open extremely fast, its honestly very jarring. The huge doors in the fountain area open effortlessly, which is extremely weird to me.This is the one thing that has left me completely confused. You only get XP by collecting lore scrolls around the map. WHY? No XP from defeating monsters, no growing stronger from your battles, you have to click left on the D-Pad, listen for a bell noise, and find a scroll to level up. I hate it. Don't forget the flying scrolls that you just grab out the air effortlessly. Hogwarts Legacy brings nothing new to the table. The graphics are the best part of the game, everything else is a either a weird gameplay decision, or a mechanic jacked from another game, yet done far worse. I would say this game is good of you love Harry Potter, and do not really play video games. Otherwise, this game is way overpriced for what it offers, and you may get bored easily once the initial honeymoon phase wears off around a few hours."

Almost every activity in this game ranges from okay to pretty good for the first couple of hours after which it becomes unbearable, boring and tedious and that coupled with the fact that there are hundreds of those activities, that really takes a toll on you. The side activities are boring, the combat is kind of unique but extremely repetitive (as it really doesn't matter what enemy you are fighting), the puzzles are mostly childish (some of them are okay though), the open world is needlessly huge and feels incredibly dead, the story and characters are cringeworthy (thank god you can skip the dialogues) and the RPG mechanics are tacked on and completely underdeveloped which is why the get in the way of having fun rather than reinforcing it. It is not all bad though, Hogwarts itself looks amazing and genuine and it really feels like the poured their hearts into designing it, Hogsmeade is also decent and the season changes were a nice touch. The room of requirement and the whole vivarium gameplay was also a cool edition but that kind of customization is not interesting for me personally, especially when it doesn't feel rewarding at all as the combat (even on Hard difficulty) is pretty easy. The unforgivable curses are properly overpowered and fun to use but as the choices in this game don't matter at all those curses are treated as everything else in the game and that was disappointing. The looting is also stupid as it is completely random which more often than not robs you of feeling any sense of reward after exploring something hidden and hard to find. At the end of the day, this game wore me out completely even before the halfway mark and I had to force myself to get to the end of it which I really shouldn't have done.  So I personally recommend this game to only the Harry Potter series' fans who only wanted to have a huge, Triple A, open world HP game where they could just fly around, explore Hogwarts and perform some iconic spells, for the rest of us who are looking for a unique, fun open world experience this is NOT it my friends, if not for the amazing Hogwarts design I'd say that this is a proper UBISOFT-style open world title as all the same tired, tedious and boring tropes and design choices are in full throttle here."

Graphicly, it's just about what you'd expect from a AAA game in 2023. Even if you're not playing on the absolute highest settings on some next-gen system, the game still looks gorgeous for the most part. On top of that, the game takes place over the course of a whole year, which will take you through different seasons that change the look and feel of the world and it's really just a pleasure exploring the same places, but from a different perspective. Storywise, the main plot is pretty simple, stop the bad guy from becoming the most powerful wizard. That being said, it's still pretty satisfying and it takes you on quite a journey to achieve your goal. Besides the main plot, there are a few side plots that do a great job of keeping you engaged in them. In my opinion, these side quests are the real highlights of the whole story. Gameplay and exploration is where this game shines the most. The combat, contrary to how I expected it to be before the game came out, is really satisfying and engaging, with plenty of spell combos and multiple ways to approach it, whether you want to go head first or take it slow and stealthy, you can do so. Enemy variety is as it should be, it doesn't need any more or fewer enemy types. Exploration feels rewarding and there is A LOT to explore, collect and interact with. Where there are puzzles, they are simple enough as to not get too confusing, but also not so easy as to become boring. There are a lot of different mini-games world events scattered all over the map, which is quite large. From doing Merlin Trials, which are themselves very diverse and have a good amount of diversity to not get too repetitive,  to constellation spotting at night, broom flight challenges, rescuing beasts and caring for them, treasure hunting through all kinds of places or just freely flying around casting Revelo every 5 seconds, they are, in most cases, fun to do. Unfortunately, it does lack one very important and crucial activity, a fishing mini-game, but I guess nothing is perfect. The Worldbuilding and NPCs are pretty complex, with plenty of small towns to explore, and charming side characters, each with their own little story and dialogue, and lots of houses for you to rob from facing no consequences whatsoever. Every shopkeeper has their own life story that are eager to tell you about. Overall, while Hogwarts Legacy might not be the absolute best RPG out there, it is a really solid one. And for what little it lacks in some aspects, it makes up for tenfold in enjoyment and pure fun. There are very few issues with the game, and I can't really recall any major bugs. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter universe, this game will certainly meet all of your expectations and will satisfy your Hogwarts student dream. And even if you aren't a fan of the universe, I'm pretty positive you'll find a lot of enjoyment and entertainment from this game. If you are just a big fan or RPGs and you don't know what to play anymore, this will be a very good pick. And for any completionist, the achievements are simple, mostly straightforward, and will have no problem 100% it."

I had a lot of fun playing this game, I liked it, although it has its problems.I pre-ordered the game hoping it wouldn't be terrible. And I did not regret it, I waited and passed it in 49 hours.The game has pretty nice graphics. I played on ultra settings without RTX. Particularly pleased with the castle, which was very well created by the development team. A stunning castle, with many details and secrets.The open world also pleases with its beauty. In addition, it is quite large and even filled. The village of Hogsmeade is also done very well, the developers deserve respect.The game Hogwarts Legacy takes place at the end of the 19th century and tells about the students of Hogwarts. Your character is a student holding the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the magical world apart. You are belatedly accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and soon discover that you are no ordinary student: you have the rare ability to sense and manipulate ancient magic. Only you can decide whether you will protect this secret for the good of all or succumb to the temptation of more sinister magic.Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world, single-player action role-playing game with multiple difficulty and accessibility options. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry will offer classes such as spells, defense against the dark arts, herbology and potions.When creating a playable character, the player can choose their appearance, faculty, and gender. Players can customize their character's voice, body type, and wand type. Leveling up gives the player access to talents, upgrades, and skills. The game also features environment customization elements where players will be able to customize the Room of Rescue as they level up in the game.The player's character will learn to cast various magic spells, brew potions and master combat abilities. As you progress, players will be able to develop their own special fighting style. In combat, items purchased or crafted can be used to harm enemies or create obstacles or enhance the player's character. There will be taming, grooming and riding magical beasts. Dragons, trolls, hippogriffs, and nifflers are shown as creatures that can be interacted with in the gameplay video. Some creatures can be used in combat, such as the mandrake to stun enemies.The gameplay is quite interesting and multi-level, although it does not seem so at first glance. To understand the whole essence and feel it - you just need to try it yourself.The game has a lot of different collectibles that you can collect, although this is not mandatory. At the same time, some gathering helps to open new abilities, expand your inventory, or give you some things. I wasn't able to collect all the collectibles because there are so many of them (about 760), but at the same time I completed all the challenges.Many players will not like this game, many will not even try it, but those who still pass it will get an interesting and new experience, because there are very few games in this genre. If you watched the Harry Potter movies or you just have an interesting Hogwarts, I advise you to go through this game and not listen to anyone."

I've read all the books countless times and seen the movies more times than anyone. This truly makes you feel like a wizard and has that whimsical dark feel to it. I love how you can choose to be good or evil with no consequence. Haven't had this kind of system since Fable 2. The way I play I'm pretty much a school shooter with magic. Psycho Mode. Love the tonal shift from School which reminds me of Bully to everything outside the safe zones which become ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ killing floors. I also love how sadistic you can be towards everyone. For once we have a game that truly doesn't feel like anything else. Entirely unique as things should be. One of the best RPGs since Skyrim. I actually feel like doing everything there is to offer.

Unless of course, the game has major issues that need to be adressed immediately. Thankfully Hogwarts Legacy is not one of those games, we don't have to beta test this game and wait 6 months to a year for the developers to actually finish it. Look at what happens when a publisher actually gives a development studio time to finish a game, instead of forcing it out the door early. This game just shows the importance of getting a game right the first time.Hogwarts Legacy has become one of the best games I have ever played, and one of my favourite games of all time. Incase you don't realise how big of a statement that is for me, I have been playing video games since I was 4 years old, and since then I have played thousands upon thousands of games. Honestly, I'm not a big Wizarding World fan, but I did watch the Harry Potter trilogy for the first time in 2021, and loved them. This game has given me a reason to explore this universe in more depth, and is pulling me in to become a fan of the Wizarding World. Rarely do I ever stop in games to read descriptions about characters, locations, objects and the such, but in this game I found myself stopping to do that quite often. I would spend a few minutes reading about a historic figure in Hogwarts, or about one of the many rooms in the castle, and I learnt so much more about this universe by doing so.The combat is incredibly fun and satisfying, to be as effective as possible you will need to pull off combos to deal the most amount of damage in a short period of time. You can evade enemy attacks by either rolling or blocking incoming spells/melee attacks, pressing the deflect button quickly will deflect an incoming enemy spell in a random direction, but if you hold the deflect button while an enemy is casting, you can deflect their spell right back at them and stun them. With larger enemies, you will need to dodge to succesfully avoid damage. Sometimes enemy wizards/witches will have shields to protect them, these shields are colour coded in connection with your own spells, for exaple if an enemies shield is purple this means you will have to cast a purple spell to break their shield, this is an excellent way of making button mashing/click spamming useless, since no player will be able to push random buttons and win every enemy encounter. Overall combat is fantastic, and also visually stunning.The music is beautiful, and perfectly compliments what is happening on the screen. A peacful and relaxing tone of music for exploration which sets your mind at ease, to intense and lively music during combat. Games like these just show you how important good music in games is, how they can elevate the moment and give you a better experience because of it. Not much else to say about the music other than it being excellent.When you get to explore Hogwarts for the first time, it really makes you appreciate this amazing universe that J.K. Rowling has created. Hogwarts itself is extremely beautiful, every area within the castle is visually stunning and unique. If you are someone that has always dreamed of exploring this universe, you will not be disappointed. You can also explore the area surrounding Hogwarts, if that wasn't enough there is also seasonal weather which completely changes the aesthetic of the map visually, and even certain aspects of the castle.Another thing I love about this game is how it rewards the player for exploration, the game encourages you to explore because doing so will grant you superior gear, wand attachments, potions, money and all kinds of collectables. The world feels immersive, NPC's will partake in certain activities depending on where you are, students will be browsing and reading books in the library, having lunch and talking to one another at a table, teachers will be going through school work in their classroom among many other things. This creates a more immersive experience for the player, further investing them into this world.There are no microtransactions in Hogwarts Legacy, this needs to be emphasised and commended. These days it is such a rare sight to see games that don't include microtransactions. Microtransactions ruin every game that they are a part of, I will always have respect for developers/publishers that refuse to put microtransactions into their game.Overall I think Hogwarts Legacy is a fantastic game, even if you aren't a fan of this world there is still a lot of enjoyment to be found within it. My hope is that the developers can continue to support and update this game adding more content to it. Imagine if they add a multiplayer mode where you can play Quidditch with, and against other players, if they ever do I will be there. Cooperative dungeons would also be pretty awesome. I'm very excited to see what is in store for Hogwarts Legacy in the future."

Hogwarts and the world look great and also have a lot of details built in. The change of seasons is also very pleasant to look at. Graphically also a feast for the eyes (if you have a good PC! RayTracing ...) BUT: In terms of gameplay, the game is just pure average. There's nothing special about the game, other than batting your wand around. My criteria: - Open World: It is simply boring. There are a lot of nice details in Hogwarts, but as soon as you're in the forest or somewhere on the map, you don't encounter anything except the occasional deer or enemy. The tasks are so incredibly long. Doing the same thing 100 times... super exciting. - Combat system: Great at first glance, but after a while you don't really need to do anything except spam buttons. Your character even targets the enemies himself! Even on harder difficulty levels, it's no challenge to just press B or A and you're done. Wish they would have thought of something a bit more difficult. But I can also understand that the game is made accessible to ALL types of gamers. Your opponents level up with you! Accordingly, you never get stronger or notice it. Because you will never meet really hard and really easy opponents. You lose your interest in the boring loot (which is thrown at you every 2 minutes) and you don't feel like upgrading your stuff, because it doesn't bring you anything: Your opponents level up with you, so why upgrade?Please introduce an option, like in any other RPG: Upscalling the opponents on and off.- Story: It's no secret that the story is just poorly written. Though it could be worse. The only interesting storyline is Sebastian's! That one was also really fun to play and the sequences to it looked wonderful. - Beasts: You have a good selection of mounts and in itself, catching beasts is fun. But then waiting 30 min for a feather after feeding and petting the animal?! Waste of time and in the end you forget it anyway and have to pet and feed it again and wait 30 min again. Applause. And in general your vivarium doesn't bring you anything, except upgrading your clothes. No interaction with the animals except 2 animations (feeding and petting). A lot of potential lost! - My Character: No decisions have any influence. Your character has no character! As funny as it sounds. You can choose your clothes and also your wand and broom as you like. That's good, but that's about it for your character. You don't bond, you have no interest in getting to know yourself or your friends (except Sebastian and maybe Professor Fig) because they simply aren't deep enough. I could write more, but that would go beyond the scope. In itself, the game is not complete garbage, but it is also not a wonderful game that you can enjoy from front to back (such as Witcher 3, Tlou, RDR2 ...) Sure, it's a matter of taste, but if you're not so much into Harry Potter anyway and you're mainly looking at the gameplay, you are not interested to get the platin Troph.After 20-30 hours, you no longer want to solve the annoying trials and do the whole time only the same! For the game to be really good, almost everything actually needs to be more in-depth and interesting. However, I doubt that this will happen. Too bad."

Not a harry potter fan, nor the target generation, but still starving for an atmospheric open world game once in a while. Selling this as an rpg is extremely questionable. Graphics 10/10, amazing details and atmosphere, must have had a horrendously good budget. But then .. with such a level of potential ... then ... under the hood, a game where no decision seems to have weight, not a single piece of gear dropped having any impact (you can regularly just visit the vendor to buy highest gear quality on your level, which are mostly reskins anyways, anything below highest quality being vendor food), any combat situation being easily manageable even on hard (coming from i.e. gw2 elementalist) and a story ending in just -well- ... meh. Also, the UI sometime, forced minimap rotation, locked cursor on page swaps...I decided to finish it since i liked the visual design a lot, found it neat in many occasions and had that 'now I am invested'-feeling and wanted to see the ending. This is barely an rpg, maybe an open-world'ish adventure, that does not remotely come close to cyberpunk, witcher or even good old gothic or oblivion in terms of depth, complexity and freedom. Probably worth it if you are a diehard fan of the franchise and want to experinece an interactive part of the harry potter universe."

The castle's design is stunning, with intricate details that make it feel authentic. Finding book pages with fun-facts about the world adds to the immersion.The gameplay is versatile, allowing you to choose between stealth or wand blasting to complete missions and points of interest. The combat is simple but can be overwhelming at times. However, the story feels a bit shallow, and your actions don't seem to have much impact on the world around you.Despite the minor flaw in the story, Hogwarts Legacy is an incredibly fun game that kept me entertained for over 100 hours.

It's the first major non-movie-tie-in game in a setting that is, admittedly, is a pretty original one. No matter what you think of Wizarding Worlds or whatever it's called, you can't deny that the setting itself is pretty unique and unlike anything else among the major IPs nowadays. And on this, the game delivers. The world is vibrant and interesting, the atmosphere is great, the architecture is beautiful and it's all filled with a lot of small details that make it really a blast to explore. At least for the first 5-8 hours of gameplay. However, personally, I quickly lost interest in the game because it gets bogged down by a lot of... inconsistencies and problems. First, about what I call “inconsistencies”.Don’t be fooled by the marketing campaign. The game DOES NOT deliver on its promise of making you feel like a Hogwarts student. As a matter of fact, the game has pretty much nothing to do with the magic academy student-like experience. The game tries to pretend that this is what it is about at first, but you will quickly realize that it’s just a poorly chosen “aesthetic” that is dissonant with everything else in the game and, for this reason, does not work at all. The game’s story is completely inconsistent with what you’re doing and how it forces you to behave in it. The best example to illustrate my point would be a particular side quest I found in Hogsmead about 7 hours into the game.An adult woman, about in her 30s-to-40s from the looks of it, is asking the main character to “follow the butterflies” into the Forbidden Forest, because she’s interested where they lead and is herself scared of going into the Forest because… of her Hogwarts background. The teachers told her that Forbidden Forest is off limits to students because there is a lot of dangerous stuff there that will get her killed as students are not yet prepared to deal with it.Let me emphasize. A grown woman who studied at Hogwarts and knows for a fact that entering the forest is forbidden to students and is scared to go there because she doesn’t want to get killed by dangerous stuff out there… asks a Hogwarts student to go into Forbidden Forest. Not because she’s desperate, not because this is a matter of life and death to her… but because she is curious where the butterflies fly off to. Unbelievable. She’s not the only one who will ask the main character, a Hogwarts student, to do stuff that is in direct violation of Hogwarts rules in a way that doesn’t even imply that it would be breaking the rules. Quests like that are everywhere in the game. The characters will ask you, a Hogwarts student, to kill deadly Acromatulas, collect stuff in the Forbidden Forest or take on a camp full of dark wizards without even remembering that they are talking to a student. Even teachers will do that. But then when we need to go to the restricted section of the Library, suddenly the rules are in place again and you have to sneak around the librarian lest she tells on you to the headmaster. I just returned from butchering an entire village worth of dark wizards and I’m being threatened to be told on to the headmaster?This is the core of the problem, I believe. The gameplay systems are centered around chopping up powerful dark wizards for a regular Saturday morning exercise, but the game never acknowledges it is something a student should neither be capable of nor even attempt to do. So it doesn’t let me feel like a student, because I’m clearly more powerful and involved in dangerous stuff than a student should be, but it also doesn’t make me feel like a powerful wizard because Mrs. Scribner threatens to tell on me to the headmaster and I am supposed to take it as a serious consequence for my character. What am I supposed to feel while playing Hogwarts Legacy, then? I have no idea. So I just stopped caring. The game would be much better off if you played as an adult wizard instead of a student. But no, of course, the marketing team needs to make false promises about how this game will let you experience the joys of being a magic academy student. This is what the “Wizarding World” is about, right? This way we’ll be able to attract the core fanbase without actually making the game for them! The worst part about this is that they were right - just look at the number of positive reviews and concurrent players. They’ve played us for absolute fools!Now onto the “problems”. Many people have already stated them in other reviews. Technical issues on PC (although I, personally, don’t have many issues. The game plays at stable 60 fps for me on medium settings. On a laptop. But I digress), collection quests being the main thing you will do in the game, lack of expected features like Quidditch and so on. I don’t believe these are really all that important or take away from the game as much as the other problems I mentioned,  so I won’t focus on all that.My biggest gripe with the game aside from what I already stated above is its UI/UX and Inventory systems. They are a disaster. You’re being littered with pointless clothing items that don't have any differences between them aside from one stat number. And you get a new, slightly better item like every five minutes. So you’re forced to open inventory (which is not instant, you have to wait until the effects animation plays out) to change the item to get that 2 extra defense. Every five minutes. The “layer” setting that changes the items' looks only applies per item instead of overall. So you have to manually change the looks for every item you equip every time. Every five minutes. That is unless you prefer looking like a clown - in googly eyes glasses, a pointy hat, and a colorful star-riddled merlin-ish cloak. If you want to craft a potion, which you can only do in a specific location, you have to wait 15-to-90 seconds for the potion to finish cooking. There’s no way to make it brew faster. There’s no mini-game or anything. Just waiting. Oh, and you also can’t put several potions in a queue either. So you can’t dump ingredients for 10 potions at once and go explore to pick up all of them later. No, you have to craft one potion at a time and wait 15-to-90 seconds for it to finish so that you can brew another one. What a waste of time. One special type of cancer that is present in this game is the locking of quick bars behind the talent tree. You get more spells than your quick bar allows you to have already at 2-3 hours into the game, but the ability to unlock talents (and with them a second quick bar) only becomes available after 8-10 hours. And you can’t use spells without a quick bar, so you have to open a menu (and wait for the animations to play out. Again) every time you need to reassign Reparo to Lumos or whatever else is required for solving a puzzle. And you have to do it quite often.All of this disrupts the flow of the game. Instead of playing, enjoying the combat, or exploring you’re stuck dealing with slow menus. This review is written after I played for about 10 hours. That is what the game says in my save file. But you might notice that it says 17 hours on my steam profile. The additional 7 hours are most likely spent in these menus. Yeah, It really adds up.Overall, gameplay-wise, aside from the things I mentioned, it’s a pretty solid open-world RPG-like game. It’s neither better nor worse than any other open-world game available at the moment. It’s just the same as all of them. I will not try to evaluate if it's a good thing or a bad thing. It’s a matter of preference, I guess.  But the game has too many issues regardless so I wouldn’t recommend getting it at full price. Especially if you’re a Harry Potter fan who wants to “feel like a student at Hogwarts”. You won’t get this experience in this game."

Within the first hour I witnessed a dragon merk someone, and got to hang with Fig Newtons.  Can't get any better than that.Or can it...?  As of a matter of fact it does.  The game does an excellent job easing you into the world.  Although the introductions can be understandable perceived as too slow for some people (the skill tree takes way too long to unlock in my opinion).  Once things begin to kick off it really does fulfill the genuine open world RPG experience even from the perspective of someone that isn't a huge Harry Potter fan.  The final product is certainly better than most Ubisoft titles (and it has achievements too.... look at that).Presentation is important which Hogwarts Legacy fully understands.  My only major complaint is PC performance occasionally stuttering - even after reducing settings to lowest.  Maybe it is my card (RTX 2060), but it does feel unoptimized in some areas of performance.  With that being said, I never felt like the game was ""unplayable"" due to those issues so hopefully it will improve with future driver updates.  I do think PC port performance criticisms are extremely valid, but the game is still designed well to be enjoyable despite these issues.I don't regret buying it at full price, but nothing wrong with waiting for a sale either.  Definitely earned my stamp of approval regardless."

However, the more I play this game, more disappointed I become. Review is not final as I'm yet to finish this game, I'll update it once I'm done with it. Now, let's begin.GOOD sides.1) Environment - very well re-created world of Hogwartz and its surroundings, beautiful landscapes, place is massive, enjoyable to explore. There's a certain focus of attention to details that's been put when creating locations, including funny scenes and moments like two statues slamming each other every time you pass them.2) Music - Love it. Gorgeous music (Except one in Hogsmeade), it perfectly transfers those vibes from HP1-2 games and movies. Very well done.That's really it, at least so far for me. Now, bad sides. There's plenty and I don't care about what others may say, it's my personal taste and belief.BAD sides.1) Boring premise of the main story - yet another ""you're a wizard"" moment where you're that rare kid with super powers that very few others have. I wish it was more grounded with you being a regular student who got him/herself into trouble with friends and now are trying to solve things you may have ruined to begin with. 2) ""Loading doors"" - they ruin immersion for me even if the game is installed on SSD but there are a few moments when I can't enter a different location for a few seconds as the location itself is being loaded and thus the door won't open right away. A minor annoyance. 3) Hogsmeade music.4) CHARACTERS. Oh god, why. Game is set in 1800s, it's pre-Victorian era. Yet we have characters from other, far away eastern or/and southern countries. Transgender characters. Lesbian characters. Etc, etc, etc. If you want to make a game that follows nowadays trends, do a setup in 2010s+ year, not in 1800s. Otherwise it completely obliterates all that magical charm that the environment tries to establish by having modern trends clash against it. Absolute waste.5) Cutscenes. Feels very rushed. Some cutscenes are short, some characters reply without any expression or care. Classes last for a few minutes and it's always you doing things. Learn a spell. Click click. Voila, class is over lads. It feels that devs put a lot of effort in re-creating the environment and then they were told: ""Yo, you have 1 month to release the game"". 6) RPG Elements. It's good to have a variety of items to wear but they also grant you offensive and defensive attributes which force you to constantly ""upgrade"" your gear. Not to mention that your inventory is limited to 20 items, which is very small. I'd rather have the game make us think and become creative with spells rather than ""brute force"" your enemies instead. Complete miss on this one imo.7) Camera angle central pivot point is too low. If you make a perfect horizontal view, it'll be on a belly level rather than shoulder level. So when you begin to look around, your own character takes plenty of screen space. 8) Some technical glitches with shading, texture buffering being too slow.9) My character loves to lock his head left or right when running around rather than look where he runs to.10) You have a large variety of spells but you can only have 4 active ones at the time with 1-2-3-4 keys and (at least) I haven't figured out how to add more to the active slots. 11) Whole UI feels like the game was designed for the consoles but was ported to PCs. It's not that bad but its that evident. 12) Population - while the game has day/night cycle, I don't see students & teachers going to their beds in the evening. Location ""despawns"" populus behind your back. You can be semi-afk staring at a beautiful painting playing a nice melody and suddenly, location is empty because its night. You look around once more, its full again as its morning. But you don't see them coming downstairs or upstairs, they just appear. Its this odd feeling when world is sort of alive but it isnt. Feels more like a checkbox to me at times.Review is yet to be updated once I'm fully done with the game."

Graphic issues are also everywhere with pop ins and unloaded textures. I have tried every fix going at this time, and I had got the game into a somewhat playable state. But no more. There are people without issues it seems, but for the most of us, this game is badly un-optimised and needs more than a patch or two.

I would've preferred if you started from year 1 in Hogwarts and could make something of yourself i.e, becoming a dark wizard or going into the ministry, your choice of ending. But this provides none of that. Instead, you are thrown into a set linear story path that you cannot divert from, the game isn't necessarily bad, but it is just a waste of opportunity and budget since I don't think another Harry Potter game that is as high quality will come along anytime soon. The graphics are absolutely beautiful to look at, and the cutscenes are well animated but I could not find myself actually getting into the story.

Instead of saying ""that was some good flying"" its 10 voice lines back to back complimenting eachother and talking about their broom for example, I could not care less. The classes are the same thing over and over throughout the whole game and the performance is horrible. The open world is empty and the enemy variety is nonexistent. Its nothing but a game to keep you occupied when you have nothing else to do. I wouldnt buy this unless it was 30$ and even then i'd be hesitant. Wayyyy overhyped, and i think that atleast half of the people saying the game is insane, is just saying it because of the controversy and because they dont want the twitter morons to win.

The first couple hours are fun and intruiging, as the world looks and feels magical and interesting, however after about 12-15 hours it becomes very boring and shallow and the lack of any real gameplay becomes apparent.You play as Mr or Ms. Ultimate Fashion Sense and Mary Sue (or male equivalent) of the game, who hasn't even attended any magic classes so far in their life, yet somehow excels at all them. No doubt thanks to the very many, and incredibly simple, button presses the players has them do. Somehow uncovering ancient secrets and riddles that are also in plain sight all around the map and require incredibly simple inputs to solve, yet somehow all the wizards and witches in all of history couldn't match the genius of this one 5th year student with no magical education. But hey, it gives the player something to grind at least.So as it turns out you're a master Stargazer/Beast Tamer/Grave Robber/Broom Flyer/ all without training. Also somehow a fighter of no match, seeing how you can single handedly walk into a camp full of grown poachers and dark wizards and kill them all without much issue. And of course, that's what 5th years students do in Hogwards, what could go wrong, right?While the combat is by far the most fleshed out system, even that one feels a bit wonky. First of all, you're limited to sets of 4 spells at once. You CAN switch to different sets of 4 spells any time, but the controls are a bit clumsy. You hold a shoulder button and at the same time press a face button to cast a spell (so far so good) or use shoulder plus  d-pad to switch sets (bit clumsy in the middle of hasted combat, but ok) but for defensive stuff you need to simply press a face button (and of course that overlaps with the attack buttons, except you gotta let go of the shoulder button that you've been holding down all this time). Also you can just shoot your wand with no particular spell by pressing the same shoulder button. So in reality it will often happen that you want to dodge but will instead cast spells and get hit, and you need quite some time to get used to the fact that the same button presses will be both block and attack, depending on the shoulder button. Not the worst system, but doesn't feel very fluent either. Enemy attacks however are also not that great, you will always get a warning ""halo"" around your characters head that's either yellow or red, depending if you can deflect the attack or need to dodge it. That's nice, as you will often get attack from off screen and couldn't see that otherwise. In practice that simply means you're gonna focus on your characters head for most of the combat and dodge whenever it lights up and them spam spells while it doesn't. While you also need to break through shields using different color coded spells that's about the extent of the depth the system has to offer, worse when there are multiple enemies and you need to try and target a specific one with a specific spell. All in all, combat, despite the range of spells, just never quite feels good.The story is actually quite interesting, however there's so much filler it's getting more and more a chore to press forward. One moment you're uncovering ancient magic or try and sniff out details of a major conspiracy, next you fly around popping balloons or looking for random puzzles in Hogwards. My guess is there's so little actual story they had to draw it out. Either way the pacing is terrible as a result and whenever you think it finally gets going it won't take long before the next stopper and filler period comes in.Graphically the game looks amazing of course. And I think that's pretty much what AAA games are these days, lots of people working and adding lots of shallow systems that look good and don't require much thought. There's tons of small stuff to grind on the map that give small incremental upgrades to your character or gear. Worst of all storage space for picking up gear. So often you're in a dungeon not even able to loot chests because storage is already full and you need to remember next time to go to a shop and sell all gear you don't wear, which takes also unnecessarily long time, requiring a 2 second button hold for each individual item. Yawn. Then there's capturing beasts (or rescuing them, since we're the good guys right?) so you can harvest their fur/feathers/etc so you can upgrade your gear or add magical enhancements. The adding magical enhancements is quite and interesting system as it at least isn't just a simple stat increase on one of the two stats you have (offense and defense. Very creative there) but the tedium surrounding it is annoying. You can also grow your own plants that you can then harvest to then make potions. All actions which have an actual ingame timer ranging from 30 seconds to grow a simple potion to 10 minutes to let stuff grow. The growing makes sense, but making 6 potions is basically just you standing there doing nothing for 3 minutes while a small animation plays out. yaaawwwwnn.Then of course there's the usual problem of animation want to look good and cool, but then sometimes it won't function property in actual gameplay because of terrain that's in the way or next to you etc. It feels like that's almost expected these days in titles such as this, so I guess everyone's used to it by now. Still disapointing.But hey, you get to press a simple input and watch a beautiful 3 second animation play out while grinding small incremental upgrades and isn't that what AAA gaming is all about?"

Nearly all of the side quests that you will recieve is either some kind of ""collect the thing"" or ""fight this guy"", over on the other side of the map. Quests in Hogwarts are usually just classes, which feels lame considering how impressive the level design actually is for the castle. There are passageways and secret areas everywhere, unique puzzles exclusive to the castle, you'll even find a guy walking sideways on the wall.Interesting how your character doesn't become super jacked at the end of it from running on all those stairs. There are three student questlines, one for Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Seems they spent their budget on the Ravenclaw line pasting the same 5 merlin trials over and over again. All three are just them being overly trusting with their life story, and when you finish one of their quests, they never let you go on to the next one, not even giving a locked quest or anything. ""So basically we have this insane plan and we'll need to find the place and find out the truth at the bottom but meh i'll send you an owl or something"". Though I will say Sebastians storyline was more interesting and had much more depth than the main storyline.Main storyline itself is pretty lame. Goblins want equality and freedom from oppression and your job is to go around on a rampage and kill them. Wow I'm such a hero! There's also a bunch of ""keeper trials"" which are actually fleshed out dungeons with mixes of combat and puzzles, even an actual boss fight, but... why? None of this information through these quests and cutscenes actually matters because the goal of the game is to kill a guy. There is no changes in plot, other than .The unisex main character is just a Mary Sue. Everything they do is right, perfect, they're good at everything, they get exclusive right to the Room of Requirement, instantly a master at wandwork and spells, planting, making potions, et cetera. They also just don't STOP TALKING EVER! Every location, even a pile of rocks will have some form of pointless dialogue from the character.Even in the last cutscene for the House Cup awards, there is no recognition for the house you chose, theres little difference at all in the game apart from one quest in the first two hours of the game. In all the bloat they recorded for the NPC's and the main character, you'd think they would mention something about you being in the house you are in. Nope. In fact, they don't even announce the name of your house when you win the House cup, they say ""This students house"", while you stand there awkwardly in the hall when everyone else is sitting down. What a terrible wrap up. I played the game on the hardest difficulty, and so should you, as the game really isn't that hard to begin with, you'll even have   potions that make it even easier. Bosses themselves have like two attacks, and dodging is way more fun than parrying with protego. I don't really use combos that often bc the enemies die quick anyways, bu the shields enemies have are pretty annoying, because this guy has a yellow circle around him I have to make sure I have a slot or two dedicated to spells that can get through that, and even when the guy hasn't fully got up from the attack, they'll always re-protego and now its time to either put another purple spell in, or wait and dodge before you can hit him again. Combat is boring and tedious. Also ♥♥♥♥ ashwinder/poacher ranger spell spam.There is no consequence for using ""unforgivable"" spells, like mind control, stun, and insta-death. Even characters won't say any relevant things about it other than ""I didn't like that"". In the books and movies, people who use those spells are sent to Azkaban for the rest of their lives, but not you! Even the people still treat you like a glorious hero, despite being a genocidal maniac no better than the enemies.The world is scattered with map markers and camps and merlin trials and spider nests and blah blah blah. There is no filter option in the map to hide all the stupid treasure ""dungeons"". The world is scattered with bloat, copy pasted merlin trials which there are 95 of, and all have an unskippable identical cutscene at the end of them. Why?I feel like the game would breathe much better if they dropped the open world, and only focused on Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and maybe a couple close surroundings like the forbidden forest. I like getting all achievements in a game before I close the book on it, and boy was this painful.Hogwarts Legacy is yet another open world game filled with bloat and pointless fetch quests. Most puzzle solutions are just given to you by main character self-talk, and most of them you'll find identical replicas everywhere. If you'd like to play as a student, seek elsewhere because 99% of the game is outside of the castle in random stretched out areas. Little about this game is actually fun, and performance wise, the game is choppy and drops frames quite frequently, even with the reccomended specs and 32 GB of RAM. Combat is annoying and easy, and nothing you do, or who you are matters.This is a rushed game, and you shouldn't buy it."

Therefore I might miss aspects of the game, that a fan would like/dislike.This game is incredible! Far beyond what I expected and I can't get enough! I've never personally seen a game with such wide variety of gameplay, done so well. You'll decorate large rooms and medows, catch magical beasts and care for them, grow plants and make potions, stealth your way into forbidden places and brutally hunt down goblins with your ancient magic. This is only the surface of the game and after 29 hours of gameplay, I haven't even seen half of the world yet.Controls feels great, its easy to change spells and the combat is very satisfying. You'll also encounter a large amount of different puzzles, all of which are very well done and generally easy to figure out. Running on ultra settings, graphics are amazing and the world itself is one of the most beautiful ones I've ever seen. The game needs a bit of optimization, but I haven't personally been effected by it beyond a couple of minor FPS drops. I'm sure a patch will be released soon, so I wouldn't worry about this, but do keep in mind, that this game currently is on the heavy side.This is the type of game I would recommend to everyone.

I love learning about the past of the Wizarding World, and I was surprised they figured out a way to make the Legacy experience interesting and captivating. Give it a try! The first 2 hours will let you know whether this game is for you! But if you're a fan, take a bite of nostalgia with this game. The scenery and character graphics are beautiful (except for the cats, who dropped the ball on the cats?), and while the character creation could do with a more in-depth update, it's not as bad as people say, but I do agree it's somewhat lacking. Still, you can play as someone who is still wholly the character YOU customized, and it shouldn't detract from the overall experience and nostalgia that this game provides. Get lost in Hogwarts! I am a Harry Potter fan and have been for decades. It was my childhood, teenage-hood, and adulthood favorite stories and movies. As I grew up with them, I don't care about whatever negative news or publicity has been getting around in relation to J.K. Rowling. She had no participation in this game, if you do your research, so no one should be discriminating against any other individual for their love and passion for this game and the Harry Potter series. None of the negativity changes how these novels helped me through traumatic times in my life, and it never will. Harry Potter holds a wonderful and magical place in my heart, and no amount of garbage, lies or unfortunate truths will sway my passion for these stories. So don't let others control you and tell you that you're a terrible person for playing this game. They're intolerant and desire tolerance while not accepting ANYONE for their own beliefs. Ignore, move past, and make YOUR own decision."

So far the story is good, combat is alot of fun and the graphics are great.Performance isn't to bad, could use a little more optimization but its not as bad as some have said. Mainly atleast for me it comes right as a cutscene starts or ends, rarely ever when I am actually playing.The voice work and music is also very well done, great animations, fun side quests, the puzzles are a blast and its fun to rip around flying with your broom! It's a wonderful game that is alot of fun to play.Thoughts After 10 Hours Now:Positives:- Graphics are great- Atmosphere is very well done- Game world is well crafted with lots to find for people exploring- Combat is a blast and way better than it has any right being, gets better as it goes to- Music is ace- Voice acting is good- Cutscenes are very well done- Animations are slick- Tons of side activities and side quests to do- Controls are good- Flying around is a blast!Negatives:- Performance could be a little better- The story is decent but not amazingGame is amazing and an early GOTY contender, check it out!Can't wait to play more, its an early GOTY contender just like Hi Fi Rush, what a start to 2023 for games, its only Feb and we have two wonderful ones so far, lets hope this continues for most the year :)**Beat the game, I would say it was a 8/10 for me, very good... went in hoping for 7/10, got a better game than I was expecting******The whole game was finished on the Steam Deck, it works great if you use Proton GE-49, turn in game FSR off (but on for steam deck), turn settings to Low but put Textures to Medium). I also have the Vram Fix and CryoUtilities Fix that I did for Midnight Sons, doing this will help on Hogwarts to****"

There's a lot of detail and interactable objects in the game world that just make it a joy to experience. The game also provides a multitude of activities to choose from and it's easy to find yourself so immersed that you lose track of time.Combat is a bit simplistic, like a dark souls-lite with many different spells to combine and a combo system to tie it all together. However, it is still fun and controls feel very responsive. Countering attacks and chaining different spells together are both satisfying and rewarding. Talents are also available to tailor your gameplay preferences by adding to your abilities anywhere from spellcasting, stealth, and consumables.One thing I do wish was improved is the variety of dialogue options. Most of the time you only get a couple options to choose from, it makes it feel almost kinetic. However this doesn't prevent you from being a total A-hole if you want to be ;)Tl;Dr: Buy game, gud game. PS: Friendly reminder, don't forget it's canon that poop can be magic'd away in HP, which means everyone is crapping themselves constantly."

Has plenty of scalability and upscaling settings, has PlayStation/Switch/Steam/SteamDeck button prompts support, native PS controller support, native ultrawide support, arbitrary framerate support, most of what you'd expect from a modern PC port in 2023. The port stuff is especially surprising, as outside of this, Fortnite, and HiFi Rush, most Unreal Engine games on PC may as well be low-effort Xbox debug builds that ship unpolished (I've boycotted making any game mods for Unreal Engine games, as they share the same problems, and are holding back PC gaming). Glad to say this is not the scenario here. Good work, even the console versions have a framerate cap separated from the quality settings, so they should be fantastic on future hardware like the PS5 Pro or PS6 (for example). Keyboard and Mouse input also has separate UI related tweaks from controller input as well (Being able to drag and drop spells onto slots, having the spells laid out in a horizontal manner, being able to scroll between spell pages with the scroll wheel).I do however wish the game had an option to not use a Over The Shoulder perspective, and the option of furthering the camera (The FOV slider is a band-aid for a shotgun wound).If you are wondering why my playtime is short, it's because I played on a relative's Steam account as Family Sharing was not enabled until the game left Early Access. I played about 10-20 hours on that account in offline mode. My save transferred over without problems.The big controversy from a vocal minority on Twitter/ResetEra/Reddit is a nothingburger. Not like anyone on those websites should have their opinions taken seriously. I thought an IP as big as Harry Potter was gonna be the thing to cause a gaming crash to happen (due to the massive wave of terrible/soulless/incomplete/buggy AAA game releases), but I was left pleasantly surprised by how high the bar got put. I hope Avalanche gets to work on more licensed games. If they patch the problems with the game after launch, then it's already better than the treatment FromSoftware gave Elden Ring on PC, despite fanboys astroturfing it as a perfect release. This and HiFi Rush are probably GOTY contenders."

They made the whole place interesting. You know how games with huge areas will have a lot of doors ""painted"" in the walls that you can't interact with? This game has even more doors... but all of them are functional. There's places to explore everywhere. And, personally, I'm not exploring for some ingame rewards (those are, frankly, a bit meh) - but because it's been really fun to explore.The gameplay is pretty fine so far, playing on hard some of the combats can be a bit of a challenge in a good way. The game incentives you to make combos while dodging/parrying enemies, leading to a very action-y combat experience that feels good.I really love how the main character can be pretty talkative, and actually talk about the weird things she sees instead of keeping everything to herself like way too many game protagonists do. Great voice acting for the female MC too, I haven't heard the male one to comment. Overall, voice acting for most everyone is good, but there's one glaring exception: there's one minor Hufflepuff student that has the single worst voice I've heard in my entire life, and that voice doesn't seem to match his face or his face movements at all, it's bizarre.Regarding performance, I'm having a stable 60 FPS, but I'm having to play on lower quality than what I've expected, having to set everything to Low and use FSR2. Loading times are pretty good, at least, and I don't have any noticeable frame drops; just a pity about the low quality."

The game starts with a generic ""chosen one"" scenario but gets better as you progress through it. I will keep the information private, but the story is engaging, and I would love to read it as a book.The gameplay is overwhelming and features many amazing and satisfying mechanics. Exploring every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings is a treat, with many collectibles and puzzles to uncover. The side quests are exceptionally well done, allowing you to understand your fellow students better. The combat system is fantastic, featuring a variety of spells that can be combined for different effects. The fast travel system using Floo powder or brooms is a great touch, making travel and exploration even more fun.The RPG elements could be better, but the character creation and skill tree are still outstanding. The voice acting is excellent and adds to the game's overall atmosphere.The atmosphere is simply stunning. Hogwarts is massive, and the attention to detail in the handcrafted halls, rooms, and dungeons is breathtaking. The neighbouring villages and landmarks are just as atmospheric, making you want to explore every inch of the world.In conclusion, Hogwarts Legacy is a must-play for any Harry Potter fan or RPG lover. The gameplay, atmosphere, and attention to detail are truly unique and make this game stand out in the gaming world.9/10 - Just fix PC FPS Drops."

My personal favorite questline was the one with Poppy Sweeting from Hufflepuff.OH, and Quidditch is cancelled this year by the Headmaster! Haha...I couldn't believe it! Hopefully it gets added VERY soon.Anyway, yeah I would still rate this game a 6/10 due to the sheer fact that after the nostalgia, I feel the promise rings rather hollow. No quidditch. Perhaps some updates/dlc will help, though I have my doubts, even if it will be fun at first. Fun at first, but you quickly discover you are no factor in changing the story for good or bad."

Hogwarts itself is a real work of art. I cant think of another game that has made this in-depth of an interior structure. I came in expecting set pieces, all the locations from the movies, connected by intricate but linear hallways, and un-open-able doors; but the castle is entirely believable as a school, and only the room of requirement is instanced. common rooms, classrooms, bathrooms, suites for teachers and visitors...etc...etc...etc...for HP fans: its not even a question, you already own it. for anyone into RPGs and fantasy as a genre: its a really good choice. for #allies: come on....the devs worked really hard, there isn't anything in the text that's anti-trans, and Rowling made her bag before it even opened for pre-ordersas to the bad that I've noticed:Some stalling issues, endless loading screens on some fast travel that forced me to end process, and a pair of hard crashes thus far; but this is all to be expected for an open world game in week 1. I have faith it'll get patched. The IP has more money than god.some (more than less) of the dialogue is stilted somewhat. The VA is only 'passable'. But it's not a deal breaker, as i can rationalize it as ""its the 1800s bro, that's just how people talked"". Just be aware that the folks saying ""best writing of the year"" are probably overcompensating to fight the review bombs. some visual nit picks: while robes are nice and billowy, skirts on fem outfits are highly static. long skirts are accurate to the period, but there is more reason than thirst trapping for short skirts in gaming; its easier to get away with skipping clothing physics if the fabric is above the knee. and trousers all look like 'trousers'. essentially the clothing could be more aesthetically pleasing. but this is all stuff that can be modded. also sad there is no romance sub plot. had I looked that up BEFORE buying, I may have held off for a sale. favorite part of HP was his tumultuous dating life. I realize that the Devs are probably correctly concerned that the twitter mob will start calling them pedo's if they have anything more than platonic friendship for the 16 year olds in the game; but it's a boarding school story, come on. When I was 16 who was dating who was half my personal drama. I'm not here asking for CDPR style sex scenes, but the story is worse for not having a cute boy/girl we can spend the whole school year pining over and culminating in *gasp* holding hands at the end."
287,29,The Real Peanut,https://steamcommunity.com/id/i_enjoy_the_company_of_men/,56,2,0,82.2,Posted: February 11,82,4,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/3a057c5062fa41a1bc62c5f6dd4d0c9a249a59f2.jpg,"The Story is extremely shallow. You are dropped in the game and you are immediately a super hero. I should also add you have absolutely no back story. At least when Rowling introduces us to the boy who lived it starts from the beginning and develops Harry prior to Hogwarts. Not only are you the immediate super hero, you start off as a 5th year student. Likely to do with the larger demographic of HP fans are in their 30s now and the studios thought it might not be appealing to play as an 11 year old but you still could come up with something... Such as starting off the game as a first year at 11, and that be the tutorial and as the tutorial is going along you're quickly going through the years where you learn who it is that you are playing as and at the end of the tutorial is when you are beginning your 5th year. Instead they decided to just throw you in as an underdeveloped character beginning his first year as a 5th year as this already amazing wizard that the player did nothing to achieve that in game. Admittedly my suggestion is shallow at best too but it is still far more developing than what we got. Then to make it worse, when you're going through your classes you're constantly showered with ""Wow thats amazing, it took me years to figure that out"". Alas, the immediate super hero. Your character is also aware of who the main antagonist is and who his right hand man is, yet you, the actual player, has no idea. I mean who Ranrok is as a character. You personally have nothing to go off of. Lets talk about risk vs reward. There isn't any. Early on during a quest you get a notification saying that you cannot wander the castle at night without risk of getting in trouble. Yet I do it every single night and literally no one stops you. There are several times where I have broken the rules and there is 0 tangible punishment. You help steal ingredients from the Potions Profs office. Then you get caught but thank god you made such a good potion and the professor just says ""Well I like people who take responsibility for their actions. You made a great potion today. That was no easy task"". Going back to showering the player with ""wow youre amazing"". Also I should add that you don't actually do anything to make the potion. It is all done in what is essentially a cutscene. Another example of there being no punishment, when you learn how to fly you have the option to veer off course with a classmate and take the scenic route thus breaking the rules. You get caught, the prof says both of us will be penalized by taking a hefty amount of points away from your house and that should deter you from doing it again. THERE IS NO HOUSE CUP!! Therefore there was no punishment. Therefore no reason for me to taper my behavior. Also why the hell is there no house cup??? Wasn't this game supposed to give you a feel for being a hogwarts student? AND ALSO why the hell is there no Quidditch?! You get sorted very early on and the headmaster, who is kind of a villian but you never interact with, says ""Due to an injury on the quidditch pitch there will be no quidditch season this year"". What injury?? The school year just started.. The students just arrived so how could there have been an injury. Why is there no quidditch?? Flying is in the game.. So is the Quidditch pitch. Outside the quidditch pitch, there are students in their quidditch house robes volleying bludgers around. You also find the snitch flying around in the room of requirement. Quidditch isnt even a complicated game. The assets are there. Put it in the game. Mark my words, Quidditch already exists within the game at launch and they will soon release Quidditch DLC and that DLC will just allow you to play it rather than adding it to the game. Similar to what EA did with Mass Effect did years ago.  Also in the main menu screen, the snitch sometimes flies around your head basically mocking you.Side objectives are mediocre at best. Its just mostly go collect this stuff or go kill these goblins and bring me my loot back. On the topic of quests in general, the game just points you exactly where to go which is odd in a game that is supposed to be immersive and open world. Rather it just holds your hand. There is one side mission that has you look for these objects that are usually high above you and even if it is not your specified objective if you enter a room and one is in there your character will tell you to look up in a very indirect but direct way.Then there is gearing.. Why in an HP universe game is there gearing?? Even then It also lacks depth. It honestly feels like an exploration device cause they could not come up with anything clever to entice you to explore more.The only real cool thing about the game is adventuring the school. However as a whole due to the fact of extremely shallow story narrative and very forced plot devices and no house cup and quidditch, I would strongly strongly advise that you do not purchase this game until they come out add features to it to make the game worth playing or it is on a massive sale"

Forget it - 1000 things to do on the way! The spellcasting mechanics are so much fun and the storyline is captivating (playing as House Ravenclaw).

Yes, I do wish we could sit in those gorgeous Common room couches or take a quick nap in our dorm’s bed to alternatively manual save/time skip, but either way, as a seasoned gamer and Potterhead alike, this game, flaws and all, is freaking incredible!"

I wanted to experience all this game has, and give it a fair review. I also live streamed the entire game and it is on my channel at .Story is Phenomenal, Music is Fantastic, Combat is Good/Okay some enemies feel clunky but combos are phenomenal to pull off, UI is a mess and swapping spells is pretty meh, taking care of beasts is charming and fun, creating potions and crafting is incredibly lackuster. inventory space is lacking, environment looks great! At first. Once you seen it already, you have already seen what it has to give, also feels like the game didn't go far enough in Hogwarts, also there are some bugs which are not THAT bad thankfully. I rate the game a 8/10 and hope they release expansions or dlcs, to improve upon what is here! I really hope this isn't a release and drop game.More detailed explanations below. The story is fantastic, and the characters are all incredibly fun to get along with. Some of the twists and turns you encounter is very fun to see, and many of the quests have tragedy spoken about it all over the place. It's a bit dark in this time of Hogwarts but the experience is quite Epic and I find the story telling and characters to be one of if not the most phenomenal thing in this game. The Music is incredible and really gives off this magical experience when playing the game. They honestly nailed it really well, every track fits well with the situations, although there are moments where the music is either a bit too loud or just disappears during some encounters. Despite that, the Music is one of the major highlights of the game as well as the sound of spells and explosions. Very boomy, very nice.Textures and Facial Expressions on medium were okayish, weren't the best looking but also weren't the worst! The effects for magic however was amazing and they did a really good job on teleporting and spell colors and the vibrancy of some environments really popped and it was a wonderful thing to experience as it felt just like the movies.Spell combinations were a huge highlight in this game, it was a very nice experience to use the utilities of each spell off of eachother in order to win in combat. I absolutely adored the spells HOWEVER. Enemies are quite . Some of the enemies will teleport to hit you, some of them will all attack you at once, and you have to Shield / Dodge multiple times because if you dodge/block one spell, you won't dodge the second either. It is quite unfortunate, and a bit frustrating to experience that as getting hit on hard difficulty despite traits/defensive stat basically meant 80% of your HP was gone no matter what. Spells were great, enemies were meh. A very weak part of this game unfortunately, the fact that you have to rotate 4 spells at a time was kind of frustrating, it made swapping to different combos kinda of finiky. Same with trying to utilize consumables, you had to select out of your pool of them in order to just utilize one at a time, its why I didn't rely on potions or plants during my playthrough. Revelio spam is also kind of annoying.Taking care of beasts is great! However, the lack of inventory space early on for both gear and beasts is kind of frustrating, same with the 4 species limit in vivariums, I really wish we could just have a huge field of beasties all mingling. Creating potions and crafting is legit non existent, you gather materials and then you just wait 15s - 2 minutes for a potion to be made, which you only make one at a time individually and cannot craft in bulk or gather in bulk. Its a time waster, I honestly wish there was a potion crafting minigame and you made potions in bulk as well as could sell excess materials for galleons. Crafting gear and gear in general is honestly kind of lame, once you have good traits you basically are just over powered, I used traits to boost all spells globally in damage and it just carried me as long as I didn't get hit as defensive stats don't matter. Exploration was also tedious and very very wide. There was a lot to do that didn't really contribute to anything aside from achievements. Another thing, is while you can explore everything and enter almost every room, once you have seen it already, you have seen all what it can provide. There is nothing really new and the world slowly becomes incredibly dull and empty aside from the seasonal changes from progressing in the quests. There are also no house points you can earn, and some things and activities you can't really do. This game on side stuff, really didn't go far enough in my honest opinion to make the roleplay experience of being in Hogwarts authentic. Honestly, I never really encountered many bugs, most of them were visual or just me getting stuck on a rock. However one major bug I encountered was entering a end game dungeon and beating it, and the NPCs spoke in the subtitles but were not there. Once I got that quest LITERALLY at the end of the game, the NPCs were there but because I beat the dungeon already, it just skipped to the end. It was very jarring and I honestly feel sad cause I missed an experience. I very much hope this game gets updated and more contented added in the future. While it did great on certain parts, it felt like it didn't go far enough on others, and felt shallow in multiples areas. The Main Story was great same were the characters, and the initial view was wonderful.I had a great time playing it mainly because of the story, music and views, with some frustrations related to combat, inventory, ui, and side activities either being subpar bland or jank. I recommend this game, and as above I give it a 8/10 and really hope it gets improved upon. The story, music, and setting in of itself really makes the game worth it in my opinion, and I will be paying my friend back in full for allowing me to experience it. I also raised $600+ dollars for the Trevor Foundation while playing it, the issues people are experience regarding the cultural thing. Just, all I will say is, Dislike the Artist, Love the Work. Magic is for Everyone, she who shall not be named cannot prevent it from being shared."

I will just say that the hype was definitely worth it because I'm absolutely in love with this game.The story, the atmosphere, the whole aesthetics in general are great. Even though the game is singleplayer you never feel alone. The map is huge and it's beautifully done with so many details and places to explore. Just walking around the map is already so calming and cozy. There is many iconic places around Hogwarts and many things can be recognized if you read the books or watched the movies, just that it plays before those. But it's also an interesting world for non Harry Potter fans. However I wish they added a tiny bit more details like being able to sleep in your dorm, being able to eat or take a shower. Would feel more realistic to me. Also I feel like some voices don't fit the characters, for example Arthur Plummly and Everett Clopton.But otherwise I really can't complain, the game is amazing and I really hope they will add some DLC 's in the future."

Exploring in the forbidden forest doesn't feel that scary and dangerous due to how strong we are and the lack of different enemies. The game is Astonishing!

The NPC's always surprises me with funny things. The Stats, Gear, Mounts, Wands and Talents/Spells is just AMAZING. Good job! The quests are really getting me hooked, and the friends you get in this game is amazing! You can really connect and feel different things about them.  Considering all the cons we also have to remember that this game is what it is and that's how they wanted to make it.

Nevertheless, for die-hard Harry Potter fans, it's still worth checking out."

The way they talk also feels right for the period and setting of the Game, but take that with a grain of salt since my native language is German. The world itself was well made and I have often taken a break to just stare at the murals and paintings in Hogwarts.The combat is incredibly fun and is a lot better than I expected and decently challenging.The map is big and with all the challenges and things to discover it feels full and alive.So with the Game so far I can honestly say it was a good buy and recommend it to everyone interested in Harry Potter or action / adventure RPGs.

If this is the case then HL leaves a lot to be desired. It's a very beautiful game and the mission layouts are simple and story engaging enough for brand new players. Players that might be primarily fans of the IP and want to experience the world for themselves. But for everyone else the world and gameplay are very shallow. NPC have no reaction to the world around them, no mission rewards is worth the effort invested, the enemy diversity is lacking and worst of all the missions feel like a CHORE rather than something you're rushing to do. After a few hours and the nostalgia factor has worn off you just find yourself in an empty world where nothing you do really matters and you're just flying from point A to point B collecting ugly glasses and hats that you never use.

The stutters are absolutely horrible at times sadly. The recommended settings by the game itself (Medium on 1440p) was struggling to maintain constant fps at times, especially in Hogsmead and during fights. DLSS didn't seem to make a highly noticable difference to performance either (but yes you get a few extra frames). And Raytracing even at the smallest level is out of the question in case of my 3060. As of right now I've settled for 1080p with a mix of medium and low settings.And for the gameplay part, the fact that we have a game like this set in Hogwarts after all these years makes me so happy (and I'm not some hardcore Potterhead). Its been really fun so far. I heard that combat was not that great prior to playing this but I've found it be pretty good actually. As for the spells, you have to attend classes, do assignments and side missions (not boring ones) in order to learn them which is kinda fun. I believe I've only scratched the surface when it comes to exploring the whole map and from what I've seen so far it's just so beautiful. Hogwarts looks so so good and extremely detailed. And you get to enter almost every single room with a door (I've been inside almost every room I've seen so far except for the ones that asked to me to level up). Recommending this because I hope (and trynna be positive) that the optimizations issues will get sorted out in the next few updates :) Also this is a review of the game and not any indication of how I feel about the statements made by the creator of the franchise. I hope people try to separate art and the artist and see the game for what it is. :)"

They haven't updated it to fix the issues listed below. Turning off ray-tracing helps with the crashing issue a little, but the game still crashes sporadically more so when fast traveling. Overall, I'd only recommend this if you like collectathons, this is worse than Assassin's Creed in that respect. They have you collect objects that literally mean nothing with zero attachment to them, and expect that to be the post-game experience. I enjoyed gaslighting my friends, stealing things from people to get reactions, and wearing a pumpkin for a majority of the game tho. Other than that, pretty boring.The no consequences for your actions seems like a half baked system that they didn't have time to finish, especially when considering the final fight of the game.________________________________________________________________________This is only a temporary review to say that performance has been noticeably worse since the last patch. My game has crash 5 times in 3-4 hours of play since the update. It is especially problematic when fast traveling frequently and walking around Hogesmead. Another issue is that lighting has been pretty bad since the most recent patch where they updated ray tracing. Indoor environments are lit like the light source was a bright as the sun and in the room. In the over-world lighting is pretty inconsistent as well, where things vary from really bright to normal. Textures and pop-in have also been worse since the that patch.The game has had issues from the start but they have mostly out the stuttering. Hopefully these other issues can get ironed out fairly quickly. Overall, the game is solid albeit with rushed design at times where things don't make sense as to why they are in the game. As someone with no experience with the books nor movies, the game could do better in explaining past events in the world that they allude to in the field manuals.This will get updated once I finish the game."

The story of the game is thus a prequel to the works of Joanne K. Rowling, who is not involved in the development of the game.At the start of the game, as is usual in role-playing games, the player creates their own character. This is a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who receives a belated invitation to the school. The player then has the opportunity to choose which house they want to belong to. The player soon discovers that he is no ordinary student, possessing an unusual ability to perceive and control so-called ancient magic, which is exceedingly rare and potentially dangerous. The player can choose how to use this ability as the game progresses. In addition, it will be possible to customize the character and develop his skills.The game takes place in an open game world in the Harry Potter universe. This will contain already known, but also new places. In addition to the Hogwarts wizarding school, the wizarding village of Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley and the Forbidden Forest are known as venues.

But games never get that right. You start as a 5th year and if I HAD my preference you'd start from the beginning as a small kid with the world being more innocent and fairy tale-ish and it would go through the entire time of Hogwarts with your character growing and the story gradually getting more serious and mature as the game goes on. Kinda like the books. I suppose that's a little too much to expect and such a game would be spectacularly large.  For the most part I think it delivers exactly what you'd want from it.  The graphics are generally awesome.  Lots of stuff to explore.  Lots of little attention to details that fill out the world. Puzzles and mysteries and spells, etc. Items and treasure. Combat seems to be handled well so it's not too cumbersome.  Plenty of cats to pet. That alone deserves a thumbs up.  As for the controversy. Well ironically the game is pretty darn woke and inclusive. Almost to the point of immersion breaking. Almost. But you either are all in on that or just roll your eyes and get on with it.   Otherwise nothing political really enters the game. It just seems to be a well made PG-ish World of JK Rowling simulation. Which I imagine is what people want."

The game's immersive world, deep lore, and engaging gameplay all combined to create an unforgettable experience.One of the game's standout features was its setting in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The attention to detail in the environment was impressive, and I felt like I was really exploring the magical world I grew up reading about. From the Forbidden Forest to the Hogsmeade Village, every location felt like it was ripped straight from the pages of the books.The game's story was also well-written and engaging. As a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, I had to navigate the challenges of school life while also uncovering a dark mystery that threatened to engulf the wizarding world. The game's moral choices also added to the sense of player agency and made me feel like my decisions had real consequences. But I later found out that my decisions had no real consequences and that there is no honor system like in red dead redemption 2.The gameplay was also excellent. As a student at Hogwarts, I had to attend classes, learn spells, and engage in duels with other students. The game's RPG mechanics allowed me to customize my character's appearance, skills, and abilities, making me feel like I was truly crafting my own wizarding experience.Additionally, the game's sound design and music were outstanding. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of orchestral and magical themes, perfectly complemented the game's setting and added to the overall atmosphere of the game.Finally, I have to say that the game's attention to detail was impressive. From the intricate spell animations to the various magical creatures I encountered, it felt like every aspect of the game was carefully crafted and thought out.Overall, I would highly recommend Hogwarts Legacy to anyone who loves the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The game's setting, story, characters, gameplay, sound design, and attention to detail all combined to create a truly magical experience."

The first half is incredible, the prologue was a completely unexpected cinematic gem, Hogwarts itself is a joy to explore, the initial lessons offer nice flavour about the spells you're about to learn, the characters are unique (albeit a bit cliche) and you're really feeling that 'I'm a student at hogwarts' vibe. Then you get your broom and the game becomes a generic open world RPG as if Harry Potter himself has joined the Assassin Brotherhood. Everything that makes the first half so interesting is gone, lessons are uninspired cutscenes and you then you learn an unrelated spell after, the world is littered with repetitive tasks/collectibles, characters become the same blend of 'good-natured but incompetent' and quests become 'go to dungeon, kill baddie, retrieve thing'. The final half of the story lets down the great introduction by offering no meaningful choices and an unemotional, obvious finale. Itemisation is shockingly poor. I picked up a 'legendary' item within my first hour of play which was discarded by a basic item in the next hour. There's no interesting item attributes to focus or balance just offence and defence when you could have had spell cooldown, damage, critical, debuff, stealth detection etc... The talent system also felt pretty shallow with most of the spell talents just adding an AoE component. The inability to unlock every talent and/or respec is just criminal. Personally I felt the potions should have been harder to obtain but with longer durations/more powerful effects. It just became an chore to brew them and apply them constantly. It would have been much cooler to hunt down a rare creature for a material, to brew into a potion that gave me a 5 minute buff or even something permanent. Witcher 3 is really best in show for this. That being said, I found the combat plants a fun thematic inclusion.Combat was generally quite fun and a challenge at times. The air-time mechanic was probably my favourite aspect of the combat. It did however feel like there were really only two classes of enemies - those that could be crowd controlled and those that couldn't. The controls for combat were not great and found myself messing up whilst trying to switch up spell slots on the fly.Credit where is credit is due, the world is beautiful. Hogwarts obviously is the masterpiece but there are really fantastic sets throughout the world. Overall this game has great potential and I hope the success it has achieved will inspire fundamental changes in DLC or a much deeper sequel."

This alone should be enough to make one hell of a universe… universe that Hogwarts Legacy barely expands on, that Harry Potter movies altered to bare minimum, enough to make couple of movies out of it. The thing is, videogame is not a movie, and it requires quite a lot more work to create believable, enjoyable and well put together world that does not need explanation outside of environmental storytelling on its own.Second most visible and painful problem is the checklist well known from Ubisoft productions like Assassins Creed, so called fillers that they’re giving players to sink hours into completion that has nothing of value, but cosmetics, upgrades, craftables. Hogwarts Legacy has quite a lot of them, and I can only assume that they were made purely to fit the popular world designs of triple A games that we were fed for past couple of years. Once you try any of those collectables once, all of them work pretty much the same, and there’s way more than enough of them to give you a headache, especially if you’re a completionist.What also stands out is that every cave has exactly the same design, every bandit camp is the same thing, and there is simply not enough unique locations to do something better with it.I should put it in the first place, but considering that game with mute protagonist and NPCs that you can talk not even once to in order to complete the game, it lands on third place, just because it exists in this game and it is beyond annoying.Most of the characters are boring, and their dialogue is something you would see more in a parody of Harry Potter more than actual and serious game.Side-quest dialogue is stiff, and feels like not enough budget was put into minor background characters, while everything was pumped into cutscenes including characters vital to the main story. Considering that I did not finish the game yet, and I’m probably not even halfway through it I can’t really have an opinion on main story, but so far every single side quests I completed was just a simple fetch, kill, gather quest that also feels like a filler, in addition to world design issues I stated earlier. I believe there are some quests that are interesting, but I am yet to complete them.Nearly non existing. This one is essentially dropped from Avalanches to do list. You can spin the globe, pet the cat, have some beasts, whatever. Interactions with what matters are not there. You can get one liners from some students in the castle. Every interaction that starts the quest is something you would expect current AI robots to do. It is not believable. Characters just stand waiting for you to approach them, do your thing, come back and then never interact with them again. For a videogame following this design you would expect to find characters asking for help midway through the thing they ask you to do, not just stand and wait for their savior. If you take into consideration games like Red Dead Redemption 2, Hogwarts Legacy is 10 steps back in terms of interactivity with the world. I will not mention the whole ‘choice matters’ thing, because there is no choice to nothing. The most important to me, certainly not to others.I will start by saying that designs in this game are wonderful. Ambience and aesthetics of the castles interior are on par with Elden Rings.The problem starts when you’re getting bored of the castle and you want to explore outside of it, because… there is not a lot to explore. If you take the checklist locations you’re really left with couple of places that shine the most. I think that while with real life locations, such as Hogwarts being in UK, worldbuilding gets the most opportunities to shine, while world design can get tricky to pull off, and you can clearly see that just flying around the map. Couple of extraordinary locations on a simple map with just mountains and plains is something that Horizon Zero Dawn was suffering from, and it is a shame."

Since you have missed the first four years you are assigned a mentor to bring you up to speed on what you will need to know. On your way to Hogwarts, you take a flying carriage, not the train. You find that you can see ancient magic. Then your party is attacked by a dragon. You escape using a port key that lands you in Gringots…and then things start to get interesting.Hogwarts Legacy is an open world game set in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, about 100 years prior to Harry's birth. This means that while knowing the Harry Potter lore is helpful, but not essential. You start off by creating your character. Your appearance can be either male or female. The game does have a number of NPCs with same sex relationships, if that bothers you.One thing the diehard fan will have issues with is the fast travel floo system. This is due to a number of things, you require floo powder to use the floo system and the floo system connects chimneys. Once you get out of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade the floo system connections are frequently attached to fireplaces, but not the whole system. However you don't need to be near a floo end point to use the floo system, you can use it anywhere in the game, except for the few times it is locked out due to the story or if you're inside an instance.You will have to complete tasks so that the professors will teach you additional spells. To learn a spell you have to follow a path pressing certain keys or buttons to increase the speed of your token. Fortunately you only need to do this one time as the game would be quite difficult if you had to do it during combat. After you learn a spell you can pin it to your spell bar. The spell bar holds four spells and you can have access to up to four spell bars. The only spell this does not hold true for is the spell to open locks, you must play a mini game every time. The mini game is not difficult, but it is rather annoying when you're doing it for the 40th time.Combat is hard. Especially since you are normally outnumbered, you versus however many enemies there are. You are taught this early on in the dueling club. Where you are given the option to fight with a friend. Foolishly I thought that not having the friend would make it a fair fight, nope same fight with no help, or something else for them to shoot at. As you progress through the game enemies will protect themselves with different protections which require a specific spell class to break, and you only have four to work with. I played with a keyboard and mouse, I do not know if a gamepad would be easier or harder. Later on it was easier for me as my keyboard allows me to create macro keys, so I can easily switch between a larger variety of spells. The problem is that with so many spells you have a choice of cast or move, you can't do both with a keyboard and mouse.The graphics are beautiful, you feel like you're living in a movie. The world is huge. You are not simply stuck in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. You have the surrounding villages and countryside to explore.Every launch the game has to prepare the shaders, depending on your computer this make be quick, 30 seconds to a minute for me, or longer.There is plenty to do in the game. Collect gear, better gear means you'll have an easier time of things. You can upgrade your gear by adding additional traits to it. You have your standard quests and lots of side quests. There are five different categories of challenges: combat, quests, exploration, field guide pages, and room of requirement. In side of the different challenge categories are a number of different challenge types. As you complete challenges you will gain additional gear, appearances, and upgrades.You can do everything a wizard does. Grow magical plants to fight for you or as potion ingredients. Collect and breed magical creatures who will supply you with the things you will need to upgrade and enchant your gear.As you level you will earn talent points that you can use to customize your character to suit your play style.The more I played this game the more it struck me as an MMO, without other people.

One of the best AAA games in the past decade. It’s just so much fun!What I like:- Excellent snappy combat- Gorgeous graphics, truly next gen. (for a price)- Interesting quests (there are fetch quests but they are short and sweet)- Main Story so far is entertaining, much like a HP spinoff movie.- Loads of content (10 hours in, barely scratched the surface)- Great characters and voice acting.- Exploration is unparallelled, you never know what you find in the next nook, pretty much all doors are open, the castle is GIGANTIC, and that is only part of the map.- An amazing collect-a-thon! I loathe collectibles (looking at you Assassins Creed) but Hogwarts somehow makes it fun and rewarding.What I don’t like:- Awful PC performance, especially if you want to use Ray-Tracing (my RTX 4070ti struggles on ultra)- Controls are clunky at times. Not the worst console port in that regard though.- Some QoL issues and gripes.- Underutilised house quarters, perhaps there could be a tiny bit more interaction with the world (eat, sleep, wait, maybe minigames)- Underwhelming gear and loot, feels pretty much as Cyberpunk 2077, you just swap out gear for the highest number one and toss the rest. (huge missed opportunity there)Overall the game is a 9/10 for me, truly next-gen and a labour of love. Also for a huge open world RPG it is relatively bug-free too. Performance is bad, but there is DLSS and graphics can be toned down. I am willing to look past that though, because the game does live up to the hype!"

The story begins on your way to your first day at school and the sorting hat ceremony. The wizarding world is in a threat of a powerful Goblin, Ranrok.

Voice acting is another piece that will make you drown in this magical world. Though, not recommended to move your voice tone from default, otherwise that might sound a bit ""robotic"".That's exactly what every fan has been dreaming about. Learn unique spells and combain them so you can beat every single enemy as they have it's unique strategy to defeat. Fly on the broom or mistic creatures from the universe. Customize your character the way you see it and your point skills the way you want.Is it a masterpiece? Yes, it is.

Simply put, the Harry Potter novels are accessible to the understanding of most people, have a mass sign, however, unlike many one-day books, they have a deep foundation of myths and fairy tales, closely intertwined with the real situation of the developing World (although these political, social and other aspects will be more accessible to adult readers than to younger fans of the book series)./, лишь написала роман о юном волшебнике по имени Гарри Поттере, но в настоящее время это выросло в размерах и является одним из самых узнаваемых и окупаемых брэндов Мира.Секрет романов о Гарри Поттере скрыт в сердце каждого из читателей, от мала до велика, – это симбиоз воображения и логики, страсти к приключениям и романтизации окружающего, узнавание реализма и сопоставление его персонажей с самим собой. Проще говоря, романы о Гарри Поттере доступны пониманию большинства людей, имеет массовый признак, однако, в отличие от многих книг-однодневок, имеет под собой глубинный фундамент мифов и сказок, тесно переплетающийся с реальной обстановкой развивающегося Мира (правда, эти политические, социальные и прочие аспекты будут более доступны взрослым читателям, нежели младшим поклонникам серии книг). is an immersive fantasy RPG set in a beautiful open world with stunning scenery, charismatic and memorable characters, a fantastic combat system and tons of mechanics. This game is not only for fans of the Harry Potter universe, but simply a wonderful game in itself. Avalanche Software did something really special with Hogwarts Legacy, and it justifies the hype. At the very least, it sets a solid foundation for future Magic world games. And we can safely say that this is the best thing that has happened in the franchise since the original books and movies./ — это захватывающая фэнтезийная RPG в красивом открытом мире с потрясающими пейзажами, харизматичными и запоминающимися персонажами, а также фантастической боевой системой и целой массой механик. Это игра не только для поклонников вселенной Гарри Поттера, но и попросту замечательная игра сама по себе. Avalanche Software сделала нечто действительно особенное с Hogwarts Legacy, и это оправдывает возникший ажиотаж. Она как минимум создает прочную основу для будущих игр в Волшебном мире. И мы можем с уверенностью сказать, что это лучшее, что было во франшизе со времен оригинальных книг и фильмов."

At launch its a bit rough around the edges but the game definitely has potential of being the best game no doubt for the franchise. Fans should be excited for this cause even being a non-fan, I can enjoy the world, its got the charm of the movies in them, a bit too PG-friendly dialogue for my taste but its not so subdued of violence that it gets boring.Combat is comparable to Batman Arkham games, some depth but easy to master.The games world is pretty huge, the Hogwarts Castle is MASSIVE, and it'd not shock me if the game operated like CDPR's Witcher series where expansions or content drops can expand the areas or world to explore more areas once more development happens.People who Spite-Bought this to help the devs or who got it to simply counter the more obnoxious individuals who exist in society will have the ability to actually play and enjoy the game rather than let it sit there unplayed. Lots of things to do and to explore.I hope the games success will make the developers able to make more games of this quality and improve further and give us even better games down the road that's different from their typical/average releases (As wikipedia would show what they were doing before this game).Troll the insufferable and insecure cyber-bullies to your hearts content."

K. Rowling, it might be not your cup of tea.The story is either not very lush, but then there is Sebastians side quest. ^^What this game does pretty well is giving an immersive open-world with a beautiful atmosphere.The performance has some issues here and there, but at least I had no single crash yet within 99 hrs of play.Currently brooming around with my second char, who is a girl in Slytherin (the guy before was a Ravenclaw).And despite of knowing the formula from previous WB Games as written above, their beautifully crafted worlds often motivates me to get out the most of these games.As it is with this one! :D"

Welcome to my review of Hogwarts Legacy.Alot of real life people arguing about this game and causing a big mess. In my opinion, if you want to just play the game and ignore the real life jank, then do it. You do not need to follow what everyone else says, do your own thing. Now that i got out of the way, let me talk about this game. The game revolves around the world of Harry Potter and the Wizarding World. Harry Potter is not in this game, but it is in the same place he attended wizard school in the movies. The game takes place in the past around the 1800's, the turn of the century. Alot of things in harry potter movies are somewhat different in this game. Also, you can explore various locations around the wizarding world, including scotland and hogsmeade. Many of the spells from the movies are also in the game, and you can learn them throught the year. The game itself is pretty open ended and you can even explore and put the main quests on hold until later. Be aware that some places will not be accessible until you learn certain spells. This will block where and how far you can explore. The season also changes the further you go into the story.The game is also open world, like a ubisoft title game. There are also collectibles hidden around the world you can find. These will take some time to find if you plan on trying to find them. The game is not perfect. It does have some bugs in it, and the developers are currently fixing it still at this point. This means it could improve from what it is right now. Anyways, the following is my PRO/CON list:PROS:- A open world game in the wizard world of harry potter. If your a fan of the movies, you may want to play this game.- Collectibles around a open world.- Side quests.- Ability to learn new spells thought the year.- The first game in more than 10 years where it is linked to the wizarding world.- Easter eggs in the game that link them to the harry potter movies, including a quiz by a npc.CONS:- There are some bugs that can mess with collecting items in the game. It can cause errors on the map in the game. I experirenced a issue where it showed a field page i collected, but never disappeared off the map.- Repetition of the game is a big problem. If you do not want to do it, take a break and then come back to play it some other time.- The open world seems too open at some points and wish to have more things to do in it.- Many places you explore look similiar, especially the treasure vaults.- Some people are complaining about stutters or other issues, but i hardly had any and im on a 3060 graphics card. Make sure to set benchmark in the game to get graphic settings correctly.Do i recommend the game? Yes, because the last harry potter game i played was lego harry potter series on ps2, and really missed the games. In the end, it is whether you have fun with the game if your a fan of the movies or not."

What a fantastic game! It's so nice to see a huge open-world banger of this scale launch so well, for once... (at least from my experience, so far!) ... As someone who grew up with Harry Potter, watched all the movies a few dozen times each and read all the books in 2 different languages, I get goosebumps every time I launch the game! :')I feel like Hogwarts Legacy is a nice open-world experience. The open-world interactivity is quite surprising, really. There are a lot of much bigger budget AAA titles out there (looking at you, Cyberpunk 2077, my old friend!) that would really benefit from the Hogwarts Legacy open-world treatment, where random items can be interacted with, which play their own unique set of animations, such as picking up food / drink from stalls and consuming them, brewing potions in real time, etc... those classic, 'old-school' immersive sim elements that seem to be dying more and more with each new AAA release where quantity is favoured over quality.Hogwarts Legacy is also a game I like to 'taste' ... to take in really slow. After 50 hours, only now did I receive my broom stick. Most people would have received their broom in the first 10 hours or so... The game has finally opened up in all its glory, to me. It feels like the fun has only just begun. As I am a completionist, I see a good 200 hours of gameplay per playthrough. Currently, I'm a Gryffindor according to the online Wizarding World Quiz!The combat slaps, too! xD It's quite addicting, it works so well, and the different combos that can be pulled off by mixing and matching spells feel super rewarding. The game might be aimed at 12+ , but it actually has a pretty complex, deep and rhythmic system if you don't spam the same buttons all the time!"

About 25-30 hours of main story, which goes by quickly. I'm not impressed by the graphics whatsoever, and I still suffer a lot with lag spikes and glitches, even tho I have a decent computer. Detailed Review: The main story gets sorta boring quite quick, it's a lot of ""get this for me"" or ""speak with"" quests. Feels a lot like filler, rather than actual main stuff. Getting side quests and main story mixed up, is really easy. Combat is fun in the beginning, but as time goes, it gets monotonous, and it's about 60% of the game. The finale boss battle is probably the best one, yet unbelievable tedious. Dialog and cutscenes take up A LOT of the game, which isn't an issue for me normally, but it drags out in Hogwarts Legacy. You can't really pick up any quests without having to go through 1-5 minutes dialog or a cutscenes of sorts. Which also counts for the side quests, or the many extra things to do, such as the Merlin Challenges. Something I really enjoy is spending time with magical beasts, it's dull, but enjoyable and generally working on the Room of Requirement, is really relaxing - once you've collected everything. Colleting can be a big part of the game, It's not necessary whatsoever, but it's a good break from questions. If you're expecting some connections between Harry Potter and Hogwarts Legacy, dont buy the game. There's a few similarities and Easter eggs, but not nearly enough for buying it. And no, theres no option of any ""romance"" in the game. None. So don't buy it for that either. My biggest ""issue"" with the game is, how bad it is to play on PC. Even after a few updates and patches, I'm still suffering with a lot of lag spikes, map glitches and delayed gameplay. I have a pretty solid gaming computer, that runs most games. Not Hogwarts Legacy tho, not even on low or medium settings."

Firstly, it is absolutely gorgeous and is filled with a myriad of tiny little details that make up the whole atmosphere of the world. There are these amazing gargoyles that always say the funniest stuff as you dash past them, or suits of armor with their quirks (don't want to say more, because it's fun to discover all of these on your own). Apart from stunning views, the clothes look really well-made, the textures are great on anything (apart from maybe faces).The gameplay is A LOT OF fun. Whether it is puzzles, mini games or combat, it all feels smooth, polishes and a lot of fun, just like it should be. I have only encountered one bug, when the game crashed, but other than that, nothing game-breaking.

The game is incredibly beautiful and has brought every page of the books to life. It is both imaginative and creative and has been so very well done that I have been pretty much awestruck each time I've entered a new room. From the 'Kings Cross' to the cherry blossom in the greenroom observatory, you're taken on a journey that I truly don't want to end. Although the castle has been one of the highlights of this game, it's important to note that there is SO MUCH more to it.The map itself is huge and comes with a lot of detail and challenges. There are a lot of side quests, and its a game you really do need to grind to get anywhere. There's a good mix of enemies and it puts your skill to the test. I like that you contribute to your combat inventory rather than buying items at shops - i.e. the mixing and making of potions. I also like that each store is different, so you're not guaranteed the items you need, forcing you to explore the map a bit more.The game-play itself is fantastic. It is easily adaptable for anyone wanting to start playing but is not used to this style of game and has a fairly simple structure that can be learned quickly. If I could compare the mechanics and interface of this game, I'd say it comes pretty close to God of War for me (don't come for me about this because I do not care).Basically, if you've played God of War, you'll have a good understanding of the inventory, skills, and other features of this game and its layout because they feel similar, making it easier and more appealing. I would even say that smaller collectibles challenges also have a small resemblance to GoW (think the 10 mask artifacts, nornir chests, etc), but it feels subtle enough that I'm possibly one of the few people who feel this way.The customisation of characters is decent but please do not play it expecting to have an exact replica of yourself. This is not Sims. There is a good range of skin-tones, faces, and colours to choose from for hair/eyes, though it's not as important as you'd think as most of the game is spent looking at the back of your own head unless in a cut scene.So far the storyline is great and not what I expected which is even better. I am currently spending more of my time exploring and collecting as I am a treasure goblin that needs to collect things before I move on, however, so far it has been nothing short of great. I love that you can walk around freely, and that you can skip conversations, both great features. The music score is also really well done. I enjoy the idle exploration music which can bounce between sonatas, adding to the ambience.I have had a couple of issues with FPS drops, but overall it's not too bad and it doesn't last long, usually a couple seconds here and there. My specs are: AMD Ryzen 5 5600x 6-Core, 32GB, RTX 3070.Overall, if you're sitting on the fence about getting this game, I'd highly recommend you do. A lot of the time, hype trains do not live up to their expectation, but this has exceeded mine.10/10UPDATE: I have now clocked the game and have gotten all Steam achievements. For anyone who is grinding, it's a good challenge - difficult, but not overly hard, and the map indicates where you're missing things which is incredibly helpful. I enjoyed the little missions and the different places the game took me to, I especially liked seeing all of the common rooms. Without a DOUBT, Slytherin stays on top.Again, 200% recommend. I will be doing a second full play through as a male character - I have to admit, the female characters got done dirty, so I will only play as a male for the rest of my games, they look way better in outfits (and that's all I really ever grind for - outfits and trinkets).Enjoy the game!"

Awesome hair, too!""Hogwarts Legacy offers players the opportunity to jump into the magical world of Harry Potter and create the perfect witch, or wizard, of their dreams with a decent set of curated presets, a good selection of character customization options, fitting styles suited to the wand slinging you are no doubt going to do, and honestly some of the best hair I have seen in a video game to date. While you don't get direct control over the sculpting of the features of your characters face, or body, the game offers enough choices to allow for some pretty unique and interesting characters regardless. The skin colors also don't, for some reason, offer very many lighter or paler options... although this may just be a trick of the lighting in character creation. The detail of the character model, and I assume the rest of the game as well, is also quite impressive and the visuals are an absolute treat. The character creation system does funnel you into a specific style which I believe makes total sense given both the world you are jumping into and the role you are assuming in the story being told. As for the specifics there are, as mentioned, a lot of great presets to pick from, both male and female body types, face shapes, skin color choices, a few starter pieces of eyewear, a massive selection of hair styles, textures, and colors that look absolutely fantastic, no facial hair (which kind of makes sense), some complexion and skin options, eye and eyebrow customization, and finally two voices with control of their pitch. (The pitch doesn't really work all that well as of right now) You also get to pick whether you are adressed as a witch or a wizard.That's it! Overall I am quite impressed by the lot of it and had a blast going through all the options. You can find my full character creation video linked below for my reactions and all the rest. Remember to use the timestamps to jump to what you want to see. Enjoy!"

I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!Here are the ingredients you will need!Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce."

I do not hate HL. It was fine. But the review says ""Do you recommend this game?"" and to that I say no. The game is a Harry Potter fans wet dream. Obviously... But to someone like me who was just a casual fan of HP, it isn't all that great.I went in with the hope of a good RPG experience. Which it delivers in some aspects. I'll organize this in a what they did well vs wrong for simplicity sake.What is done well-------------------* Graphics - Visually stunning with my high end PC. * Story - Engaging and well driven. Enough said...* Full - The open world is not barren. There is stuff everywhere. And there is detail within the detail* The characters - Voice, emotion, animation, etc. It is all there. And it is done well.What is done wrong-------------------* The wallhax scanning thingy - I am somewhat of a collector when I play games so having this game full of them started out as a nice thing. Unfortunately it became a nightmare when I would have to span revelio ever 10 seconds because the bell noise got louder and then randomly quieter. It was like I was being constantly gaslit by picture on the wall that doesn't even look special at all. It became a tedious process of going to a new room and spamming scan until I found every collectible in the room. Then move to the next room and do the same. Horrible.* Broom mechanics - As a general rule of thumb I play all 3rd person games with a controller. So keep that in mind. I did not test on kbm. Having altitude control bound to the same stick that controls the camera is literal hell. Just map a face button to ascend and descend. Other games do this so much better it's insane.* Factions - What house will you pick? Well it doesn't matter. Aside from certain clothing items changing colors it really does not do much. You get a different location where your commons are. That is it. HUGE loss on replay-ability and HUGE loss on weight of the choice.* PvE variety - Not many types of fantasy enemies in my fantasy game. * Combat - I have seen other reviews compare the combat similar to the Arkham games. I see the comparison. But If I had to choose who does it better I would 9 times out of 10 choose Arkham. Spells are cool and combing them can sometimes be cool but it just gets old fast. Like imagine playing Elden Ring and the first weapon you get is RoB and just use that through the whole game. Don't let me yuck your yum tho. It you liked it, great! I just didn't.* 1st world problem - I played it on a 49in ultra-wide. If you have one. You know what I am about to say. The menu system has everything spread out and it takes an eternity to move the cursor around to equip stuff. Again if you know, you know. I almost considered just using my mouse in menu to speed things up. I am by no means expecting devs to cater to an audience of like 2 percent. But the ability to turn up the speed of the cursor would have been nice (if there is one, I could not find it)* Loot - The Destiny style loot system where your loot is based off of your armor at the time of opening has its critics and its fans. I am sure you can gauge where I stand based on where this part of the review is. I am sure I missed some good and bad but here is what I got. For the 2 people that did not buy the game on release, this should be a good metric to gauge on. If you are here for HP lore and stunning detail then pop off. But if you wanted a good RPG experience then you may have to look elsewhere. To anyone thinking this is some kind of review bomb, I hope you get help. Please read the full review b4 making your mind up on which political side I am taking."

The open world is pretty large and absolutely beautiful. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series, you will most likely enjoy the game. The music and sound effects are very much like the movies and are one more step to making you think you're not in a video game. The combat, though not the flashiest, feels extremely fluid and satisfying. Side quests are actually fun and meaningful, just like in Red Dead Redemption 2. Exploration is extremely fun, and you are always coming across something new to explore and investigate. Although the NPCs are a bit dull in this game, unlike RDR2, I still highly recommend playing it."

The gameplay's smooth and satisfying, story's quite interesting but first and foremost the world is full of puzzles, collectables and I keep on getting mind blown by its sheer vastness and detail.

Your choices impact nothing in the story or the characters, you will just get some different dialogue and also there aren't different builds in the game so this means that replayability is basically non-existent. A lot of assets are not done in the same style which makes some things feel disjointed. Its almost like they didnt have much of an art direction and each artist did as they pleased. The character creator has barely any options and its mainly presets. It is also unoptimised with a lot of stuttering and FPS drops and there are loading screens basically everywhere and asset pop-in even when installed on an NVMe SSD. There are some bugs as well, more noticeably voice pitch changes sound like a robot.There are some good things like the music and character design. Every NPC is voice acted with some fairly decent actors. The lightning and atmosphere is done really well and also its just really cool to move around the wizarding world and see such a large part of it.Overall I'm fairly disappointed. It could have been so much more than what we actually got and I feel like if another studio developed the game it would have been so much better. But it is a step in the right direction and hopefully we will get more games like this which get increasingly better by each release. If I were to give it a rating I would say its about 6.5/10."

If Denuvo is removed and the PS-exclusive quest is added, then I'll flip this review.The game is a solid, well-deserved 7/10, but it had the potential to be a 9/10 or better. Some of its faults are definitely moddable away, we'll see what the community cooks up.Let's start with the good things. As a Hogwarts simulator, it's the best we've ever seen. Pretty much everything is  recreated in great detail, you can  open pretty much  every door, look around everywhere , and the game world  is so large it could've been  half the size and literally nobody  would've complained. It's massive. It does have some omissions though. Wizard currency is only talked about. Your money is just ""gold"" (a few lines of dialog accidentally refer to it as galleons but most of it calls it ""gold"", and if that was indeed galleons everything would be insanely expensive at 1800s prices).You can't sit anywhere but the ground, or sleep in your bed (sounds minor but over time it starts to feel weird). Teachers don't give ""X points to [house]"", but ""points to [house]"" (other than a cutscene or two). These are meaningless, I went to check my house's points and our hourglass had a grand total of 0 gems in its lower compartment after I won those points. It was easy to count.You can't IMAGINE how inconvenient travel was before Ignatia Wildsmith invented Floo powder!There are a few continuity errors: seventh-years' future OWL results are mentioned when it should be NEWTs, that kind of stuff. Nothing major.There is no Quidditch. Fair enough, that would've been a huge development undertaking, and the game already has issues with dev time allocation/budgeting. There is an explanation in-game as to why, and it makes sense in the game world.The game's faults are broadly in two categories: technical issues, and the writing/execution of the main story.The game still has Denuvo despite it having been defeated. To absolutely no one's surprise, most of the performance issues with this game are on the CPU side, even on ""Low"" settings. I had to manually reactivate through their website 4 times (I started counting after the third) because it wouldn't do it automatically. Feels nice to be a valued customer. Guess what kind of players do not have this issue at all.Graphics are... weird. You can see the ground loading in front of you in small tiles for 10+ seconds, even on a monster PC. Regardless of your settings, even on RT Ultra, there are some weird screen-space shadows (not ambient occlusion) that disappear as you rotate the camera or NPCs walk in front of them. Regardless of your settings, lakes will use screen-space reflection with the laughably bad reflections that entails, especially if you fly over them. Regardless of your settings (I'm noticing a pattern here), reflections stop working near the edge of the screen. If you turn RT off, a lot of reflections stop working entirely. Mirrors turn into blackboards. This is not exactly a groundbreaking problem, games a decade or more ago could solve this. This game was made with Unreal Engine 4, the tech is there for multiple different kinds of non-raytraced reflections.The game ships with an outdated version of DLSS that you can easily swap and get better results. The player shouldn't need to do this.There's a crazy amount of fog, beyond ""we get it, it's Scotland"". We're talking PS1 Silent Hill levels of fog, and very often. Get a fog removal mod.Consider disabling about half of the HUD elements as well, for better immersion.Binding spells to buttons is BAD. What's even worse is that to make it slightly less bad is locked behind TALENT POINTS. Most talents improve your spells directly in the game world, but some of them only serve to make controls less horrible. Your character does not gain any power, you just get to pause less often to rebind your spell slots. You could suffer through full manual rebinds, save all those talent points, and your character would not be an iota less powerful, only you more annoyed.Broom controls scream lazy-remapped-controller-port. There's an entire vertical axis on your mouse that's not used, and it would solve nearly everything with it.On Hard, around level 30 or so, enemies become HP sponges. It's not any harder to defeat them, just pure tedium. You can (and should) make it faster by using plants and potions, but this gives you another form of tedium as you have to replenish them (which is on half-to-1 minute timers).The true final boss is the camera controls and a target lock bug. Your character moves differently when there's a target locked, but even if you have unlocked it, sometimes it only frees the camera but not movement. I have died multiple times to this alone. Unbind that button entirely (it's Caps Lock by default) to avoid this. You don't need target locks, even on Hard.Items are MMO-like random drops. This makes zero sense in a single-player game. I went through the entire story without the default school uniform skin dropping that everybody else is wearing, and I was frequently checking the clothes shop to see if it was selling an item with that skin regardless of stats.And now for the elephant in the room. The main story and the writing. Where do I even begin...It's as if a different team made the main story. The world has such an enormous level of care and detail in it that you would completely understand if the devs had to cut some corners, but they barely did.The main story is the opposite.The writing goes out of its way to save voice lines and not even acknowledge choices that you made. Not the basic ones, not the Earth-shattering monumental ones. Mass Effect 3 would be proud of the extent of choice-cancellation, if it was done through good writing. It wasn't.Your character is 100% unisex. Disagree to do something, you'll discuss the specifics of doing it within 7 seconds anyway. There are some actual cringe scenes where someone that you're supposedly on good terms with only talks about you in the most generic, distant terms .The only choice that seems to be acknowledged is .  Unforgivable curses? This is really unexpected, given the enormous amount of voice acting that went into random NPCs talking or random events playing out that are only there for world-building and you might even miss. There are conversations between students that you can simply walk past and ignore, that are way longer and better-written than what you get as the hero. Hell, NPCs have things to say if your character is wearing PJs!Many quests don't handle the objective being complete already. Have you done the thing that I want? Sorry, I still have to tell you these two lines about my now non-existent problem before I can get surprised that you took care of it right after.I can't shake the feeling that two different teams were involved here. This is a AAA game, the devs should've had the budget for a few dozen extra voice lines on top of the insane amount that's already present in the game, especially considering the size of the map that goes above and beyond what anyone would've expected. Games more than a decade ago could pull this off, and with full voice acting. We could've sacrificed a copy-paste Ubisoft open world village or two for this.Bonus: there's a PlayStation-exclusive quest. Screw that. Buy the game once it's been added to PC."

Nicely created characters and you can fully customise your own. The game guides you quite a bit and linear at the start, but I guess that's to make it easier for younger players. You can choose your house in Hogwarts Legacy through a Sorting Hat quiz or manually pick (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff), which could lead to replay value and different experiences per house."

You also don't need any prior knowledge of the Harry Potter universe before starting the game. It can be enjoyed by anyone.There's a massive amount of content here. Tons of quests, people to talk to, areas to explore and things to collect. All beautifully presented both as a narrative and graphically. The game obviously borrows a lot from other games in the open world genre, but also introduces many new mechanics - all of them working exceptionally well.Personally, I've experienced a few technical issues, but tweaking the settings largely eliminated most of them. The option menu is great and gives you a lot of liberty, but your experience might differ.It's also becoming increasingly rare to play a game without any form of microtransactions, which makes it ironic that the game is published by Warner Brothers - one of the absolute worst offenders. Avalanche Software seem to have gotten complete creative control with this one however, and they've done a tremendous job.2023 already have some heavy hitters released, and I'm pretty sure Hogwarts Legacy will be fondly remembered for years to come."

It's not a game i'd recommend, even if you are a Harry Potter Fiend, though i can imagine HP fans will enjoy the game much more than most.Almost every mechanic in the game is executed in the most basic, functional form; no attempt is made to innovate, improve, or even make it unique to this game. If you have played any other games in the past 10 years, you have almost certainly experienced every mechanic this game has to offer, and likely a better executed version.In essence, entirely ignoring all of the controversy surrounding this game it is frankly not worth your time nor money; it has nothing to offer. Those speaking highly of its acclaim are either blinded by their love of the setting, or supporting it due to its controversial nature.Speaking with the controversy in mind the game should absolutely be avoided."

424,43,Bryan Adams,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WoCunt/,8,,1,85.8,Posted: March 1,57,0,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/2fd87be47ef9f48bff783dfa32c9a1f9f58e5104.jpg,"Unlike a lot of other people, I had absolutely no expectations for this game. Actually, that's not entirely true, I had 1 expectation which was that I wasn't going to play Hogwarts Legacy. And no, I didn't hold that expectation because I couldn't bear the thought of playing a game loosely based on the works of a bigot, it was due to the simple unavoidable fact that I do not care about Harry Potter. Despite watching every single 1 of the I don't know, 5? or so movies and reading half a book, I never truly got it. It's just a wee lad magicking around, presumably in his imagination as he needs to escape the hellscape of his living situation under his uncle's stairs. Add to this the LEGO Harry Potter games not being anywhere near as good (IN MY OPINION) as the excellent Star Wars and Indiana Jones games, I was left in no way hyped for this game, and yes I know this isn't a LEGO game, which honestly minus points. After apparently entering some sort of trance and adding this game to my wishlist and then watching a friend play through some of the early sections I decided to buy it. After owning the game for only 12 days, I already have over 60 hours and 100% of the achievements. You really wouldn't think I have a full time job. I know J.K Rowling is getting a lot of hate lately and rightfully so but thank ♥♥♥♥ she decided that Hogwarts would be in Scotland. This game really wouldn't be the same if it were in England, granted some areas of the country could be made to look pretty great, the world we get to explore throughout this game is truly spectacular and incredibly well designed. Also, having gone to school in England I know first hand that the character who's eyes we experience this game through would actually just have been bullied the entirety of their first year after joining school late. Actually, that would probably happen in Scotland as well, going to have to mark that down as a severe inaccuracy within this game. Why are all the students so nice to someone who shows up a few years late to school and generally just nails everything? Every time I wake up in the dorm room, I am expecting another black eye or maybe a lewd drawing on my forehead, but no.After reading through the list of achievements, I expected I would need to complain about needing to reach the map room on all 4 houses, however as this only added an extra 3 hours of gametime, I didn't mind doing it, plus I got to do more Herbology lessons. Whilst on the topic of achievements, although I have no qualms with replaying the early levels, I really wish I didn't have to live through all of the Merlin Trials. Not because I found them too difficult, but due to the gall of Merlin forcing me to sit through 95 unskippable cutscenes. What a prick that man was, and truth be told I'm glad he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dead. Even when I am stood on top of the centre of his little leaf outline, I do not appear in the cutscene, how self-important do you have to be? The world doesn't revolve around you Merlin, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless pile of bones, it revolves around the sun, maybe if you spent more time learning science instead of being a ♥♥♥♥ you might have been able to notice that no one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ likes you. At least I am only forced to see him being made out of leaves, because if I had to see his presumably hideous face NINETY FIVE times, I probably wouldn't have completed the game without prying out my eyes. Seriously, this guy makes me want an entire 9 hour storyline about the adventures of Peeves and Ignatia Wildsmith. That would be infinitely more enjoyable than hearing ""Not so tricky after all, Merlin"" one more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time.I don't know if it was hidden within the digital deluxe version that I didn't pay for or maybe it is in an upcoming DLC, but I couldn't seem to find Dogwarts. Did this get cut or I just missed it? I thought it would be in the room of requirement but alas, 'twas only Deek and that would ruin my immersion.The lack of quidditch didn't really phase me too much, because again, I don't care about Harry Potter.  Besides, the story and various side quests give you enough of an opportunity to become the best student at just about everything else so adding another thing to the list of activities the playable character naturally excels at would probably be overkill. I mean, you already get to beat Professor Ronen at Summoner's Court so there's not really a higher peak in that regard. The guy is practically a god, and I wholeheartedly believe that he let me win that game just to boost my pride. Obviously I am not saying that Ronen is truly some omnipotent being, I just mean he is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cracked at grabbing balls from across a big plank while in competition with children.The story reminded me of the Mark Twain novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which for the uneducated is a fantastic read, and the subject of a wonderful 1949 film starring Bing Crosby. Now I'm not saying that the writers of this game copied from this book in any way, but their decision to make Merlin the primary villain of the game is a tad suspicious and should really be investigated as to where they came up with that idea. My word is Merlin a colossal waste of space. I hope he is not resting in peace but instead burning in hell like the evil piece of ♥♥♥♥ he is. I cannot stress this enough, NINETY FIVE UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES. It really puts Ranrok's crimes into perspective, I mean, what did the guy even do? Want a little bit more power so he could presumably enslave humanity? Big deal, were the machines truly the enemy in The Matrix Resurrections or was it the mere existence of the movie? At least I could skip that by never watching it, which isn't an option when it comes to Merlin's moon-sized ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ego. I cannot believe when seeing the first Merlin trial completion I thought ""huh, that was pretty cool"" because after Merlin trial number 72 I was ready to shoot the ♥♥♥♥ like he shot Hank Martin in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.That prick aside, the characters in this game are very well written as well as the interactions the playable character has with each of them. It is a shame that at times you are forced into more linear storytelling as early on you can keep your experience with Fig a secret. Later in the game the character just blurts out to everyone that will listen that they can see and use ancient magic which completely negates the option of hiding this information from people in the first place. What if I don't want to trust everyone in Hogwarts?Now onto one of the best aspects of this game, and no I am not referring to Professor Garlick, but of course the music beautifully composed by Chuck E. Myers, Peter Murray and J Scott Rakozy. You don't really need to know that they were influenced by the work of John Williams, because of course they were, he's the best. Just kidding, of course I'm talking about Professor Garlick. It really is a shame that this game isn't more like Bully with you regularly attending classes to improve your grades, but instead you attend probably under 10 classes in total with a handful of additional assignments. I think it would add to the enjoyment of the game to feature more time in the classroom but primarily because it would mean attending more Herbology classes and as a result getting more time with Professor Garlick. I don't think I really need to go into detail as to why getting to spend more time in that classroom would be a bonus. If the sequel to this game isn't the story of you playing the replacement for Professor Fig, and you get to spend the entire game attempting to seduce Professor Garlick, I will be severely disappointed. There are already far too many stories in the Wizarding World focusing on kids.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, almost as much as I enjoyed writing this review and would have to place it firmly in my top 7 games on Steam. But seriously, ♥♥♥♥ Merlin and everything he stood for."

And era-appropriate entertainment it sure is.Hogwarts Legacy is a flavorless, unimmersive ESG hugbox wrapped in a Ubisoft carrot-dangling open world time-waster.The story and plot are beyond generic, the writing is dull and horribly underedited and you won't remember most of the cast in a week.The game's world is peppered all throughout with cynical corporate box-checking inclusivity, making this version of the 19th century Scotland demonstrate the kind of demographics even modern day Los Angeles can't boast.There's no curfew, no timetable-management, no mini-games or interesting activities. There are no real friendships or relationships outside of the dull main quest. Hogwarts students don't feel attraction or repulsion towards each other, they don't do anything and have no goals. What little depth they bothered to add to the rare side characters is all but negligible.The Houses -- seemingly one of the main themes of the entire franchise -- do nothing but determine the colors of your robes. There are no rivalries, no factions, no infighting, the House points mean nothing. The whole thing is all but discarded.Nothing you do or say matters, you can slam into an obstacle on a broom and nothing will happen, the loot is mind-numbingly boring and pointless. Learning the unforgivable curses, the inclusion of which is spoiled in advance by the overbearing UI, warrants no reaction from the Wizarding world. The combat bears no challenge, the time of day can be changed with the press of one button and most of the game, once again, is spent brainlessly following what the UI tells you to do rather than, you know, PLAYING it.Hogwarts Legacy is filled to the brim with signs of how little effort went into its open world, with extras spawning in and despawning as you rotate the camera, people floating in mid-air, people simply disappearing every night, none of the NPCs reacting to anything you do and all the other stuff that would be endlessly ridiculed all over the internet if it were any other franchise, but I guess it's okay when it's 'Arry Pottah."

This game does a fantastic job of depicting Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and a solid job with its combat and execution of the story, but falls short in other areas.I spent hours walking around the castle, looking at all the finer details and failing to uncover all its mysteries and puzzles. It is a beautiful masterpiece worth touring in its own right. I also spent time visiting all the shops in Hogsmeade and enjoying the spectacle. Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are the main strengths of this game world, with the rest of the world being no different than anything you might find in another open-world game. Once you leave these two areas, things get bland fast.It's a good, solid game but after beating the main story I am not motivated to continue, and I certainly have no interest in replaying from scratch. The gameplay is a bit shallow and there isn't a reason to dig deep into the systems. But it can still be fun for a bit."

No matter what you buy, you are supporting some sort of unethical practice. So by their own logic, these people shouldn't buy anything at all. In the end, they are just hypocrites who like to hold others to impossibly high ethical standards that they themselves don't follow. I find it even weirder that people are willing to tear down a game that has nothing to do with JK except that they're using her famous IP... something many companies have done over the last decade or so. Why so willing to f*ck over the game devs just because of the IP they're using? JK has no hand in the game whatsoever and is barely getting royalties from it, only because it's her IP/Brand. If she had a hand in the game, then that would be more understandable, but that's not the case. This is the equivalent to showing up to a birthday party and calling everyone at the party a bigot just because the party is Harry Potter themed. Now that.. well, all that is out of the way. I absolutely love this game with every fiber of my being - it's everything I hoped it would be and more. The world is vast and the castle alone feels huge, I can't even count the amount of times I'd get distracted just simply exploring the castle and being in absolute awe by the design of it all. I love the way they've handled collecting items and solving puzzles, the collectibles aren't just a simple go here and find this, they can be behind puzzles and encourage exploration, which I've gladly enjoyed doing. Combat may seem simplistic compared to other modern games but hey, I found it to be pretty enjoyable and I have yet to tire of it. The game allows for a level of customization I honestly didn't expect but I appreciate all the same. Your Hogwarts house determines what unique area of the castle you live in, you can transmogrify your gear with a good amount of options you collect and you have a personal space to customize and decorate!Everything feels smooth and honestly it plays pretty well, I will say there have been a lot of lighting bugs here and there, I'd enter a bright, beautiful room only for it to feel like someone turned the sun off. It is a MASSIVE game, the general main story takes 20-30 hours to complete and that isn't counting collectibles or side quests, so many collectibles, I've been playing for 11 hours now and I have yet to unlock my broom LOL. The whole world feels alive, ghosts flying around, students having conversations, everything around you is doing something. It's been a while since I've played something that felt so fleshed out. I could sing praises on this game all day long but all in all I wholeheartedly recommend, whether you're a huge HP fan or simply an RPG fan, chef kisses all around."

My review is not about Rowling's political takes or any controversy, but about the state of the gameplay experience.10/10So, let me talk about the game. It is incredible. I am not, and never have been, a fan of the Harry Potter series. This is not for any reason in particular, I was always just too busy obsessing over Tolkien's universe as a kid. Every time I tried to get into the books I failed to do so and went to another series. This does not mean I can deny the sheer brilliance of the world-building and comfort it provided many other children, however. This is now a comfort I know myself.This game has made me love Hogwarts. it has gotten me into something I always thought I hated. I have given it the true chance I never gave the books (but now will). It makes me feel so free and so cozy. I have never experienced a more immersive game in which I play as a witch and utilise magic so wonderfully. The school is warm and welcoming, the characters are well-designed and voiced, and the creatures are all so unique. I am immediately immersed as I open the game and load into the school.From class ""assignments"" to serious story quests, there is always something to do in terms of tasks. Outside from this, I find myself spending time flying around on my broom for no reason other than I love the way it feels, or exploring the Forbidden Forest just to see how lively and beautiful the world is. Jumping mushrooms, singing flowers, and rolling birds. I have never before experienced such a magical game. Sometimes, it makes me feel like a witch as intended. Other times, I escape the school grounds for a while and feel like a fairy.The school itself is also so whimsical, from speaking portraits to poltergeists and ghosts that feel as though they are just like any other people (or at worst, annoying) rather than frightening. As someone dipping into Rowling's universe for the first time really, I am blown away by just how comforting everything is even when taking elements that are otherwise portrayed as ""scary"" or negative. The game takes elements from some of my favourite genres, too, allowing you to do so many things. These include botany, potion-brewing, and DECORATING A HUGE SPACE! I spent ages playing with furniture, colours, and wallpapers last night after unlocking my unique room. Seriously, I keep discovering more and MORE to do in the game. I see myself spending hundreds of hours in it.As for soundtrack, it is as beautiful as the scenery. The writing is, too. Everything is. In terms of inclusion, it marks every box. I am a woman who is attracted to the same sex and running into Nora Treadwell was absolutely heart-warming. An older lesbian couple who is passionate about archaeology and history?! Precious...Please play this game. Please do not let the opinions of chronic Internet dwellers take this magical experience away from you by convincing you that somehow your purchase funds any sort of bigotry. And if you are those people, touch grass. I have already had multiple people block me on this platform just for playing the game. It is utterly ridiculous how such a wholesome experience is being twisted into something so sinister when it should not be."

My personal favorite part is the care of the magical creatures, but the dueling is great fun as well. Other things that I considered notable fun, Herbology, Potions, and decorating and customizing your very own Room of Requirement with Deek the House Elf. The games graphics look amazing and overall the locations you get to visit are amazing.  83 Floo Flames (Fast Travel) locations really help a character get around, so make sure you get every one! The game has a fair amount of redundancy within the game itself, with the main quests and side quests which can kind get super grindy for lack of better word. The game has 13 main quests (and this is depending on you view of things in my opinion), and roughly 57 side quests to be completed is you are wanting to get the ALL achievements (45 total achievements,at the time of the writing of this review seems to be bugged, more on this in my review). All of the main and side quests are required to complete the story mode of the game to get the achievement which gets a little old and somewhat frustrating. Other sources of frustration and further grinding can found in locating and solving the ""Merlin Trials"".  Consisting of 95 various puzzles that you activate using the herb Mallowseet from Herbology. The puzzles vary if different challenges that you must solve using the various spells you learn at school such as Jumping on blocks, Zapping spheres, Lighting Pyres (via Confringo Spell), Rolling a giant ball into a bowl (using Accio and Depluso), rotating blocks until the are properly align on the accositate pillar (Using Flipendo). Another is locating all the 30 Demiguise statues to Learn all 3 levels of the Alohomora Spell from Gladwin Moon (this ages Hagrid apparently). Also, another annoyance to me were the Depluso rooms a Hogwarts, after you have learn the Depluso spell(s) a new side quest will open where need discover not one, but two depluso rooms and solve said puzzles encase therein. I recommend searching the Internet or Steam for a walkthrough, they really are painful and not fun in my opinion.Another particularly frustrating achievement ""Collectors Edition"" where if you are someone (like me) who wishes to complete at game 100 percent will be driven CRAZY!!! In order to achieve this rather daunting collections you will need to complete 10 collections in order to get this achievement: (Don't say I didn't warn you) 1. All 9 Potions and Magical Plants in the game2. All 67 Enemies in the game3. All 86 Appearances collected in the game4. All 150 Revelio Pages in the game5. All 13 Rescueable Beasts are Encountered in the game6. All 75 Traits are collected in the game7. All 42 Wand Handles are collected in the game8. All 140 Conjurations are collected in the game (SUPER FLAWED)9. All 16 Ingredient items in the game10. All 13 Brooms collected in the gameFlying is a NIGHTMARE, I tried both my trusty keyboard and an X-Box One controller and I could not find a good way to go, the 3-D/camera considerations make this absolutely frustrating for the challenges and quests, but I did find flying around the world to reach certain areas and things in the world is workable, but I personally think this just could have been so much better in my opinion, lucky for me you can skip this part, but boy what a lost opportunity and I would loved to have had the opportunity to skip summoners court all together, the challenges just seems flawed to me all the way around, I feel the hardest opponent was Leander Prewett, who happens to be your first official Summoners Court battler, and I found you had to hear his pompous butt way too much for my liking, I hope that perhaps they will review this one every match after this one is WAY easier than he is in my opinion. In general I have found the 3-D aspects of this game make a variety of challenges and some other worldly bugs (getting stuck midair or in the steps you just summoned (the bone staircases in the crypts) are fairly common, and can be eliminated by exiting the game and coming back in, but this of course could have been corrected with some rigorous beta testing in my opinion) and can cause you to have some issues as well which makes the game frustrating at times to keep a groove going. My last concern is not a major one, but I find this last achievement a little petty, the Finishing Touches achievement which requires you to use Ancient Magic on every character in the game.  As there are 67 characters in the game, and if you have beaten the game already, you cant necessarily complete this with you 40 level character sadly.  On top of this there is an achievement where you have to play the game with each house in order to unlock the map room (a key part in the actual game). So needless to say you just keep grinding and grinding. As of today 4/25/2023 I have logged over 350+ hours in this game. So I can honestly say I have played VERY thoroughly so is it worth the price of admission, no, not for the Deluxe Edition in my opinion, no, some of the poor design consideration really hurt this title in my opinion. I think the multiple teams that had worked on this project may have had struggles to complete this by the deadlines Warner Brothers Games set. I also think that the grindy spots also really hurt its chances in the long run for replayability. So it is my honest opinion to pick this up on a SALE if you can get it, as it is fun in some portions of the game and you do get the Hogwarts and Hogsmeade feels, it is nice, but this does not make up for the flaws."

Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.And have you noticed that only Europe seems to have a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911."

(naughty Slytherin student goals)This is without question a game designed for the fan of the Wizarding world in mind; but I feel like the average gamer who loves open world games and collection/trophy hunters will also really find some enjoyment.I am very much looking forward to seeing what the devs have planned for this game post-launch, but for now, i still have SO frickin much to do in this game."

Performance wise though - it does push your hardware quite a bit. I tried playing it on my old machine (GTX 970, i5-4690, 16GB DDR3) and it was playable - but only at 720p (w/ FSR2 upscaling it to 1080p) on low settings, and you only got 30fps (20fps in some intensive places like Hogwarts and Hogsmeade). If you're used to consoles it might be playable, but overall you'll need a somewhat recent PC to play this.What impressed me most was Hogwarts itself. The place genuinely feels like a huge labyrinth, which is what I would expect from a magical castle. There's always some secret somewhere... Which brings to what I feel is the game's biggest weakness. The world is designed as your average open world Ubisoft game. The map is pretty big, but it's also filled with time wasters - dumb puzzles (that repeat), collectables, the occasional enemy camp that has the same enemies every other camp has. Oh, what's this? Yet another Merlin trial? Yeah nah, I'll pass. The game also does try to push you to re-explore places (i.e. with the lockpicking skill upgrades), though you quickly realise there's no point in that because all you're getting is just samey RNG loot.Story wise it's about what you would expect from modern AAA. Some quests are decent , some are just not that memorable. The main story line is... okay, but it's just not that praiseworthy. The funniest thing to me, and probably to many others, is how you can be an edgy, unforgivable-curse casting monster and nobody will really care about it. There's a huge disconnect between what you are (a 15-year old student) and what you do (a mass murderer, a poacher that ""saves"" the animals (wink-wink)). I know it's just the game being a game, but it does feel a bit weird at times. You can literally cast the worst unforgivable curses in front of your teachers and they'll be like ""please don't kthx"".Overall it's a beautiful game, that apparently does an okay job at bringing the world of Harry Potter to life. It held my interest long enough for me to beat it, so I guess I can recommend it. If you're into Harry Potter you'll certainly enjoy the world, though I'm not sure if that demographic will like the collect-a-thon parts."

I only have three real complaints. Pacing of the story had moments where I could feel the padding. A sence of urgency is placed on the Main Story and then someone just says ""yeah, but not yet"" and your forced to go do another trial.Second Complaint is Audio. Some of the story moments were recorded with live recordings. Like someone just took a cellphone outside and just recorded the sounds of a backyard, or a fireplace. no adjustment of the levels no detail work. Just loud and jarring. Couple that with cleanly edited voice work from talented professionals in a booth and it makes for an awkward listening experience. Then some of the voices you could hear where modulation was being applied or no editing happened at all. an example; NPC is giving me a quest, our characters are outdoors, I can hear the echo from the NPC's voice as if it were happening in a closed space. Like the sound you hear if you recorded your voice in a room with no dampening on the walls and a wood floor. Lastly... Lockpicking. I'm a wizard that can summon lighting and instantly kill trolls, reduce the size of giant spiders to be able to step on them, or turn a living being into an exploding barrel and throw them into another living being to cause an explosion that harms everything around them... but I have to go through a mini game to pick locks. I get it... but like... let wizards do wizard things and leave the tedium somewhere else eh?That's it. The only things I really would give this game grief over. and I didn't even mind the pacing that much because the combat was FUN. I didn't care how the main story got padded out because I knew they were going to send me into another fun fight. I enjoyed going out and picking up Revelio pages because the world is interesting. Some of the puzzles, the Depulso rooms especially, were a joy to try and figure out.I wouldn't call this a GOTY by any means, it follows a lot of the same tropes you'd expect from this genre, and does fall into some of the same pitfalls because of those tropes, but Avalanche did an amazing job for a developer that isn't known for this genre."

(was already satisfied to hear a new game comes out)I was very confident about this game, since i followed it (end of 2021). What can i say.. it's magic, probably. Already told my boss that i am attending a school after work. Didn't tell him that it was Hogwarts.Long story, no sense..I made the Wizard Test online at Warner Bros website. I wanted to go Slytherin.. but the hat made it's decision. So.. i am a Hufflepuff. Connected my account with the game, scanned the QR code and got all the goodies.The intro, the music is beatiful and truly epic. Goosebumps and shivering. Voice acting, animations. I am playing the game with a controller. Super comfy, gives me bit of nostalgic feeling. The controller feels super nice to play with. Also the cast/spells and interactions you do with it.Overall i am astonished so far (remember i am easily satisfied). Put the game on hardmode if you want it ""more"" Souls-like feeling (still - easy), and roll around. It's truly amazing. And i am glad i pre-ordered and started early. I usually don't do this anymore. But this is just an amazing experience for each wizard or sorceress, no-thing else. :trolol:I am playing since Tuesday.First off, no game breaking bugs or anything like that. A few happy little accidents, but that didn't bother me. The exploring of it all (from start to the first run through the school) is just WOW. Taking my time everywhere. If you open menue, inventory and map you can see already what's ahead of you. The map and content is just big and you'll have a blast exploring it.There's so much love in every detail. Spot of interest? cast a spell! Something flying around? cast a spell! Something to reveal? You won't believe but, cast a spell! The more you reveal with one of the first spells.. the more you get addicted to that nicely ""bing"" let's you use it even more.Just to find from where that ""bing"" is. In the beginning you might not be quite sure where to look. Use it as much as needed. Sometimes you have to be close to that ""bing"" and look at that ""bing"".There is a story, explanation of background from the ""bings"" you reveal .. whatever.. btw. you can pet all cats you come across.If you still reading, thank you for your time. I wish i could explain it to you how it feels for me, better.. but i'm not a wizard.This game will only get better. It's already everything i ever wanted since the PS1. :)Enjoy wizards & sorceress'"

From my childhood to adulthood. This game is deep and mysterious, capturing the brightest and darkest elements from the world of Hogwarts. The direction the developers have taken represents a revival of the Harry Potter series - one that is led by fans who understand and love the world and can expand it in a meaningful and authentic way, much like Dave Feloni's & the Andor team did for Star Wars.As a lifelong fan of the Harry Potter books and movies, I was enchanted by the magical world and as a young child frightened by the darker moments in the series, such as the Chamber of Secrets. The combat in Hogwarts Legacy is truly fantastic and only improves as you progress through the game. I have only experienced a glimpse, but I am already imagining how my late-game dark wizard character will play, drawing inspiration from the best moments in the movies. The combat is fast-paced and aggressive, reminiscent of the cafe ambush scene and the battle against the Death Eaters in the Order of the Phoenix. It's clearly inspired by games like Batman: Arkham and Shadow of War, with quick strikes, deflects, and parries that are highly satisfying. On top of this strong foundation, there is an extensive array of spells that allow you to dominate the battlefield in creative ways, whether you choose to incinerate your enemies, batter them with kinetic force, or strike them down with dark magic. I have unlocked the ability to modify my spells with ""ancient magic"", and I envision a build in the late game where I can curse my enemies, disarm them with expelliarmus, and then strike them all down with avada kedavra as the greatest dark wizard of the age. These modifications to basic spells (which are already enjoyable to combine) will make you feel like you're playing out the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort in the Ministry.As a fan of RPG's, including Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and The Witcher (though I was disappointed by Cyberpunk's lack of impactful player decisions), I appreciate morally ambiguous stories. Hogwarts Legacy offers constant opportunities for player choice, some subtle and others more significant. There are many small choices that affect your relationships with other characters, who you can accompany on quests, and your reputation in the game. For example, winning a practice duel in class can earn you respect and admiration, while losing might result in disdain. Although I am still early in the game, I have already encountered fleshed-out NPCs, each with their own agendas and personalities. I recently completed a quest where a Slytherin girl tried to manipulate me into retrieving something for her from a dangerous location. I agreed, but only in exchange for a reward, which earned her respect and surprise. Alternatively, you could have completed the task out of kindness (or to gain her favor) or kept the item for yourself.I could continue to sing the praises of this game, but I think it's clear that there is a great deal of love and care put into it by the developers. The setting is rich and immersive, and the graphics are gorgeous and customizable. I am eager to see what other surprises the game has in store, and I look forward to future DLC. It's worth noting that, in 2023, it is becoming increasingly common for games to be incomplete at launch (such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Darktide), but so far, Hogwarts Legacy feels complete and well-rounded. I highly recommend it to fans of the Harry Potter franchise and to RPG enthusiasts alike."

I've spent the better portion of an hour there on the first day of release for us that pre-purchase the Deluxe Addition. It seems to be flooded with Racists & Transgender Haters. You would be hard pressed to find anyone that just wants to talk about the game in general without one of those  morons hijacking the thread. Needless to say, I haven't returned there.The game is enchanting, and wonderfully done. I have no issues once I figured out what graphic settings gives me the best bang for my money without loosing the immersion. My settings are Ultra, but I leave  disabled until some sort of Optimization patch comes along, the graphics are gorgeous enough without it, and my pictures speak for themselves. The game also supports NVidia's Insel Photo Mode.Getting around is easy enough for me, and there are several ways to do it, but I'll let you discover them for yourself. The voice acting is top notch in my opinion, and the characters are both charming, and engaging. Cut-scenes give the game more depth, and you'll get to know some of your friends, and acquaintances this way. The game is a story, so try to live it.I find this game is best played in a dark, or dimly lit room. You'll see why once you play it. Try to leave the real world behind you once you close the door to your room. So give the game a chance without any forum BS to sway your mind.If you come here to spread your Hate, Flame & Troll, I'll quickly delete your comments, and block you. I could care less how many Hilarious & Jester awards your childish mind gives me. They spend just a well on goodies as any other award. So if you want to waste them on me... go for it!I play games for my enjoyment, and nobody else's. That's the way I believe they should be played regardless of Race, or Gender haters trying to influence yours, and my enjoyment. It's just a game."

The combat is fun, there are plenty of combos to make use of while fighting, but spells could use some rework (mostly Alohomora with its absolutely pointless minigame) and seeing the same types of enemies half a minute within walking from one place to the next - or even quicker while flying - gets boring quickly.The world itself is beautiful and well-made, yet it still has a certain emptiness to it. There is some dialogue between the NPCs found in it, but they repeat the same thing over and over and over again without reacting to anything the main character achieves. It is also supposed to be an RPG, yet there are usually only two dialogue choices (not counting questions before accepting a quest) one for a goody two-shoes and another for a rude character. The problem is, even the choice that is worded rudely before picking sounds as if the first option was picked. They are practically the same. That is my biggest problem with the game. Nothing matters, nothing reacts. You can't talk to NPCs, not even students inside Hogwarts unless they give some sort of fetch-quest or collection quest. I usually play good characters, so it is not an issue for me, but for those that want evil or grey choices during quests will be disappointed. I remember one (1!) out of dozens of quests, where my choice mattered. Where is the RPG in that?Don't even get me started on the collections. Other than the field guides that contain lore for the world, all others are completely useless and are only there to lengthen the playtime. So are the trials that are all over the world and so easy and repetitive that it makes you think what Merlin thought of his fellow students' mental capabilities when he thought them up. He certainly had a lot of time on his hands, though...And the story. What is there to say about the story? It's... there? I guess. I really like this game, but there is nothing in the main story that I am completely in awe of. It's all just mediocre and shallow. The twist about one of the characters was very predictable and most of the side-quests are as forgettable as the NPCs that gave them. The ""companions"" are not so bad, but they could have made it so that they could be dragged along on adventures whenever. And the main character. The ""Fifth-year"" is a completely blank, soulless character with no background, no personality, no explanation as to why they start their studies in their fifth year. It's never explained why, only the fact that they are not the only ones that this happened to. That's just lazy writing if you ask me. The main antagonist's reason for hating wizardkind is... well, mentioned in a sidequest. The last boss fight was good at least. Not much of a challenge over level 30, but still good. There should have been more bosses like that one. Overall I'd still say this game is worth a playthrough, but I doubt I would start another after finally getting 100% on my first."

Despite all the controversy, we as gamers have to appreciate the time and effort that went into this masterpiece. Beginning character customization does fall a bit short with few choices and not a lot of room to customize your features, but by far the story makes up for it all. You gather more cosmetics throughout the game and you can change how you look no matter how far into the story you are. I was also able to switch between keyboard and controller without any issues at all. There are a few bugs in the game, but nothing too noticeable on my end. I could say so much more about how great this game is so far, but it's better if you check it out yourself. I highly recommend this game to any who grew up with the nostalgic of the Wizarding world or a big fan of fantasy RPG.Well, I'm back to defense against the dark arts class now.

Ходишь по замку и деревням, трогаешь всякие летающие топоры, кнопки, животных, разрушенные стауи, говорящие цветы, летающие мётлы, живые картины, поющие кусты, котов, чужие сундуки и т.п. Всё звучит, шевелится и радует глаз. Именно в звук много атмосферы уходит, но не сказать что он тут какой-то особенный. Нормальный звук.С контроллера играть удобно. Мало тактильной отдачи.  Ужаснейшее управление полётами (с клавомыши тоже ужасное).  Мне гораздо удобнее с контроллера, чем с мышью.На Ultrawide опять не всё хорошо. Катсцены с рамочкам.

Mostly looking for missing pages and such) id say it was one of the most complete games I've played in along time. It provided that bit of nostalgia of being a kid and going to see the harry potter movies in theaters. Id say its worth it but who am I.

But I was looking forward to this because of the developer Avalanche. This is indeed a VERY excellent open-world adventure, with *tons* of well designed magic. Pros: The atmosphere of everything is very magical. Magic spells are very well designed and make for some fun puzzles and very well balanced for combat.Combat itself is also very well designed, where every spell has a function depending on the enemy or situation. Not super hard, perhaps a bit too easy on Normal (when compared to fex God of War, which has a lot harder boss fights). I would probably recommend Hard on your playthrough.The main story is well written and engaging. You always want to know what happens next.Cons: There were some major performance issues on launch (3080 Ti here), should get better with patches.Some of the facial and gesture animations look a bit underwhelming (when for example compared to God of War or Heavy Rain).A lot of the puzzles were a bit too easy to figure out.9/10"

I had high expectations but it honestly surpassed that.  There is the main plot but lots of side quests. (I'm a sides quest gal).  The area is fairly large.  I've played it for 12 hours so far and only barely touched on the map.  I'm still constantly getting lost in Hogwarts as you can explore every nook and cranny.  It brings the enviroments of the movie to the game, but also takes some things from the books (such as Peeves) to fill in the gaps.  I was surprised how you can wander everywhere.  Go from green house to kitchen, to library to classrooms to bathrooms.  I think the moving stairs was clever how they did it so it didnt impede progress.  The ability to fly far and wide is amazing.  Going from Hogsmead to landing on one of the bridges inside Hogwarts to stroll around the castle feels seamless to me.  I have yet to get into the beasts portion of the game as I've been doing side quests and exploring.I found the world building amazing.  I love the tiny details of paintings moving, statues watching you, house elves cleaning and disappearing.  Listening to conversations that dont affect the plot but dont sound out of place, and the amount of work in the BG NPCs that you cant interact with, they have nothing to do with the story, but living their lives and you get a peek into it with their interactions. I will say the combat was initially too challenging for me.  I found trying to juggle all the keys (going from numbers to ctrl, space, mouse and arrows) while trying to watch for attacks and counter spells a bit overwhelming.  They let you change the difficulty setting but not so much allow you to rebind the keys, which would be a nice QOL.There are a few minor things so far, glitches, and also not explaining how the clothing/gear (how to change its appearance) was lacking, but it doesnt bother the game play at all. I know a lot of people do not want to support the game because of politics and peer pressure.  I respect that.  I myself was gifted this game, but if I wasn't I probably would've still purchased it.  It really does the world of Harry Potter justice, and the team at Avalanche clearly love the source material and did it justice."

Open world exploration, lots of collectibles, secret & puzzle solving, engaging spell slinging fights, customizable build load outs based on player preferences, immersive story, full voice acting with a ton of attention to detail to make the surroundings feel alive, and a lot more I'm sure I'm forgetting.In most games that have attempted such a broad scope of design when integrating many systems and lore from source material together, I would have expected the pieces to break at the seams, but somehow this game still delivers a cohesive, fun experience and stays true to the source material. Not only does it nod to many smaller references from the books and movies, but expands on the world building - setting the stage for potentially more cannon material in the Wizarding World.My favorite discovery so far has been a brewing pot in the last stall in one of the lavatories, one of many small bits of fun you'll encounter while exploring the castle. Even for those unfamiliar with the world, there is a ton to bite into. If you're a fan of exploration and open world RPGs with many side quests and mini games, you'll thoroughly enjoy this game.The first HP game ever released was very well received, but followed a myriad of half baked sequels that each drifted further away from the original vision. Hogwart's Legacy has brought back the original intent into an era that made it technically feasible to support such an ambitious vision. I can't wait to see what they end up doing for DLCs or a sequel."

The team who worked on this did a solid job on the world with a tremendous amount of details. The whole environment seems alive with interactivity, and the scenery is beautiful. The moving pictures, the various dialogue interactions and events, the little items you can move, etc. all come together to create a truly unique experience and makes it feel like you are really part of the Harry Potter universe. Also, the fact that you can roam around Hogwarts castle and the surrounding areas without loading screens is a great touch that makes you just want to explore and helps to not break the immersion. There is so much to do and see with story quests and side quests available, as well as dungeons, puzzles, item collection, customization, and different scenarios for each house, which adds to the replayability. Even more, no pay-to-win or DLC microtransactions to ruin the experience. So far, the game has run without any hiccups or bugs after about 10 hours of gameplay. I can honestly say I am happy to have spent the money on this game and feel I have gotten my money's worth, as recent games have been lackluster to disappointing overall.

Especially if you like Harry Potter universe. Worth playingWhen this game was announced, I was immediately excited. I am a big fan of the Harry Potter franchise, and although I'm aware this takes place in a completely different time, and is more-so a spinoff / extended universe / lore game, it still had my attention. The game was delayed a few times, but I'm okay with that if it means a more polished product. I pre-ordered it and played it for the 72 hours early access for deluxe edition pre-order buyers. I am not finished with the game after ~25 hours (I am about 55% total completion as of writing this review), but I am definitely enjoying my time and have little to no complaints. Also, figured I would mention that I am very experienced with this style of game, and have likely completed a lot more than the average person may have in those hours. I am focusing side / exploration missions first, story after.I absolutely love the combat in this game. It is intense, and there is so much going on but it doesn't overwhelm you or require you to be an expert at games. There are 'ultimates' (in a sense, they aren't actually called that in-game), and you can even interact with the environment and control some of the environment while battling enemies as well, to keep you entertained.The exploration is reminiscent to that of the first 3 Harry Potter games on PC, allowing you to walk all through the castle (which is absolutely gigantic, by the way), as well as outside of Hogwarts grounds, up in the mountains and hills. Outside, you can also fly around on your broom (after a certain point early in the game), making it that much better.There are lots of missions and collectables and things to unlock throughout the game. This is nothing new per se, as it is just like the Far Cry games, however I am a completionist, and love to try and finish every single thing. Some of the more mundane collectables are also useful because they can unlock extra outfit overrides and outfit perks after collecting certain amounts of them.By all means, the story isn't a crazy, 'new' story. It follows a certain trope () but it isn't annoying or horribly boring like Borderlands 3 was (for me). So it's good, but it's nothing we haven't  seen before.There are levels, skills (referred to as 'talents'), perks and stats for your clothing pieces (same idea as Cyberpunk), upgrades to the broom, upgrades to clothing, clothing rarities / qualities, etc.The graphics are great! It's not groundbreaking, but definitely great to look at, inside the castle especially. It is all I ever wanted when I was a kid, but unfortunately that was not possible back then.Choosing your own House at Hogwarts does have some effect on your gameplay. Many missions and side missions are different, each house has their own common room, and things can play out slightly differently. It's no 'Detroit Become Human', but there was at least some attempt, which I like to see.Choosing your wand length, wood, inner core, your house, patronus, and all that was cool to do. Even though it doesn't really affect anything, your wand you don't really often see up close, it's still fun for those who are very into the franchise.As mentioned before, lots of the side missions and exploration tasks can get repetitive in nature, though they are all physically different, the idea is the same. Doesn't bother me, but could bother some. If you've played Far Cry, it's the same deal. For me, I couldn't care less about this. However, I can't deny it; the mouth animations when someone is speaking is  a few years behind.You may not experience any, however I have experienced things such as falling through the world randomly,  and almost getting stuck in certain areas in the highlands while trying to get into areas on my broom, but it's mostly my fault because I was trying to cheese the game. I have not encountered any softlock issues, any horrible game-breaking bugs, just some minor issues, none of which directly affected me really at all.As an example, in shops, where you can sell your clothing pieces (basically your armour), if you have like 20 pieces you want to sell, you can't select all, or even just click once to sell an item. They have a preventative measure in place so that you don't accidentally sell something you want to keep (because you can't buy things back), meaning I have to hold left-click on each item (could be upwards of 30 items if I have a full inventory) for about 1.5s. Not that big of a deal, but if they allowed you to buy-back or even do a sell-all or multi-select, it'd be a lot better. Another example is the character creation screen. Who in the world thought that a slider (with no images for reference) for hair colour was a good idea?! You can't simply pick a color, or have a gradient bar to see what colour you're selecting. You have to sit there and scroll through a slider bar with about 25 different colours and just try to remember which one you liked most. You can see the preview on your character but good luck remember what specific selection on the line was the one you wanted. There are a few other small issues like that, mostly based on preference and my playstyle, but in my own opinion I think there are a few overlooked UI / developer choice issues that could be made a lot better. .Do I recommend it? Yes! It is fun, entertaining, though nothing groundbreaking. It is a  win for Harry Potter fans, as they haven't had a game in like 10 years and the last 3 entries were horrendously bad. I am a huge fan of the first 3 games, as I grew up with those, and this is like a modern take on them, and I could not be happier. The game isn't as demanding as some in terms of computer power, which is another bonus."

Every time I feel like I've seen the best thing in this game's world, it keeps surprising me. As a fan of this series, the DEVELOPERS have absolutely outdone themselves. The moment I walked into the Room of Requirement, it was as if they had pulled the visions from my mind. It was perfect. The attention to detail from the dining room to Hogsmeade are beyond words. What's even better are the house common rooms, two of which we never saw in the movies. My wife is playing Ravenclaw and WOW that common room's details are astounding.The story is intriguing, the battle system is awesome and feels like the quick, fast-paced action we saw in the movies. Flying is a bit wonky, but you do get better. Overall, I was not expecting this game to be as BIG as it is, the world map is massive. It's fun to play, rewarding to search and discover secrets, it really is everything a Potter fan would want.For those slamming the game because of JK Rowling, look, she's filthy rich, whether you buy this game or not, it won't affect her life at all. On the flip side, there are literally hundreds of people who worked over 5 years to make this game a dream come true. You buying the game says thank you to them, keeps them employed and rewards their hard work.On top of that the devs even included a trans-character in the game for good measure and a proper ""EFF"" you to JK Rowling. So don't trash this game in review bombs because of her, stand with it and the inclusion of a trans character, but more importantly, support the developers for making a game so accurate to the world, that blows the mind."

It may not be the RPG they marketed it as, but it is still a fantastic game. With no real class selection, choices that matter, or build variety to find, it's hard to call Hogwarts Legacy an RPG, even if it has a few light RPG elements. Unfortunately, these days it seems that any game with even the slightest hint of an RPG element is marketed as an RPG and Hogwarts Legacy does manage to be a fantastic open world action adventure game, so I cannot say I am overly disappointed or surprised.At it’s core, Hogwarts Legacy is a very standard open world action adventure game. If you are not a fan of AAA open world games, you’re probably not going to like this. It doesn’t really do much that is unique or different other than being set in a really cool fantasy world with an amazing castle and executing the formula very well. It does have performance issues, especially in Hogwarts and Hogsmead, but they were not enough to ruin my enjoyment. When the game is not having a lag attack, it runs pretty good.After a decently long and super cool introduction, you enter Hogwarts as a 5th year student. The castle really does feel magical and maze like. Between the early game quests that take place in the castle and all the collectibles and loot scattered about, I spent the majority of my first 10 hours inside the castle. There really is just that much to see and do inside the castle, but this did lead to a few balance issues. Early game I was swapping out ever single piece of gear 3 to 5 times between each combat encounter, and when I finally met my first boss, I was way over levelled.I really appreciate that each piece of gear you get is saved as a skin that you can apply to any piece of gear of the same type. There is a pretty good variety of skins, although most of the shirts seem to have a very blue colour pallet, maybe because that is my house colours. Like most games with character customization, you pretty much end up standing out in a crowd. You do have a pair of default house robes that you can wear, but that’s boring. It would be nice to see NPCs change their clothes, especially when not in Hogwarts, or when the seasons change. It is a little odd being the only one wearing a scarf and gloves during the winter.Something I find really impressive is how the game handles loading. Every door seems to be a sometimes not so hidden loading screen. For the most part doors just swing open as you walk into them, making for a completely seamless experience while traversing the world, including Hogwarts castle itself. Sometimes the game does not load quick enough and a small loading circle appears by the door handle. This never lasts for more than a few seconds, so when it works, its amazing, and when it doesn’t, it’s not even a minor annoyance. Combine this with the fact that you can use your broom from courtyards inside the castle and directly fly to areas outside the castle, and the game feels open in a way that other open world games don’t. For some reason, there are some outdoor areas of Hogwarts, and the entire village of Hogsmead, where you can not use your broom.The game consists of doing main quests, which often take you to very cool locations, side quests, which are fairly standard, and assignments for your professors, which teach you new spells. The main quests and side quests are usually pretty interesting, although some side quests don’t even try to hide the fact that they are fetch quests. The assignments do often feel like fetch quests with no real story attached. You do gain new spells from assignments, so at least you get a good reward for doing them. The game is not going to win any awards for writing, but it is good enough to keep my interested.The game does a good job of slowly introducing you to new mechanics so that you never feel overwhelmed, but at times it does feel like things are introduced too slowly. Most of the mechanics are pretty neat, but many of them feel they could have a bit more polish. Broom flying is very nice, even if the controls are not the most intuitive. The Room of Requirements is super cool, even if what they call green is more of a teal and placing items is a bit awkward. The most notable bad mechanic is lock picking. I really do not like the lock picking mini game in this game. It is not explained well, its not fun, its animations are much longer than they need to be, and it feels out of place. I’m using magic to unlock the lock, not picking it, so why is there a lock picking mini game?The combat, on the other hand, is great. This is some of the best combat I’ve seen from a game that is not a shooter. You have a good amount of spell variety. Spells feel impactful and powerful, although mid game enemies do get a bit tanky. Blocking and dodging feels good. I do wish you could have more than 4 spells on your spell bar at a time. It’s not a huge deal to switch spell bars with my mouse wheel, but with so many easily accessible unused keys on my keyboard, it would be nice if I could use some of them. It would also be nice if the Room of Requirement spells were on a dedicated spell bar that only shows up inside upon entering so that they do not take up space on your regular spell bar.Outside Hogwarts, you have a fairly standard open world with collectibles, towns, puzzles, loot, caves, bandit camps, etc. I would say the world is a bit above average, but I also really like fantasy and fantasy environments. The world is not the biggest world I’ve ever seen, but it does not need to be. I would much rather have a small and dense world than a large and sparse one. Hogwarts Legacy is decently dense and the open world activities are fun and varied enough. I thought I would not do them all, but then I checked and noticed I only had a small handful left, so I ended up finishing them off.Something I find very odd is that many of the ruins and bandit camps have mini puzzles to get their loot. These puzzles are very simple and consist of things like moving some objects and doing a bit of parkour. The thing I find most strange is that you're a wizard with a flying broom. Most of the time these puzzles can be entirely ignored if you just take out your broom and fly to the loot. It just feels very odd that they would spend time making all of thees tiny puzzles that can easily be avoided. It feels like they forgot that flying was a thing.In my playtime I have not had many bugs, unless you count lag and frame dips to be bugs. The worst bug was when I randomly fell through the world. Then I remembered I was a wizard with a magical broom, so I flew back up and continued as if nothing had happened. I’ve also had a few floating objects that were clearly bugs and not part of the games magic, and a texture issues.Hogwarts Legacy may not be anything groundbreaking, but it is a fantastic game and other than performance issues, my only complaints are very nit-picky, like the Room of Requirements not having a proper green or lock picking being very annoying. The story is interesting, the characters are decent, the world is truly magical, the music is great, and the combat is fun. There is not a lot more you could ask for."

Terus kemarin tanggal 10 februari juga banyak SJW di discussion forumsnya jadi makin ragu sama gamenya tapi emang intuisi tidak bisa diragukan karena dari awal emang liat gamenya kok kek yg bagus gitu ya, pas udah jamnya early access jadi tangan sangat gatak buat beli alhasil beli lagi untuk ke 3 kalinya tapi yang Deluxe Edition biar sekalian bisa download duluan mumpung Wifi di Thailand kemarin lagi bagus bagusnya.Ternyata gamenya keren abies, biasanya main Fallout atau Elder Scroll itu agak cepet bosen karena walaupun seru tapi rasanya sangat datar aja gitu seru yang buat saya 2 jam perhari udah cukup.Tapi somehow ini game emang bener2 nagih. Explorasi dan vibes tiap region itu bener bener beda. Dari Hogwarts yang bener bener wah ancient abis, Hogsmade yang bener2 homy and cozy, terus Forbiden Forest yang bener2 vibesnya terlarang banget itu bener bener point utama yg gabikin nyesel keluar duit hampir sejuta buat game ini. Walaupun memang variasi musuhnya terkesan repetitive tapi explorasi, view, dan vibesnya yang bikin saya nyaman sama game ini. Dan ya memang tidak ada game yg sempurna ya bund, kadang lagi asik asik liat pemandangan tau tau fps drop dari 50 ke 30 tapi selebihnya itu lancar dan masih sangat playable buat dinikmati. Dialogue scenenya juga udah di set jadi NPCnya ga bener bener random penempatannya, sangat bagus banget drpd Fallout yang kadang kalau kita maksa buat ngobrol tau tau ngebug entah kemana.Overall ini game 9/10 buat gamer seperti diri saya yang suka cepet bosen sama gamenya, sayang aja ada bbrp hal kaya Quiditch dll yang entah tidak di implementasikan atau belum di implementasikan, harapannya cuma kalau bisa ini game ada ekspansi lebih via DLC baik kelanjutan cerita ataupun fitur multiplayer/ local coop karena somehow battle sendirian rasanya agak hampa dan terlalu OP. Mungkin kalau ada fitur companion seperti Fallout dan Elder Scroll bakalan lebih immersive, tapi ya we know its a different developer. Anyway , i still dont want to complete the main story as a Ravenclaw, because the house have many and long sidequest that i wanted to explore first rather than completing the main story, because why not."

It feels like a love letter to the Harry Potter Universe and there are so many little details that make the world feel alive. Combat is punchy and fun. The visuals are gorgeous and nostalgic. If you enjoy intensely fun magic combat and exploring a fleshed-out fantasy world that's overloaded with the mystical and magical, you'll love this game. If you're already a huge Harry Potter fan, this game was made for you.Now, I cannot say the game is in a perfect state right now, as that'd be dishonest. I received the early access copy as I'd pre-ordered the Deluxe edition. My computer specs are:- RTX 3060- i5-12600k- 16 GB 3600 MHz DDR4 RAM- NVMEWith those specs, playing at Ultra settings at 1080p with DLSS Quality and no Raytracing, the game has been playing at 75 fps (my monitor's native refresh rate) with dips into the 60s here and there. At High settings, my fps was pretty darn steady. As many others have mentioned, the PC version is plagued by stuttering issues. Even tweaking my settings down to medium or lower does not solve them. Hopefully a day one patch solves this. It's really my only complaint.Despite that, though, I've been very much enjoying my time with Hogwarts Legacy. Once some patches roll out for PC, I think my rating would bump up from an 8/10 to a 10/10. I'll update my review if my opinion changes as I continue through the story.Now, if you excuse me, this Hufflepuff needs to get back to her classes ;)"

The game offers a vast, detailed, and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and its neighboring regions, which is packed to the brim with locations to discover, collectibles, and activities to clear. For a Potterhead like me, it was a dream come true.The combat system in the game is varied and satisfying. As I learned new spells, new combat opportunities opened up, which kept the game fresh and engaging in the long run. The customization possibilities are also excellent, featuring a myriad of cosmetics and skins, and my own customizable 'base' to furnish by hand at leisure.The progression system in Hogwarts Legacy portrays my growth as a wizard quite well, giving me new tools and utilities to access previously-locked content and areas. I also liked the solid roster of side characters; most of them are likable/unique enough, and their writing isn't complete garbage.However, the game is not without its issues. One major issue is the excessively repetitive open-world activities that create bloat and annoyance for those who want to complete all side activities. Additionally, combat balance issues with potions, 'healing spam,' and unforgivable curses make most fights quite too easy, especially when upgraded.Another problem is that most named foes and quest bosses are just normal enemies on steroids, with no variation in mechanics and no unique behaviors. I also noticed some inconsistencies with lore and character behavior. For example, if I used unforgivable curses in public or during quests (with witnesses), nobody seemed to give a damn.Moreover, I experienced significant frame-drops inside Hogwarts when transitioning between different sections and in specific places throughout the castle, regardless of settings. In some cases, fall damage doesn't even register on enemies.Overall, it took me 42 hours to complete Hogwarts Legacy, taking considerable extra time to clear all optional content and find around 90% of collectibles/secrets on Hard difficulty. However, I don't see a reason to replay the game once finished, except for achievement hunting, as the content is linear.Despite its flaws, I think Hogwarts Legacy is worth buying, especially if you're a fan of the saga. The amount of content and quality are more than fair for the proposed $60 price, expected from an AAA release.In conclusion, Hogwarts Legacy is by far the best game ever made based on this franchise, but it's not a masterpiece by any means. Fans of the series will almost certainly like it, but it's still drawn back by its issues."

I'd say the actual weakest part of the game is the actual gameplay, although it is entertaining enough to carry itself.  Most of the enjoyment I've had so far has been from exploration, which is something I look forward to in everything I play.The character customization is not what I'd consider good, although it's probably acceptable for most.  There seems to be a wide variety of different clothing options that you find regularly, and (having tested on two different saves) the loot is randomized.  The shaders on the hair are absolutely awful, and despite spending quite a while sifting through them and looking at them in different lighting environments, never found anything that looked good.  There seems to be something... wrong with many of the faces and eyes, particularly the girls, to me.The story (which I am not far into) seems intriguing enough, typical fantasy spiel, as you might imagine for the genre.  Many of the character voices are somewhat unusual, even jarring, at times.  When not over-acting, there's a serious ""robotic"" voice / pitch issue for both the player character and NPCs at times.  The lip syncing is quite unnatural and distracted me at times, as well as the strange empty eyes that most NPCs have.The combat is what I'd consider ""rock, paper, scissors"" combat.  You need to cast the right type of spell, generally noted by its colour, to break certain defenses which also share the colour of the spell type that must break them.  While it is not difficult even on hard difficulty, it can be very fast-paced and reaction-heavy when fighting multiple enemies.  That alone makes the combat pretty engaging, but there is no real depth or complexity I can note beyond this.This title is certainly not worth the listing price and if you are dead set on getting it, wait for sales... or perhaps pursue a more morally acceptable avenue of acquisition.  I can certainly see it becoming a micro-transaction hell in the future.It is not a terrible game and is more good than bad, on those terms.  Nostalgia will certainly be a winning factor for many fans of the series, and I suspect that is a large catalyst for its seemingly overall success.  Suffice to say, the thick controversy over this title does it absolutely no favours.  The way some of the more sensitive subjects are handled in-game feels like something between a haphazardly forced afterthought and a poor joke that leaves the entire room uncomfortable.  The more I progress through the game, the more I find myself thinking these instances were not mistakes.Speaking purely from a reviewer's standpoint on a game, I cannot see it being worth the price.  It's not ground-breaking, it's not amazing, and does nothing new for the open world genre.  It's not terrible, but it's not ""overwhelmingly"" and ""positively"" good, to me, at least.  As it stands now I cannot really recommend it, especially concerning the price and what you get for the content, not counting moral / ethical reasons.I'm sure nobody has come to the review section to hear my personal feelings on the controversies involved, so all I'll say is:Some of the behaviors I have seen absolutely disgust me.  Y'all need to do better.Be better."

In the castle and outside you will also find riddles and secret places to explore. This is legit the best game i have played since i started playing League Of Legends in 2010! Just a miracle game!

Unfortunately, the 'magic' only lasts for so long. The remainder of the game is persistently dull.   Every puzzle mechanic or setting that is briefly interesting seem to only have been used as a little feather to tickle our noses with, it's just disappointing to see the amount of obvious love that has gone into many parts of the world go to waste because this overblown officially licensed fan fiction tries to reach it's fingers into too many pies. I don't even want to really get into how uncanny it is that in spite of anything our character does in the story or side, the worst consequence you can really get is a bit of sass or a mild scolding.   Most folks probably don't expect anything mindblowing from this game, perhaps they just wanna explore the recesses of their nostalgia within the recesses of Hogwarts. This game DOES encourage exploration, and the castle truly IS beautifully made and presented. However, the way they encourage exploration is a far cry from being engaging in any sense of the word. Spamming REVELIO as I jaunt through the halls, it really takes away from much of the sense of amazement I reckon I would have if these areas were presented to us in a different context. Our introductions to the various classes of Hogwarts are an adequate example of that being done, of exploring the god forsaken castle through the inquisitive eyes of our youthful protagonist and their peers. It's a crying shame these classes are only one-offs and the rest of the game is so much more focused on other parts of the world it's a wonder that they felt the need to include the school at all.

When looking at exploration and progression, it might even surpass Elden Ring - and that says a LOT about this game.: As of writing this review, I've completed 54% of in-game challenges + 14/45 achievements. Still have many mechanics to unlock and enjoying every moment of it without being bored.Whoever designed the spell combat in this game deserves a raise. This is Harry Potter done right and truth be told, a game of this caliber should have been made when the Harry Potter hype was at its peak about a decade ago! But better late than never. While combat takes a backseat in this game (as hard as that is to believe; to be elaborated in the next section ), Hogwarts Legacy took every well-done combat system that exists in this day and age of action-adventure games (ie. Assassin's Creed, Arkham series, Dark Souls, etc.) and mashed it into a solid system with its own identity that's difficult to get tired of. My only gripe, if I were to nitpick, is the limitations caused by the spell pages. It's hard to mix up many spells as I would like to and combat may be become clunky, but perhaps a sequel - if any - will provide more options.As mentioned above, even though combat was discussed first, it takes a backseat in this game. Exploration is where this game truly shines and I found myself spending hours and hours just running around Hogwarts/Hogsmeade and doing quests & chores without fighting a single enemy. The idea of unlocking different mechanics and spells in this game that can be creatively utilized not only in combat but in exploration, combined with a progression system designed to help you take things gradually without being overwhelmed, makes every quest and step enjoyable. All in all, here's the best way to put it: I haven't even unlocked the endgame spells and I WANT to put it off so it feels like I'm becoming a truly powerful wizard through every quest and step I take. This game helps you to enjoy the process, not just seek results.Glamour/Transmog (single player or MMOs) is such a simple yet delicate mechanic that can make or break a game. And Hogwarts Legacy hit it out of the ballpark. Not much more to be said. Pick up a gear, have that design unlocked, equip it as your appearance at any time. Do the same for your wand and broom? Couldn't ask for any more than that.Merlin Trials and such may become repetitive, but not to the point of considering them tedious. The Room of Requirement and its vast design potential really caught me off guard and is a welcome addition to the wizard experience. After having experienced Island Sanctuary recently in FF14, the concept of taming animals for resources to upgrade gear and using conjuration stations to grow plants and brew potions was the icing on the cake to an already amazing game.Just like watching a movie, each quest had me engaged to the story and progression and had me waiting for what's coming next. Truly well-written main story and side quests, particularly for anyone like myself playing this game for the nostalgia alone.Haven't confirmed any sources for the Quidditch DLC, but it must be on its way right? It'll be free RIGHT?!Options are slightly lacking in the versatility department, but not a major complaint considering the nature of the game. For an adventure game of this caliber, the options they provided were ENOUGH, but not entirely plentiful as one might expect.With a solid combination of combat + exploration + side content, the trifecta for Hogwarts Legacy is a complete enjoyable experience with replayability potential. Add nostalgia to the formula, and it's the perfect game to play in 2023. Nowadays, that's a hard combination to master. The first game in a while that I pre-ordered for full price and zero regrets. PS: I don't support pre-orders but this game was just too hype lol"

The JK Rowling controversy notwithstanding, it looked great and was praised as the Harry Potter game all long-time fans of the franchise were waiting for. I am not such a fan. My attachment to the franchise is rather looser. Yes, I have watched the movies, even liked some of them. I have also visited the exhibition housing the movie version of Hogwarts. But it's not a big or important part of my childhood, as it is for many. Nevertheless, there is some familiarity and I do like a good open-world game from time to time. As such I was eager to try this game. A rare event. Let's see how that went.Arguably the game's greatest selling point is the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry itself. The Castle is lovingly reconstructed and fully explorable. Well, provided you can be bothered to do the fetch quest necessary for the lockpicking spell at least. It is also iconic enough that even people with my limited familiarity will recognise a great deal of locations, items and activities. The rest of the world is also generally beautiful, with some impressive vistas and interesting art direction choices to be seen. Unfortunately, it is just looks. The game offers but limited opportunities to interact with the world. Outside of preset activities/missions you can't really do much. You can't go to classes, or even prank your fellow students. That was a mild disappointment. But still not enough to sully the accomplishment that is Hogwarts.Unfortunately, this is where the good part ends. The game has little else of value to offer. The plot is a D-movie level schlock, unoriginal and entirely unimpressive. Anyone who doesn't guess the direction it's taking at least halfway in is simply not paying any attention to the game. Not that I could fault them for that. The main character is an underdeveloped and overused archetype, a Mary Sue that can do no wrong, even when playing with the Dark Arts, it's all kosher for Mary. The overwhelming majority of the missions are simple fetch quests. In fact, the game offers a masterclass in how many different ways once can masquerade simple fetch quests. The game tries to make up for its lack of interesting content with padding. There is, naturally, an inventory system and other cookie-cutter RPG-lite elements too. Those also serve little purpose and wouldn't have been missed if they weren't there. The setting in general comes with its own set of issues. For instance, the decision to set the game in the 19th century is completely incomprehensible and detrimental. Adding this distance to the timeline effectively eliminates the chance of encountering the more famous canon characters and their relatives. Or hearing of their tales. Which would have allowed even those with a more peripheral association with the franchise to experience some nostalgia, ie from the movies. It makes even less sense if you consider that the game earns nothing from this timeline change. Hogwarts and the wizarding world is effectively stuck in the 19th century anyway. You could have set the game in the 21st century and almost nothing would need to change to accommodate for it. If anything that way even all the ridiculous forced diversity present would make somewhat more sense. Somewhat.Finally, there is combat. Lots and lots of combat. Seeing the bodycount the protagonist racks up I had to keep reminding myself that this is still based on a book for kids. Be that as it may, there are some interesting elements here. The variety of spells present can offer a number of ways to approach a fight. It all works out ok at first, but as you progress through the game and the battles become longer, it hits you. It is tedious. Spam all your spells, wait for them to recharge while avoiding the enemy, rinse and repeat. That's it. Thankfully, there is one specific build that is utterly broken and can be used to end nearly all fights much faster. It requires the use of the Dark Arts though. So if for RP reasons you opt not to go down that path, well sucks to be you. Personally, I'd rather sacrifice every goat I have at the altar of lord Voldemort, than sit through one of those long-winded fights again.All in all, this was a disappointment. I can't really say I hated the game, despite all its flaws, mostly because I couldn't muster enough of an interest to give a dime. For all the noise that surrounded it, it is just a bland open-world experience. One of those where you have a checklist and you just go from place to place on the map gathering collectibles. Granted, the art directors and artists do deserve an Oscar, but everyone else involved is up for a Razzle. Perhaps megafans of the franchise will appreciate the game for what it has to offer, a glimpse of the wizarding world. Still, as far as I'm concerned, Hogwarts Legacy commits the most cardinal of sins. It is boring. As such, not recommended."

And no one who is either of those qualities touched it. It's a sick thing in the media to try and paint anything negatively and they weave tales that suit whatever narrative. SO PLEASE DO NOT take those smear articles into consideration. It's not fair to the game creators at all who DESERVE the love for this game it has warranted. That aside, While the character customization is VERY lacking, and the characters look mostly 30 yrs old once in the game, and wanting to play a feminine pretty wizard or witch is nigh impossible due to the bad character customization, and how it maps the face in game (you always look like you are on drugs and have a stomach ache while smiling literally all the time) the game is still great. It's the best game I've played since Witcher 3, and I am thankful no early access on development, they did the RIGHT thing and waited until they could produce a COMPLETE product, without taking everyone's money for a semi finished product and hype. The game is beautiful, the story is interesting but not overwhelming. The things you can do are setting the bar for future games. I have played 20ish hours and only 20% through the game. It is refreshing to return to a time of polished, unrushed, complete games. I can't give it a 10 because of the characters looking so bad and the lighting on the hair making it look mostly bad if not darker tones, but this is a solid 9/10 from me."

Avalanche did an amazing job with this game, as it's exactly what I needed.For anyone who is review bombing this game due to J.K. Rowling. Yes, there are royalties that she receives. Yes, she was brought in to help with the game on a few occasions. But, the royalties are small, and the help she garnered was castle/world detail and that is all.

I both love it and hate it as a HP fan. Probably would have recomended it if it didn't crash every 4-30 minutes now. The first ~9 hours were fine, but now it crashes a lot. It feels like it wants to do the world justice, which it does in a lot of cases. But it absolutely doesn't in others.As said by others you don't feel like a Hogwarts student at all. Lessons are very much on the sideline, and only done to get access to some spells and potions. The 'Forbidden Forest' is forbidden, but for some reason you can just go wander into it without any problems. You just have to deal with some spiders and poachers from time to time. The world is gorgeous and Hogwarts itself is massive and you can really get lost there (if you dont use the quest tracker).At the same time it, Hogwarts and to a lesser extend the rest of the world, feels very empty. Yes there are other students and Peeves is doing his usual business but you can barely interact with it. Most of the interaction is meaningless and does not recieve any reaction from others in the same room. You can blast a firespell into a group of students and nothing happens. This makes the game really feel 'on rails'. In the 'Forbidden Forest' you encounter a lot of creatures who do not react to your presence at all! Yesterday I strolled passed a group of Centaurs and they didn't seem to notice me at all. The stuff that is there is very polished and works very well. The combat is fun and engaging. But after a while the things that you cannot do start to bother you. For instance, you can't jump over the railing of a staircase, there are invisible walls everywhere. What year is this? Let me fall to my death by jumping over a railing if I want to. Or at least make the wall look like it is some magic barrier, as if it is a magic protection. Now it just feels lazy.The RPG aspects are a bit shallow (maybe I am spoiled by Skyrim). I don't feel like I have a lot of choice in how to build my character. The gear feels very generic, the talents don't feel like impactfull choices. Just pick the talents for the spells that you use because it straight up upgrades them. I wish the options for combat were more varried. Now it is basically just blast spells. I think a lot more could have been done with potions, herbology, conjuration, transfiguration etc.The more I am thinking about it the more flaws I start to see. I am starting to sound like a salty old man (probably not too far from the truth ;)). But it feels like a game with so much wasted potential! Would probably be a 6.5/10 for me if it wasn't for all the crashes."

As one of many it has always been my dream to get a good Wizarding World game. I'm a huge fan of the Wizarding World and Harry Potter. From the books, to the movies and everything around it. And with a smile on my face I can say, this game does not disappoint.I went into the game with little expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. Is it perfect? Well no, but it’s everything I ever wanted from a Wizarding World game. Let’s first dive into the good stuff. The best part of this game is easily the world, and most importantly Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. Both are filled with details, things to explore and references to the movies and books. Of the whole world, Hogwarts itself is easily the best. I even dare to say it’s one off, if not the best location ever made in a video game. Everything is just right. It is full of secrets, puzzles, lore, details and things to explore, it’s correct in comparison to the movies and books and it feels alive. It’s just.. Perfect. The beautifully crafted world, together with great graphics and excellent sound design made exploring everything a joy. One of the games where I did not use fast travel the whole time. I would also like to give a little shout out to the devs for introducing seasonal changes. There’s not many Single player games out there that change the ambiance and decoration of the world based on the season.What the game also does right, is distributing content evenly across the length of the campaign/game. Even 20 hours into the game you’re still unlocking new mechanics, spells and locations. This made it not too overwhelming and constantly gave me a feeling there was still so much to do and dive into. I was also pleasantly surprised by how deep some of these (side)mechanics are. Even stuff that can be ignored completely like potion brewing, beast taming etc can go quite in depth.Combat is also much better than I expected. It never becomes repetitive, is challenging at times and enemies having various shields that need to be broken by specific types of spells, together with the player constantly learning new spells keeps it fresh.I’m also really happy they decided to put in something for everyone. From exploration to combat to flying on your broom to beast taming, to potion brewing and even building your room of requirement and various puzzles. There’s something for everyone to like.Now on to the less good points. The main story is rather weak if you ask me. Some side quests/stories are more interesting then the main story itself, and personally for me it just didn’t click. The missions you do are fun, and the locations you visit are great but the overarching story just didn’t do it to me. I also had trouble fitting it in the Wizarding World because the whole plot around which the story revolves has never been mentioned in any of the books/movies or whatever, and the way it’s proposed here, makes me feel it’s important and special enough to have been mentioned.As I said before, the world itself is well-made and fun to explore, and there is something to see around every corner, but for people who don’t care about 100% completion a big part of it is not interesting at all. I personally think they did well by introducing various puzzles, chests and enemy camps around the map. They don’t feel as repetitive as some other open world games, but in the end it is filler content. They should’ve made the main story take place a bit more around the map, but instead it was rather focussed on certain area’s.Also performance is, at the moment of writing, unstable on PC. I have a high end PC, and even though I run the game on 140fps+ most of the time, at times I get frame drops to like 20fps. Especially during combat this is really annoying and it breaks the immersion while exploring.I do think that if you strip the Wizarding World setting from the game, it’s still a good game, but nothing to write home about and in certain aspects quite average. The wizarding world setting and the attention to detail really is what makes this game.Overall, I would highly recommend this game. It’s not perfect but I think that everyone that even remotely likes the wizarding world/harry potter universe will absolutely love this game. Whether you’re a die hard fan, or just like the movies, you will love the references and attention to detail. The world they created, and especially Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are absolutely mind-blowing and set a new bar for developers."

The open world is a redundant part of this game. Also, the creation of potions was disappointing part because you do not participate in this process (a good example of how to do this more interesting is potions craft in Kingdom Come Deliverance).I hope developers will understand their mistakes and maybe will improve it in the future DLCs.P.S.

Whether travelling by foot, broomstick, or Hippogriff, Hogwarts Legacy is an indulgent treat of fantastical tourism for longtime Potterheads, marred only by occasional loading stutters and texture pop-ins that can snap you out of its immersive spell.Much of that fan service will inevitably be lost on series newcomers, of course, but even for those less versed in the wizarding world, Hogwarts Legacy has something to offer. Combat, in particular, successfully adapts the source material's spellcasting into a satisfying battle system that's as much a challenge to your reflexes and tactical skills as it is a spectacle of particle effects and flurrying physics.With over two dozen spells to learn, alongside more advanced actions such as parries and combos, it can be a little overwhelming at first, but – once mastered – Hogwarts Legacy's magical melees showcase both the brutality and the sophistication of wand warfare in a way that the films or books never quite could.This combat pairs nicely with the game’s role-playing progression systems, too, which allow your character to continually evolve across the hundreds of hours you could potentially spend navigating its world. Avalanche generously hands out rewards for your time at Hogwarts, no matter where you might decide to spend it, with a near endless bounty of cosmetic items, talent points, spells, and more to unlock throughout your excursions, both scholarly or otherwise.Not all of this loot holds equal weight or utility, but thankfully it's not the only carrot on the stick to keep you enrolled. The school is nothing without its inhabitants, and the class of 1890 are a rather brilliant bunch, its many pupils a pleasure to spend time with alongside the equally endearing faculty members. Charismatic teachers, such as the scene-stealing charms expert Professor Ronen, will keep you coming back to classes to learn, and there are plenty of other enigmatic figures to encounter, both within the depths of the school's many secret areas and beyond.Voice acting can be a little iffy in places (the male avatar, in particular, comes across as a strange mix of wooden and incredibly posh), and the dialogue doesn't always land — too often dumping lore on the player with reams of exposition — but these blind spots tend to be the exception, rather than the rule. On the flipside, Simon Pegg chews the scenery as uppity Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black, and the game's soundtrack is fantastic, building off and around John Williams' iconic score rather than overly exploiting it.More broadly, however, Hogwarts Legacy also falls into the same traps as many other big budget, open-world games of its type. With so many avenues for progression, the game can frequently overburden players with convoluted menu management work, as they become weighed down by multiple resource types that bloat out and needlessly complicate the experience.Equally, in a world this big, not every activity feels either important or enjoyable, and there are many spaces that feel unoccupied and lifeless, there for the sake of it rather than to provide any lasting value beyond the surface. Established fans will likely be willing to forgive these more prosaic features, but others may instead come away with the impression of a compromised game not quite able to hold up to the promise of its own ambition.Still, there were plenty of ways in which Hogwarts Legacy could have really botched the spell of delivering on an authentic wizarding power fantasy, especially one burdened by decades of expectations. Thankfully, by resisting the temptations of the live service model (or perhaps avoiding the cautionary tale set by 2020's Marvel's Avengers), Avalanche has conjured up a vision of Hogwarts that – for the most part – looks and feels worthy of its namesake.There may be tension at the seams where it tries to hold the sheer scope of its aspirations together, and its fan service can only do so much to patch over those gaps, but Hogwarts Legacy nonetheless succeeds as an easy – if uneven – time killer. Whether this is your first time to Hogwarts, then, or you already know the way from the Common Room to the Library like the back of your hand, Legacy offers a generous slice of role-playing escapism, not to mention a viable remedy for shaking off those late stage Winter blues."

Rejoice, fans of the Harry Potter universe and welcome to Hogwarts!I've purchased a Deluxe edition, so I had time to evaluate the game from many sides, run around the world, swim in the lake, collect jumping mushrooms, visit battles and start studying dark magic while many were waiting for the official release of the game. - it is incomparable here. Living leaves, grass, living surroundings, waves, paintings. Absolutely everything that caught my eye caused genuine delight. - it's just off the scale! I feel through the screen as if I really am a Hogwarts student. This is one of the few games where I listen to all the conversations of the characters, even if they are talking to each other and not to me. I look at the room, at the team of my faculty, at the world around me and I am absorbed. I didn't have such excitement about games after I passed The Witcher 3.When I'm playing, I want to play even more. ""No sleep, I have to see that village over there,"" and it's every time.The game absorbs, the game captures, the game gives you more and more new each time.  - with animation, of course, they tried. There is a lot of it! Moving chess, paintings (moving not only frames, but also images in them), foliage, grass, clothes. All elements have animation and physics. - let me just say that they delight me. I am amazed and in love. - you know, it's like plunging into real life, where you really do some important things, and not just running around in the form of: find and bring. Everything makes sense here. At least the main quests. They immerse you in the story without any problems, It tells you what is happening and what is needed from you.  - I got the impression that a real person, not a bot, is giving me a task. In conversations with NPCs, you can see their enthusiasm, anxiety, excitement, interest.

I thought for a long time and imagined how it would be implemented. It turned out that it was beyond praise. Again, I will say about the Witcher 3. Very similar emotions from the battle scenes. Spell combinations - you can choose your style of play: go ahead, or act covertly (as far as possible). - A huge number of skins and visual for the main character.• We have been waiting for this game for a very long time• Sometimes the game crashes without any errors. The picture just freezes and that's it, Crashed.Honestly, guys, I'm holding back a lot right now not to reveal all the cards about the game. Among my friends there are both fans of the Harry Potter universe and those who don't like this universe. But I haven't heard from any friend yet that he didn't like the game. We all bought a Deluxe edition and we all have similar emotions. Everyone is delighted.If in doubt about the purchase: watch videos or streams to get an idea.Most likely, I will add some new words in my review when I complete the game by 100%Hello to all Slytherins!"

Definitively worth a play if you liked either the books or movies. Spell cast fighting was way better than I thought it would be. The only complaint and problem I had was one serious glitch before the transfiguration class. Lost about 20 hours because I was relying on autosaves. Recommend not doing the side quests that pop up while waiting to start the class (or any class for that matter) and just doing the class. Doing so will prevent the glitch.9.3/10"

Would like to see the game optimized better but to say that the game is unplayable is simply a lie. Running a 3080ti and Im running the game at true 1440p and everything set to ultra and im averaging 60 fps in asset heavy areas. In caves or when Im exploring i get about 100. I was running the game at about 30 to 40 frames with ray tracing on at ultra and at the same settings so I suggest keeping that off. I see frame drops in demanding areas or when loading in a completely new area. People saying this game is literally unplayable are full of it. Unless youre someone that can only play a game at 100+ fps and must play at 4k with everything maxed out with ray tracing on. This is easily one of the best games Ive played in a long while. Theres so much to do and there is so much detail that was put into this game its crazy. Already invested 14 hours into the game and Ive still barely scratched the surface of the story. Highly recommend this game especially if youre a fan of the Harry Potter series. Im not a fanatic by any means but I seeing familiar faces and just seeing parts of the world that was in the films was really fun.

In fact, I haven’t been back to the castle in probably a month of in game time and no one is looking for me.  I don’t have to sneak out, I can wonder all hours of the night, no howlers saying get your butt back to class, and not even my friends are looking for me.  No one misses me at school when I’m meandering the countryside for days on end looking for landing platforms and astronomy tables.  Where is the struggle?  I should have to sneak past prefects and use hidden exits in order to leave the castle at night but alas, those only happen on main quest missions.  Other than that, it’s a free for all.  Second, okay developers what is up with the shadows going crazy all the time.  I have tried playing with all the settings but about an hour after playing the shadows and image layering go haywire.  I have played with settings and everything else, but still weird shadows.  Then I go from human to automaton vocally.  I chose the lower pitch male voice and randomly I sound like a robot.  To fix any of these things I have to completely close out the game and reboot.  Third, there are lots of things to do and at first I was stoked at all the content, but then…I was bored.  It feels like busy work.  There are 3-4 cave designs so once you’ve been down a couple you have been down them all and for very little gain as the gear doesn’t scale to your current level.  Merlin must not have been a clever man because the only challenging puzzle is the cube flipendo one that is more annoying than difficult.  Fourth, poachers and poaching.  So, I can capture a handful of magical creatures so I can harvest their fur, whiskers, and warts to upgrade my gear.  Other than the fact I’m not killing them, am I really any better holding them hostage in my only little menagerie?  I can also breed them and sell them to collectors isn’t that nice?  I must spend 15 minutes grooming and feeding these beasts to get materials which again feels like busy work.  I hate Farmville like timed elements.  Really, if they are giving me a house elf that I can’t free then maybe he should be doing all the feeding and caring and then once a day I can collect the materials from a box?  Then potions, honestly the only one I use is the health potion, because the battles are over before I have exhausted all my spells let alone pulling out a thunder brew.  If I can’t sell potions, then having my own greenhouse in the room of requirement is a waste of time, because I can find all the health potions I need in the world.Fifth, the little things.  I liked having to smack the wings off a key, but I didn’t like after finding everything it was an item that was far below my level so all I really get is a skin.  The prize must match the effort developers.  Scale the gear to level please!  So, here you are walking around at a normal pace in Hogsmeade listening to the sights and sounds enjoying the ambiance, I breeze into the tomes store and wham, I’m now walking like I’m thigh high in the swamps of sadness.  Developers, this is an unnecessary mechanic.  Keep the walking pace the same!  Conversation pace, I wish there was a 2x button because the dialog is slow.  I want to feel engaged enough to listen to their whole rants, but if my eyes can read faster then the pace of the dialog it’s a skip for me.  Speaking of dialog, I would have liked voices that are distinctly goblin and voices that are distinctly dark wizard.  They have variety with so many areas could they have had a distinction with those voices.  No need for a killing curse, because in the end they all die and disappear without ever having to use the killing curse.  If they disappear, they are dead in my book.  Lastly, brooms need stats.  I can’t tell the difference from one to the next, please tell me stats on brooms and why I should bother spending 5k on a broom.In conclusion, not quite sure this game was worth the price for pre-order as I never use my griffin to fly anywhere when a broom works just fine, I think I could have waited until the game was $30.  I wanted to love this game after reading all the books and watching the movies multiple times.  Yet, the more I played the more I became bored.  The side quests of caves, trials, and whatnot all became repetitive and the prizes really didn’t feel worth the effort.  The crafting elements felt unnecessary and I’m a person whose spend 800 hours building settlements in Fallout, so I LOVE building, but I was disinterested in the building mechanics in this game.  The potion crafting felt unnecessary, the beast collecting was another time waster but unfortunately necessary for materials to upgrade.  A game shouldn’t feel like a slog or like work.  I feel this game put in size to make it bigger but, it’s just a lot of time wasting vs. being engaging.Games are meant to be fun or at least have me feeling vested.  The only thing holding me to finish is the fact I paid money for the game.  I don’t even feel a need to do another play-through.  So note to future players, pick the house you want and play how you really want at the beginning because it makes little difference.  You can YouTube all the different endings without the tedium."

I did not read the books,  I watched the first movies 20 years ago because my girlfriend back then wanted to watch them. I did not care much. I dont remember both, neither the movies nor my ex gf.So I started Hogwarts Legacy and expecteded an average and typical open world game - just embedded into the Potter Lore with some neat stuff and NPCs and the typical quest structure.However, after playing the last days and only having finished the first parts I must admit that Hogwarts Legacy gave me RDR2, Skyrim and Deus Ex flashbacks.I did not anticipate having that much fun.Hogwards Legacy is an extraordinary game with astonishing love to details and so much passion. It is a great open world game, the scale sets the bar for immersion and atmosphere really high. I hope Ubisoft takes notes.Why or how is is so great: It is the exploration, the mechanics and how you interact with everything.The sense of wonder, the pure giddy joy that I get with each and every new quest and location, the choice of which activity I want to spend my current gaming session with, the view, the environment, the scale of this game, everything is so well done. The music fits, the sound fits, the fights are a mix of tactical approaches and pure chaos, I love it. The whole ambiente feels organic, it is an audiovisual masterpiece.All quests and storylines feel good and motivate to explore.  I never really get too invested in the story of a game, unless it's exceptional.And yes Hogwarts Legacy does not invent gaming new or again, but it was is exceptional enough in many segments that I find the story and characters interesting and I get dragged into this world.The last years I didn't think I could feel like this exitement and joy about games anymore, but Hogwarts Legacy has well and truly proven me wrong. Thank you Avalanche, Hogwarts Legacy is proof that games are indeed a work of art.It is a game about ""magic"" that feels magic in so many moments and left me in awe.This is now a 9 of 10 for me and a must buy and must play for Harry Potter fans. Some criticism:- The inventory management is not good.- Most of the time it runs buttersmooth, but in some areas and moments the fps go wild, I get everything from 120 Ultra Raytracing fps down to 50- despite the amazing world and ambiente you have to do the typical fetch and do this and that quests. Hogwarts Legacy uses the established recipe of open world ""go walk and work"" quests, so do not expect wonders here game design wise."

I first thought it was a shaders compilation problem but the stutters persist even after 15 hours of gametime. Also they seem to have NO plans for improving performance whatsoever and have barely adressed the issue. Don't buy this game unless you have a monster PC or are willing to deal with a painful port. Alternatively you can get it for consoles. Gameplay wise it is pretty fun and I wish I could recommend it to anyone."

Its minorly buggy. I managed to get myself massively OoB more than once, and have seen some minor graphical glitches. And it has Denuvo. If I had known I wouldnt have bought it. I was wondering why cutscenes ran like crap on High on my beast of a machine. Now I know. ♥♥♥♥ Denuvo. I'm not into Harry Potter at all, and know very little about it. I saw a couple of the movies like 20 years ago and I read one of the books. Comes off like very English ""magical"" whimsy. I got it because hey, I'm not into Spider Man either and I 100% it on the PS4 because it was that fun. I  had heard about how beautiful this game was, and I'm not seeing it. My machine can handle it on High. Should be able to handle it on Ultra. But frankly, it doesnt look that good even on High, everyones got kind of a wax doll look to them.Its still a fun AAA. And it *is* a typical AAA so expect all the handholding. Ive been playing From Software games lately, so going back I was surprised how easy it is and how everythings perfectly laid out for you and leads you by the nose. But I think thats just games in general nowadays. Still, its cute and fun. Everything is named stuff like Grindleblat and Snorkenplort or weird terms that sound *very* English to a North American. Playing this I can totally see why people got so into the world. Man, if I was 10 years younger I probably would have been into it too when it came out. Its worth a look even if youre not into Harry Potter. If you're OK with Denuvo that is. I'm not. Makes me want to sing yo ho ho and a bottle of rum when publishers put that crap on their games. And I am way not down with piracy. But Im also not down with publishers hamstringing their games for legitimate customers."

Time to write my review:I'm no Fan of the Harry Potter movies/Books, maybe only watched the movies once or twice.This game was a blast! I had almost the same experience as Elden Ring last year. This game felt like Elden Ring's Little sister and i loved it!Part of me wished there was no ending to this game. Because when i finished the main story i felt hollow inside knowing that the end was near. I Wanna keep playing this game, but with almost the Field Guide at 100% there's gonna be barely anything left to do then do Battle Arenas or raid Bandit camps over n' over. It is to early to ask already for DLCs,I Know Avalanche Software said that there are no plans atm for DLCs, but i atleast hope that the rumors and leaks of POTENTIAL DLCs for Quidditch and a Rumored Missing-Quarter of the map are true.This game is gorgeous and it be a waste to leave this game as it is now without DLCs.- The Combat is really well done- The Character customization is Decent- The amount of Freedom in this game is amazing!- The Outfits and enhancements are neat.I hope for DLCs in the FUTURE!"

The soundtrack is brilliant! I played the game in German and the translation was perfect. The voice actors did a good job I think :) After around 50 hours in the game I finished the main story line (I did some sidequest in that time, too) and I still have around 40% of sidequests, secrets and so on left to do. Also I think I have to play the story again, at least once more.If you like Harry Potter or the Harry Potter universe, magic, beautiful landscapes, a nice soundtrack and want to play an open world game - this is for you :)"

So, without further adieu, as for as AAA games goes, this one takes the cake (and eats it too).  Most AAA titles have been very disappointing, or lack luster.  They don't try new things, and I think HL sets a standard for that in the gaming community.Story: I loved it.  You're a student, and they don't just ""forget"" that fact and send you on a journey.  From classess, classmates, professors, and nearby villager problems, the game does a great job in melding and cohesively briing together a world.  Side quests, and companion quests also directly link to the main story, usually, in some way or another, and even those that don't, aren't necessarily bad.Side Quests: On the topic of side quests, thank goodness, there are not 7281 fetch quests.  Sometimes games, especially AAA games, fall into this rabbit hole of ""more is better"" and HL doesn't.  It spreads the quests out, and most usually have a unique story, or something driving them.  Sure, theres a fetch quest, but they aren't all the same *cough cyberpunk cough*.Side ""missions"": These are where HL lets us down.  Merlin trials, cairns, popping balloons, these are tedious, and unnecessary.  I'd rather half or even 1/3 of the Merlin trials, with actual complex puzzles.  Do better.Characters: Lovely, just lovely.  Each with a distinct personality, even side characters you meet once or twice are just full of life and vigor.  Love it.  There is one companion who gets shafted, I won't say who, but unfortunate.World: $%^# yes, its beautifully designed, flying is MAGICAL, and I truly mean that.  Magical beasts, plants, its all great.  Even decorating your rooms, the amount of features is astounding.Enemies/combat: While there are few enemies, each enemy has really neat interactions, if you're willing to learn them.  Specific spells that affect them, and ways to disable or deal massive damage.  This, along with the general combat, is fantastic.  More variety would be nice, but I do prefer less variety and quality and I think they made the right choice here.Overall, there are some improvements, but not many to say about this game.  I will, very briefly touch on the controversy and negative comments surrounding this game - don't be a bully and don't harass people and pretend you are better person for it.  Education, awareness, and joining local initiatives helps a lot more than hating someone for playing a game.  Do better."

The attention that has been paid to every little detail, the graphics are stunning and the gameplay and combat is phenominal.Pros:- The common rooms are STUNNING, the Hufflepuff common room is my favourite it's so earthy, cozy, hobbity and full of plants! The Slytherin common room is lavish and ornate, a bit cold feeling but beautiful. You can even see the kraken in the lake through the underwater windows sometimes.- There's actually so much space to travel, the area surrounding Hogwarts is all open to fly to and filled to the brim with things to do, Merlin trials, dungeons, chests, secrets.- The entire castle is absolutely gorgeous, the textures of the materials used are also amazing, granite, gold, wood. Incredibly lavish and intricate. - The room of requirement is highly customizable, even down to the ambience of the room, dark and gloomy, bright and cozy.- There is full trasmog built into the game, you keep the appearance of anything picked up and can change the look of any item equipped, for free, at any point. Also the uniform options look awesome.- I wasn't sure how the combat would turn out but it's actually SO GOOD! And the talents you unlock later really make you feel so powerful!Cons: (most are super minor!)- There's some issues with performance but there are fixes out there that work and my game is incredibly stable after them.- You don't really have much reason to go back to the common room, you can't sit on the chairs or sleep to pass time.- Some voice lines are reapeated too often, like the floo network lady and Deek. Like I'm glad you're proud of me but you don't need to tell me 50 times a day you wholesome bugger.9.5/10 childhood dreams come true and absolutely worth the price!"

Everything is an illusion.The RPG elements barely exist - no meaningful relationships and no repercussions for negative player behaviour. Every character that you encounter feels more or less the same, there's very little soul to them. Classes have no depth to them, either just a short cutscene starts, or you learn a new spell and amaze everyone in the class in 30 seconds. Then you're out. No quidditch, plants and potions are pretty limited (less than 10 of both) The Room of Requirement feels like a chore with the low wait times, if you want to be efficient you basically have to go back every half an hour to check on things. The game runs horribly on PC - these graphics have no business making 30 series cards sweat one bit - yet they do, with constant fps drops and overall bad performance. Movement feels clunky, I dread every moment where I have to swim or do parkour. Getting around with the broom is frustrating too, if you don't have a huge grassland under your ass, you'll have trouble landing. Enemies are repetitive and shallow. Puzzles are kindergarten level with no thinking involved. The only time you can't solve a puzzle is because you haven't progressed far enough yet to get the required spell. The only positive things I can mention about this game is Hogwarts and Hogsmeade - they are made really well - although they are also the most stuttery parts of the game which takes away from the enjoyment. The combat feels good too, it doesn't surprise me that these 2 points were the main marketing materials, every other rough part of the game was hidden. Combat also suffers by the extremely broken mechanism that is stealth. After you unlock it you can just wander around camps and one shot everyone for the rest of the game without having to engage in real fights much. This is on the hardest difficulty too. This game had so much potential but at it's current state it's nothing more than cash grab bullcrap for mindless Harry Potter fans who'll defend it with tooth and nails. The game will hopefully get actually developed in the coming years, just like Cyberpunk and the new Warhammer. Looks like nowadays this is the standard for game developers: cash-in early with a game you can barely call early access, then take your sweet time adding all the missing things.I hate that the game is what it is, I wanted to love it so bad - but it crossed a line where I can't turn a blind eye. I will still 100% it and wait for future updates, but my dissapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. I feel sorry for the people who's standards are met with the ability of being able to pet mutant looking cats."

The world is beautifully designed but feels very hollow after a few hours due to the lack of story and consequence. As others have mentioned the main character is overpowered, which wouldn't bother me too much as I tend to be more of a casual player, except there is just no depth of story to the game or even interesting puzzles to compensate for it. On sale it might be worth a few hours of ""wee I'm a witch/wizard"" but the game falls pretty flat after that. I am having a hard time even remaining interested in the story after unlocking most of the spells. There is absolutely no point to most of the side quests or tasks other than experience farming and as mentioned the main character is already overpowered so what is the point... The Merlin trials are extremely repetitive and don't offer much benefit. I hardly noticed any difference in broom performance after completing the upgrades. It all just falls very flat for me.Performance has been pretty crap as well. I happened to upgrade PCs midway through playing: On my old GTX 980 rig the game ran smoothly, but textures would frequently fail to load causing the graphics to look PS2 era. I recently upgraded to a new RTX 3080 setup and the graphics look great, but I am still noticing a bit of stuttering regardless of my settings.Aesthetics - A+Story - MehGameplay - very meh"

No amount of reviews can explain how beautiful and immersive the game is, you really have to try it yourself. It's really massive and it is everything I expected as a fan of Harry Potter and an open world game like this. I could spend days just exploring Hogwarts Castle alone and I'd only be scratching the surface. The battle system is extremely fun and addicting too! It was such a surprise to use unexpected spells and combine them with other spells during combat, not to mention a lot of combos. Oh and how much I love the main story quest, it's as if I'm watching a movie yet at the same time I am in it. Love the game, years from now this is a game I will still come back to."

I also appreciated the implementation of the fight system and the many ways in which you could engage with enemies. However, I was disappointed with the absence of a moral system in the game, as the choices you made in the dialogues did not have any real impact on the NPCs' reactions. I'd like want that my choices to have real consequences for me and a greater sense of moral ambiguity and complexity in the game's dialogue options.Despite this shortcoming, I still found the game to be a good experience overall, especially for fans of the wizarding world. As a game studio's first attempt at this type of game, it is impressive, even if it wasn't entirely unique.I must say that the attention to detail in creating a believable magical universe is remarkable. I really liked the exploration of this world."

A great game if you like the series. They definitely nailed the setting and the combat. Another highlight is the soundtrack. The story is okay but could be a bit more fleshed out (don't expect a deep RPG). Some great ""wow"" moments though with the set pieces. Tons of side-content that varies in quality. It's all optional so you can skip the usual open world filler (and frankly, there's quite a lot of that). From a technical standpoint the game looks great and runs well for me, but I have a beefy PC.Strongly recommended if you like making cows do 360 mid-air flips with your magic."

Speaking strictly on the game itself...The PROS:This is a HUGE love letter to fans of the books and films alike. And if you've obsessively read and watched all the Potter media you can consume, like I have since I was but a wee babby, you're going to enjoy it that much more. Hogwarts is a character in its own way, just as much as Harry, Ron and Hermione are, and the people who made this game's version of the famous wizarding school know that. Every single nook and cranny and centimeter of flooring oozes detail. I turned off my minimap and quest directives (I cannot recommend this enough to any player) and let myself get lost in the castle. See a door? Well, it's not a painted wall. You can go through that door, if there's no lock on it (if there is, come back later once you have the spell sponsored by LockPickingLawyer). Every single floor is explorable. It's insane how large Hogwarts feels.The paintings on the walls play music and converse. I walked into the central hall and was gobsmacked by the angry visage of a dragon animated in the stone walls. I chased flying books about like an idiot and had a grand time. I pet every single cat I could see. I ran after a pair of ghosts in a domestic violence incident. I turned a corner, and watches Peeves slap a stack of books out of a student's hands and whip down the hallway, cackling maniacally. When I entered the lavatory, a mirror complimented me on how amazing I looked, and then when I came in later, it told me I had a gross face. Animated suits of armor push and shove each other and make movements in your periphery. Students chatter on about rumors of your adventures and whatever story beats you've finished. I have yet to see one of these random events repeat.Combat is flashy, snappy, and oh-so-much fun. Some complained about how boring and silly the wand combat was in the movies. Worry no more! Once you unlock talents and start investing points into your spells, it gets more visually bright, more chaotic and varied with each point you spend (I suggest first getting the talents that allow more spells to be assigned to the D-pad so switching on the fly is much less annoying). There’s potential for a variety of playstyles here, and I've barely touched any of it yet.If I’d not known who was composing the music for this game, and you told me that John Williams did the scoring, I would have believed you 100%. The folks who worked on the score have clearly done their homework. There's many nods to the film's iconic themes, the instrumentation and style follows directly in Williams' footsteps. It really is that good. It feels like a natural extension of the tracks we've come to recognize from JW, but still easily stands on its own. Sound design is straight outta the movies. It’s a treat.The world is fit to bursting with content. I've only just got to the point in the game where I've unlocked the majority of the main features, and I'm at a loss of where to start. Fly about the castle and admire its architecture? Be a loot goblin and bash down every door looking for someone's private stash? Be a Newt Scamander and care for the magical beasts? Become proficient in the Dark Arts even though it is strictly against my moral code? Obsessively find the best pieces of furniture to decorate my little slice of home in the Room of Requirement? Explore the Forbidden Forest? There is no shortage of things to do. In fact, there's so much to do that it may feel a little overwhelming. Which brings me to...The CONS:While the game is full of things to do and see, much of the content outside the walls of the castle can become predictable. Fetch quests, deliveries, there's a bajllion collectables to find... I've seen people liken this game to Assassin's Creed: Valhalla in this regard, and I can't say I disagree. The Scottish Highlands did not have anywhere near the same amount of attention given to it as Hogwarts did (I can't blame the developers, entirely, there was hardly any source material to build off of outside Hogwarts/Hogsmeade). While the game opens up to the rest of the world fairly early on in the story, you may be like me and not find yourself out in it too much, because it's just not nearly as enjoyable to experience it. The majority of characters are pretty forgettable. I've got a few favorites (harm a hair on Natty or Garlick's heads and I will riot), but even those characters aren't ones that are going to be iconic in any way. I haven't been terribly impressed with the story, either. It’s an average tale, but set in the wizarding world, so at least it's got magic in it. But the tutorial portion of the beginning of the game? Wowza. Wish the rest of the story could be as exciting as that, but regretfully, that doesn't seem to be the case so far. I'm hoping I can come back and update this review about how wrong I was.Everyone and their mother on this Steam page is aware of the performance issues on PC. I don’t doubt it's really bad. Avalanche needs to get in gear and fix these problems ASAP. The PC port has obviously not gotten the same QA as the console versions. Maybe I'm just really lucky, but I have not had any significant performance hiccups, crashes, or glitches (although with this game, you can call the glitches magic!) except twice: entering the Owlery (I probably had 5-8 FPS for a good ten seconds), and the first few seconds of the sorting ceremony cutscene stuttered. That's it! I've had a pretty blissful ride thus far, and I'm working with specs that just barely pass the minimum requirements.Sadly, the NPC's are just as detrimental to the immersion in the game as they are a compliment. While I enjoy eavesdropping on all their conversations, they don't really do anything outside their little bubble within a short range. They don't go to dinner in the Great Hall, they don't go to classes and sit down, and they have very limited interaction with the player’s presence and actions. Actually, I think there's the possibility that the students and faculty get raptured every night, because when I go to my dormitory after dark... every single bed is empty. All the classes are empty. Halls are empty. The Castle is silent, save for the ghosts and armor and portraits. It's rather disconcerting. Where did they go? Why, Avalanche, why are they not able to rest their weary heads at night? How am I supposed to stand over their beds and breathe down their necks if there's no one to stand over? Red Dead Redemption 2 set the precedent for AI pathing and behavior. This game ain't meeting that bar. It tried to jump and busted a kneecap on the bar.In conclusion...It's been a long, long road to get a Wizarding World game in my hands where I can be a witch and get my own wand and an assigned House that isn't stuffed with predatory IAP. It may not be the immersive RPG experience of going to classes and getting to know your peers like a lot of us hoped for, but we have come a long way from Harry Potter on the PS1. I’ve had an unreasonable amount of excitement while playing this, and I can’t thank the developers enough for giving me such a special experience. This game is like biting into a fresh, warm pumpkin pasty and taking a swig of butterbeer. It's so delightful and cozy and FUN.It gets a solid 8.5/10 from me. TL;DR: I have not had a single hour where I didn't have a gigantic, stupid smile on my face for a prolonged period of time. I may need an ambulance. My face hurts. This game's amazing and it's made me forget my need to drink water and eat food to live. I've reverted to the wide-eyed, magic-obsessed seven year old reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone on a beanbag in the library. Only Hogwarts Legacy can sustain me now."

I was blown away when I first saw Hogwarts and how insanely detailed and alive it felt. The combat was challenging and very fun with the limited spells that I knew early on. After a few hours of exploring I found that while the castle and surrounding area are very vibrant and alive, there is zero immersion. You're not a Hogwarts student, you're a protagonist who lives in a talking castle. You don't get to actually do anything in the castle. You can't sit at your house table and eat breakfast in the great hall. You don't receive/lose house points for anything. You don't get to participate in any classes, instead you watch a cutscene and get some random quest, which will reward you with a spell. You can't PLAY QUIDDITCH. Every character in the game talks ♥♥♥♥ about the headmaster for not letting them play quidditch because Avalanche even knows that it should already be in the game. Why do you start as a fifth-year? Imagine getting a game like this with seven years of being a Hogwarts student. Instead you're a fifth year and that year never ends, you just stop going to classes.The end of the game was the most disappointing for two reasons.1. As I got towards the end of the game I started to get excited again because all of the quests are preparing you for and leading to your O.W.L.'s. I thought at least I'll get to do this interactive quest to test my knowledge of the HP universe and of the game that I just spent 70 hours on. It's a cutscene. And your character isn't even in it. You don't get grades. All it means is that there are only side quests left to do. 2. All of your choices leading up to the ending mean nothing. It doesn't matter if you learned unforgivable curses and tortured people in front of your teacher, or if you refused to learn any dark magic. You just pick which ending you want and watch a cutscene. If you pick the ""bad"" ending there are no consequences and nobody knows that you made that choice. Maybe my expectations were too high. I'm a massive Harry Potter fan. I listen to the audiobooks when I drive, when I'm falling asleep, when I'm walking my dog, all the time. I've read/listened to the books at least 15 times but I honestly don't know how many its been at this point. I understand why so many people absolutely love this game because it is fun, but it's lacking so much that I don't think I'll be able to force myself into playing again just to see a different common room."

Weather has natural changes which is great (not the same weather everyday like some games. COMBAT: Not turn based (thank you!) its real time! Lots of options with combat, dogding, teleporting, blocking and great magic spells. There's also options of stealth, pokemon type plant helpers, potions, the works! The combat and overall gameplay was really thought out. Great level up system too with choosing your playstyle on a tree system (for those who are familiar with assassins creed tree system types).GRAPHICS/ENVIRONMENT: Gorgeous! I have a really really old computer so the specs are below requirement. I had a bit of lag issue (my fault) however I got some memory sticks (min 16GB) to help with that, and instantly the issues were resolved. I would definitely recommend to have at least 16GB to really enjoy the beauty in the game. Besides that everything else was awesome, I love the soft touches and feel to the overall look of it (reminds me ALOT of Fable). The effects are epic with the magic spells and combat, the decor is enchanting with all the pictures and items that move and talk and quack (yes quack). Such a beautiful game I can't express it enough, you'd have to see it for yourself!++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Summary: Overall I'm very impressed with this game, I feel as though there will be many updates in the future to help iron out any further bugs that may arise (I haven't come across any just yet), but overall I really really really recommend this game for anyone that loves a good story, adventure and magic!! Thank you for this game its really great so far!"

This game gets voted down because of the creator of the IP. Yes, what she did is wrong, but the only relation she has to this is the royalties. This is a game made for Harry Potter fans, and is easily enjoyable by everyone. You can like something without liking who made it. Ignore all those who are trying to oppress and shame you for wanting to play this, their views on this are faaar too ironic to be taken seriously.Now, about the game. I'd give it an 8. It's a fantastic game, but the sheer lack of enthusiasm coming from the main character's voice ruins what could be an amazing story. In my opinion, the side quests are what make this game. This is the first time in a while that I actually enjoyed side quests and side stories, they are so well done and the characters (for the most part) are so well written.I would give this a 9 if it weren't for my own expectation. I was under the belief that the story would be affected by what house you are in. This is only the case in one quest (Hufflepuff has the best version of this quest imo). Other than that and a few dialog lines, your house doesn't make any difference.I completed the story in 28 hours, which included faffing around and side quests, so I probably could have done it in under 25. Usually when I finish the story, I stop playing the game, but I still actively want to complete the side quests, regardless of there being nothing to gain.TLDR; Ignore the haters and the reviews that deduct points due to JKR, this game is a solid 8/10."

Ah, turns out he was gazing at a magical projection of some sort of cosmos - there is just so many little to big things of interest in the world to explore, I find it very refreshing - as in recent years, big games like hitman make a big world but there isn't as much depth and surprise in terms of exploration.I also appreciate how they blended the tutorial into the story-tellin, it was not a boring ""here is a training yard, practice this, that and those, then start playing your game"".The few interactions I had with the available characters were good in terms of different personalities and considering the dialogue, I look forward to learn more about them in the future.The developers really did a great job with this game, and if they do decide to make another with say, one of the other magic schools in the HP world, I'd be in even if I'm not particularly a fan."

I would also not recommend tweaking with the character voice, only the standard ones work well in general. The combat is one of the strongest points in this game, while a lot of people talked about how ""basic"" the combat feels, all the movement, spells upgrades, you can basically set up what combo works best for yourself and just have fun with it, the combat feels very dynamic and fast, you can work your way by dodging attacks or parrying, you can move enemies around the battlefield, you can handle any encounter your own way.Personally, I would recommend following a bit of the main story until you unlock more spells, but you can always just do whatever you want in the map and go back to that later.This is probably one of the ""must"" have games for this year, and you're not going to regret getting this one, it's one of the few triple A games that are worth the full price."

Though they have only just begun their first year at Hogwarts, they have, within their first week, mastered a sufficient number of spells to be undefeatable in combat.When they are not wiping the floor with battle-hardened dark wizards, Protagonist is routinely breaking and entering into private homes, stealing everything that is not nailed down. Why does no one react to being robbed blind in broad daylight you may wonder?I mean, what exactly do you expect people to do?Would you speak up if a murderous lunatic showed up in your place, a lunatic who, I should remind you, spends their time off burning poachers alive and smashing goblins into hard objects? A lunatic who has access to an ancient magic with which they can literally disintegrate you with the flick of a wrist?No, you stay quiet. You may laugh nervously. You comment on how Alohomora really is a neat little spell, and you pray that the insane person leaves your house as quickly as possible. You try to pretend that a shiver is not running down your spine as they beam at you happily after rifling through your underwear. You see, Protagonist is a high-functioning sociopath, perfectly capable of keeping up appearances in society. They really liked your grandmother’s old robes and they’re totally making off with them, but they’ll wish you a good day as they leave your house.Rumours spread in the Valley of a terrifying new evil with a cheerful voice and an unhealthy obsession with wild animals …///What I’m trying to say here is that the ludonarrative dissonance is real.The game also performs absolutely atrociously. Since early access the constant stutter has improved marginally, but it’s still extremely noticeable and disruptive. With my 3080 I had expected to be able to turn on RTX (while playing at 1440p), but that essentially makes the game unplayable. Further patches are necessary and I am wondering why no NVIDIA driver update for the game has dropped yet.Wait, is the “recommended” rating a mistake?It is not, actually. I adore this game! Like many others, I grew up with Harry Potter – reading the books, then watching the movies, and even though JKR has spectacularly ruined her own reputation, I still feel a great deal of nostalgia for this world.And Hogwarts Legacy delivers. It is the colours that are just right, it is the broom-flying, the nods and references, the sheer detail in Hogwarts castle. The story is nothing ground-breaking, but pretty decent. The side quests are not hugely boring. I actually like that the “puzzles” can be done in two minutes, it gives the game a nice flow. Combat is definitely fun. Hogwarts Legacy is hella cozy and I’m loving it.There are some gripes I still have with the game – the low amount of gear slots, the lack of interaction with the school, certain quests that are really dark in tone which none of the characters seem to acknowledge – but this is mostly nitpicking.Overall, Hogwarts Legacy is really good, actually. Who would have thought?"

They've done a good job of recreating Hogwarts and it is honestly really cool being able to fly around and above the castle on your broom seamlessly. I had fun in my first several hours playing the game just exploring the castle and the areas outside around the castle like hogsmeade. The more you progress though the more you realise how little the game has to offer. One of the biggest offenders is how lifeless the world feels with the lack of interaction in general. I compare it to Bully which came out 17 years ago now. When you walk around the school in Bully it feels like you are a part of that world. There is a time mechanic where you need to get to class on time and go to bed on time etc. All the NPC's have their routine they're following making you feel like the world is moving regardless of you being there rather than it feeling like the world is waiting for you like it does in Hogwarts Legacy. The difference between the level of interaction compared to a game released in 2006 is honestly really sad but that's just one of my many complaints. The general lack of role playing is also a big issue, you don't feel like a student in this world at all. You go to class like less than a dozen times from what i recall just to learn spells so you can go on mass killings in the world. The story and writing in general is lackluster, lack of well written characters to latch on to and connect with to pull you through the story. Main character has no personality. No consequences for your actions and choices have zero impact on the outcome in the end. Combat gets extremely repetitive and tiresome. The R2/RT spam is ridiculous i felt like i was on autopilot throughout most of the combat. The lack of enemy variety didn't help either. The gear system is terrible because of the level scaling making exploration pointless knowing you will never find a really good item that will last you dozens of hours because everything is scaled to your level. There is nothing interesting to see outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade because of all the bland check list side activities they've added to pad out the length. Boring level and puzzle design in the caves and dungeons. UI feels like it's ripped straight out of a modern Ubisoft game. Graphics are inconsistent, sometimes it looks like a good looking PS4 game and other times it looks like an early PS3 game. The performance is awful because of the amount of VRAM it uses, i had to find a fix online for my RTX 3070 8gb because it ate all my VRAM like it was nothing. Maybe it's justified if the game looked amazing but it doesn't. The game overall doesn't feel like it's a full price Triple A game, it feels like a budget title. Makes sense that the developers last game was Cars 3. 4/10 (Mediocre)"

If you really like Harry Potter, then it'll be the best game you've ever played. If you are a normie like me, then it's just a decent game. Not going to blow your mind or anything. The biggest praise I can give this game is that it's clearly high effort. The devs cared about the atmosphere of Harry Potter, about details, about characters, about making a diverse and interesting cast.Gameplay-wise, it is as close to the Bully sequel as we are going to get. Go in with this expectation, not expecting Red Dead Redemption: Wizard or Hogwarts: Torment.Technical issues: no glitches so far. The game is mostly running well on Ultra, but occasionally chugs when it needs to load nearby areas.The bad: voice modulator should have been cut. It's so bad and audibly artifacted. The Trans Character is obviously a female VA with a voice modulator and it sounds as bad as when it's applied to you. The menus are also pretty slow to use, especially when you need to go over the map screen, which takes time to load.The keyboard controls end up being too clunky for comfortable comment - better use the controller.Overall - it's a very solid 6/10 AAA game. Better if you are a big Potter fan."

Solid 7, maybe 7.5 out of 10. The game looks good and plays solid. I loved flying around, busy world with lots to explore and to do. So why not higher than that? Due to two major reasons: 1. You basically don't have any impact on the world and vice versa. The world is not responsive to your situation. Examples in spoilers: -  -  -  -  2. Story writing can be so. much. improved....- - - These are, in my opinion, things the developer should work on for a possible game 2. They are, in my opinion, reducing the possible replay-ability to almost zero and stop making it an RPG. But overall, it was a very enjoyable game!"

Most upset that you can't just be Hermione and study super hard and learn all of the spells without progressing through the main story, which I found predictable and boring. ""Open world"" my ass. Exploring around and running into locked doors constantly you can't unlock until halfway through the story is not magical. UI requires many extra clicks to get where you want, with slow loading times. I have a state of the art brand new computer and it's crashing constantly.The characters are designed very simply (compare them with something like Dragon Age for example, where even the humans have unique features and strong personalities that are woven into the design) and with poor animation. Their stories are interesting but they have maybe only a line or two of extra dialogue if you want to talk to them more at any given moment. A fair few things are copied over from the movies, while so many things that would be amazing moments or references aren't there.Good combat. I was surprised about that. I would probably rate it slightly positively 6 or 7 out of 10 without the crashes. But feel like it's worth a negative review while those remain."

It is a beautiful crafted world with environments that contain many secrets. The visual effects are top notch and the shaders look absolutely gorgeous. It definitely gives the right magical feeling to this game. Even though it is called Hogwarts Legacy, the world map is far more massive than just Hogwarts. You will have a blast exploring and traveling. The graphics are top notch and definitely live up to the new ray tracing standards especially when maxed out. The story so far definitely fits in the Harry Potter universe and can feel a bit cliché at times due to that. The gameplay is very enjoyable and the magic battles (so far) feel quite snappy and smooth. There is still a lot for me to discover, but for now it definitely lives up to what had been promised. The puzzles vary in difficulty and some require magic in order to be solved. I think that the diversity makes it fantastic.This game is what I dreamt of as a child."

The developer has nothing to do with the author in question (or their beliefs) and has made it clear until they are blue in the face.Think instead that:If you like the Wizarding World you'll love this.If you want a fantastic open world RPG that captures the feeling of the books/films, you'll love this.If you have many hours to spare and want to get all the trophies for this game...get more hours from somewhere. You'll need them!I was a little flippant about the game when I heard that it was being made. It looked nice in the trailers but it was from a company with no real track record for games like this, so my hopes were not high.What the developer released was one of the finest games I've ever played. Not because it's perfect - it's not. There are various technical issues that still need addressed and every game needs improvement somewhere after all.No, it's one of the best games I've ever played because it made me laugh, cry and shiver with excitement with those 'hairs on the back of my neck raising' moments that rarely happen nowadays. It's because they nailed the atmosphere and packed so much in to the game that it made my head spin. Thankfully they also released all of that content in a very measured way so that you didn't get swamped with too many things at once.The flying is so much fun once you get the hang of it. The battles (especially if you follow the objectives handed out to you before each fight to earn collectables in-game) are very well done and can get increasingly manic as time progresses.The side missions are interesting because you are given the time to bond with many of the characters, and even the shorter side missions have lovely connotations, like going back to a hamlet and having the people thank you for your help as you walk/fly by.There is a remarkable sense of detail on every level of the game and it all feels so magical.The music needs a mention too, because it changes dynamically and adds to the ambience, creating an adventure you'll remember for a long time.Well done to Avalanche Software (not to be confused with Avalanche Studios) for blowing me away."

When I stop playing Hogwarts Legacy I look forward to the next time I boot up the game and return to the Wizarding World. Hogwarts Legacy is like Skyrim is for me, hours evaporate in the blink of an eye while you are in game without realizing that so much time has passed.I played Hogwarts Legacy on a Win10 Pro machine with an i7-8700, 16GB of DDR4, and an NVIDIA RTX 2070.  The only tech issues that I experienced were during the early access period when I would get random frame rate drops. The frame rate issue was almost completely resolved on my rig by the official release week patch. Hogwarts Legacy does use Denuvo anti-piracy software so I wouldn’t doubt if many of the performance issues reported by players stem directly from Denuvo.The story is fun, the game play and mechanics feel solid and polished and the wand combat is dynamic and fulfilling resembling what we saw in the Harry Potter movies. Avalanche gave us a polished, feature complete game which is quite the feat considering the unfinished, feature incomplete, broken state that most games launch in the era of Live Service Gaming. There are also added features where if you link your Wizarding World account with the game it will import your house, your wand and patronus from the website which is a really nice bonus. You can choose to manually select a house instead of using your Wizarding World house that you were sorted in so player agency is still king. Avalanche did a wonderful job faithfully recreating the world described in the books and shown on screen in the Harry Potter movies. It felt wonderfully nostalgic wandering through the corridors of Hogwarts discovering new areas and seeing deftly placed fan service Easter eggs from Harry Potter lore.The open world feels vibrant and full unlike today’s staple generic empty Ubisoft open world design that we’re all so tired of. Side quests feel organic to discover and fun to do so they don’t feel like open world busy work. The NPCs have actual personalities and conversations with them don’t make me want to spam the next button to end the conversation. I actually want to fly around on my broom and discover every inch of the open world, explore new areas and dungeons and I look forward to my next combat encounter. I even enjoy caring for and breeding beasts and growing/brewing plants to make potions in the room of requirement.Enemy variety comes in predictable pre-assigned varieties, especially when fighting the Goblins; the Ashwinders have a bit more variety in my opinion. There are also infamous foes that you encounter which offer a bit more variety but generally play similarly to other foes of their faction. Despite having only a finite number of enemy archetypes like most games, the combat remains engaging and fun and spell combos can really up the damage as certain spells synergize best with other specific spells such as the Glacius/Diffindo combo.Let’s address the elephant in the room, yes Hogwarts Legacy is much more diverse than the 19th century United Kingdom was, and even more diverse than the Harry Potter movies were in the 2000s, however it doesn’t detract from the game or the story and its easy to head cannon that perhaps the wizarding world had more migration due to their smaller numbers and a closer knit society. Basically it’s a non-issue that shouldn’t affect one’s enjoyment of a stellar fantasy game.Overall I give Hogwarts Legacy a 9\10 for giving Harry Potter fans a mostly lore accurate, feature complete, fun, and engaging game. My hope is that Avalanche gives us future expansions to Hogwarts Legacy so the adventure can continue."

Spoiler-less review.My, my where to even begin. I did not expect this at all, lately I've had terrible luck with pre-orders and I said to myself if this game is trash, its the last time I'll pre-order anything. Well its my most played game in February, I've never played a single player game for so long and nothing else (not counting the Steam Deck). Although I'm glad I've finally finished the story and I can get back to playing other games again, there's this cool afterglow that I don't know how to explain. Usually I'd be sad after finishing a great game, but this time it hits different, like has my search for a great game come to an end?I won't straight up and tell you that this game is GOTY 2023, its up in the top 3 possibly yes, but there's another one coming out in December that I'm keen to play, question is if it will have what it takes to compete with this one in less than a month?Now on to the actual game, I won't go into any spoiler-ish details, but I'll say that the supposed 'Good' ending felt a bit dry, like there wasn't any recognition for my hard work and I would've rather chosen the 'Bad' ending. I haven't watched all endings yet and I got spoiled by people that are not to be named, so there's that.

However, I also had my fair share of game crashes, sometimes even locking Steam so I'd have to restart my PC. Worse is the configuration.While I praise HL for most of its accessibility options, a couple of basic things are missing. FOV is limited and camera distance is not adjustable. After only a couple of minutes I'll have a headache and become dizzy. I managed to increase the FOV beyond the norm by editing the config file but this made the game run very poorly in many situations and the compromise still made me dizzy after only an hour. Even worse, you can not turn off antialiasing (something that would improve perfromance drastically) and the only possible AA modes for me are DLAA (which sucks) and TAA (wich sucks even more), both methods leave artifacts on the screen that just don't look pretty at all.Storytelling:I will not spoil anything, but it sucks. The story line itself might be okay in the end since I only played about half of it but there are serious deficits here. First, it doesn't quite make sense to me. Now, I read 5 of the books, saw the 8 movies, and I still don't quite understand whats going on. It all seems random, dull, and worst of all: slow. Quests are extremely linear and when I was exploring and doing side quests many dialogues or voice lines didn't make any sense (referencing characters I hadn't met yet, telling me to do things I already did, getting thrown into an advanced side quest I stumbled upon with no idea what to do, that kind of stuff) and the characters and how they act don't seem relatable or believable. Also a lot of the quests start with following a NPC to a certain spot after teleporting to the NPC. Following slow moving NPCs isn't my idea of fun or immersive storytelling.The worst part is that you are forced to complete tons of story and quests before you can actually progress further in the open world. If I could have skipped the story and just walked around doing wizard fights, that's what I would have done and I would probably not have refunded the game.Character:While visual customization is a strong point, I could not connect to my character at all. Visuals is all you can choose. The dialogue options, The way my character talked, it all alienated them from me as the player. Its so frustrating because it seems so superficial. If you're making me create my own character, and then force decisions and personality on them, that feels strange. Either let me have control over who my character is or have me play someone who fits the story you want to tell the player.Also, for some reason, we are the innately super special magic awesome person and everything revolves around us. Never have to ask for a favor, always being offered help, everyone always has time exclusively for us or cant be interacted with at all. Just feels very synthetic.Controls:The standard layout is a bit weird, but you can reassign and customize controls so that's not the issue. My biggest issue here is feedback. Combat feels great in general, but sometimes I don't know why I died. I played on hard and most times it was perfectly fine, even taking out bosses beyond my level. But in other fights I was dodging, shielding, and then died. normally when you die, the character falls to the floor. I got death screens with my character running and jumping and rolling that very moment on multiple occasions. With no idea what killed me, or when. I am not sure if this is actually a serious bug but it got really annoying.Music:It does not include quite the same soundtrack from the movies, its very different, albeit a similar theme. That was disappointing for me. Graphics:The overall gameplay graphics are good, see later. However, the cutscenes and ""cinematics"" are a joke. Cutscene animations are terrible, sometimes not even starting in the uncanny valley, most are far from out of it. The textures and models are perfectly fine but there are always some details or animations or effects that shed light on the worst possible parts of the cutscene. The cinematics are just plain bad. I play on native 4k, 60hz and the short season change movie is highly compressed 1080p 30hz garbage. From a full price title in 2023 I expect far better.World Objectives:There are a lot of things to do in and around Hogwarts and that's good. Sadly it's a lot of copy and paste.  Most enemies and puzzles do reset completely when you go away too far, and by that I mean about 30 meters. I've seen a Troll actually vanish and respawn on the hill behind it. I've seen puzzle elements do the same thing. Its annoying and wastes time, breaks immersion and adds nothing to the gameplay. I cant multitask, I cant kite enemies. Why build a big, detailed open world if I cant interact with the world and the entities in it simultaneously? ______The GoodGraphics:It. Looks. Stunning. The atmosphere is pretty on point and the models, textures, effects and assets all look great. The world is beautifully put together, expect for a handful of objects clipping weirdly, being misaligned, hovering or having transparent edges (which is sure to happen in all open word games to a certain degree). But most of all I am impressed with the VFX artists, they really outdid themselves.Hogwarts:The castle is breathtaking. All the rooms, the details, the corridors, the ghosts, the paintings... beautiful. All together it is a very accurate representation of the castle as known from the books and movies. The surrounding area and Hogsmeade are similarly well made. The ambient animations are magical and the world is filled with interesting collectibles.Combat: This is the strongest point of the game for me and even if the whole games was ultimately not for me, I enjoyed  of the fights. It's fast, intense, beautiful, snappy, the sounds are great, it's easy to grasp but hard to master. Fights were always a challenge for me, but never too hard. ______SummaryThe game is not for me. For 20 bucks or less, I guess its fine. But its so damn disappointing. It is weirdly inconsistent with some parts of it being absolutely the best things I've ever seen in gaming and others being done better in 5€ trash games. It is an excellent showcase for an interactive Hogwarts, but it was not immersive. The first 5 hours were interesting, the next 5 confusing, the last 5 annoying. It's hard for me to find the right words. I hoped it would become better but it just became worse. It feels tiring and bothersome to advance. Ultimately, I found no more motivation to play. When I avoid playing a game because it annoys me, its a bad sign.If you love HP, Hogwarts, and some casual fun, and don't take this game so seriously, you'll probably have a good time. I hadn't."

The writing is downright terrible and the main plot is so dull. This game is also horribly optimized on PC and has a really bad memory leak that might stop you from playing the game all together. I've had this game crash on me easily 50+ times with a RTX 4080 and it is infuriating. And it's a shame, because visually, the game is stunning...until you see any facial animations. Then, it looks like Mass Effect: Andromeda.Most of my time playing this game was spent wondering ""This game would be so much better if it had x, y, or z."" There's just so much missed potential, it's crazy. No Quidditch, no real minigames, only 3 duels in the entire game that take <5 minutes to complete, a really lame beast poaching mechanic, it's just devoid of things you'd expect in a Harry Potter game. This should have had Yakuza/Like A Dragon amounts of minigames.This game is not a Hogwarts life simulator. If you're one of the many people that wanted something like that, drop those expectations and go pick up a game like Persona 5 or Bully that will actually have things to do at school. Both of those games are better than this. And if you're not looking for those life sim elements and just want a fun, engaging story about magic, there's still way better options out there. Go check out Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.By far the best part of the game is the combat, but it feels like this game is afraid to let you just fight. Most combat encounters are over far too quickly, even on the hardest difficulty. Most quests are just fetch/delivery quests or are 99% really boring puzzles. If this game had a proper arena (and not one that's a $20 add on), it'd be better.Stevie Wonder could see the ""twists"" of the main plot coming. It's terrible. The goblins are clear racial stereotypes and this game has a lot of weird racist vibes to it all.All in all, it doesn't do anything exceptionally and if it didn't have the Harry Potter IP attached, it'd be a flop on arrival. All in all, a very mediocre title carried by nostalgia."

With that being said, I'm going to separate my feedback into a positives and negatives list. Some of my criticisms might seem harsh but this is a AAA full price game so I see it as fair.Positives -.This is a very safe RPG, essentially anyone can play it, regardless of age or experience..Bugs are minimal and are usually just goofy rather than anything game breaking..Combat is fluid and satisfying, it's very easy but with lots of room for mastery..Characters are incredibly well detailed (visually) and are mostly interesting to interact with..Voice actor cast obviously extremely talented..Graphics are in line with a 2023 AAA title..Flying on a broom is pretty one dimensional but is still really smooth and the most fun way to traverse..There are elements of a good story here and there..Forbidden Forest is decently atmospheric..Some of the landscape is beautiful..Professor Garlick.Negatives - .The game is insanely childish, from the art style of beasts and enemies, to the actual story and lore, rarely will you find the same dark and chilling elements of the source material..The game is just very generic, they haven't innovated within the genre at all..The game is frustratingly repetitive, you will see the exact same enemies, fight them in the exact same way, hear the exact same voice lines, solve the exact same puzzles, pick up the exact same loot time after time after time..The puzzles are all mundane and essentially just copy pasted all over the map, if you want a game with interesting puzzles play Arkham City or Tomb Raider. .The looting system is silly, you spend so long after a battle spamming F on the ground to pick up everything only to run out of inventory space until you solve more mundane puzzles to expand it..Hogwarts Castle itself is unimaginative and bland (the saddest part for me), has absolutely none of the charm you'd expect and feels far more like a generic hub than a secret wizarding school..No Quidditch?.The main story is a bit disjointed but passable..There is one singular decent side quest that I could find, the rest are all mid or worse..Movement is clunky, which would be fine except quite a few puzzles rely on movement which just makes it frustrating.And then, my biggest issue with the game, by FAR, is the actual feel of the world itself. The open world has absolutely no flow. It feels like exploring a pre test version. There's no real thought or creativity put into it. If you've played Red Dead 2, you'll know what an open world should feel like. In this game, enemy placements are haphazard, the small dwellings and towns are forgettable and there's just so much dead space in-between. There's no charm or intrigue when you explore. There's plenty to 'do,' but only if you enjoy doing the exact same things over and over.Conclusion -Might be confusing as to why I recommend this game after so much negative feedback. It's because the game functions well enough and there is some fun to be had here. For completionists and those who enjoy a light, feel-good game this is probably something you'll enjoy. For anyone looking for a really gripping story or for exciting, innovative gameplay, I'd suggest avoiding it. Overall, an aggressively mid game that ironically has no magic to it.5.5/10"

Open World side missions CAN be Improved with better rewards. The Story is one of the strongest and surprisingly amazing to play through (Main Quests + Associated Side Quests). Combat is really really fun with good boss fights here and there (Less button mash comparatively but not souls-like moveset. Don't mash R2/RB alot or you'll miss out on how good spell casting is).Navigating the World is also well laid out. Travel through Floo network or go broom broom or rather do Mounts (I personally loved crusading on my broom rather than Mounts).Creature collection could have been improved a little but its still good and WHOA The Room of Requirements stuff was awesome to do.My recommendation if you're picking this up is to play the game how it pans out since it is well coordinated balance of Main Story line and linked side stories altogether. Do Combos in combat to have a good time around it but keep timings right for perfect deflects.Ran really well on my RX6600 at High settings with FSR 2.0 Quality at 1080p but would further be optimized as time goes by.Kudos to WB and Avalanche for an amazing journey into the Wizarding World!

Flying on a broomstick is one of the most iconic and epic moments this game can offer and exploring Hogwarts and its surroundings feel just magical. The entire game is beautifully designed that I can hardly find anything negative. It definitely gave me the same vibe as RDR 2 or The Witcher 3. When a new addition arrives, I only hope game writers will spend more time on quests which are very primitive though as said this whole awesome adventure makes up for a bit dull story."

Game quicksaves before you can do anything stupid-Walking down stairs has its own animation-Art style is a very cool-Runs well like 90% of the time, 7% probs being my fault-Replayability. As expected, I will be doing at least 4 plays of this game as each house has unique quests.- Graphics quality, I play on two machines, one at Ultra settings and the other at medium. Game looks great on both.-Character Customisation, Hair colours aren't flat. They have undertonesCONS:-Have encountered few technical issues such as crashing on 72hr prerelease day 1, random ps2 graphics that was fixed by verifying files n downloading patches. Got stuck in one quest cause the marker didn't move, but the regular checkpoints saved me.-Character customisation CONSFACE- Limited to a few facial presets, can't sort by male and female like in other games and they're all mixed in together which is a bit annoying.SKIN- I like that the darker skin tones look natural and don't just look like they got orange and moved the brightness shader down. However, the skin colours don't go very light. I tried to make a character as similar to my own appearance as I could, her hair colour and eye colour were fine, but the skin colour only goes as light as ""Sun Kissed"". I will probably look for a mod for this in the future."

Best single player RPG that I have played in a while.As someone who isn't a 'massive' Harry Potter fan, and was more interested in this game for being an open world single player RPG I have been completely blown away. This game exceeded my expectations and then some, and I have loved every second playing it. The world is positively 'magical' and full (I love learning all the lore), there is always something to do and explore, and the story behind the game has me completely invested- even the side characters stories! There's some many little things as well that change within the game, whether through your direct interaction or otherwise, noticing these and searching for them really makes the world feel alive- the attention to detail is fantastic and I rarely use the fast travel mechanics because of it.I am writing this while I am probably just over half way through the game, and I really don't want it to end! I already know I'll be looking to 100% all the achievements and will likely end up playing through this again with different houses and choices. It's not often that I get so hooked on a game that I can play for hours and not realise it, and I really hope that the dev's / publisher behind this continues to expand on this game and its success, with DLCs and additional story lines, even ones focused on the side characters we meet along the way and the impact of certain choices i.e Sebastian, Natty, Poppy etc. (Honestly, it's also really refreshing to buy a game and it be playable right off the bat. Not slapdash 'cello-taped' together and missing content like many other big games seem to be shipped out nowadays.)So If you're been looking at getting this game but for some reason haven't committed to it yet, do yourself a favour and dive right in, because its completely worth your time and well worth the price."

Yes, the ""student life"" aspect could have been improved, and we could have attended more classes and felt more like a student with a curfew and other restrictions in place. Is the game perfect? No, but what it did it did very well, and - in my opinion - that more than makes up for any lack in other departments.10/10 recommend"

Roaming around hogwarts and finding all the details and secrets is amazing and took up a good chunk of my first 3 hours playing before i really did many missions. The story is ok, wouldnt say its anything spectacular or memorable but its a good experience nontheless. Where this game really shines is its exploration and combat, there are so many challenges to do, things to unlock and puzzles to complete. after every major class you seem to get a spell that unlocks even more challenges too, its a really nice loop where everything isnt just thrown at you instantly. combat is super satisfying with the combo's of spells and beautiful animations. with every spell you learn you can strategize and think how it will fit into your current combo or just think of a new one, you can spend hours mastering this because every spell fits into eachother so well. it would have been nice to have maybe a few more spells and to have a different way to access your ""utility spells"" like you do with some of the other spellls in the game (like alohomora FE). i also would have enjoyed a slightly more expanded merchant system, hogsmead is great as an area and has a lot of nice shops but as soon as you're out of hogmead the only thing vendors seem to have is 3 different types of leaves and some fur, maybe a broom sometimes. addressing the hate this game has been receiving, i think its completely unjustified, this game was made by developers who have gone on record and state they do not agree with JK, they have in fact done a full 180 and implemented a very inclusive system, even going as far as to introduce a trans character, but that isnt good enough is it. you hate the woman and everything even loosely associated with her must burn. grow up or stay mad, this game is a 10/10"

No forced live service bullshet like premium currency, always online, weeklies, season pass, and massive cash shop from the get go.It's not Elden Ring but it beats almost all popular AAA games released these days. Just remove Denuvo so we can get some more fps and it's perfect."

Things I didn't really like:- Alohomora mini game was fine the first few times, annoying after the 50th time.- Unskippable Merlin trial cutscene that also gets annoying after the 50th puzzle.- World didn't really feel alive since people don't acknowledge you or the things you do. You can break into peoples homes and they'll just sit or stand there like they were brainwashed. No morality system means no punishment for using unforgivable curses and no one really reacts to you using them. You have a bedroom but never really sleep, never get a stash where you can put any items away, you don't get to interact with any of your housemates outside of quests.-  The Room of Requirement provides you with so many things to build and customize to your liking just so you can never use them. Chairs, sofas, tables; None of them have any purpose other than looking good. This creates the same issue outside of the RoR where there are no ways to sit next to people and just watch their animations, that the studio clearly spent a good amount of time creating, like people getting yelled by Howlers or people just casting spells to climb walls, Peeves harassing students, a one-man orchestra and so on.- Enemy variety is low.- Caves are uninspired and short. Loot is also irrelevant late game since I didn't get a better gear from level 30 to 40.- Most side quests are fetch quests and given by, what appears to be like, the same looking NPC most of the time.- When certain spells and/or parts of the Castle were first introduced, like alohomora and the restricted section in the library, you got to use stealth and interact with people that you don't otherwise do. Prefects and Peeves would stop you or harass you if you were out of your bedroom after dark but that just disappears after the initial quest. Mixing potions and seeing other students do them incorrectly was quite fun but also gone with their starting quest. However, I still think the game is amazing and I certainly got my moneys worth in the end."

You run around for the main story mission, which is very interesting and a new story for the Hogwarts universe, and you learn spells, make potions, race on broomsticks and much more. There are multiple different kinds of enemies, ranging from environmental to the main story 'super villains' that can attack you through your journey. You make friends, or enemies throughout the game. You have to attend classes in order to progress and learn spells. -'Holy sh!t, what a beginning'-'Where are we going- OMG SO FLUFFY'-""Wait why are the graphics doing that?'When beginning this game, its a wild experience. I was not expecting it to start the way that it ended up starting. You dive right into the lore and story of the game.I will talk a little about the grapics issue later in the review.This game doesn't exactly seem like it would be very friendly to people who have never played any games previously it can be a bit confusing in the start and it kind of has a tutorial, but tutorials only come with every new thing you get in the game, so if you are still confused (and can be impatient like me) you may need to search up how to do things. You could also ask a friend but if you have no friends that play the game it could be hard to navigate. (However that is just my opinion take it as you will)Pretty basic controls for keyboard and it is controller compatible so that's always nice. There is quite a bit of character customisation to be able to make your character pretty much however you want as a student at Hogwarts. Its a little strange that we have haircuts from the 2000's but I like to think that maybe they time travelled into the future and liked what they saw? There is a lot of different things you can do to make money and potions. Someone I know decided to skip the story temporarily right when they could and they went and explored the world. Which is a little risky. Considering you wont have many spells and the enemy's are various levels.The fighting in this game is very interesting and takes good timing and a good lineup of spells/potions to effectively beat your enemy's, it can be hard at first to understand but once you get the hang of it it is pretty fun. Though it can get a bit repetitive once you find your ideal spell's and way of fighting. There are many different mini games that you can play throughout the Hogwarts experience, so far I have personally not beat them. It seems that you can only play the mini games with the limit of the quests they are in, so far I have only seen one other mini game which is in the open world. You can keep pets as well, which can only be kept in your small room that you can decorate, you use them to collect materials which help you with making potions and upgrading things you collect. You can collect materials throughout the world as well to help you with your journey.  There is broom riding and eventually you can get some animal mounts which is fun as well! The last thing I am going to talk about game play wise is the story, it is pretty interesting and easy to get sucked into. You should play through the story at your own pace, however some features that you want have to be gathered through the main story missions. There are loads of side missions, but you have to go and find them yourself unless they are required to finish to move on with the story. As for the open world, I must say that the graphics are absolutely gorgeous other then they can be a bit hard on your PC depending on what you pic. I had to turn mine down to medium and although I am very addicted to the game, I still get annoyed when it stutters every once, sometimes while I am in a boss fight. Sometimes the world decides that it wants to break completely and it seems as though the trees, owls and other students stretch and glitch through the faces of the earth. The only way to fix that is by closing your game and coming back into it. It has only happened to me twice in 30 hours. Sometimes when you escape into the menu the book will also glitch out, it doesn't effect my game play so I continue on, however I do get annoyed by it every once and a while. Other then those glitches which they will hopefully fix, the graphic intensity almost reminds me of Red Dead Redemption 2, but they are not that great when you have to turn the down in order to play without as many stutters. So far this game is not multiplayer, I was speaking to a friend of mine and we both kind of wish there was some sort of multiplayer battle arena or multiplayer Quidditch. You could make your own teams and hassle each other it seems like it would be pretty fun. I have not interacted much with the overall Hogwarts legacy community I have been in the Harry Potter fan community for a while, sometimes their debates can get a bit heated but overall they are awesome people.I have not yet finished the main story line, but so far it seems that once you are done the quests you cant play them again. Hopefully once I am done the game it wont just delete my whole account for finishing, which for some reason is something I am fearing will happen. I haven't even finished the game yet, however I can add an update if something like that does happen. You can make multiple accounts so that you can play in different houses and interact with the different people in the different houses. Other then that it just comes down to if you want to play it again after your first play through or not. Overall its a really amazing game. I am hoping that maybe there will be more features soon, just because sometimes as I said it can get a bit repetitive and in my opinion some of the things they haven't added that they could add, like quidditch, was a totally missed opportunity. I am still however very addicted to the game and I wouldn't say that the missed opportunity are a reason you should not play it. However, I will add this, if you are not a harry potter fan it may not be the game for you. It is clearly very heavily inspired by the harry potter universe. I would also add that if you are not in it for the story, the lore, or you do not like repetitive features in the fighting, I would not recommend this game. If you like exploring the world right off the bat though, this would totally be a fun open world experience."

I doubt that any game published in 2023 will surpass Hogwarts Legacy's brilliance.Hogwarts Legacy has everything that RPG open-world game should have - smooth and interesting combat system, great story progression, lots of exploration that can benefit your character in various ways, housing system, as well as mounts and pets. Transmogrification is a great detail as well, no one wants to look like a clown! There are also equipment upgrades and traits that can make your character a lot stronger!Graphic wise, the game is stunning and every single corner looks like it was really made with love and patience. Seasonal changes were such a wonderful surprise. All the side quests I've done so far were not even slightly draining or boring, it's been fun completing them and meeting different characters! Everyone is very unique. Also, all the little events around the castle and beyond make the game feel so alive. Controls on KB&M are really good, haven't tried the controller.Thank you for creating the world I've always dreamed of. ♡Edit: Got 100% challenges done ingame, missing only two more achievements for 100% on Steam, the game is still 10/10. Definitely worth buying."

Going straight into the look of the world, it's really a detailed and expensive world that truly feels older but familiar to the main books. Being able to just traverse the School and surrounding areas without a loading screen is wonderful, and the map is peppered with quest and collectibles that open up as the story goes on making returning a must Side quests even give completion bonuses on top of the standard reward which apparently will lead to your ending. There is usually a Good and Bad choice such as keeping the items... I haven't done the bad but sure it will play to your ending With all this detail is also where the game falls flat in many areas. After a few hours you start seeing the same Picture and Pots that are fragmenting through each other vectors. The school is busy but the students are mostly static or on rails  you can light the floor on fire and no one will react  Say what you will about Cyberpunk but at least they reacted even in it's worst state The open world is filled with Puzzles to do unlike Breath of the Wild (cause that game sucked) it's not barren and filled with only Bomb Puzzles. Each one might be similar sometimes but they utilize all your skills and doesn't punish you harshly if you were not ready for it.The skill tree is basic... 5 routes with minimal trees but they do offer you a chance to have a play style you want.If you want to focus on Stealth or Dark Arts or Potions... Your level is really your only hindered.Flying is pretty solid with upgrades to improve as you move on. Still you are rewarded for traveling by foot as quest can easily be missed.Where the game just... Falls flat ...Some of the side missions to move you forward are unbelievably tedious Zero quidditchZero interaction outside of Quest Givers or Story.House building site that... Could have just been a hub instead of a severally basic house builder.And Wasted time on a basic Tomigatchi simulator where you can place Animals.These features were pointless and seemed like easy additional content instead of focusing on other areas.Again, this is not Skyrim, not Fallout, not RDR2...but it's not bad... And it blows BOTW out of the water.Again Solid 7/10 For now. I can recommend buying it if you are a Potter Fan or need a new time sink that has a very decent story to keep you busy."

Still have 3 achievements left which are only available on 3 other playthroughs (dependent on which House you pick). Overall, the game took me 65 hrs in total to fully complete and I enjoyed every moment of it. So here is the thing..... DON'T BUY IT/ PLAY IT RIGHT NOW, I am going to say the obvious here but it is still very buggy with many quest breaking bugs. 40+ hours in, my game saves got corrupted and the game forces me to play again from the beginning and it took me hours of fiddling to get my original save files back and are able to continue the game normally (even then, my character profile are still corrupted and weird looking). -Some quests will break if you interacted with the quest item prior to starting the quest. -Some collectibles will not be registered but the achievement will unlock on Steam instead. -My character was stuck in a cutscene that prevents them to move inside a story mission and I have to reload from an older save to get out of it, (without an older save, before you start the story mission then you would be screwed). - Stuttering and lag is the most common issue amongst players even if their PC is a beast. Change in season like Fall and Winter will drops your frame rate like crazy. - The funniest bug I encountered was entering the pet haven in your base, and the camera now focuses solely on the pet instead of my main character, whom I can still control but can't do anything else. It is moments like these that the game either hard crashes my PC or I have to shut the game down myself. If this is just any Ubisoft open world games, I would have asked for a refund rather than salvage my old saves to 100% the game. This game does something that no other Harry Potter games have done before, it lets you attend Hogwarts as your character, flying on a broom to explore Hogwarts and Hogsmeade as it was described in the book/ movies. I was immersed in the game despite the horrible FPS and bugs, Hogwarts castle is a sight to behold and thats just 30% of the game map. So for that, this game is can't be any lower than 8/10 for me. Hogwarts Legacy isn't a perfect game, but you can damn well see and feel the passion of the developers who made it, and I genuinely believe that you are doing yourself a disservice if you play the game now before it is patched and fixed."

I was quite surprised to get a solid RPG game with a very nice combat system, decent characters and an interesting story (so far). I am far from finishing the game as I am exploring a lot, but that is another plus - I want to explore, both inside and outside of the castle. Is the game perfect? No, the performance is all over the place, I have random FPS drops at seemingly random locations, and the game stutters every now and then but it is not common enough to bother me, it might bother some. Also, the broom flying controls are... clumsy. Once you get used to them it works well enough but it took me some time.

I'm not the biggest Potterhead in the world, i've only watched the movies once or twice each. So approaching this from a purely subjective standpoint i will talk about the main attractions and what i think about them.The story drives home the Harry Potter feeling spectacularly and feels pretty immersive. It really did provide me what i feel like is an answer to the question ""How would it be if i existed in this universe?"" The Main quests are enjoyable even if they aren't the most action-packed all the time but they do provide you with a sense of progression each time. A new unlock, a new system, a new mechanic.The Open-World is quite vast. Travel is easy and there are numerous fast travel locations that can be accessed without any hassle. Or if you'd rather take the scenic route, the various travel methods feel fluid and dynamic. Providing a smooth experience.  Side-quests are abundant however most of them require you to have unlocked certain mechanics to complete. While some only appear after you've acquired said abilities some will still be available if you don't have the required ability, effectively locking you out from that side-quest until you progress enough with the main story. Which isn't too much of an annoyance but it is there. Other side-content such as encounters that are marked on the map like dungeons and puzzles provide content too. And there actually is an incentive to do them thanks to the Field Guide Challenges. Otherwise things such as these usually get forgotten and only get brought back up from their graves for those who are ambitious enough for a 100% completion.Combat was one i was quite curious about. And i am satisfied for the most part. I chose the Hard difficulty as a gamble to see if it would be unfair and needlessly annoying or if it would provide me a challenge similar to that of a Souls-Like game. The game is still relatively easy even on Hard and even against enemies that are higher level than i. (Leveling also seems to be quite easy as i am already Level 20 out of 40) Combat itself is rather simple. Revolving around basic attacks, timed-blocks and dodges. Like Sekiro and Mortal Shell, the game provides you with an indicator when an attack is approaching via circles around your head. Such as an orange one for blockable and red for unblockable attacks. Which ultimately makes dealing with enemies quite easier. Spell Sets are also quite clever and being able to update them on the fly is a relief. It does feel like an MMO Skill Rotation after a while though as you know your favorite combos and you will keep doing them because they are most effective which starts to make combat a little bit repetitive but i am not too bothered by that. The combat also rewards you for being skillful such as keeping a high combo will reward you with  So overall i am satisfied with the combat system it provides. Can't really talk about the one-time use items such as potions and throwables as they don't fit my play-style.Foraging and farming is like any other RPG. A chill activity that only stays fun for so long but you can't really blame them for doing it by the book. At least the Field Guide Challenge progression keeps you motivated during all such activities.The amount of spells in the game -although i'd likely have wanted more- is enough and it  Spells are managed by cooldowns when you are close to enemies but unhindered when out of combat which is a very smart move. The Stealth mechanics of the game are also very classic. Invisible circle + cone of detection around the enemy. Invisibility reduces the effect but doesn't remove it. Nothing too special but for those that enjoy it, it is a nice little addition.Those are the things that had my interest mostly so i will conclude the review here. I may update it later if i remember anything."

I know at the time I wrote this review, my hours are low but it's because I also own on console and been playing a lot there, so I am more then valid in my response :)Graphics: They are amazing! There are some great details in comparison to get a superb visual aspect and the game runs smooth on maxed out graphics with RTX on. Really, it's probably so far, the prettiest game released to date! Audio: Amazing, you've got all the sounds, musical tunes and atmosphere you expect from this universe and more. Seriously keep all your sound on max because it's stunning!Controls: I personally use a controller because it's easier to play and get around the game with this compared to a keyboard and mouse.Game-play and everything else after: So the game is in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, but do not expect Harry Potter, this is set in the 1800s so before he was even liquid form :)Anyway, you are a 5th year student attending fresh and kind of forced into the world of magic and it all starts to unravel around you, with lots of twists and turns along the way.The story is superbly done, it's so good! I am playing it twice!You can learn skills in a unique way, swap and change, go good or bad, evil or nice and change the dynamic of the game in a way to fit your play style.

Gameplay: 7Exploration: 9Design: 8Graphics: 7Tech: 6Story: 7Quests: 7NPC's: 8Dialogue: 7I have never had so much fun just exploring the world for what it offers. Riding a broom is fun but nothing beats running around on foot for things that you might have missed while on a broom flying around. There is some fun hidden quarks of humor in dialogue from the random npc's that you find scattered around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. Its even fun to watch 2 sets of armor have a bit of a fight. There are some major tech issues with fps drops and shuttering but these only happen when in Hogwarts or Hogsmeade were there is a heavy npc count. There is a few in the open world with this issue but it rarely happens. The game with all it has to offer is a 7/10 but this review my change based on any future updates or additions. I can not wait to jump back into Hogwarts to continue exploring and finding all of its secrets it has to offer.  I don't Mind spoilers ether as it makes me want to go see it and experience it with my own eyes through my own hard work of playing through the story to learn how it all happens and to see how it all ends.Also for someone who likes to do 3Ddesign in blender the work in the design of the castle is awe inspiring and makes me want to work harder in that field of work. Thank You to the Dev's for giving me more chances to test my skills to see how far I can go even if I am only starting out.

The excitement of attending charms and potions classes with tasks to complete, the thrill of sparing with fellow students in duels, roaming the great hall and staring at the starring ceiling for as long as i can, to walk in the corridors at night; disturbing portraits with lumos spells :P, all were a dream i had when i watched the first few harry potter movies. Meeting fantastics beasts, rescuing them, taming and feeding them were also a really sweet indulgence i so wanted, and flying the skies on Hippogriff back was a soothing experience.I would really like to thank avalanche studios and Portkey games for making Hogwarts Legacy, and to enable me to revisit my younger self, and making me relive the fantasies of being a part of this world."

And considering most games don't even launch with any transmog, I'll take it.Making potions you had to make 1 at a time and wait 15-30sec for each. At least let us make them in bulk so we can go grab a drink or something while it brews.The best thing about the game is the keybindings though! No issues rebinding anything, ESDF works great, there is a hardcoded  but only when that is the only key you can press. It actually took me over 30 minutes to set up all the binds as there are about 200 things you can change, all with primary and secondary options. * Couldn't post the review until game went live, and have played a bit more since I originally wrote it. Currently up to 16% Quest progress now at 11 hours played, and just got Combat and Exploration progress above 0, and I have a couple more spells unlocked. Still can't open locks though."

You're constantly pancaked between being a student subject to your teacher's wrath and killing hordes of evil wizards. This constant flipping makes all characters seem inconsistent and poorly written. Pairing with the fact that even some of the cool sounding quests are ruined by their streamlining. The secret wizard dueling club is just 1v2->1v3->1v4 to winning the tournament! The exploring an old shipwreck to recover someone's family heirloom is swimming out into the water and pressing F over bubbles until you find it.

If you really want it, wait for sales. Aside from the excellent visuals and fun flashy combat system the game doesn't have much else to offer.Unfortunately, the story is not just generic or mediocre, it's borderline non-existent. Although the prologue seems promising, the pacing quickly drowns, because without filler, the story would take 3 hours max. It offers practically no memorable characters. More than that -  you can count on one hand the characters who posses some sort of interesting personality or depth.The main story line offers practically no drama and fails to create any emotion within the player whatsoever. The ""philosophical question"" it presents has a laughably obvious answer. The main villain is shallow and you barely get to see him. With such approach the player has zero interest in progressing the story.Another thing this game does is it tries very hard to not create conflict for the player. Pretty much all people you meet will instantly be friendly to you and praise you  as a genius.The story offers no variability. There's no role play of any sort. Dialogue options are mostly 2 and don't influence anything. Your Hogwarts house doesn't change anything. It doesn't matter what choices you make or if you use dark magic or not. There are 3 endings and in the end you literally say to your teacher which ending you want.Most of the quests are generic mmo-style garbage, like: kill x this, bring me x that, go talk to them etc. Also MAIN quests sometimes reuse locations or just take a previous quest and just remix it a bit. Many times you have to go talk to a person and that would be it. The actual quest will appear after some sizeable time has passed. The open world is vast but all it has is Ubisoft-like filler (bandit camps, puzzles and go fetch quests). Also to learn new spells you have to do grind quests, and there's forced stealth in the game. Have fun :)The combat, on the other hand, is done very well. It is fun and has a lot of variety. The animations are juicy, and overall it makes you feel like a powerful wizard. Among the minuses I can list some enemies (like trolls) teleporting to you during attacks, even if you are on the other side of the arena, the spell casting panel not being the most convenient thing in the world and sometimes the game feeling a little too easy. Also the bosses are very boring.Graphically the game looks very good. It offers beautiful views, interesting visuals and overall is very immersive. The Hogwarts castle is very big, beautiful, authentic and filled with details. If you like exploration, this game is for you. Plus there are broom flights, magical beasts and other cool stuff. The only minuses I can think of are npc animations are sometimes stiff.The resource management (for potions and gear upgrades) is very grindy. Potions have real-time timer to cook. The magic lacks interactivity with the world."

You've been warned.They just don't learn. This game has forced TAA and no true fullscreen. Everything looks blurry to the point it makes me feel like I need glasses again. Performance is worse than RDR2, but what would you expect from devs who aren't known for doing Triple A games. Gladly, this isn't a console for peasants. And in the land of PC MASTER RACE we have the option to use Reshade with sharpening to correct that, even though the TAA is still being processed and consuming precious FPS, and even more so because it has f'ing Denuvo. I hope they remove Denuvo once this game gets cracked, because otherwise it would only be pointless and hurt the playerbase.But, putting all of that aside, they gave us a neat option to use AMD FSR 2 upscalling method to bring the game from 720p to 1080p while maintaining the graphics on High and therefore the game remaining beautiful. On a 1080ti with 12700k I get from 75 to 100 FPS. And I can say it's not a port problem because the game is just awful on PS5. People have to play it looking worse than PC on Low settings and with less FPS. Search videos and screenshots to see what it is really like instead of reading what ultra fanboys say on Facebook because their egos can't take it. And they say PS5 is the equivalent of a 3080. Yeah, sure, pumpkin! So there's no reason for buying it on PS5 just to get access to that exclusive mission.Now, story wise, so far it's looking good despite a few flaws. You can grasp that there's a mystery being conveyed, but you have no clue on WTF is going on and where the story is gonna lead you. It just feels a bit lost in itself. But then it starts to shape up and you know what's what instead of feeling like things happened out of thin air without a proper introduction and backstory.Simon Pegg's acting in the role of Hogwarts' headmaster is terrible. He sounds like a soap opera sub celebrity reading a script doing over inflexion in every word. It's not at all like a real person talks and it can come off as cringey. Then there's that student from Uganda that's also super obnoxious to listen to because her phony accent is terrible and her tone of voice and laughs don't match what's going on. But, gladly, as I've seen so far, you'll spend most of your time talking to your professor and mentor, and your friend Sebastian. These 2, plus the main character, are all portraied by very talented voice actors. The main character's voice is very similar to Daniel's voice, so in a way, you get that Harry Potter feeling. Even when you go to Ollivanders, you're treated just like Harry, as if you were the most special person being long-awaited. That was a bit on the nose for me.For the combat, I was surprised. Few people understand that these games - specially Warner Bros games - aren't strictly fighting games. They're more rythm games. And that's fine. You just need to adjust your expectations to it. WB games are not like playing The Warriors, for instance. Anyway, Avalanche Software managed to improve this genre in the most sneaky and brilliant way possible. It's like they brought Guitar Hero to a fighting game. Instead of 5 colors on the toy guitar controller, you have 4 colors in this game, 1 for each action button on Playstation. If this were done thinking on PC, they could have gone up to 5 with no problem since it's pretty feasible to reach the number 5 key. So, essentially, you have to tap those numbers according the colors of yours spells and the color of the enemies' protection spell shields. And this was so beautifully done that they managed, in my opinion, to surpass the misplaced faith in the Souls games, making Hogwarts Legacy much, much more enganging, in all areas, even by not making the same mistakes as well. The combat has so much nuance, possibilities and areas of the brain triggered at once that I shall not talk about it in order to not make this review any longer than it needs to.Lastly, the environment and many side quests. It's like they followed the Marvel's Spider-Man's footsteps on this one. The whole place is beautiful, there's so much attention to detail that it's fun to swing, I mean, fly through the map experiencing all of it. The side quests don't feel like boring chores. They're fun excuses to see everything and level up as oppose to just do a pointless checklist maybe for achievements. For comparison, I tell my friends that Hogwarts is like a GTA, and then you get out to explore the world and there's another GTA. That's how big Hogwarts is. And super detailed! Although not as big, but still super detailed, there is Hogsmeade with several houses and stores to go into for looting or visiting and none of them are copy-paste. I just don't know why they didn't go with Diagon Alley. All you see in this game from Diagon Alley, so to speak, is the inside of Gringotts.This level of effort really shows. Despite wokies being noisy on Twitter trying to boycott this game, it's soaring in sales. As of now, it has reached almost 900k concurrent players on Steam alone!PS.: speaking of wokies, mind you, be careful when posting on Steam Discussions. Steam mods are wokies and they are mad af right now to the point that I got banned for a week from the forum after being called names by more or less 50 people, which I reported and nothing happened, but I, on the other hand, got banned for being ""rude"". So there goes the Steam moderation selectively grooming the community to be toxic and cancerous by condoning people's bad behaviours and harassing me by banning me for merely being a victim of this arbitrary and corrupted system with zero accountability. Little people on power trips. Go figure. This kind of cancer is making Epic Store look better by the minute! No wonder they don't have forums there."

The wizzarding world was the constant franchise of early 2000's. For people like me who went to middle school around the time the books and movies were released, it was a pop culture phenomenon. It was everywhere, you read the books, saw the movies, played those early EA video game adaptations back when they were good. And after the 8th movie came out you were around the same age as the characters, you were done with school and heading out into the real world. This franchise means a lot to the 'millennial' generation and I'd say Avalanche has done a great job capturing what made the franchise so special all those years ago, while still taking into account that the target audience isn't twelve anymore.Fans of the franchise will love this game. Hogwarts has everything you'll recognize from the movies, and even stuff from the books that never made it to the silver screen. The smallest things, like the potion ingredient store closet or the jail cell on the roof they kept Sirius Black in for all of 2 seconds in the third movie. The House Elf kitchens and the ghost ballroom from the books, they're all there for you to discover. It's a nostalgia trip and that alone is worth the price of admission, IF you are a fan.Avalanche has done everything it can to make this game appeal to all, unfortunately they listened to the twitter side of the internet for what would appeal to them. The response this game has gotten online is nothing short of hilarious, the very people this game is made for are trying all that they can to stop people from playing it. Their whims are being catered to at every turn. From the for 1790's Scotland laughably diverse student body and faculty, merchants and townsfolk, to the sexuality of every side character seemingly being non-straight. You'd think they'd eat this game up, but no. I hope that sends a message to the industry that you can not please these people. For people less familiar with the source material, or those who never really cared that much, this game must seem a bit mid. When you get out of Hogwarts you are greeted with a massive overworld that is completely littered with useless stuff. Mostly consisting of what are called Merlin trials, which require you to do a tedious little puzzle to trigger an animation. This gets you inventory upgrades, so you'll have to do at least a few, but there a dozens of these menial things everywhere. As well as the caves, which are all copy pasted from the same handful of templates and get you nothing other than a piece of gear which is always worse than what you already have. You can completely ignore these but they will always clutter up your compass, map and minimap.Combat is simple and can be trivialized with potions and plants, I finished the whole thing challenge dungeons and all on normal difficulty but it never actually got difficult. Maybe that changes on higher difficulties, but the combat isn't what makes this game worth playing anyway.This game shines in it's presentation, like I said, if you are a fan of the wizzarding world you will love this game. But it doesn't quite capture the (pardon the phrasing) magic of going to a magic school and having your own adventure. I think most of that is to do with the lack of interaction with your classmates. You do your main adventure mostly on your own being aided only by a professor. Your classmates are relegated to side quests, which I think is a shame. Because what connected the audience to the story of the books and movies was building this bond with new friends and together becoming stronger than any adversary. Here you are the chosen one who could've done it all by themselves.Portkey games has this phone game 'Hogwarts Mystery' that does that way better. I hope they decide to port that to PC in some from or another now that this is such a rousing success.  Who you are in this game is vague, your origins are not revealed. Who are you? Why are you only joining Hogwarts as a fifth year? Where do you come from? It seems there's a prelude missing and kind of an important one. The choices you make along the way also don't matter to the story one bit.  Avalanche clearly want you to spend the bulk of your time in Hogwarts. You get a whole room all to yourself for you to interact with animals, build the perfect pen for them. Create your own space decorated to your liking, you can sink hours into just that if you wanted to. Technically it runs well enough. It runs on the Unreal 4 engine, so there's still pop-in everywhere when you're outside zipping through the map on a broom. It also does a small frame drop every time you charge into a different area of the overworld map. Inside Hogwarts that all goes away. It does have to load a second or two at doors at times still though. So you can see the seams in this seamlessly connected world, but they didn't really bother me.Enemy AI is single minded and dumb, when you blast someone of a platform or just remove them far enough from their path, they have to run all the way back to where they started. They won't attack you during their little hike until they get there. None of them will ever dodge out of the way.The amount of content here is nothing to sneeze at, and considering the success of this game I'd be surprised if Warner Bros. didn't come out with some cut content as DLC. There's a screenshot of a dragon on this very storepage that is just not in this game. The made character models fro dementors that are only used in one cutscene for one Hufflepuff specific quest in Azkaban. We only hear about stuff happening in the ministry. Definitely room for expansion.For fans of franchise this is an absolute must-buy. For everyone else, you should probably wait for a sale. It's a fun romp, but like I said, without the nostalgia trip it loses a lot of it's appeal."

Once this is resolved there is a good chance this will be GOTY...Update: I've played about 50 more hours, and gameplay this game still delivers, however once you get to  the stuttering problems get a lot worse.

Outside of quests, NPCs are about as interactive as a table or a chair, you can shoot spells or curses at them but they don’t move or say anything.It’s not much of an RPG, it’s an open world action adventure game with some side quests and almost no customization to speak of. Cyberpunk 2077 removed the RPG label from marketing before release, but somehow, that game still managed to incorporate more RPG elements than Hogwarts Legacy.Performance on PC is also very bad, frame drops are prevalent in both Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and the day 1 patch fixed none of them.

The first time it crashed I didn't lose my game but the second or third time it crashed I lost my game and I was angry because I thought it was going to be impossible to recover but after reading a Reddit page that had happened the same thing I ended up being able to recover it, I don't know how.

Hogwarts is absolutely beautiful. The game is enthralling from the on set and immediately pulls you in. Immersion and the scale and beauty of this game is just second to none. The story thus far remains very interesting and there is definitely a sense of character progression both in power and character development.I am truly loving the scale and size of the game and the amount of content is insane, there is quite a lot to do and a lot of collections and that just keeps you set to explore more and more. Hogwarts castle is just insanely huge and intricate with so many secrets to explore and epic encounters to watch inside and outside of Hogwarts where the world does fully feel magically alive.The games foundation is well set and can only get bigger and better. I do hope they add multi player features and eventually add Quidditch to the game. I am very impressed as someone who wasnt going to get the game immediately and do recommend the game to anyone who has grown up watching harry potter.

Rowling in the Harry Potter universe. Players take on the role of a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, attending classes, participating in magical duels, and exploring the castle and its surroundings. The game was released in 2021 and has received mixed reviews from players and critics.One of the standout features of Hogwarts Legacy is its beautifully crafted world. The game's graphics are stunning, and the attention to detail in creating Hogwarts and its surroundings is impressive. The environments are rich and immersive, and the game does an excellent job of bringing the wizarding world to life. Players will feel like they have stepped into a magical world as they explore the castle, attend classes, and interact with other characters.Another highlight of Hogwarts Legacy is the character customization. Players can create their own student and choose from a variety of races, including humans, elves, and half-giants. The customization options are extensive, and players can choose from a wide range of hair styles, clothing, and accessories to create a unique character. This is a great feature, as it allows players to personalize their experience and make their character feel like their own.The gameplay in Hogwarts Legacy is a mix of action and RPG elements. Players will attend classes and participate in magical duels, using spells and potions to defeat their opponents. The combat system is intuitive and fun, and players will find themselves becoming more confident in their abilities as they progress through the game. Additionally, players can explore the castle and its surroundings, solving puzzles, and discovering hidden secrets.One of the criticisms of Hogwarts Legacy is its lack of replay value. Once players have completed the main storyline, there isn't much to do in terms of side quests or additional content. This is a disappointment, as players may feel like they have exhausted the game's content once they have completed the story.Another issue with Hogwarts Legacy is its writing. The game's story is somewhat underwhelming, and the characters are not particularly well-developed. While the game does an excellent job of creating an immersive world, the writing is somewhat lackluster and fails to engage players on an emotional level. This is a shame, as a more compelling story could have elevated the game to new heights.In conclusion, Hogwarts Legacy is a well-crafted game that offers players a chance to step into the wizarding world. The graphics and world-building are impressive, and the character customization is a great feature. However, the lack of replay value and underwhelming writing are significant drawbacks that may turn some players off. If you're a fan of the Harry Potter universe, Hogwarts Legacy is worth checking out. But if you're looking for a more robust RPG experience, you may want to look elsewhere.""- ChatGPT"

(keep in mind 2000 series users, I have reports of players having trouble with the 2070-2080 cards)Sound is 10/10 - However, I have had issues with character dialog where the volume level of people speaking rises and falls in different conversations. Leaving me adjusting my volume level. Also the sound has issues with direction. Depending which way your character turns/faces you can't hear people talking anymore. Personally this greatly annoys me.Gameplay Combat 9/10 - Could have been better but its good enough to keep your interest throughout the game. Gameplay - 6/10 - This is where the game starts to take some hits. Between tedious potion brewing, Gathering resources, Character development, Gear (No shortcut having to re-equip cosmetics and gear constantly), Gear Progression, Menu Navigation, Choices don't actually matter, No Good/Evil system. Its all super annoying and time consuming.Controls - 10/10 - Now keep in mind I'm using PS5 controller only. And it plays and feels flawless. (Except when trying to mount your broom. Keep in mind that they need to fix the L1 and O key combination times. They way they have it setup you have to wait 2 seconds before pressing O otherwise you'll just dodge)Should you Pre-Order? - Honestly the Dark Arts Cosmetics are probably the best looking gear I've found in the game so far so its worth the extra $10 in my opinion. Especially if you want to try and get as close as possible to a dark wizard. All the other gear looks like ♥♥♥♥. Don't get me wrong this is a great game well worth the triple A price. I myself plan to 100% the game and spend over 100 hours on it. If you like Harry Potter even a little bit I'd say its well worth your money. The story and feel of the game is great.Its just a real shame it fell short of being a true masterpiece."

Hogsmeade is equally pretty. It's a double edge sword because you're expecting to see all these things you know from the franchise, and sometimes they're there and you love it, but more often it's missing and makes the game feel a little more empty.Then everything beyond the areas we know is either bland countryside or a cave/tomb where you see the same assets and enemies constantly reused (spiders, goblins or evil wizards) and engage with the same open-world filler content/puzzles over and over 😴The main quest was only just barely interesting enough to follow along (a bit like the fantastic beasts movies lol), and I didn't really like any characters in the game except Sebastian and Ominis.There's also a lot of key HP elements missing and I think a sequel could improve on the formula."

Just to put things in perspective, most of us have been waiting for a game like this for a really long time. Open world Harry Potter/Hogwarts game. So I feel like anyone could have came along and produced that game with modern day graphics and we would have been happy regardless. I feel like thats what this is, its really just a sub par story, sub par game, sub par combat, sub par puzzles, with some Harry Potter lore sprinkled on top. I got excited and hoped that maybe I could play out a Dark wizard story line, well this is not that kind of RPG. Its very linear, even if you use dark magic and unforgivable curses it doesn't alter the story at all. Your characters demeanor never changes, he always resembles some soft sensitive, harry potter wanna be student. One moment im using the killing curse, the next moment I am politely accepting a quest to help someone find their lost rabbit. IDK man I just feel like this could have been done so much better. I think the idea of starting as a 5 year was a poor choice, I think basically just stealing the world of hogwarts and then creating some bs story that has nothing to do with Harry was a poor choice. Yea Idk, i was waiting for this game for a long time, overall just pretty disappointed."

It's like ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" of fantasy games with it's massive open-world.  For fans of Terry Pratchett's ""Discworld"" book, game, film universe; this is as closest we will ever get to having a game in the same vein.  BTW, Pratchett came up with a LOT of what is in the Potterverse well before J.K. created it.  Hogwarts is like the Unseen University, just more beautiful and with professors that give a crap about education and Hogsmeade is a smaller form of Ankh-Morpork.  Yes, there are the occasional bugs, but that is going to be expected in such a huge world game.  Hopefully the devs will be more open-minded in regards to fixing them than Rockstar, since they just gave up on RDR2."

The gameplay is almost entirely designed for your brain to go AFK and just autopilot like an automaton, the ""puzzles"" aren't actually puzzles and offer no challenge, every single part of the game is made to handhold you through it. The collectibles aren't even fun because they aren't tied to any real challenges, they're just log completion percentages or main quest rewards or random loot chest drops.One of the main side ""puzzles"" you complete over and over again is literally just simple 2nd grade algebra and assigning the numbers 0-9 to a series of symbols that never change and are presented IN ORDER on a door. At first I thought you at least had to count the number of limbs the creatures had, but nope, you just have to count 0-9 left to right on the door.It had a lot of potential but the devs seem to have a philosophy of ""No barrier to entry"" which means everything has to be dumbed down to the lowest possible ""difficulty"".I'll keep playing to see if it gets any better and update my review if it does but I doubt it. Kind of just going through the motions really.ALSO A *BIT* MORE OF A MEME POINT BUT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE COLLECTIBLE CHOCOLATE FROGS, WIZARD CARDS, OR FLAVORED BEANS IN THIS GAME WITH LIKE 20 COLLECTION SYSTEMS, LITERALLY WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?Edit: It's getting worse the further I go on. Why doesn't potion making have a minigame or mechanic? Or herbology? Or the beastkeeping system? Why is everything just *get resource* *use resource* *wait for timer*? Why are Merlin Trials completely braindead ""Cast single spell on nearby objects""? It's all chores. Where is the gameplay? It's just more and more and more and more examples of the devs being afraid to put ANY barriers to entry or inconveniences, and failing to produce an enjoyable game as a result."

I was thoroughly entertained for numerous hours by the game's excellent balance of exploration, magic, and adventure. One of the things I loved about the game was the attention to detail that was put into recreating the world of Harry Potter. It was truly immersive and exciting to experience the Hogwarts castle, Quidditch games, and magical animals all come to life. Also, I liked how the character evolved along the course of the game into a powerful witch with special spells and powers.However, while the game is amazing in many ways, it does suffer from optimization issues. I faced stuttering and low fps throughout the game, despite having a decent PC that should have been able to handle it. This did detract from the overall experience, as it was frustrating to have the game lag and stutter during crucial moments.Despite the optimization issues, I still highly recommend the game to anyone who is a fan of the Harry Potter franchise, or anyone who enjoys immersive RPG games. The game's attention to detail, engaging storyline, and magical world make it an experience that is not to be missed."

The combat is how I expected, it has its kinks but is pretty easy and fun once you get the hang of everything. The flight system is better than I expected it to be.

Let's start with that:Every scene and every landscape in the game is a masterpiece. Each element has been carefully crafted, and it's clear that a lot of effort has been put into it.The game truly reflects the world we imagined from the books. The visuals from the movies and books have been brilliantly synthesized. Instead of using the names from the original story to sell the game, they've been carefully avoided. The references are just right. The game takes place in the 1800s, so there's a different teaching staff, different enemies, and different problems. The variety of enemies and the way the story progresses gave me the feeling of detective work that I had in the books, and like in the books, you find yourself in the middle of a big problem, and you collect bits of information from the many events around you. The story telling in the game, and the progression of information and mystery, made me very happy.The game, like classic Harry Potter games, is full of puzzles that you have to solve and hidden secrets that you have to uncover all around the castle, and solving these and working for them is really fun.The graphics are beyond great. I didn't encounter any bugs or optimization problems. The spell effects, inspired by the movie, are fantastic and look great. I can't find anything to say about the design of the school, it's perfect. Even after spending a long time, it still continues to enchant.Regarding the music, the original music from the movie was not abandoned, and generally new fantastic music has been created based on that theme.The story has a completely new Hogwarts and teaching staff. The characteristics of the teaching staff are completely different from the original story. For example, you may not see the professor of dark arts as a bad character. They have characters that are quite intriguing. In terms of voice acting, they've found a voice that's very similar to Daniel Radcliffe's, and generally his reactions are compatible with Harry Potter. This didn't bother me.The only thing I think the game is missing is that the chosen school sections could be a bit more effective. I would have liked more specific tasks for the chosen section after selection, and more tasks for your section...In conclusion, the game is amazing. It is not unrealistic to think that the producer will make us happy with new tasks and expansions in the future.I wish everyone good games and I definitely recommend playing this game."

I have no doubt that future optimization patches further down the line will help smoothen out some FPS drops that many seem to be reporting, including myself. The soundtrack is beautiful and the audio in this game really needs to be experienced with headphones on for the full immersion experience.

Gameplay quickly becomes tedious and uninspired. The entire world feels like a bland Assassins Creed game with a million pointless completionist tasks that bare no significance to anything or anyone. Ironically, there's no sense of magic in this game at all. Attend Hogwarts for a whopping 8 hours of school-time and watch cutscenes so you don't have to experience the tedium of class life, fly slowly and with great limitation to exotic locations such as Hill and Rocks, or Paddock, perhaps the illustrious NPC Village of static dialogue. Visit and explore Hogsmeade; In under 10 minutes because there's literally nothing to do there except buy a few things. Murder hundreds of humans and goblins along the way, whilst bitterly murmuring about the diabolical things these witches and wizards are planning. Evil deeds that can only be halted and disrupted by the angelic magic prodigy that is the stout and dependable ""Shlemhrimhrer,"" named aptly because companies don't know how to be PC without being absurd.

Combat is pretty fun and can be challenging, even on the normal difficulty; and the story is not that bad, either.

Nonetheless, if you have the money, go for it 👍However, I know there are MANY people unsure out of fear of backlash from friends or rando's on the internet due to the IP being owned by J. K. Rowling. Trust me, I hate her too and am annoyed with the nonsense she spouts from her bigoted brain of hers, I DO NOT support her views or values whatsoever. That doesn't mean I can't enjoy anything that came from what OTHERS have made based from her world; I still enjoy the movies, and I most certainly am enjoying Hogwarts Legacy.You are not a terrible person for getting this game, you are not a transphobe, you are not aiding in her already deep pockets. You are valid, you should do what you want. Boycott if you want to boycott, but DO NOT bully or harass others for buying/playing this game. If you REALLY care that much, use the $60 to donate towards a charity that benefits those that J.K. hates so much.

Hogwarts Legacy is a game every gamer must play: wether you're a fan of Harry Potter or not. Wether you like JK Rowling or not. Grant yourself some enjoyment and get this masterpiece.PS: The fact that this game remains at €60 puts Square Enix' preposterous €80 price point to shame even more. Go eat a bag of marbles Square Enix.

Architecture, textures, sounds, atmosphere,... everything feels like straight out of the movies.And most importantly there are NO MICROTRANSACTIONS ! (those would be a deal breaker for me)Combat is enjoyable and can be great fun when trying new spell combinations or making use of the environment.Definitely better than Witcher 3.The biggest downside are the challenges.I mean they are pretty good and there is great variety, however you have to do them too many times.Merlin trials were very anoying and too repetitive for me because I wanted maximum inventory size.Despite that I really enjoyed just run or fly around and explore without knowing where I'm going or what to expect ahead.I also spent lot of time decorating my room of requirement and magical worlds for my creatures.But I was expecting more assets so there it definitely room for improvement either by patches,DLC or probably most likely MODs.Increasing creature limit would be nice as 12 is way too small.Definitely looking forward playing this one again in a year or so with some cool MODs or DLCs."

I thought they would be a chore, but the game has several ways to point out what you're missing and where, although you may need help with a guide in a few occasions.It doesn't really have any innovation in its mechanics, but it uses good known formulas for open-world RPGs (level, spells and item progression, character and item customization, a small player hub that will expand throughout the adventure and allows you to customize all sort of cosmetics/decoration, and lots of lore, secrets and references to be found."

If that isn't the definitive Hogwarts Experience I don't know what is.         Jokes aside Hogwarts legacy does a great job in effortlessly letting you into the world. The castle is exceptionally well made and running around exploring it a joy.  The combat is a blast as you have a veritable arsenal of familiar spells to play around with.                                                                                                                            I do have minor gripes about not having mandatory classes everyday but that's just me.  The game feels like it's optimised really well as aside from a few minor drops in fps whilst outside , it runs well.Overall if you loved The Wizarding World as a kid, you'll have an absolute blast playing it and if not ,the games is still fun enough to keep you engaged"

As a player, it really does feel like you're at Hogwarts, with all of the familiar settings, characters, and spells.However, the game's biggest problem is the extremely boring gameplay. All of the puzzles are too easy, and if you do happen to struggle, your character will start thinking out loud and reveal the solution within five seconds. A good chunk of the quests revolve around farming items rather than engaging in immersive story quests, making the gameplay tedious and repetitive.Another issue with the game is that it feels lifeless, lacking any random events or anything to make the world feel alive. This makes exploring the world feel like a chore, rather than an adventure.Some other problems:* You can stand right next to your teachers and cast forbidden spells like Crucio without them even reacting. * You don't have the ability to make choices that significantly impact the game's outcome* Finally, the game's quest system is outdated, with the game constantly reminding you to return to your quest, making it feel more like a game from the year 2000 than a modern RPGOverall, while the feeling of being at Hogwarts is well-executed, the game's boring gameplay, lifeless world, lack of consequences, and outdated quest system make it a disappointment for those expecting an immersive and engaging experience."

I couldn't get into it. My fandom was established with the movies, and even though I enjoy them, I'm not what I would consider a huge Harry Potter fan. But my wife is, and because of her, I've gotten to see the full breadth of what this game is. At several points in the game, she started crying despite herself. She'd get mad about it, chuckle, and then carry on only to be gobsmacked by some other tiny detail that only she could appreciate as a fan of the books. In her words, the devs understood and captured the appeal of why everyone wanted to live in the Wizarding World. Say what you will about the controversy surrounding the HP universe, but I think it's clear that the devs put a lot of love into making a Hogwarts that is for everyone. Mechanics-wise, it's similar to other WB games but the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Confringo combat is frantic enough to be consistently interesting. The side quests are actually interesting and fit within the overall narrative. The only downside is that quite a few of them are collect-a-thons of varying flavors. If you're a lore nerd, then you'll be pleased.Oh, and despite what's been reported prior to the official launch, your House choice DOES actually make a difference. My wife and I had two different approaches to a quest based on House choice, with both of us meeting characters and visiting locations that the other didn't. My gripes are minor and deal more with the immersive qualities in RPGs. You can't sit, the cats meow sounds weirdly demonic when you pet them, and there isn't much reason to spend time in any of the spaces when you're not questing or collecting. I kinda wanted a Bully-style immersive game, but I understand why they went with the approach that ultimately shipped. Haven't finished it yet, but I am happy with what I've played."
