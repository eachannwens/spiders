0,1,Zicerite,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zachbeezer/,"5,188",86,1,113.0,"Posted: 16 February, 2022",202,83,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/9d3ac17bc05d03bb26897a2c9a7121d748e62808.jpg,"Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been ""playable"" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the ""next gen"" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.The game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now."

I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. 2 years later... I'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch; I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. 1 day later...I can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. ""It looks decent and actually pretty fun now,"" I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.2 days later...I see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam; just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. Present day... This game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!Some thoughts:This game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. P.S.Also watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game... It's so great and the story in both the game and the show are breathtaking. 11/10."

I'm literally making this review as a reminder. Had a blast so far but jesus guys, update your nvidia drivers.ULTRA EDIT:I might as well actually review this game in its current state considering the attention this got, while I have not finished it I feel I have experienced enough of the core mechanics to formulate an accurate opinion at least on the gameplay. It is a Witcher 3 reskin with a cyberpunk setting, considering that Witcher 3 was amazing (and I still have yet to get through it entirely) it does translate. Narratively this game excels, the dialogue is well written and acted and the characters are hard to not fall in love with. Walking around the world is exhilarating although unengaging, it is lacking interactivity. That being said the gameplay itself is a lot of fun. The guns pack a huge punch, very satisfying to use. The melee with katanas specifically is fun but broken, I did a body and reflex melee build and was able to behead TONS of foes before they even had time to react. The game is unfortunately plagued with bugs, less severe bugs especially after the recent hotfix but there are a myriad of small immersion raping bugs that pop up here and there Bethesda style. Ultimately I invest in player agency/good writing and fun gameplay at the end of the day, the graphics are important but less so. The decision-making of Witcher is here and that's really what I like the most HOWEVER this game was clearly not ready and considering recent events with the dev I will be hard pressed to trust them again. This is an incredibly bad launch. All of that being said, if you're the type that is a fan of Deus Ex, Dishonored, or Fallout: New Vegas you will love this game warts and all just for the godlike quest design those and this game offer. Plenty of skill check dialogue to be found. Suffice to say that I have had a good amount of ""That actually worked?!?"" moments so far which is a really hard feeling to nail down with games like this, you usually only get that out of CRPGs like Age of Decadence or Divinity, etc. At the same time I do not judge anyone that refunds this game or waits for a more stable version to come out because CD PROJEKT RED really dropped the ball and should not have released the game in this state. In conclusion, this game is mostly what I expected it to be and it is a shame that people expected this game to be the second coming of Jesus. I was banking on the decision making and quest design and this game delivers on those fronts. Everything else though, it does fail here and there but, in my opinion, not enough to make the game genuinely bad. If I had to give it a score out of ten it would be a solid 8/10. Hopefully CD PROJEKT RED can iron out all of these problems in a timely manner and elevate its standing.Also driving anything is just plain awful, it depends on what you're driving but in my opinion it should just be the same for whatever you're driving but I'm just talking out of my ass at this point."

I've done three playthroughs, one when it came out, one after a patch a few months ago, and one now.Patch 1.5 has been the least buggy that I've ever played the game. There's more content, and more features.You should never forget that CDPR sold us a buggy, broken game. That features are still incredibly shallow and nothing of what we were initially promised. But that aside, Cyberpunk 2077 is still a story, and a world, worth experiencing. I'd get it on sale(it seems to be on sale for a pretty deep discount very often) and not pay full price, but it is still worth getting.Characters worth meeting, a game worth playing, and a story worth experiencing. Definitely one I'd say you should pick up when the price is right for you."

Jumping from World of Warships (fairly new at that also) to this gives you an idea. Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games. So, I am floored by this game. To me its amazing. Now I set the combat at an easy level and I bumble around in here and am in no hurry. I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more games, as I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time. I love the characters of this game, the visuals of it, and have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or something, but this does not bother me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this is very rare. Well done to the developers of this game."

As someone who played it two years after release, here are my thoughts on what the game is like in its current state, without any hype or rage attached to it. In short: I was pleasantly surprised. Like, a lot.I picked this game up for cheap with low expectations. I expected something flawed but fun in a mindless way like Far Cry but I couldn't have been any more wrong. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game made with genuine love and care, with impressive attention to detail. The game was much more immersive and RPG-like than I thought it'd be, and the characters and story were top-notch. It reminded me a lot of Deus Ex and Fallout: New Vegas.I think this game deserves special praise for being a AAA open world with zero padding. That is, you can ignore all of the side content and railroad through the main quest and finish the game in 10 hours if you really want to. The side quests are also extremely good though, and I was drawn to doing them solely because I found the characters and world fascinating. I think Night City deserves praise as an open world that feels hand-crafted and intrinsically interesting; nothing in it felt like mindless copied-and-pasted content to me.Of course, your mileage may vary. This game is not GTA or The Elder Scrolls, and I think a lot of the disappointment that people have with this game even now comes from this fact. The driving isn't great, the pedestrian AI is basic, and you can't go into every single building. But I think that's fine. The game is a story-focused RPG and Night City is just there as the pretty backdrop in between missions. The real meat of this game is the narrative and characters.For years I'd been hearing about how CDPR didn't ""deliver on their promises"" but after playing through the whole thing, I can't really say I feel that way. I had a blast and my only true gripe with the game is that it's unfortunately still riddled with bugs. You won't encounter anything game-breaking, but it is worth mentioning, so keep that in mind. Regardless of that though, I was still pleasantly surprised, and this is probably my favorite game I played this year. Long live Night City."

Like me, you probably see this on a sale, and think it's gone down in price, it was a hot topic a while ago, and maybe you should take advantage of the opportunity that you see before you and pick it up while you have the chance. It's been out for a while, and they've probably cleared out most of the bugs by now, and it's *probably* a pretty good game at this point. It is. Kind of. You'll probably be able to make it through the main story, and a few of the most important side quests relatively bug free. The story is great. I think it's partially worth it on story alone. But because of that, you'll be longing for more. You'll keep seeing it in your steam library a month or two later, and feel guilty that you haven't picked it back up again. But you'll know that as soon as you do, you will continually be disappointed.It feels unfinished outside of the main story. There's content there, but it gets repetitive really quickly. There are tons of opportunities to buy new vehicles, and do more side gigs. But half of the time spent playing the game outside of the main story arc is spent searching through articles and forum posts about how to get an event to trigger that you missed, or to hack your way around an issue here or there. Mission events that are totally out of your control like waiting for a phone call just don't happen. And the worst part is, yes, you can get it to work. You can *technically* play everything that exists in the game in its current state. But eventually the workarounds will become too cumbersome. You'll let it sit on your recently played list for a while, until the next sale, when you can replace it with something better.I'm just here to tell you that when this time inevitably comes, it's okay to let it go. You had a great run, but there's no shame in uninstalling. Just be sure to remember all of the good times that you had together."

But for the biggest part, it's all fixed now. There are still some bugs, but in most cases they are just visual.To be honest they are quite ridiculously funny. Imagine driving alongside a character and then you witness the character start spinning to 360 degrees its limbs around like it was possessed by some demon.In a way CP2077 became family for me, you know? You somewhat hate some of your relatives but you still love them in another way, right? Well that's CP2077 for me.It took me some few good hours to learn to love the game, and i would say, i am very happy i didn't give up on it.As i said above, as far as bugs go, it's pretty stable and i didn't really encounter anything that was major.Obviously, people are different so this is purely my opinion, but i don't like how the car driving feels in this game, it feels too.. stiff and unnatural, it might be just me because i am used to old-school car driving, let's say GTA 3/NFS (anything before NFS 5 - Porsche). Driving a bike on the other hand is amazing, it's what i use most of the times.- Another thing that is somewhat annoying, the waypointing system is somewhat bad, the routes you get aren't the most efficient ones, and often your objective isn't appearing on the 'floor' it really is, so you end up searching for something and then realize it might be in some hidden basement or something.- The UI seems to be a bit cluttered and confusing and it takes a bit to get used to, or maybe i am just getting old, but i feel like there's no point in over-complicating things.- The overall mechanics or however you want to call them feel somewhat mediocre, but it's fine by me, the game compensates with other stuff.- You cannot edit your facial/body features/tattoos. Once you press that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ button. That's how you'll be stuck for life. One more thing, and this probably was my biggest 'oof' about the game was that the assault rifles are pretty awful.Pistols? Good! Revolvers? Great! Sniper Rifles and Melee Weapons? Amazing!, but the assault rifles are just bad and inefficient. Even shotguns are decent. While this section might have less of these bulletpoints, they're the pillar of this game, the ultimate moneyshot.The world is so big you will feel like frog in the Ural mountains, you will feel so small.It's quite an interesting feeling that i could never get from any game before, for me this thing made the game so much more immersive.It's a beautiful game with purely astonishing views, amazing world details and such, but the size of it all, too. So many streets, alleys, not to mention if you go climbing like a goat on all the buildings.  In my opinion, if you're into walking simulators, this alone could be worth your eddies (i.e. money).The story is more than decent, it avoids some of the most boring cliches, although, it's not anything mindblowing.Friendships and relationships come and go in odd ways, depending on how you make your decisions, i think it's pretty rare to actually feel like your decisions really affect people in games. To feel like you're actually influence someone real.Often when i had to make decisions i was encountering dillemas such as 'Hm, c'mon, this dude is a decent fella, i shouldn't be a ♥♥♥♥ to him', and well, i usually don't overthink that kind of stuff in a game, lol.The game is a modder's paradise if you're into that, the internet is full of tutorials and content, they aren't very finicky to install, however, updates usually tend to mess with them.Did i mention side gigs? There's plenty of them, but also random events happening around as you walk, such as groups of gang members commiting dumb stuff. Obviously you can go past them, but would you? After this game will suck you in, you won't be able to stop sinking hours in it.While we're on this subject, my advice would be to not rush into the story (I kinda did and i am not very happy about it), and enjoy some of these side stuff first, besides leveling up and getting cool stuff which will aid you in the main missions later, it's also the best way to get to know the game.There's so many references and easter eggs, some subtle, some not so subtle, especially if you're from Eastern Europe.You can play the game any way you want. You can go the boring route, non-lethal and stealthy, or you can go in guns blazing, and not leave one single cell in an enemy's body alive. Of course, a combination between all of these options is also a possibility, but i like to keep it simple.I do wish it was more fun to play in stealth. While i usually am not the stealthy kind of gamer, i can and do appreciate a game with good stealth. CP2077 doesn't have a good nor bad stealth, it's just.. average, i guess?(With this, i mean purely by how it feels for me to play it in stealth. You do get to be very creative in stealth, you have interesting ways to mess with the enemies and distract them, but the 'satisfaction' just isn't there for me)Ultimately, it's a game that will suck you in, you will have fun for hours, the world is purely amazing, you'll feel like 'Woah' all the time. I initially bought this game on pre-order, i was angry about the delays, before i got the chance to play it at the release, my PC died. Now after 1 year i finally get to play it (I know it's better that i didn't play it at launch, but it's about the principle).I am happy with my purchase, and for the price i paid (one night out in the city ), i had and still have a lot of fun, even if i already saw 2 endings, i am not letting my grip of it, i don't even remember when i was so caught in a game that i played it without a break until the sun was rising.Probably i will go for full completion. 60h in this game passed so fast, and there's still plenty of juice in this baby.As far as the developers go... I know they got a lot of poo thrown at them, but they're people and they make mistakes, and they weren't lazy. I would say things went wrong because of the team leading/resource management, but that's another subject and quite irrelevant. Point is.. their hearts are in the right place, and they fixed a majority of issues, and they still are working on the game.Maybe i am being too soft about the situation, but it is what it is, i can't say i am not disappointed because it's not how i expected the game to be after how it was marketed pre-release, but i also like to believe i have some common sense and ability to make the best out of situations.Edit:After putting around 150h in this game, i must say, there were few more bugs i encountered, but nothing major, except, i once fell through the map and the game reloaded from the last checkpoint."

I did not experience any bugs that disrupted my game experience any more than having to reload my game and one instance i will mention below.Pros:True evolution of the bread crumb story system. Those familiar with the concept of save scumming will be happy to know that an extra 20-30 hours or multiple unique playthroughs can be squeezed out just by simply trying all of the text options or trying a different combat approach. Different combat and pacifist approaches can lead to entire new quest chains or missed opportunities. Without going into too much detail, multiple friends and I have had majorly different outcomes playing the same class in the same style/build as well as found tertiary outcomes in subsequent playthroughs. Can't stress how good this aspect is enough.Side content for days. While the main story itself is only 15-20 hours, the side content is easily double if not triple that. Between cyberpsychos/gigs/police/side kick story quests/flavor text quests it can actually be quite overwhelming when you begin the game. For the full experience I highly recommend completing all of the sidekick story quests as they give the opportunity to experience the most endings as well as inject the most girth into the primary story. Easily the highlight of the game. This is obvious when comparing my two playthroughs, in the 100% one I had a complete feeling of understanding. the directions things were going were carried by these side quests, all of the motivations and history are there. In my rushed playthrough, it simply felt like a series of conversations with johnny silverhand and taking turns swapping bodies. completely different experiences. I just felt like I was rushing around doing errands for johnny by pushing only the main story.Night City. It's the best city video games have blessed us with to date. Yes, despite the ""crowd AI'' not being amazing. Yes, despite there not being ""1k+ routines."" Yes, I played RDR2 and GTAV and yada yada yada. Night City is alive and you can hear it breathing. This is amplified 10x when you acquire the double jump or rocket jump legs. The verticality they promised was delivered in spades. EVERYTHING is climbable. Give it a shot. Look around.Endings. 6 of them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. SIX. 1 is hilarious (in a morbid way). 1 was the appropriate ending(IMO). 1 was out of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AAA blockbuster movie. 1 is what gamers want. 1 is trippy. 1 is sad.Make a save at the point of no return and give em all a shot. They're worth it.Cons:Loot. If you played Witcher 3, it's the same song and dance. Massive amounts of useless scaled loot where everywhere you look you see slight 1% dps upgrades to already existing items. Add onto that you have a weight/stash system and it just becomes a chore by the end game. If you are a packrat like me, invest into the body perk for 60 extra carrying capacity for peace of mind. The exception to this con are the ""iconic weapons'' that are unlocked after completing certain criteria. Unique and useful, I found ""skippy"" to be the best weapon in the entire game. Look out for him and the other icons :)Lifepaths. Thankfully on my first playthrough I chose corpo. I feel like I had ample chat options that really fell into line with the core story path and made me feel initially that lifepaths weren't as bad as people made them out to be. After experiencing nomad and corpo both to completion I can say that this section really does feel unfinished. There needs to be more content before coming into night city as a nomad and building up the relationship with jackie in the prologue. Again, rushed. Sad. One of my most anticipated features.AI. This is as of the day 1 version of the game. The combat AI is.....bad. It is only saved by the fact that you can use guns and snipe people from the shadows from a distance. After having played a full melee and ranged playthrough, melee is in a rough spot. Don't take this to mean that melee is more difficult, it simply means that the AI is so bad that they clump up and spin in circles or glitch through walls to 1 shot you with a shotgun and you will end up getting gangbanged every time. Cop AI is....missing. If you commit a crime and get 4 stars just let them kill you or drive away far enough, they will simply give up. There are no correction routines for driving AI. Simply park your car on the road to create an infinite traffic jam.No crash reactions. No crash animations. You can hit a wall at 200 mph and be fine. They make no attempts to course correct or avoid collision, same with the crowd AI. If you double jump in public people will just...huddle near you..scared for their life? Again, AI feels missing.Limited romance options. For all the controversy and hype this topic got it ended up so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bland. I know its a weird thing to complain about but I can walk around and see vulgarity at every corner and you're telling me theres no brain dance station to plug into?  there's 1 brothel in all of night city? only 2 joytoys? Again I understand how minor this is. Just confusing. Most of the primary romance options in this game only ""swing"" one way, based on the ""gender"" you chose at the beginning of the game. So if you went in with ideas of who you wanted to ♥♥♥♥, you may be very dissapointed (if you care at all.)Braindance sequences in the primary story. Thought they were too specific with requiring you to wait for chat dialogue to finish. rewind/fast forward is too slow and not snappy to your inputs. you can end up just looking around aimlessly looking for 1 piece to scan at a specific timestamp. Not very interesting overall and I believe they could have been better served as a cutscene. Overall boring.I had one graphical bug that came at a very unfortunate moment during the prologue. A pistol went thru a key members head during a pivotal scene and really ruined the mood. This was the only instance of immersion breaking i experienced from bugs other than typical day 1 shenanigans.No Mini-games. Not even gwent? cmon.Conclusion:Without going into story specific details, this is one of the most enjoyable RPGs i've played in my life. The amount of variables you have to play with in the beautiful world of night city is actually crazy. When I read reviewers saying that they hated johnny silverhand because he was an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or that they didnt really understand the story and that it all felt rushed, I feel bad. Or I read on reddit that the game was too buggy to enjoy and there were too many dropped/cut features to be a ""good game"", I feel bad. We played different games. I got an 80-100 hour open world RPG set in a cyberpunk universe with characters that had personality, a story that had me wondering about the possibilities so much that I immediately started a second playthrough. A city that was handcrafted top to bottom with views so nice I was constantly snapshotting and posting them on discord. A soundtrack that had me wanting to sit in cars to finish tracks. I got a game that I am disappointed having finished.Waitin to slurp up that DLC.Overall Rating:My Gut says 6 months from now or whenever the first DLC drops this game will be a 9.2-9.5. In  its current state I would give it an 8.7-8.9 ish. 10s dont exist. Wake up, Choom."

People were promised a next-gen experience. I've played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then this. - Police appear out of nowhere.- Police are amazingly easy to escape. You can walk a block away and lose them.- Civilian NPC's appear and disappear when you're not looking.- The A.I. is alot my artificial then intelligent. The only reaction they ever have is to duck or completely disappear in thin air. - The A.I. is basically on rails; they will not drive or walk around anything you put in front of them, they'll just stop and sit there for eternity.- The world doesn't actually feel alive (no random encounters). NPC enemies spawn in the exact same place every single time without fail.- Bars and food are exactly the same vendor with a different coat of paint. No matter where you go you can't sit down and eat something, or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless it's a talking-scene tied to a quest).- You can't interact with shop keepers beyond buying something or receiving maybe two lines of chit-chat. You can't rob them. You can't kill them. You can't get quests from them. They won't even react if you lob a grenade at them.- The ""car chases"" are on rails and there's only 3-4 prescripted car chases in the game.- Only 2% of ""choices"" your character makes in dialogue has any effect on the story. The rest are just alternate dialogue to give the appearance of choice and replayability. - Character starting paths (Street kid, Nomad, Corpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.- Player characters have no reflection unless you use the specific mirror located in your apartment. - You can't alter the look of your character after the initial character creation. Not even a haircut.- Can't customize your apartment in any way, shape, or form.- There's almost no reason to ever go back to your apartment after being there the first time.- Vehicles can't be customized; no new paints, liveries, or body-pieces.- There are 4 mini-games total: Hacking, shooting-range, boxing, and car racing. There are only two shooting-range quests, only 6 boxing matches, and only 4 races. That's it as far as mini-games go.You can fix bugs but unless CD somehow improves the lack-luster world and experience they created, I can't recommend this game to anyone."

Yes, it was that bad. A colossal failure that shook the very foundation of CDPR. Once, more than a crowd favourite, an exemplar video game company that could do no wrong. Now, deeply tarnished and with much to prove. I was not as burnt as others, as I had not pre-purchased the game. Remember kids, never pre-purchase. I did follow the news of the game though and I was very interested in its premise. Now, a few years later, the game is apparently in a better state and seems to have gotten a second lease on life. I felt this was the right time to give one of the most famous, or rather infamous, games of this generation a chance.Let's begin by saying the game is incredibly ambitious. An attempt to transfer the famed Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop RPG to a video game. In the form of a sequel no less. That game's deep and captivating lore, world-building and great legacy characters are here to provide a solid foundation. Unfortunately the execution is not smooth. Much has been made about the game's plethora of bugs. Indeed, to this day it is a complete glitchfest, a janky mess. Characters walking around holding invisible weapons, falling into walls, cars flying up or moving in impossible ways and many more. Every few moments there is a glitch. Luckily I did not encounter any actual game-breaking bugs, but I shudder at the thought of how bad the game must have been when it released. Still, the bugs and glitches obscure the fact the game has more serious design problems, that it is, in fact, a rather uneven game at its core.Take Night City for example. At first, it lures you in with its ocean of icons and distractions. But it soon starts to ring hollow. Once you scratch under the glossy, neon surface it becomes apparent that Night City doesn't really have all that much of substance going for it. All the people around, the buildings, the impressive vistas, they are just props with limited interaction. The main plot is another example. It begins quite well and sets the stage for a truly epic tale, but it runs out of steam half-way through. In the end it just concludes. It rather feels like the creators intended for a longer experience that was haphazardly trimmed down. Indeed the main story's surprisingly quick conclusion unbalances the experience. The many simple sidequests were good when there was some main story to break them up with, but once you are out of main story, they grow stale. It doesn't help that much of the side-content is repetitive gigs and police raids.I did mention the legacy characters earlier and I can confidently say, Johnny Silverhand is simply awesome. Perhaps a bit too awesome. His presence is so conspicuous I just can't believe he is not the protagonist. He has it all. Charisma, badass attitude, a mission, as well as tragic flaws. The segments you play as him are some of the most fun and empowering, as well as depressing moments in the game. V, the actual protagonist, just doesn't add up. I understand that V is meant to be more of a shell for the player to insert their personality and although there is the ability to pick a background or three, V is still quite thin as far as character substance goes. At first I thought it's because Johnny was played by Keanu Reeves, but I quickly realized that the other legacy characters were also a step up from their game-only cohorts. So while the ""Keanu factor"" helps, I think there is also a gap in writing talent involved here. This contrast was a mild disappointment.Moving to the gameplay itself, I have to say I did enjoy it. Yes the design problems continue and touch gameplay considerations as well, for example the absurd weapon upgrade system, but the game generally plays well enough. It offers enough variety to keep things fresh. Different types of weapons, ranged and melee. Quickhacking and a hacking mini-game. Stealth segments. Cyberware that can slow down time, turn you invisible or provide other advantages. Even a fairly enjoyable driving around experience. There is certainly a lack of polish and the game doesn't really excel in any of those aspects. It's hardly a top-notch shooter or an A-class driving game. But that it tries to do all of these things together and pulls it off reasonably well is admirable anyway. For as long as there was some decent content to play through in Night City, being in that game's world was fun.To conclude my thoughts, I think that something went wrong with the development of Cyberpunk 2077. Yes, hearing about the sorry state it released in and experiencing the still present glitches galore on offer that much is obvious. But I do mean something went really wrong here. The creators seemed to have had a vision, indeed a grand vision, that simply was left half-shaped and unfinished. Cyberpunk 2077 is not a bad game by any stretch. I enjoyed my time with it. But it is an incredibly disappointing one. The expectations it creates, it simply never delivers. It sets itself up to touch the stars and falls flat on its face. Do I recommend this game? To fans of the cyberpunk genre in general and Pondsmith's work in particular, absolutely. But I do advise going in holding a fairly small basket."

Thank you CD Projekt Red for ruining the parts of the game I enjoyed the most.1. GOOD: The map updates were great, especially the configurable filters.2. GOOD: The ability to track Fixer missions complete vs available is nice; and so are the gifts they give you when you finish all of them.3. GOOD: You fixed the Pacifier resistance mod. Thank you.3. BAD: You retcon'd the skill system and equipment qualifications so much I couldn't use weapons and armor I had customized and used for over 300 hours of gameplay.4. REALLY BAD: You so completely NERFED armor and armor mods, that my armor (after 300+ hours of play) is now at half the strength it was, and I can only craft defense mods half the strength I could before. Why the hell would you do that? You don't nerf gear in solo games. You only do that crap for game balance in MMO and PvP games. That was a true knucklehed move.5. RIDICULOUS: You overbuffed MaxTac and Border Patrol so much they dodge every bullet if you have agro'd them. Number 4 has ruined the game for me. As I said below, I've completed it multiple times already, and there is no infinite playability because fixers don't generate random missions - once you finish their mission queues that's it; and standard mobs and mob hideouts/dungeon crawls don't respawn. So messing with NCPD MaxTac, and Border Patrol were the only remaining fun. EXTREMELY disappointed. Time for me to uninstall. >:-(***ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW***I have played through Cyberpunk 2077 four times, male and female, all three character choice types (Nomad, Street, Corp), and each available ending. I like the gameplay mechanics, the city and story are really really good. The music kicks ass! However, as a player of the original pen-and-paper Cyberpunk 2020 and Night City this is based on... this ain't Cyberpunk 2020.What I think they got right::: Combat feels very balanced, and the variety is good (melee, ranged, etc.) (though I wish you could hire NPC henchmen and build a team that can level with you - netrunners for overwatch, solos, snipers, etc.). Weapons selections, and mods are excellent. Vehicles are fun - though I find motorcycles are most efficient for travel. Scale (the game environment is HUGE). Ambiance and environment can get really immersive.What I think was okay, but could have been much better::: Interpersonal relationships. Don't get me wrong the main NPCs are outstanding. The movement, script, etc. - great. But the people on the street? not much there. There were definite opportunities for the developer to integrate enhanced relationships with various NPCs - Rogue, and many in the merc underworld; The Us Crack girls; Jefferson Peralez the mayoral candidate (his quest reached a climax, and then just quits - very disappointing). Cops? No sources of intel/friends on the force to speak to for info on gigs, personalities, or other info. The Talent/Skills trees are okay. Too many skill bonuses to select from only enhance combat capabilities when you are doing special actions like slides, and melee functions that don't really match my play style. In general the Talent/Skill system is good though, and does make a difference for many needed functions like hacking, crafting, and others.What I think they got wrong::: Fixers. Mission assignment. no Infinite playability. Lack of character customization - No ability to visit a salon and change a hairstyle, or get a tatoo. No ability to alter the physique of your character - on the female character you can change the breast size, but that's it. The male character can change penis size... really? That was necessary? I've played over 250 hours and those features are needed maybe 2 minutes on screen; and the clothing system? Really? Especially for the outfits you craft yourself - you should be able to pick the colors. Can't believe I can go to a high-society corp clothing store and spend $3000.00 on a shirt, but can't pick the color of the cloth.Cyberpunk 2020 was about immersive role playing. Going to the fixer locations, negotiating your price, building a team, developing enemies (watch your back), and allies and sources for intel and gear, as well as fixer missions, and growing your rep with factions.Cyberpunk 2077 is a very playable, and fun game, but would benefit greatly from a better mission system, respawning mobs, and random/infinitely spawning player-leveled side missions and gigs. I have played every side mission, every gig, bought every car, and finished every NCPD and other on-map alert and there is literally nothing left to do but cruise around hunting gangers, and screwing with Arasaka, Militech, and NCPD MaxTac. ...and WHY don't MaxTac mobs drop gear? Same for the border. No drops?I'll keep playing it, because I like it, but I'm praying for some serious DLC coming soon, and some game mechanics fixes to allow greater infinite playability."

And yeah, there were some issues, but when you can just hide behind a handle and spam away on the net without a care in the world, the complaints stacked up and didn't give the vidiot its due justice. When you want to create the best, there is some gonks out there who will tear you down.Sure, there were a few netrunners too who threatened the corpos, but little good that did them. Didn't slow down the developers. They kept pouring time and energy into the game. Fixin' it up and making it flash.The developers broke their corpo leash and kept giving to us. Listening to the us chooms instead of those NetNerds who squat their mom's basements. That is why I nominated Cyberpunk 2077 for the Labor of Love in the 2022 Steam Awards. The developers care. A lot. And they continue to prove it by releasing new content, fixes, and polishin' the vidiot like a diamond.Bottom line choom; when you need that escape from deep reality, you can get your fix with Cyberpunk 2077. Is it worth the eddies? You betcha it is.Also, if you haven't eyeballed it yet, go check out the vidflick Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.Good hunting, choom."

Just the game itself, the gameplay and  the mechanics.To be clear, I was never part of any hype train and only paid attention to what CDPR specifically said the game would be.For me it’s just so telling for the game in general. Even after they fix it, the point still persist. It’s such a ultra basic thing for the minimap to zoom out while driving in games like this (so you don’t have to slow down before every junction in case you MIGHT have to turn next), but they still got it wrong.That’s kinda what you can expect feeling a lot while playing this game.Saying to yourself; “… Huh? Why does it act like that, and not like this?”, “It would have been better if…”, “It would have made a lot more sense if.”You will feel this especially if you have any experience with GTA or other games in which do open world city driving etc. (we will definitely be getting back to that later).Even though it’s really poorly optimized, it IS visually very impressive. It looks amazing. Stunning.I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere, the look of the city, the open world in general, the lore, most of the story, the battle/gun system, the great side quests that often more than rivals a lot of what the main story have to offer, the perk system and the ability to equip Cyberware.That list is sadly quite long, and mostly subjective of course.First off, the game has been cut to pieces/heavily watered down from the original vision/marketing.E.g., day and night cycles, the metro, weather impacting the game, important life path selection (it doesn’t matter at all), crowd community system, third person cutscenes, the AI etc. etc.The AI was supposed to be groundbreaking, but instead it is groundbreakingly bad.It feels so stiff and fake and there’s nothing to it at all. No reactions, no interactions, no heart, no factions you can play into for depth, no nothing.You will never feel more alone in a huge city than you do playing this game.Much older games did it way better. There were supposed to be routines etc. for the NPCs, they were supposed to feel alive and part of the game.That’s not at all the case.They can do two things:1. Cower.2. Run and de-spawn right in front of your eyes (literally).They don’t react to you in any meaningful way at all.The AI itself is non-existent. That’s mostly true for the Cop System as well. You never see them or interact with them. There are no car chases, no real wanted system. You see them from time to time on street corners, almost T-posing.Other than that, they just always annoy you if you aim your gun in public or hit a pedestrian etc. and they then almost always WILL become aggro to you. If you did the deed on the top of a mountain, a cop probably saw it somehow.Even if you go in guns blazing out of nowhere helping them on a “Crime”, they ignore you before, during and after the fact.As a whole the wanted system should have been cut as it’s detrimental to the gameplay and immersion.I mean, they only just recently patched that cops would spawn right behind you no matter where you were at the time (in the weeds or on top of a building).Looks great, feels very unreal as I’ve been saying. There is a lot to do, but it has absolutely NO effect on anything at all. It doesn’t impact you, the game or the AI.Nothing you do will. The “Gigs”, “Crimes” etc. are just random no effect happenings - plus loot.It’s just you, against the virtual world in which you are imprisoned. And with that I mean that it feels like you are in a virtual world - in game.It was actually good. But it’s very clear how much they have watered down the experience to be able to get it out as fast as possible. The prologue with Jackie is the closest you get to the “next gen RPG” feels. But the buck stops there. After that it just becomes normal/average current/last gen. Not directly bad, by any means. Just really disappointing.The worst thing for me with the story, is that it’s finite. It’s closed off. Either you finish the game, or you don’t.I wanted to complete the last mission and then keep playing after the fact (somehow).Go back and do the stuff I didn’t do. But you can’t. You can only go back to before doing the last mission. It feels bad after all that work, and it shows if you look at how fast people stop playing it on Steam alone.I wanted to keep playing, building my character, doing side quests, tie up loose ends - until new content came out. Because, you know, it’s supposed to be a next gen open world RPG.It’s definitely not that. Visually maybe.Just to be clear. This is not GTA nor should it be.But it’s still the funniest thing ever. It seems like they have gone above and beyond to not being compared to GTA. I’m pretty sure it was probably banned to talk about GTA in their office during development.That would explain a lot as to all the things they missed or got wrong.GTA is a game with similar city vibes. What’s wrong with looking at what they are doing right when it comes to open world driving, AI, city stuff, interactions, reactions, physics and mechanics? And then making them even better for this gen?Physics and mechanics are physics and mechanics. Most of which will be the same if you want it to feel as real as possible.It’s not about copying GTA or not setting your game clearly apart from it. It’s about looking at how other people have solved the same “issues” and why gamers like it so much (pre crazy town GTA of course).Like it or not GTA is a competitor and I’m pretty sure Rockstar was very relieved as to how Cyberpunk turned out. Especially if you think GTA 6, and that CDPR wants to take Cyberpunk Online at some point.In general there are really old RPGs that did many RPG things better. Some of which isn't even included in this “next gen RPG”.With all that being said, I actually enjoyed playing. I mean I have 100+ hours in it! Right?Well, it’s complicated...I held off doing the main story for the first like 90 hours. Just because I was hoping a lot of those bad mechanics etc. would get patched, improved on etc. so the gameplay would be better. I wanted to save the main story for that. So, I spent my time hunting loot, grinding etc.But then I couldn't hold on to my naïveté any longer so I started doing the story for real (from the first boss).In what felt like a blink of an eye (5-10 hours) I got that prompt; “No going back”…The end to the game. The last mission. I was shocked. All that grinding for nothing. It just ends... It wants you to stop. You have to.Like that moronic CDPR moderator said on Reddit (I believe it was):- “… our games have an ending. They always have. It’s your problem if you don’t like it…”Well, the main story can still end, credits and all, without it ""forcing"" you to stop playing or only being able to go back to before the end.As baffling as the mechanics etc. were at times I genuinely enjoyed playing the game.But in the end that enjoyment was like dragging my bare arse over a course carpet like a dog.It kinda feels good now, but you will feel hollow and regretful later.People should definitely look into it. But maybe hold off for now. They are literally still bugfixing to this day. Stuff like physics, gameplay mechanics etc. will probably not see any action before a good while (if ever).I really hope I can recommend this in future. Also for me."

I love Cyberpunk 2077, but as of writing this review (June 17th, 2021, v.1.22) I cannot recommend it as a whole experience with clear conscience. I will update the review once something changes.UPDATE: There has been a number of patches since I wrote this review, but they did not address the issues I mention.Let's start with the good things. Like I said, I love the game, and I do love it for a lot of things, but the most important one is . The game has potential to be great, one of the greatest games in the genre, but it's not fulfilling it at the moment. For now, I see it as a skeleton of a game that it can be, but the core elements that are there are very strong. These elements are the main story and side storylines, world building and auxiliary storytelling, characters, setting, the aesthetic and visual design, gameplay, music (both in-radio and ambient soundtrack), the list could go on.Now on to the bad things. I'm not going to discuss bugs in this review, sure enough they aren't good, but 1. I believe the game has much bigger problems, and 2. I believe those will get ironed out with time, with each new update.I believe the game's biggest problem is the , and that term encompasses a large area of the game, so I'm going to point some of them out and what I think would be a better alternative.1. Low amount of customization optionsSure enough, the character creator is quite expansive, but customization extends to more things than just V's physical appearance. We are talking guns, cars and bikes, apartments, haircuts and tattoos, cyberware, etc.2. Lifeless (and stupid) NPCsNPCs in Cyberpunk exist only as a filler to the world, they have no purpose, no routines, just occupying screen space. They spawn and despawn as you turn around, turn around and start walking in opposite direction when there's something in their way, react unrealistically to traffic or gunfire. Traffic NPC AI is even worse, they won't go around any obstacle, no matter how slight, sometimes just plain stop in the middle of the road for no reason, swerve around lanes, not react properly to traffic lights, it goes on.There also are no non-story NPCs that you can talk to (not including vendors). I'm not saying every pedestrian needs to have a full dialogue wheel, but there should be people you can talk to that aren't part of a quest in some way.3. Corporate manufacturing and street marketsThe theme of the game is how everything is ran by corporations, and these corporations produce things. Mostly arms. And if you look around the city, you can see they have their branded stores. I think that it would be great for immersion if these stores were functional and stocked with weaponry manufactured by that corporation (for example corp A produces power rifles and body armor, corp B has flamethrowers, light machine guns, and grenade launchers, corp C specializes in blades, has all the katanas, kukris, knives, axes, etc.) and you need to visit a specific manufacturer's store to pick up a specific weapon type. You should be able to customize your gun when purchasing, like changing the skin and getting attachments. And on the counter side of the corpo stores would be street markets where you can buy pre-owned iron, maybe it already has a scope on it, or some paint and stickers. It's probably not as a good as a brand new toy, but at least it's not sold at a 3000% markup.4. Cyberware and body modsThe current system of getting cyberware is very underwhelming. I was very excited for a feature that was teased in the demo before the game came out. That feature was ""humanity cost"" that was associated with getting an implant, alongside the price and street cred requirement. It was implied that different implants have different humanity costs, the greater the modification, the greater the cost (for example, a low-key Kiroshi eyeball implant would have a significantly lower humanity cost than a Maelstrom-like visor replacing half of your face, but would also not offer as much utility). We don't know how having high and low humanity cost would affect the game, but I pictured it to be a nuanced and interesting system.That leads to the next thing about implants, it's that they barely change your appearance. The only mods that change your look are arms and hands mods. We should be given a lot more options of heavy body modifications.There also is the lack of animations, you just open the shopping window, buy the implant and you're good to go. There should be an animation every time you get an implant installed, similar to the first scene at Vik's.When it comes to buying and selling cyberware, the corporate stores don't make that much sense here like they do with the guns. Since ripperdocs are running their independent clinics, they can stock with whatever they want (or whatever they can get). There should be top-of-the-line clinics with best, brand-new implants, and scroungier chop-shops where maybe it's a bit more mix-and-match (like a cyber arm put together from different parts) but it'll get the job done.5. FashionBefore the game dropped, there was a lot of teasing going on. One of the teasers were snaps of Night City fashion and the 4 main dressing styles prevalent in the city, which indicated that your choice of clothes is important in the city of dreams. Meanwhile, clothing selection is pretty limited, and clothes serve simply as armor. I would have much rather have armor stat be boosted only by either wearing actual body armor or by installing implants like subdermal armor and shock absorbers, and have clothing be purely cosmetic.6. Pastimes: clubs, bars, restaurants and food stands, races, fistfights, BDs...Cyberpunk desperately needs pastimes. Only things to do in the game are main quests, side quests, gigs, and hustles. Action 100% of the time. There need to be activities to do in down time. You should be able to go to a bar, grab a seat and have a drink, go to a club and dance the night away, visit a restaurant and have a nice meal at a table or go to food stand to grab a bite on the go. It's the little things that add up to a greater whole. When playing for the first time, I remember reading all the websites on the Net, and being impressed with how complex the city is, and wondering which of the coveted clubs I'll visit first when I get the chance.7. Other immersion odds and endsI believe the choice of life path should be more impactful (other than a few, mostly inconsequential, dialogue options throughout the game), as well as the life path intro part should be longer to really get a feel for what life was like for V before becoming a mercenary (at least a few missions). Also, there should be more gigs with Jackie before we do the Heist, to bond with the character more.I think that any location marked as safehouse should allow you to access stash and sleep (and maybe use a mirror as well).Romances are a little bit shallow, once the thread is over you can barely interact with your S/O, maybe you'll get some texts from them, but that's about it. There should be something more you can do with them after you've done their quests.Exploring doesn't feel rewarding, because it doesn't feel like there's anything to discover - the city is reminiscent of it's citizens, looks good, but is empty on the inside.Random events. Self-explanatory, as of right now, every event in the game world is pre-scripted.I think that about covers it, my review of Cyberpunk 2077. Like I said, I was thinking about it for a while so there's a good chance I'm forgetting something else I wanted to mention.If you're looking to buy the game, I said all I had to say so you can judge for yourself, but if I were you, I'd wait for the first drop of new content before deciding."

But even if we strip away all those technical issues, this game is just plain incomplete.  So many issues plague the gameplay and design in CP2077.  I focused all of my perks on stealth abilities but still found running-and-gunning to be the most effective tactic in nearly every situation.  The knife-throw sounds cool, but actually loses you your knife after a single throw, which totally destroys any point to having such a perk/strategy.  In the end, it makes every battle feel pretty much the same, despite intense attempt to build a character that goes counter to it.Using a perk to auto-scrap junk is nice in that it gets rid of a big chore, but is that what perks should be doing in a game?  Fix the chore itself, instead of making it a reward to not have to do it.  Interestingly, there are paradoxes to getting rid of this tedium, since scrapping certain junk actually removes economic opportunities for the player too (some junk is worth way more than the scrap it creates).There are no minigames.  I remember being excited to hear one of the characters telling me to go to the pachinko casino.  I thought I'd get to play the games.  Nope, they're just pretty environment geometry.  Most of the game is like this, despite such a beautiful city, there really isn't much to do in the city besides travel through it and shoot things.  No sports, no bar games, nothing.  The AI is horrendous.  Committing any crime immediately spawns cops right next to you, which is both unrealistic and cheap.  But even then, on Very Hard, you can easily escape any wanted level by sprinting down the road in a straight line.  The cops can't keep up and they won't put any backup in front of you.  Also, jumping in any body of water will confuse the police enough to lose all levels.  For a game that came out seven years after GTA V and thirteen years after GTA SA, this is comically unacceptable.  I hate when people blame QA for game issues, but the AI honestly makes me wonder if CDPR even tried playing this game naturally, or perhaps if their warnings about the gameplay were ignored altogether.The city is beautiful and definitely feels hand-crafted instead of snapped together with tile sets, but that's about the only compliment I can give this game and it just further exposes the fact that the city is pretty void of things to do.  And when looking at all the tall buildings seemingly connected by a network of high rise tunnels and bridges, it only serves as a tease since the game has no real vertical element.  No flying, no climbing, no parachuting or repelling.    So even if the game suddenly started working properly, it's just not good.  It has a lot of sizzle, but no steak.  I love the setting of this game, and I love The Witcher, and I loved the way this company operated in general.  I had expected this game to revolutionize the open world RPG, but instead we got a mess so bad, I can't even understand how it got released with a straight face (even putting code bugs aside).   It doesn't justify the $60 purchase price for me, and it doesn't hold a candle to many open world games that came out ten to fifteen years ago.  This may not be the worst game in history, but it's easily the most disappointing game I've ever played.  I hope CDPR gets its act together, because this game is not good."

The TL;DR of this review? 8/10 Give it a shot, but walk into this experience not with the intention of making your own specific character and doing a lot of heavy ""custom"" RP (i.e. ""I'm going to make my V be a corpo stooge this run"" won't be possible. V, male/female/neither, is a pre-defined character more in line with Cmdr Shepard in Mass Effect than The Courier in Fallout:NV) instead think of this experience like an open-world FPS campaign with some more significant choices thrown in to influence the outcome and you can customize your character's appearance.Now, I recognize that the CONS section is longer and more involved than the PROS, but quantity does not outweigh quality in my opinion.PROS- The world is *genuinely* immersive in the macroscopic view. Crowds seem to bustle, music fits the setting, traffic jams occur, Night City's appearance and soundscape are genuinely, dare I say it, ""Breathtaking""- The characters, especially 3/4 of the potential love interests are solid characters in their own right and I thoroughly enjoy their stories.- The Main Story, while having it's odd ticking bomb type timeline which will be mentioned later, is honestly pretty solid. You've got basically 3 choices for finales (a fourth hidden one that's exceptionally difficult), the characters are honestly pretty in-depth and believable, the stakes fit the Cyberpunk (as a copywritten universe specifically) vibe, and the ending I feel leaves us with some really awesome potential for a DLC expansion onto the end of the story or a sequel depending on your choices.- For me personally, Keanu's performance, is a highlight. I believe him to be a genuinely solid character, well acted, if occasionally a bit clumsily written (mostly in the dialogues between him and V, their dynamic can feel a little confusing like seeing their relationship evolve but out of order or something at times). I recognize some apparently find his performance sub-par, but I disagree and frankly I don't think I as an actor (granted, mostly stage musicals) would have made any different character choices if I had his role. I believe it to be well-executed on that front.- The straight male, gay female, and straight female romances are genuinely, I think, extremely well written with the gay female romance being honest to goodness one of the best love stories I've played through. Hell, even in my first run as a male who can't romance her, I genuinely enjoyed her story and the friendship presented. On par, IMO with the Tali-Shepard romance or the Garrus bro-mance in Mass Effect.- When appropriately leveled or slightly overleveled, the gunplay feels genuinely pretty nice IMO. There are definitely better games, but for a studio's first outing on FPS, this is a serious win.- The aesthetic of the outfits are genuinely fantastic to me. Personally, I ignore the core stats until it's clear a clothing item of a given style is just plainly under-leveled, but usually you'll find a suitable replacement with better stats well before the stats become a problem. I think to have a better time, just look as fresh as you want, unless you're playing on the highest difficulties, I frankly don't see much benefit to optimizing your armor. Treat it like armor in Dark Souls, it's basically aestheticCONS- THE TIMELINE PRESENTED IN THE MAIN PLOT IS TOO SHORT TO REALISTICALLY RP YOURSELF INTO PLAYING THE SIDE QUESTS. Without going into spoilers, the main story pretty quickly after the tutorial/prologue gives you a nebulous timeline of, ""a couple weeks"" with some heavy stakes attached which frankly is not enough time to *really* do anything else believably. But a lot of the best material is in the side-quests. So I honestly just kinda handwave and imagine that for most of my run, I'm still playing V's backstory pre-inciting incident until I hit the last couple missions where the main-plot becomes relevant again. This one there's no fixing unless they rerecord some lines or something and as a heavy RP-focused player who loves exploring worlds, this is my biggest individual gripe.- Still a wee bit buggy/unoptimized. I play with a fairly up-to-date middle upper range PC with a 2070 Super and there are times where the frame rate will drop to ~50 from the 90+ on 1080p and ultra settings. It's far better than it used to be, I'd even go so far as to say it's less buggy than most games on release nowadays, but if you've got a low tolerance, stay away. - Melee combat feels wonky af and enemies can be bullet spongey, though these have both improved. Melee combat might not be fixable or at least not easily, the bullet spongey thing though can still be improved a bit.- Driving feels weird at times (honestly, if you play a nomad, will quickly have *the* best vehicle in terms of speed, acceleration, and handling in my opinion and it's basically free). Vehicles are ""floaty"", deceleration seems almost logarithmic than linear on keyboard and mouse, Minimap is still a bit too small. This is all fixable.- The Straight Male romaceable character, if you are RPing either a purely lesbian female character or even a bi female character who's loyal to their girlfriend, doesn't seem to take polite hints of lack of interest to back off. He's otherwise a really sweet and genuinely good guy, but it sucks to the point that I, when playing a female character already in a relationship with someone else or otherwise uninterested, will avoid the last mission with this guy. Not likely if ever to be fixed.- The City's immersion falls short upon scrutiny at the micro level. NPCs seem to go nowhere and panic for almost no reason, there are no other motorcycles on the roads (plenty parked, none driving), and there are no roaming cops/gang patrols which kinda hurts too. These are all fixable.- The fact that clothes/weapons can be the exact same kind, but have drastically different stats kinda bugs me. I wish they'd just have like 3-5 tiers of any one weapon/clothing item which indicates overall effectiveness/damage rating/quality and maybe even make the items of a given tier have a different appearance determined by it (i.e. tier 1 handgun of this model has visible rust/pitting/dings/nicks, vs tier 4 looking fresh off the table of a custom gunsmith). In the end though, this is an extremely minor gripe and not likely to be fixed.- You can't just transmog your outfit overtop whatever you have currently equipped to make the optimizers who want to RP happy. At least to my knowledge, this hasn't been addressed outside of mods but really shouldn't be *that* difficult to implement.- Still no haircuts or customizable tattoos or even more overtly visible body mods either in general or just after character creation. I feel these are still pretty core to the Cyberpunk experience as an aesthetic and idea, yet do not exist yet outside of mods to my knowledge. This is a super easy fix and I hope they include it in the big update they're planning to drop soon that I've heard rumors about."

The Cyberpunk world is beautiful. The Prologue of the game shows you a living, corpo infested city that is alive with things to do. The montage of you and Jackie plays out in hot spots around Night City, dancing, drinking, having a sick time. You fly in an AV, you take on the biggest Corporation in night city with the hopes of becoming legends. Then the real game starts and you realise Night City is nothing but a back drop for you to do missions in. You can't actually do anything. You can't sit and eat, get drunk and stumble around, ♥♥♥♥ around with the 'Privatised, corrupt NCPD' (more on that later), watch brain dances, go to clubs and dance, it's just a map that exists for you to drive through. The City's NPCs are garbage, they don't respond to anything (Patch 1.22-1.23). The traffic is still useless and have no mind of their own. I parked my car on the road and it just caused a massive line up of cars just sitting there waiting.Driving sucks and unless you REALLY want a nice car there is absolutely NO reason to purchase any of the vehicles that are available to you because the driving mechanics don't justify spending that kind of money. Why would I spent $100k on a car that's gonna slide around like it's on an ice rink, when I can just steal a car to do that for me? Or just fast travel?So many massive buildings that you just can't go inside. So many restaurants and street vendors that only exist to fill space. The Police in this game, advertised as corrupt, nasty power abusing thugs do NOTHING. And if you do run into them, they will spawn IN FRONT OF YOU and blast you to pieces. There's no bribing, no arrests, no dirty cops asking you to do jobs for them. They don't even drive around. It's a SERIOUSLY missed opportunity considering the amount of NPCD side gigs you can do. Why couldn't have these been used as side missions from cops trying to blackmail you? You commit a crime, get a warrant, a cop tries to arrest you. You could either pay your way out or do a job for him. This could be linked to any of the NPCD gigs in the city. But they're not. The cops do not play a massive part in the world and it's seriously best if you ignore them completely. Because they always ignore you. When they don't ignore you, it's a broken mess that is pointless and adds nothing to the gameplay.You might think all of this sounds like nit picking, and you're right. But this game sets the expectation that Night City is your playground, and it's a city that is alive and can be lived in. It's not. It's just a map to do ♥♥♥♥ in. This for me broke my immersion, but for others the beauty of the cyberpunk city may be enough to keep them interested. However, I really doubt it.The combat is fun. You can specialise in blades or blunt weapons, firearms, hacking, and stealth. I found myself using stealth and quick hacks a lot, and relying heavily of Tech weapons to do serious damage to people.Stealthing around, breaking people's necks, dumping the bodies, hacking security cameras and turrets to work in your favour were some of the best times in combat.Once gunfights started, the AI were either super smart or super dumb dumb, and once I found a Power Rifle all encounters were so damn easy it was a cakewalk from then on out. I played on the 'hard' difficulty for reference.BUT this wasn't a problem for me. I don't think the weapons are supposed to balanced. I think it the point of the weapons and crafting and modifications is to become a seriously violent and dangerous cyberpunk beast and you can absolutely achieve that. How you wish to do that is up to you, and the combat for me was overall acceptable.Character customisation is fine, but you don't see your character enough anyway so don't worry too much about it.The loot, namely the clothing, all look ♥♥♥♥♥♥ absurd. By the end of the game you will be wearing so much mismatched nonsense for the sake of armour and clothing mods. There's no transmog either so be prepared for your character to look really, REALLY stupid.Now we move onto the Characters and Story. SPOILERSYou want to be a legend in night city? Want to climb to the ranks and be a top dog in the Mercenary World?I never felt this to be the case. The main story revolves around you trying to save your own life and get Johnny Silverhand out of your head. You'll do missions for some big corpo players and also some prominent gangs in Night City. But none of it is for glory, all of it is for saving your life. No one wants to help you unless you can do something for them. Kill some other gang member, steal some ♥♥♥♥, kill some other dude. Find out that the person you did all this for can't help you, or they just die anyway. Your character becomes desperate and by the end of the main story you're either making a deal with a corpo devil, or going out in a blaze of glory. THE SIDE MISSIONS however are where the meat of this game is and you should spend all of your time doing these. That doesn't mean these are perfect, and I'll explain below.You will meet people who will play a big role in your character development and main story through completing side missions. Some side missions are also just cool insights into the cyberpunk world that REALLY needed to be fleshed out.Here's my example.You will do a mission for a Jefferson and Elizabeth Peralez. Jefferson is a candidate for Mayor of Night City. He has goals, he seems pretty reasonable, and you go to investigate a break in of their home.You find some things that don't add up. A secret room in their house, antennas and cables leading to the roof, and then you spot a van outside the building.After chasing the van, you end up a huge firefight. Once you waste them, you hack the van and find out that these group of hackers are literally changing Peralezs' mind.They are altering his memories, his personality, they are changing him completely so when he gets elected mayor his decisions will favour these hacker's intentions. A crazy, dystopian nightmare of mind altering control. And this whole time, Elizabeth was aware of it. She had no choice but to go on with it, to not tell him what was going on.You go to meet up with Jefferson, to either explain to him to situation or give him no clues. Before you do however, you are contacted by the hackers. They blacken your vision, and warn you to stay out of it.This ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me up. And even Johnny, the rebellious anti corpo blaze of glory bad ass warns you to stay out of this one. It's too risky. I wanted to find these guys. These hackers who are controlling a politicians brain, some crazy cyberpunk ♥♥♥♥ that made my skin crawl.But after you tell him, you receive a few text messages, and that's it. Mission over. You never hear from them again.This was my general view of the side missions of CP2077. So damn good, so damn close to being a fantastic mission, but they all just scrape the surface of something with the potential to be MUCH bigger. THESE missions made me feel like becoming a legend of Night City. Taking down people like this. Making a name for myself, but it never happens.After 75 Hours of game time I can say that I enjoyed what Cyberpunk 2077 had to offer.But at the same time, I'm disappointed that this was ALL it had to offer. No DLC can fix the broken world, the lack of world development, The main missions that end SUPER quickly, or the side missions that burn out right before they get really good. I recommend this game if cyberpunk is something you're interested in. But be prepared for a basic RPG game, glittered in a cyberpunk aesthetic."

The main quest gave me the point of no return pretty quickly, so I avoided that and completed just about everything else on offer first, aside from boxing, collectables, out of the way gigs, and police shootouts, which felt like filler. Most of the main content is very well done and found only a few instances of medium-strength bugs that lessened the experience. Some of it is nearly brilliant.I don't pay much attention to marketing, so I can't tell if some of the anger over this game came from broken promises, but this is exactly the game I hoped it would be and it exceeded my expectations. Played on a modest system at lower settings to keep a decent framerate and the graphics are incredible, world is amazing, city is layered and complex, and detail shows in every dark corner. It doesn't have the interactivity of a GTA title; you can't take your fake girlfriend bowling or get a haircut, but I never cared for that stuff anyway. The mission design, setting, and writing matter to me, and Cyberpunk delivers through nearly the whole running time.I could easily play another 60 hours of new main/side missions. Hopefully the messy launch doesn't prevent expansion packs or a sequel, and that it gets fixed up quickly for anyone unable to give this a try. I can easily see that the game isn't for everyone but you if you ever liked a Deus Ex then give this a shot.ORIGINAL:Playing on a Ryzen 3600 and 1070ti. In terms of performance I have most graphics settings on low aside from volumetic fog and near shadows, which are medium. Even with these low settings the graphic quality is really good and keeps framerate ranges in 50-60, with a few drops in some outdoors sections. This is very playable. No crashes or game-breaking glitches for me so far, though there have been oddities that required a game restart.I'd say the gameplay falls more into an immersive sim in the style of Deus Ex than anything else, and hits exactly what I was hoping for. The shooting is well above average, car handling not so good (hopefully these get some changes), RPG systems seem plenty deep enough, and the conversation tree's are mostly great. Don't feel like I'm far enough in yet to judge the story but it starts out slow and awkward but has picked up and is pretty cool.There are many frustrating bits, like having to manually alter config files to rebind some keys that the in-game menu can't, and to turn off double tap to dodge (which really messed with me). The stealth systems are too rough to be reliable but are almost there. Some visual oddities pop up on occasion and the simulated citizens do some wonky things. In comparison to many other complex open-world games on launch I'd call this launch way above average, but it could definitely use some more work.Very happy with the game and looking forward to exploring a lot more of it. Someday I will do a replay with a much beefier system and see all those fancy graphics I'm missing out on, but in the meantime the low settings still look great and the game is excellent."

It's a shame that it's clear the developers wanted to add way more to its gameplay and story but didn't have the time. Wish they delayed the game for 2-3 years to avoid crunch and to get a full version of what the creators envisioned, but what we ended up with is still great. I would recommend you wait a few months before buying so they sort out some of the bugs as they often take you out of immersion."

(If you haven't bought it yet, wait till Feb or March for the main patches)EDIT: I get a lot pf people are quite ""passionate"" about this game. Reading the comments with my friends has become a great pastime. Here is my take. Yes it might not have met ALL your expectations, but this game ain't bad by any means. Hell it did not murder your family, or commit war-crimes in the middle-east. In all seriousness, my dad always used to say, that the Biggest Room in the world is the room for Improvement. Give it a chance. Maybe not now. Maybe someday. But do give the devs and the community a chance. Keep it civil folks. BACK TO MY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ REVIEW (why is it one of the top ones? It ain't helpful by any means -_- ) :117 hrs in, finally got through the main story and everything around. (Street Kid, Male V. Ended at Lvl 42 SC 50). Going to be honest, is the game buggy? YES. Is the AI absolutely whack? Yes Again. Performance? As of v1.05, quite improved but driving fast around the city, especially around your home can give a performance hit.  But the story? It is worth every penny. It is worth experiencing. Keanu's performance isn't top-notch but it is enough to get you engrossed, keep you in. Plus, well its Keanu. Whoever did V has done a stellar job. The side characters, and their quests are a delight. Gunplay is a hit or miss. Enemies feel a tad spongy at the start to AR's while Handcannons and their tree is overpowered. And with the right mods, a single Overture or Crash shot going up 80K in a single HS crit damage. By the end, with legendaries, Enemies, bosses become a joke on hard. The netrunning and berserk are quite fun, and give stealth or an all out approach a variety of possibilities. Mantis Blades are a must and combined with double jump, are quite fun. Meanwhile Gorilla arms have their use only in fistfight brawls. Projectiles and Monowire are good, but Mantis Blades are just that good. Pretty sure you look like a cyberpsycho gone rogue, but hey, it is fun.And Night City. What can you say about it, that hasn't been said. What a creation. The world design, from the badlands to heywood, it is gorgeous. You will absolutely love it. The Soundtrack is just perfect, whether you are driving with Royal Blue, Vexelstorm on the radio. Overall, this an extraordinarily beautiful mess. AI and the NPC interaction leave a lot to be desired, but the foundational NC is exceptional. The main story is amazing and side quests are top-notch. Recommended for the story. 8/10 with the hope that mods and patches bring Night City and the Story the credit they belong. Buy it around Feb or March when the major patches are out."

The game isn't majorly groundbreaking. However this game has a beautiful open world with a ton of fun stuff to do. Most of the characters are compelling and I instantly connected with many of them. The map at the start was overwhelming with new activities to complete and I gained a ton of satisfaction slowly chipping them off of my map. There are a handful of annoyances. These include graphical glitches, missing QoL features, clipping issues, loot stuck in the ground, some NPC's have canned dialog that repeats over and over again. These issues are not prevalent all the time. Many of the negative reviews are upset that the game has bugs or that it is not perfectly optimized for their system. Others are upset because they thought that the game would break the mold. Whenever you have a huge release like this, people rate the game as a Zero with no context. This game is a solid 8 in it's current state. Once the bugs are worked out and some QoL features are added, it will be a solid 9. Don't listen to the trolls. Get the game"

I've installed some mods this past week and they really do improve the game to the point to where I'd say it's worth a buy, even at full price. I've got about 15 installed right now, and they all work great so far. The awesome part is they are simply small config type files that are only KBs in size. I think the largest mod I installed so far was 2MB. All you do is download and then extract the contents into the root installation folder....quickest mods I've ever done. I'm probably going to make a guide that'll include installation instructions as well as a one file package that includes all the best mods.There are sooo many mods out there, and some are highly configurable, rivaling the best popular mod-able games. These mods fix bugs, game-play balancing, broken perks, life-path bonuses, gang traits, UI improvements, vehicle handling, better NPCs and crowds, traffic, better melee etc. They also can add cut content like street vendor trading and even wall climbing. You can even unlock the ability to romance characters you'd otherwise not be able to (I'm going to bone Judy Alvarez as a male V, haha).If you have the cash and are even interested in the game I think you should take the plunge. $30 is a steal for what it can become with just a couple minutes of post installation tweaking.P.S. - the official patch 1.5 is going to drop in a few months when they release the next gen console version of the game. It's supposed to be a huge update with lots of fixes and perhaps even restored content. That patch (and future patches) will most likely (hopefully) negate the need for mods. I know now it's definitely possible to fix this game and make it what we all expected it to be...the question is will it be done officially or by the modding community (so far the modding community has a massive head start).P.S.S. - My opinion of the publisher has not changed....f*ck 'em. The devs are not to blame, but the suits are. The launch was an abomination, something I'll never forget. I'll never again buy a game at launch from CDPR. Yes, I'm recommending it now, but only thanks to the modders. Buy as cheap as you absolutely can.EDIT: These are the mods I have installed and working as of 12/29/21.

I am aware that the launch was sketchy and the game was packed full of bugs / glitches. As of patch 1.31 CyberPunk was a worth while game purchase for me. I did enjoy the almost 180 hours of playtime I put in. However driving in this game stinks bad, car handling physics felt very arcade like and also felt like I was always driving on wet slick surfaces. I can't remember how many times I've lost control of my vehicles flying off the side of a bridge or overpass and take my car swimming with me - Laughable... Racing missions, ugh... what a disgrace to racing games. One other thing, the faster you drive, the most deserted and desolate the city becomes. Driving fast turns the city of Night City into a ghost town. The game engine can't keep up with the asset loading buffer, so in an attempt to keep the bare bones city going, all npc cars and people disappear. I recommend not driving at all in CyberPunk, walk, run, hop skip run walk... whatever... or ride shotgun as a passenger in a vehicle! If you have no choice but to drive, do it slowly... feather the throttle and keep it in the granny lane at all times. Far better immersive gaming experience in what was supposed to be Witcher 4 in a modern city. At this point, I'd be a happy CyberPunk gamer if CD Project Red gave me Roach to ride in Night City. Slow and steady wins the race here,Played through twice, playing every single side quest. Still can't figure how to make enough legit money to purchase all the cars. Perhaps on my third play through I'll avoid becoming a crafting genius and learn to kill with knives only. Sell every gun I find, argh... there just so much to do and new builds to try out. Different skills and cybernetic enhancements combinations to try out. For a half baked broken game, it sure has been a lot of fun and I can't wait to see what else gets patched and added. Definitely picking up any DLC packs that CD Project Red releases. This game is staying in my favourites."

I’ve completed every mission in the game, from secondary missions to open world Ubisoft level missions. I also got every achievement in the game. And here’s what I think.#Night City:The world of Cyberbug is completely gorgeous, beautiful or would I say breathtaking?The world feels real, every inch of the city is rich in details. From walking through the slums in Kabuki or driving through Japantown you can feel how Night City is rich in details and everywhere you go is unique.#Characters:The characters that you see on main and secondary missions are one of the things I can't complain about. They feel real, they have motivations and plans.#Missions:The game focuses on what instead of why. You don't know why Johnny hates Arasaka or other corporations so much, he just hates and you gotta deal with it. Gigs at a point of the game become boring as duck, “go there and kill a guy, steal something, sabotage something, plant a bug in a computer”, at some point you ask yourself if those missions were made by Ubisoft. The Beat on the Brat missions are literally stupid, 4 hits of those dudes and you are dead, and if you are playing as Netrunner or something like that and don’t focus on body level, one hit is enough.#AI:Npcs from games from 2004 are far better than Cyberbug’s npcs. Their reaction to anything is stupid, their only propouse is walk 10 meters back and forward in the streets. You can punch a guy in a wheelchair and he will be walking like nothing happened. If you park a car in the middle of the street, the other cars will simply stay there forever. I feel like they had a monkey in the dev room coding the police AI. The police spawning behind you and oneshot you is a completely normal phenomenon.#Gameplay:Cyberbug lets you play many ways, from a skilled Netrunner to a Street Samurai. But its still boring, almost all perks are PASSIVE. They don't change a duck about your gameplay. Most of the perks are cooldown reduction, increased damage, more move speed, reload speed etc etc. The game keeps telling every minute about cyberpsychosis and how dangerous it’s but you can still use cyberware in every place of your body and literally nothing bad will happen to you. Cyberware is mostly passive too. Only arms and legs cyberwares are not passive.#Life Paths:I played the 3 paths and it doesn't matter which path you choose, nothing will change in your gameplay. The only thing that changes is some dialogues and that’s it.#Customizations :None, nada, rien, nessuna, keiner. You start the game and you make your character and that’s it. You can’t change your hair cut, tattoos, nothing. You can’t customize vehicles. You can't customize a thing in the game. Games like GTA San Andreas and Saints Row 3 could do all of this, but Cyberbug, “the game of the decade”, can't.There were too many promises about this game, and they could barely keep half of the promises. I loved CDPR for their work in The Witcher trilogy, they builded their respect for a decade, only to duck it up like this, and for what? Money, greed. They released the game at the end of the year so they could get as much money as possible on Christmas sales. And guess what? It ducking worked! They tricked everyone and sold an unfinished game that YES could be the game of the decade. The devs believed the game would be merely done by 2022 and I really feel bad about them. Cyberpunk, a gigantic overpromise."

The world, the map, the characters (at least some of them), the music, it all clicks because this is the content that was initially designed before CDPR decided to rewrite everything from scratch, half-assing everything from now on. Unfortunately, this is FAR too little to consider CP2077 a good game.The negatives however are everywhere. The gameplay is horribly repeatable, you can feel the content filler with every single step you take, going through uninteresting and outright boring ""gigs"" and ""NCPD activities"" that all play the same. Everything that was showed in the trailers and demos was fabricated, the world is empty, the content was cut horribly to the point that the game looks like it required another 2 or 3 years in development just to fill all those holes, let alone fix the bugs. The main story started with a bang, I noticed the amount of polish and effort that was put into the beginning of the game, which is on-par with the main quests of Witcher 3. However, the moment we start the whole biochip journey, everything looks like half-assed attempt to meet the deadlines and not bother about user experience. It's clear as day that this is where the real content made by ex-W3 devs ended, and the new vision of the project begun, the one which forced Keanu Reeves into the picture because of marketing deal, and not because he actually fitted for any role in what was originally planned. It felt exactly the same like beginning of Mafia 3, which also started with a bang, leaving a smell of ♥♥♥♥ for the remaining part of the game. If you ask me, I have no clue why CP2077 has better rates than Mafia 3 had, it has exactly the same problems, exactly the same empty world and exactly the same boredom.I've finished the whole game and explored everything that game had to offer in order to review the whole product. No patch will fix severe lack of content caused by extreme cuts and half-assed execution of remaining part. You have only one attempt to make good first impression, and the impression of Cyberpunk looks like a game focused on meeting studio management expectations, tight deadlines and forced marketing, rather than offering quality product for your own enjoyment. It's definitely not the worst game I've ever played, but it dropped far below my expectations, which were already non-existent, as I knew that the game won't be anywhere close to Witcher 3 quality, yet even with that approach I didn't expect a game to turn out this bad. Considering the size of the studio and how many people were actually involved into whole this mess, I won't be as forgiving as I was e.g. with Mafia 3, as I really believe that CP2077 isn't a good game in terms of the content and gameplay, and the price tag doesn't reflect the quality of the product.---If you liked my review, you can find more of them on  and on my ."

The big one. The game to top all games. It had the marketing. It had the hype. It had the big celeb  cameo. But it was not meant to be. The best way to describe this game is ""The width of the ocean, but the depth of a puddle"". I did enjoy some parts, but overall once the shine had worn off, this game is incredibly mediocre. To be honest, I had more fun with the Deus Ex series than I did with this. But lets get into the pro's and con's of the game:Positives: + The general aesthetic is amazing, nothing comes close.+ The sound track is awesome.+ Robot limbs.+ Weapon design.+ Amount of missions, both main and side (note ""amount"", not quality)+ First few missions are great.+ Interesting characters.+ Size of the map.Negatives:- Bugs. Oh so many bugs.- AI is garbage, especially civilians. - Story starts well, but quickly becomes MEH.- Police spawn out of nowhere.- Crafting is no fun.- Driving feels like you're always on ice.- ""Lifepath"" is a 10-minute Go Here And Do X before all 3 become the same path, with some slight dialogue changes.- Big, boring empty parts of the map.- Johnny Silverhand is your buddy one minute, and then an a**hole the next like the previous convo never even happened.- End game choices feel underwhelming.- Main bad guy seems intimidating and scary the 1 or 2 times you see him throughout. In the finale, he's weak and boring.- Combat doesn't get challenging once you have a sniper that can see and fire through walls.- Skill tree is okay, but not fantastic.- Clothes stats cannot be carried over to pieces you like the look of. Your character looks like a douche for best stats.- No haircuts.- S*x Workers (Dolls) were supposed to be everywhere. There is 2, maybe 3 throughout.- About 75% of what was promised in promo and trailers is absent in the game.As you can see, the negatives outweigh the positives. Yes, some of the negatives are nitpicky, but these are basic things that should have been in the game from day 1. The game is overall fun for a while, but I cannot recommend it. Maybe when all the fixes, DLCs and everything is out in a few years time I might go back to it. Otherwise, my hard drive space is better used on other titles.Most importantly - STOP PRE-ORDERING GAMES. Only when you stop this, will Devs start putting more effort into releasing a completed product. If you put your money in their hands before they put the product in yours, they have no accountability."

I tried everything from being a sneaky, pacifist hacker, katana-bearing demon ninja and an all out Rambo. Landing headshots with an assault rifle is just as satisfying as making some poor scrub team kill with his own grenade, as is melee “slicin n dicin”. That being said, hacking does seem a little slower than combat and eventually, the melee style gets a little old. There were times that I just lost patience towards the end of the game and went in guns blazing, even on stealth missions. Unless you enjoy solving puzzles, hacking quickly becomes a chore as it is unintuitive and boring.The difficulty modes are a bit out of whack. I played the game in the hardest difficulty  mode – it was a bit tough in the beginning, but got much easier towards the end. The AI in this game is absolutely brain dead and needs a lot of rework. I could snipe enemies from a distance and they’d barely move. It seems as if they have a certain radius that will not leave. The police AI is hot garbage – they appear out of nowhere and apparently, they have no budget for cars.Speaking of cars, driving in the game is an absolute chore. The cars are too “floaty” and the mini-map is way too zoomed in. I ended up sticking to the motorcycles, which were bearable. Also, are you telling me that there are no self-driving cars in 2077?Crafting is pretty bland, sadly. Disassemble components, craft, upgrade, rinse, repeat. Even the perks for crafting aren’t anything great. Inventory management is an annoyance and could use a lot of TLC.This is where the game really shines. The main quest as well as the side quests are a blast and supported by solid story lines. With the exception of one NPC storyline, I really got into their stories. The theme of the quests have a nice variety to them - some were about forgiveness and redemption, others about moral choices and the media, etc. – but nearly all of them were memorable. Most of the side quests had fun twists including a guest appearance from a well known Portal 2 voice. There’s a quest in which you aren’t told of the final outcome, but if you listen to the news broadcasts, you figure out what happens in the end. The dialogues are some of the best written in my experience. There’s raw emotion mixed in with rationale and the writers did a great job in giving the player enough response options. The humor in many of the NPC dialogues had me chuckling out loud, which is rare for a game these days. I’d really recommend that one complete NPC story lines without getting distracted by other quests. It really lends to the true experience and is way more satisfying than doing it piece meal.The romance options are good, but not great. A lot depends on your gender AND your voice, so choose wisely. Suffice to say, there’s someone out there for you but it may not be who you want. Also, please keep in mind that “Angel is male and Skye is female” or you’ll end going “oh no no no no no” as I did.There are 5 possible endings including one REALLY “bad” ending (which I doubt anyone will go through). Some of the ending choices are a different because of your choices / questlines. I love the concept of multiple endings, so this was an absolute win in my book.A major flaw is some of the epilogue and it’s hard to discuss without spoiling it. There are parts in a couple of the endings that makes little sense because those events either did not happen or don’t make sense. This may not be a critical factor to some people, however to me, the epilogue is very important as it brings closure to a story. I played the game on a 3090 and WOW – the graphics are just mind blowing! With ray tracing and DLSS, I found myself just wandering around in awe. Areas like Kabuki are incredible to behold. Keep in mind that the graphics will spank your GPU, but it’s so worth it! I used some of the presets as recommended by Digital Foundry and Gamers Nexus and then optimized them for my rig. I was able to get a steady 60 fps after a bit of tinkering.No review of this game would be complete without discussing some of the many bugs. Other than graphical bugs like T-posing (which are annoying), there are some game breaking bugs. Some NPCs won’t open a door that’s required for progression, while others won’t clear a checkpoint because you chose an alternative route. These bugs are incredibly annoying. I saved frequently so that I wouldn’t have to restart a mission from scratch. This game could’ve used a LOT more QA. There are bugs that break immersion, which may be forgiven sometimes – but game breaking bugs are unforgivable in a AAA RPG.After finishing the game, I looked up the features and promises that the game was supposed to have. It would’ve been awesome to have those and I can’t help but feel that the game has so much wasted potential in it. It could’ve become a true game changer (pun intended) like Half Life had it lived up to its original vision. Gang allegiances, cyberware-customization, choices that REALLY impacted the game, etc. would’ve elevated this game to a legendary status. The game world, while gorgeous, doesn’t have the NPC “richness” in which one may see NPCs observe a particular routine or react like events around them (other than cower in fear). Cyberpunk is definitely one of the best games that I’ve played this year. I’m not sure that I’d call it a true RPG, but perhaps a RPG-lite. It has solid, gratifying and varied storylines with a long list of memorable characters and “big moments”. The main story and most of the side quests are very well written and resonate with the player. The characters from the game will stick in my mind for a long time. It definitely has serious flaws, which can’t be brushed aside. However, are these flaws serious enough for one to NOT play it right now? In my opinion, no – you can play it right now and get your moneys’ worth without any regrets."

I was really impressed by the design of the levels and how they enable you to choose different approaches (violent, sneaky, hacking, etc.); for instance, in one side mission, you have to take out a target and if your tech ability is high enough, you can enter the neighbouring building and snipe your target from a balcony without even entering enemy territory.

I am playing the game for the first time and went through ca. 2/5ths / 20 hours of the games' side content again after the patch was released (I found out you can save a main story character when I looked into a 100% guide before the point of no return, yeeaah...), so you can trust me when I say that the difference in graphics and gameplay is substancial.On top of that I didn't encounter most of the bugs from version 1.31 in 1.5 and the graphics are now on the level of the 9th console generation.The only thing that the patch couldn't fix is what Cyberpunk 2077 is in its core, a (in my opinion) artistically, technically and gameplaywise very impressive, but storywise very underwhelming and at best mediocre game that cant live up to the success of The Witcher 3, a game that was the result of over 10 years of learning from failures and constant refinement of the formula by CD Projekt (everyone who played the Witcher 1 will know what I am talking about). Cyberpunk doesn't have that advantage, it is the first entry in a new franchise, in a setting that the developers had little to no experience with, plus they had to cope with a mountain of expectations and pressure. The game was hyped to death by people and the publisher didn't do itself a favor with their bold statements about the work of other publishers (EA) and misleading marketing material. But the game itself has still potential and a solid foundation on which can be built upon.Briefly, if you played with the thought to get the game but were deterred by the bad initial player reception, and set your expectations more on a Witcher 2 rather than a Witcher 3 level, now is probably the the best time to give it a shot."

The graphics are generally breathtaking (definitely comparable to the red gummy bears!).  Night City is a sight to behold. Especially the raytraced lighting really shines with all the neon lights everywhere, giving the city a realistic eyegasmic look. The illusion of a breathing, living world falls apart though, if you look too closely. The “inhabitants” of Night City feel like bland robots, walking from A to B no matter what, with no brain. The spawn system randomizes the look certain body parts and then spawns these creatures into the world. Sadly, this system does not check if it spawns an NPC-instance more than once in the same area. Occasionally, the same pink-haired meatbags spawn in hordes in a radius of 25 meters... A quote of  describes that phenomenon really well: .There are some interesting, big buildings, that you would love to explore from the inside, but in nearly all cases you will be greeted with the typical “X – Closed”- UI hint, when you walk towards any door. The Main Story is awesome and is the reason that made me keep playing Cyberpunk until the end. Some characters are just hilariously bad and bland (-> “Adam Smasher”) and some parts of the main storyline were obviously cut out, especially in the first Act of the game (-> Jacky). The main aspects, regarding the impact of technical modification of the human body in the near future, the resulting consequences and the question of what it means to be “alive” and “human” are well handled. First, I did not care about Johnny at all, and thought he was quite annoying shouting his “Anti Corpo”-propaganda into the ears of my V every five minutes. However, progressing through the story more and more, he grew on me. Keanu Reeves was a worthy investment.Some of the side quests also tell unique and interesting stories that add value to the overall experience and tone of the game. Depending on which quests you did and partially, which decisions you made, there are a few different endings, that range from “okay” to “Damn, that was actually quite nice”. Like most Open World games nowadays, Cyberpunk also falls into the category of games, that attempt to artificially blow-up the playtime by adding meaningless, repetitive “content” to the game. The so called “gigs” and “NCPD”-hustles are sprinkled over the map, like too much salt on fries. These activities always follow the same few patterns: “Kill all people and collect a Gucci back, that is laying around there” and “Go into that building, free that guy… oh and by the way, that closed door, never mind it! There is an open window if you look 90 degrees to your left or right”. This type of content adds nothing to the experience of the game and feels like those weird liquorice bats added to the gummy bear boxes (for people who like those ones:  …You kind of do not want to have them, but you bought them with the whole package.The gunplay feels generally solid, there is a lot of variety of ranged weaponry. The Stealth gameplay also works quite well, with its quick-hack mechanics and can be fun at times. The melee combat on the other hand feels bland to jokingly bad and consists of the same two to three, clunky animations chained together repeatedly. The dismemberment looks quite satisfying though!The skill tree consists mostly of entries that provide passive stat-manipulations with no real impact on gameplay. To be honest that part of the game could have been cut out completely and I wouldn’t have noticed it at all! The Cybernetics are fun to use and change the way to play the game. There is a lot of variety offered and trying out new combinations and modifications is adding a lot to the gameplay experience! Especially the “bullet-time-like”-feature and the arm projectile launcher are a joy!Audio-wise this game is a mixed bag and suffers from several issues. Sometimes music or ambient sounds randomly disappear abruptly or are missing their fade out-effects. Certain audio-effects are often playing at a way too high or low volume depending on the distance of the player. Those issues are occurring way too often, sadly. The bugs and issues regarding the mixing and spatial audio were the ones, that broke the immersion for me the most in this game. The soundtrack enhances the atmosphere and fits the game perfectly! There are some so called “bangers” in there, as the eloquent kids of the modern world would say! A few more combat tracks would have been nice. The same few action tracks repeat a bit too often for my taste. But in general, great music and the sound effects are also good, just the mixing is totally messed up.Besides the annoying aforementioned audio issues, there are a handful of other bugs, regarding the pathfinding of the AI and some animation issues that can break immersion. Those can be quite funny at the same time though. Each player will experience a different number of bugs, maybe some are even lucky and do not encounter ones at all, I encountered many. Besides some T-Posing while driving a car, NPCs walking in the air or godlike, flying traffic lights, that could be mostly ignored, there are also some bugs that negatively impacted the experience. An Issue, where UI elements did not turn on/off after entering/leaving a vehicle occurred way more often than I would have liked. At one point a dialogue/interaction option that already got triggered, stayed in the dialogue-options and could be triggered again, teleporting me to a position where I have been a few moments ago and blocking the progression of the quest. Most of these issues could be resolved by loading a recent checkpoint, but those bugs negatively impacted the fun I had with the game. All the bugs are a testament of a game, that needed way time in the oven. More than one additional year for sure."

Optimization was ungodly levels of bad. Glitches...you probably already know. Playing it today? I can run the game on max settings at 60 fps with a 1660ti, and the worst glitch I ran into was an annoying ""You Are Doing Something Illegal"" popup that didn't go away. I fixed it by promptly shooting the next civilian that pissed me off, ironically enough.Story is good, characters are even better, especially Silverhand. Wish there was more development for our MC than ""Keanu Reeves is in my head"", but the random encounters with sidequest characters and Johnny's condescending comments throughout make up for that. Graphically mindblowing. Unbelievable work by CDPR. Best graphics I've ever seen in a game to date. All there is to say.Combat is...not what I hoped for all the time. I expected a lot more cybernetics and cool abilities than simply enhancing your ability to peek out from cover and shoot like a TPS. I would strongly suggest building either hacking or an extremely aggressive build to mix things up. I played a shotgun/tech run, and had an absolute blast. Stealth is actually fantastic, too, which I wasn't expecting.Is it finally the game CDPR advertised? No. Far from it. What they advertised would have taken another 5-10 years in development. I really wish it could've worked out that way, but they had a deadline to meet. Tragic, really, because they clearly put a lot of effort and love into this game. HOWEVER, I can safely say that it's definitely worth the full sixty dollar price tag. It absolutely feels like an AAA game now, and is far better than the vast majority of single player games I've played. The only reason that there is anything that I'm bitter about is because of the violated promises from the devs, though I can't really blame them. All I can really say is that I hope consumers don't push CDPR to force their content out, because given more time, I genuinely think this could have competed with or topped Witcher 3.In short, what they promised? No. Still worth it? Yes. Great game, and I'm going to have many more hours in this to come."

My first pre order, my first modern rpg, my first 500 hours spent in a game, my first long ass review no one will even read. But I need to talk about this game, because it´s that good.The story touched me in ways I couldn´t have foreseen. Johnny's frustration with the system and the desire to change it, when there's really no clear or clean way to do so was incredibly relatable, and it put a lot of my thoughts into words. The story is good, not too long, which, paired up with some great side-quests, makes for a longer experience if you desire it. One of my favourite aspects of this game is the customization. For your build, and for your character. Being able to play as a woman, made to look like I want her too, with great voice acting and to have me able to choose her clothes, and choose the build, which can be anything from melee to stealth to guns to sniper rifles, was a major deal breaker. Yes the game is first person, and I would't have it any other way, as there's many moments that would only work in first person, but you know how your character looks, you hear her, you see her in the mirror. And as a woman, being able to play as one in game was great for my immersion.The gameplay. Ah, where do I even start? There's a lot, a lot of options, so as you imagine there's some hits and some misses. The melee combat could use some work, and as much as I would love to use the monowire more, the execution of it lacks some nedeed complexity. But the gunplay is amazing, the details in the guns, the animation, the sounds are great, and they're just fun to use. The katanas are very good too. There's also a lot of cyberware, from your cyberdeck to the double jump legs, which opens a lot of doors for different builds. The stealth is fun without being too challenging.The music. THE MUSIC. It feels like a love letter to music and rock sometimes. I can't listen to ""Been Good to Know ya"" or ""Never Fade Away"" without crying a little. The quality of the music really makes the world believable, they sound and feel like they were recorded there. I could go on forever, I really could. This game watched me grow. I went from struggling on easy with a very bad build to thriving on very hard. I know I love this game because it's message stays with me and I carry it and think about it on my day to day life. I loved it from the moment I read the description back in september 2020, and I love it now, more than one year later, because it taught me to keep fighting, even if the fight seems already lost. The game is not perfect, and this is not an objective review by any means, because objectivity is overrated when there's so much soul to be seen and felt every second you play it.Thank youThank you for everything."

Night City is a treat for the eyes, although some zones feel a little lackluster.-  .

Every choice isn't impactful, but there is a lot of variety in what you can say and/or do, making different backgrounds worth the new playthrough.-  . There is a ton to do in the game, from simple repetitive gigs to richly animated and diverse questlines that bring you to every corner of Night City.-  .  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game is gorgeous, especially during the night time in the middle of the city. It perfectly scratches that itch for a futuristic neon aesthetic. The models are great, whether on guns, swords, cars or other random objects. It all coalesces into a very immersive experience.-  . Vastly underused concept, but every quest that involves them is an absolute treat.-  . It takes advantage of the gorgeous world, you can do whatever you want with it, and take some great pics if you're into that. Just a cool tool that is easily accessed at all times.-  . There are no two ways around it, combat sucks. It feels like skyrim's (which was already poor in 2011) in a game that came out 10 years later. Shooting is clunky, melee is overpowered.-  . Developers please, are we really so out of ideas in how to implement higher difficulties? I usually play games on the hardest diffulty for a good challenge, but Cyberpunk is still stuck in the primitive stage of HIGHER DIFFICULTY = ENEMIES HAVE A TON MORE HEALTH. When every basic thug needs to be shot 100 times in the head, it only breaks immersion, especially in a game already plagued by poor combat.-  . I know it's not exactly fair to compare, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GTAV is coming up on 10 years of life. The driving physics here are rage inducing, and there are only about two vehicles worth giving a damn about in the entire game. Shame, because the cars are so well designed. AVOID CURBS AT ALL COSTS.-  . Primitive UI and UX, nothing more to say. It's annoying, hard to read, feels awful to navigate. You have 3 different buttons to escape 3 different menus, why...-  . Whether we're talking weapon and skill progression, which feels unrewarding at best, and downright punishing if you don't invest in crafting and get iconic items too early, or in game/lore progression where your street cred doesn't feel impactful at all, the whole progression system is underwhelming and could use a lot of work. I expect this is an area of the game that will improve drastically with mods.In the end, I enjoyed playing the game and completing all the achievements. I got the game during steam sales and it was definitely worth the price I put into it, especially with the modding community coming out with more stuff. Cyberpunk is a flawed experience, one with its moments of brillance and very high highs, as well as very low lows with broken and uninteresting content at times. I'd recommend it if you know what to expect, have a very capable rig, and get it at a reduced cost."

It is a perfect base for things to come, hopefully, as right now there is just nothing there - see under Negatives.- The Cyberware system is pretty fun and useful to augment your character or make up for its shortcomings. Also it's the only system in the game that actually gives you a meaningful feeling of progression and increasing power, especially the double jump which is a total game changer.- Stealth is relatively fun and usually a viable option - even if it's always realistically faster and easier to just kill everything guns blazing due to how unbalanced the game as a whole is.- Combat is just average, serviceable, but nothing to write home about.- Driving is relatively bad compared to other similar games such as GTA series, but it does its job, except the damn zoomed-in Minimap which will make you miss every turn if you are driving more than 50 mph.Unfortunately the category where most points will have to go.- BUGS. The amount of bugs in this game is absolutely insane - I've never played a buggier game and that includes early access and Beta titles. Literally every aspect of the game is bugged heavily, some are easier to notice, some harder. Many of them are, at least, easily fixed with a Load game, but they happen often enough to pull you out of the world every few min. And some are huge and make entire game systems not function - such as most armor mods not working at all, or perks not working as intended.- OPEN WORLD as a whole is extremely underdeveloped and shallow - basically non existant. Outside of the 100% scripted missions, and Paint-the-map gigs and NCPD jobs (most of which are the same - come here, kill and loot, job done), there is no pedestrian AI at all, no Police AI, no reputation system of any sort - you just kill a million members from each gang and they all still love you and their bosses still work with you without a word, no fun activities, no hangouts with love interest/ buddies, no car customization, no property buying or at least apartment customization (nor any reason to visit it ever)... Many basic things missing, even stuff that appeared in other games such as GTA 3 20 years ago.- ITEMIZATION is probably the worst I have ever seen in an RPG. You have literally a couple of guns, a baseball bat, a few bladed weapons... and that's it. They all get random “quality”, and they scale with your level. The system where items get a random number of mod slots is just the worst - for example you can find Legendary items with 0-4 mod slots. Legendary with 0 mod slots is EXACTLY THE SAME as just a white item of that level (??!). So you are forced to savescum to obtain Legendaries with max mod slots, which you can already do as early as lvl 8, and from there you can just keep crafting Armadillo mod (which scales with your level and you can even craft Epic versions without having the Perk for Epic crafting) and never worry about any items ever again, they just become an annoyance. Iconic/unique items serve no purpose at all as they are always much worse than just random things you already wear - unless you invest 20 points into Crafting to be able to upgrade them to Legendary quality. And if you do that you lose most of your combat/stealth/ hacking potency so it's definitely not worth it to get a 5% better item. Leading to...- BALANCE: Non existant. I played at Hard from the beginning and I was able to 1 shot most enemies including bosses through the entire game with just 1 Katana strike to the head. Just from buying a new legendary Katana on the same vendor every 10 or so levels. Once you stack some Armadillo mods you become completely invulnerable to enemy bullet fire - but somehow still get 1 shot by any explosion or melee weapon. I guess this is an error in damage calculations, i.e. a bug, but that's how it is at the time of writing this review.- NO REPLAYABILITY / CHOICES DON'T MATTER: Unfortunately I don't see the game having any replay value due to having basically NO meaningful choices at all. The origin story just gives you some unique dialogue which doesn't really ever change the quest or dialogue in a meaningful way. Regarding the story, I can already see it being a lot worse on subsequent playthroughs as a heavy focus is put on just slowly walking/ driving and talking from objective to objective, in completely linear missions with very little to no player agency. Once you already know what's going to happen, I just don't see it being fun.- PACING is completely broken as well. If you do gigs/ NCPD missions you will very quickly outlevel the entire content and have all quests at ""Very low"" threat level until the end of the game. Also towards the end you will find yourself in a situation where you have several side quest chains unresolved and have to spend hours driving around the town waiting for people to call you and give you next parts of the quest - while on main quest you are already at the ""point of no return"". What can easily happen is that you think you are done with all sidequests and you just go finish the game - without ever knowing you were supposed to wait for 72h for another call to continue the chain.- SCRIPTED AND OPEN WORLD DON'T MIX WELL - By this I mean situations where you kill a guy in a quest... and then you reach him in the main quest later on and not only is he alive but you both act as if you just met. This happens on several occasions. Also it's pretty funny when you have a scripted car chase as part of a quest and you can see the regular cars keep disappearing all around you, so the scripted ones that are supposed to cut you off on intersections can spawn in instead - it looks insanely amateurish and completely takes you out of the game. Or, I have a guy scan my cyberware during a quest and he calls it ""complete garbage"", while I actually am decked out in full BiS Legendary cyberware - just cause the script expects me to be lvl 10 at that point, while I'm actually 40. Way too many continuity errors like that everywhere.All in all, as someone who considers Witcher 3 the best single player game of all time, I'm deeply disappointed by what Cyberpunk turned to be. The further I progressed in the game and the more I played around with its ""systems"" - or a lack thereof - the more apparent it was that most of the budget and development time went into the scripted quests, while basically all other elements are left criminally underdeveloped. CDPR turned from the golden son of gaming to worse than Bethesda overnight, seeing how they on purpose lied about many aspects and systems of the game that never made it in not even in a most basic form; not to even mention the bugs, nor the console situation.That said, the game does have that certain ""something"" that makes you wanna login and play, so it it not outside of the realm of possibility for CDPR to actually make it a great game it was supposed to be, a few years down the line. However after finishing the entire game I'm doubting it a bit as there's just too much wrong with it - for starters they will need at least 6 months of heavily working on the game just to fix most of the bugs - so without any gameplay additions or enhancements."

The problem is, that's about all this game has going for it. Yes it looks amazing, but everything else is lacking. Let's start with the character customization. In all the marketing we saw, style and body modification were shown to be a huge part of what this  game would be about. What we got, however, was unremarkable. Aside from customizable genitals (which except for in the inventory menu, you will never see again after you've created your character) this character creator had no more depth than your average character customization in games, and in a lot of areas, it had less. Many of the NPCs in the game have cool looking cybernetic eyes, arms, and legs, but your character has no access to any of that. In terms of cybernetics that affect your appearance, all you really have are the little bits of metal on your face. To make matters even worse, once you've created your V, that's it. You can't change your appearance any more. Despite the fact that the ads implied in Night City, you could change your appearance and and body on a whim, you can't. Not even your hairstyle or tattoos, let alone cybernetics.The next thing I want to talk about is character choice. Aside from the intro mission, and maybe a few bits at the end of the game, you really don't have much control over V's personality or choices. V essentially becomes the same character no matter what you choose. For example, I chose Corpo as my lifepath. After the very first introductory mission, V went from being a cold, calculating Corpo completely devoid of morals, to being a passionate, tough talking mercenary. I had no say in the personality shift, the change just happens, and it happens in literally minutes.The world itself was also a let down. I went into this thinking it would be a sprawling open world with lots of exploring to do and interesting things to discover. But what I found was, while it is clear that tons of effort went into crafting the beautiful city, it really doesn't go deeper than the surface level. Yes there are tons of NPCs walking around, but the city does not live and breathe. It is completely static, and the AI leaves a lot to be desired. As many have already pointed out, the AI seem to be the absolute bare minimum, they walk, talk, and run away if you scare them. That's it. The police AI are a complete joke. If you get in trouble with the law, police just spawn feet away from you, no matter where you are. In the middle of the desert, on a freeway, on top of a building, police just materialize out of nowhere.The story definitely had it's moments, and I did very much like the ending I got. I was very disappointed that you do not get to go back to Night City afterwards, and see how your decisions affect the world. Instead, you are simply given the opportunity to go back to your last save before starting the final mission. I found that story missions, side missions, and gigs all played pretty much the same way. Accept a job, go in either guns blazing or silently, find something, then get out and accept your payment.The cybernetics and gear system was weird, to say the least. Even playing on hard, I never had any reason to get into crafting or cybernetics to be powerful enough to get by. I wanted to get into cybernetics more, but even doing all the side missions and gigs didn't yield enough money to be able to afford the good stuff. By the end of the game. I had only added one or two new cybernetics to my character. I was also disappointed with V's apartment. You get one apartment, you can't get new or nicer ones. On top of that, there is no reason to ever return to the apartment you do have. Yes you can stash stuff there, but that's it, other than that it is pointless and you can forget it even exists. I also found it strange that there was no way to customize or upgrade cars. You spend so much time in your vehicles, but you can't do anything with them besides drive from point A to point B.This is tough, because if it had been advertised as what it is, I might have thought it was a really good game. But aside from visually, this game was not nearly as deep as I got the impression it would be. Part of the blame lies with me, after the Witcher 3 I had faith that CDPR would deliver another masterpiece. That was an unrealistic expectation I realize. But at the same time, I don't think anyone can deny that this game is not what we were told it would be. Yes it  was probably largely the media that made expectations so high, but I do believe that CDPR did, in this case, overpromise and underdeliver. If Steam had a numerical rating system, I'd probably give the game a 7/10. But because I have to choose recommend or don't recommend, I have to choose the negative option. I might reconsider later on after patches and DLC, but I believe many of the problems cannot be fixed in that way."

That I mattered.""- VSince 1988, the cyberpunk universe has been expanded upon in a number of new comic books and video games. The most recent addition to this renowned futuristic setting was the CDPR video game adaptation, an open-world RPG that became famous for its numerous bugs and unplayable features. Deeply tarnished by the colossal failure that Cyberpunk 2077 was, I started the game with very low expectations, hoping to catch at least a glimpse of what Night City could be. To put it briefly, I was pleasantly surprised. Cyberpunk 2077 follows the story of V, an ambitious Edgerunner who tries their hardest to make a name for theirself in Night City, a diverse megalopolis overrun by corruption, organised crime, and gang violence. Our protagonist, who has left his previous life behind, becomes involved in a risky heist, which sends them on a Homeric quest. With the help of an unlikely acquaintance, they soon realise that in the corporate world, there are no happy endings, only bittersweet ones.The game's pre-existing lore, combined with the introduction of new and old but beloved faces, results in an epic story filled with emotion and heart-pounding action. On one hand, the experience is fleshed out by complex characters with various goals and dilemmas that confront their own existential problems. On the other hand, the main storyline is divided into acts that, even though they set the stage for further exploration, prove lacking in terms of content and coherence. For example, the various life paths that can be chosen from the beginning of every playthrough deliver a strong start for an almost flawless recipe, but they run out of steam halfway through the journey. As a result, besides some occasional dialogues, they fail to make an impact, leaving you with a surprisingly trimmed-down experience.Behind the colourful neon lights and glossy chrome cybernetics, the game attempts to transfer the cyberpunk dystopia without substance, as many of its features, including game mechanics, prove lacking in the already crumbling formula, not to mention the ridiculous number of bugs or glitches that to this day seem to be a nuisance. Originality and player integration are the key factors that shape the cyberpunk world. From the character to weapon customization, everything can be tailored to your specific needs and playstyles, leaving open the door to countless roleplaying possibilities. If you ignore some design flaws like ridiculous weapon upgrades, the game has a tonne of original concepts that will keep you entertained for countless hours. Quickhacking, for instance, was a surprising mechanic that works masterfully with the stealthy segments. Considering how well the weapons and all of their accessories work and produce stunning results, ranged combat is also deserving of praise. The implementation of the skill levelling system and the inclusion of cyberwares that increase V's toolkit's capacity for mental and physical effectiveness promote both stealthy and less covert methods, leading to multiple playstyle combinations. Unfortunately, this cannot be said of the melee combat segments, which are significantly less compatible and stylish than their more interesting counterparts.The overall development follows a straightforward path with a strong starting point but a hasty conclusion. Your choices during your playthrough, whether they be related to ability specs, career paths, or dialogue options, will be entwined with various scenarios that could affect specific events or decisions. Although I find such interactions refreshing, they merely scratch the surface of what was originally promised. But it is not the main story nor the different gigs that make the experience unique and appealing; it is the side quests that redeem the overall package. They are simply incredible, full of gaming references and secrets that lead to some of the most notable and memorable moments. The only thing that bothers me with the almost unblemished mix is the way they tend to pop up on your radar, as they urge you to engage in other activities while you wait for a chain event to activate randomly.While the game succeeds in creating a world that is a masterpiece and seduces you with its myriad opportunities and details, it hits you square in the back when you use some of its features. The vehicles are a great illustration of the aforementioned point because the designers focused a lot of time and energy on producing stunning interior and exterior designs without taking into account one crucial element: functionality. Driving is awful; it involves erratic, out-of-control movements that frequently cause collisions or unnecessary casualties among civilians. The same is true of the most fundamental wanted level system ever designed, in which you are located by police cars after committing a crime without them making the slightest attempt to pursue you; instead, they simply spawn a few metres away from you. On top of that, the world's dynamics seem hollow, especially given how little emotion and engagement the NPCs show, which makes them seem like inanimate objects with no real personality. To give credit where credit is due, the most recent updates attempted to make some changes to this factor, but in my opinion, their effects were akin to applying a plaster over a massive wound.With absolutely breathtaking scenes that left me speechless, Cyberpunk 2077 has, without a doubt, the most stunning setting in the gaming world. Night City is a combination of visual cohesion and unbridled beauty that cannot possibly be absorbed in a single playthrough. Its crowded streets, slums, and vast open spaces provide a ludicrous amount of pure content and attention to detail that will keep you occupied for days on end. Everything looks polished to the highest modern standards, including the skill system, the weapons, and the clothing. I took my hands off the keyboard countless times to simply take in Night City's beauty, and every time I did, it left me with an unforgettable feeling that I would give anything to relive. The soundtrack was low-key, one of the main emotional drivers that deepened my connection to the game on a personal level, and one of its biggest stars. Since I was abusing the replay button, the astounding mashup of techno, pop, and rock beats left a mark on my Spotify playlist. The voice acting reaches the pinnacle of perfection, and the sound design is superb, giving every gun and vehicle a distinct clang and feeling. The icing on the cake, however, was how in various parts of Night City, you could hear different accents and languages depending on the area's dominant culture.  After many hours of play, I can confirm that the game's drawn-out and enduring redemption arc is still being worked on, with ongoing fixes and changes raising the prospect of a future, well-rendered sequel, since the game’s original foundation is still clearly in disrepair. Cyberpunk is by no means a bad game; on the contrary, it is a unique experience with a grand vision that regrettably got blinded by its ambition."

Let me start by saying I'm 56 hours in and yet to finish the game. The main story is awesome and engaging, some NPCs are really likable, there are awesome side quests and little easter eggs, fun things to find like skippy the smart gun. smart guns and netrunning are fun and refreshing, almost watchdogs like. Combat is good for an RPG.Now the bad part tho is it's hardly an RPG and not at all what we were promised. You don't really define V, he's a predefined character with a dream of becoming a night city legend and he acts solely in that way, it's not your character. Getting to pick your peepee isn't defining your character.We were promised a next level immersive open world RPG where you get to define who you are and how you approach the game. Literally none of it is true. Let me start with the AI or rather lack of thereof. The civilians just run a few feet and duck in the open till the end times. If you shoot a vehicle they just do nothing, don't even attempt to drive away just freeze in place and that's it. The driving AI though, damn that's a whole nother level of bad. I've parked my car on the sidewalk with only like a feet sticking out on the actual road and there formed a huge traffic jam cause of it. The hostile mobs are not perhaps as dumb as some games out there but not the brightest either, certainly nothing next gen about it. The scripted scenes are all on rails, like Jackie driving you the car is literally not driving. The opponent vehicles are all driving along a predefined path and nothing you can do will change it. Shooting NPCs in car chases stuns them at best, you can't kill them, shoot their tires or anything. But that's not as bad as NPC pathing during scripted scenes, try parking a vehicle in their predefined path and they'll clip straight through it. Character creation isn't really as good either, there are no sliders to make your character fat, muscular or short. Cosmetic cyberware is extremely limited. There's no way to modify your looks outside of character creation, which in a cyberpunk game where body modifications are a prime focus is just lazy. Functional Cyberware is also extremely limited and bland. The live megabuildings we were promised, well there are only a couple you can enter and all of them are 1 or 2 stories only.Unique NPC's with full day/night cycles and reactions to your actions literally spawn/despawn behind your back, the same thing with vehicles. The whole vertical build seems to be a huge scam too. Like there are roof tops and multi level streets but that's about it. You can hardly enter any buildings.The immersive features are severely lacking. - There are only a few vendors with only interaction with them being 'got some eddies to burn'. - NPCs have no inventories. - The loot drops like its some hack'n'slash game with most of it being junk. - There are no factions or karma systems. - There's no item ownership, you can literally wipe everything clean and no one gives the slightest. - There are no police chases, you can move 1 block away and all your crimes against humanity are forgiven. - Most the side content is just go there kill every bad guy get your eddies. - There are no dynamic encounters, once you clear an area it's safe and empty till the end of the game. - You can't sit on mostly anything outside scripted scenes and your apartment. - There are no containers that aren't loot chests. - The consumables are junk, there's no animation for any of that and the effects mean little. - There's only one uncustomizable apartment in the entire game. - There's no garage or car customization, you can own vehicles but they just spawn when you want them to and you can only get them in a predefined color and configuration. - The quick travel isn't a train or public transport, it's just a click this holo map and teleport. - There's very little to do in the game world outside of quests in general. The only thing this game lived up to is the Cyberprank 2077 meme. So overall if you want a fun game with a good story and decent combat, go for it. If you expected a next gen immersive world where you could sink hundreds of hours without even touching the main story, this isn't it.Edit: 1.5 made this game infinitely better. It's now somewhat of a GTA in a cyberpunk setting with more customization/RP in some places and less in others. Hoping the DLCs will eventually make the game awesome."

I decided to wait for patches and for better PC and while I waited for few years I read and listened how everything is wrong with this game, how patches cant save this because it's whole core gameplay needs to be changed to fix it. Might be a matter of personal taste or the wrong image people had about this game (bad overhyped marketing) but only things I think needed actual change were police system, driving and the botched lifepaths.RPGish gunplay is always kinda hard to nail down when you are just shooting mostly humans, it's nothing to boast about but it serves it purpose with fun and unique guns to play with. Quickhacking is like throwing spells mid combat/sneaking which makes things bit more interesting. Meat of the game is the stories it tells through main story and side jobs, which are good and made me care about people and get invested into their stories. pulling my heartstrings a bit with certain scenes.Overall the wait was worth it for this journey, it offers some memorable moments and characters that will stick with me and when that ending credits scene hits with that music it got that rush of emotions out of me thinking about everything I've just experienced and accomplished. Still CDPR botched the launch and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this up for so many and wasting their trust they had built with Witchers, its hard to justify positive reviews for this game to some but for me personally this is now a good game after the patches and with the expansion coming out next year I'm actually excited to return to Night City but I will not buy the expansion until I've seen some trustworthy reviews. 8/10 never fade away. CDPR build your trust back to what it was and prove yourselves once again."

I worked at CDPR in Warsaw, Poland and I told them every time they made a mistake but they often refused to listen. I'm so sorry they were only listening to devs ignorant of the IP instead of those of us who genuinely care about the game and the Cyberpunk brand. They have lost touch and it's disappointing. I feel bad for Mike, most of all.Taking all of us out of the credits was the biggest insult. I love and hate this game because CDPR stock was all the Directors seemed to care about in the end and it only hurt the game, the devs, and fans. Way to go, głupi.Feb-15-2022: After a couple hours with the 1.5 update, the game has issues (in what seems) to be streaming and unloading of assets that can cause performance drop until you save, exit the application, and reload. I'm rooting for you Red. If you want to be real rebels, as we claimed to be, it needs to start from the ground up because the folks that built this incredible Polish studio have become the things they claimed to fight against from the start.FEB-19-2022: The 10gb patch has fixed the performance issues! :)We put years of our lives into this game and this is not the legacy we wanted to leave behind. We were supposed to create THE Cyberpunk game, not ""a cyberpunk game"".I'm still going to root for you next time because I believe people learn from their mistakes if they truly care about the work and art they share with the world to enjoy because that's what it comes down to in the end: We make games to entertain, educate, emotionally impact in interesting ways, and help them become better human beings through the games we create because we find all of these things to be deep forms of fun rooted underneath all of this chrome.Good luck, next time. I'd love to see The Witcher 4 playing as Ciri BTW. More Female Protagonists, please. Cyberpunk 2088 or whatever would be cool with me too. Let's do better next time and I'll keep cheering you on in my odd way.Love,The Inspirer"

I laughed, I cried. I enjoyed it like a movie.My second playthrough was much more fulfilling though. I was V, I made decisions like I would, I got the exact build I wanted, I completed all of the quests from the maximum interesting characters. I achievement hunted the sh*t out of this game and enjoyed every second of it. Gunplay is amazing, quick hacking is perfect for stealth, awesome crafting system with fun weapons. I enjoy the adult theme of this game and the conundrums it places you in. My only complaint so far is that there just isn't enough money to purchase all the vehicles, so I'll probably just glitch or mod the money to get that, because I truly feel I've mastered and beaten the game already on Very Hard difficulty. The only thing that remains is to finish the rest of the endings, including the secret one.I recommend this game, especially for older gamers who want a great FPS experience, but with a meaningful story and a wonderful sense of accomplishment for fleshing out the game.  There are some minor bugs, but they dont break the game or ruin the immersion that badly. The complaints are overhyped, especially at this update stage.9.5/10 -"

In a dystopian future where violence, corruption run rampant and money is all that matters, players impersonate ""V"" - forced to become a gun-for-hire after their previous life is shattered by a chain of events. Along with their longtime friend Jackie Welles and other characters, V will be struggling for survival, money and fame in the ever-risky life of a Night City mercenary.🟩 🟥 🎮 Gameplay is divided into Exploration, Combat and Character Management.Is performed on foot and with vehicles, progressively obtained by purchasing them or from certain quests. Fast travel terminals are also present in the world and unlocked by going near them. Night city and environs form an immense amount of space, but fortunately all relevant missions are already highlighted on the global map for convenience. Each location of both main and side missions often houses secrets and plenty of loot, other then lore documents to know more about the world. At first only one sector is available, while others are unlocked a bit further in the main storyline. Plays out in first person, with an equal focus on firearms and melee weapons depending on one's style. Both weapon categories have different mechanics, for instance melee ones can block, parry and counter, while each ranged weapon class feels different to handle and can mount specific accessories. Hacking is also a strong component of any fight, with hacks capable of disrupting enemy weapons, turn machines into allies, or even instantly kill someone. The environment can be a formidable ally, with explosive containers and similar items being plentiful. Implants, mods and perks can change how combat plays out significantly: some slow time, others allow using unique ammunition or specialized hardware.Is performed via a series of menus including inventory, crafting and cyberware. Most customization can be done anywhere out of combat, while to change implants, V has to go to a Ripperdoc and undergo surgery. Weapons can be upgraded with Crafting to get better stats, though it becomes more and more expensive each time. In the same way items can be scrapped for materials or sold to merchants for a quick buck, though this is worthless until late game. Attributes and perk points are awarded each level or from certain rare items, allowing the creation of a specialized build with several skill trees to match each."

But a preem gift with less fancy wrapping is still a preem gift - worth the €$."

The graphics are great and the character models are very good. Animations during dialogue sequences are very detailed and it makes a very immersive experience. The sound track and radio stations are very good with DMCA options for content creators. The music for combat is very reminiscent of doom at times making for some tense moments. The OST is very thematic and fits the world.I played through the main story and got one ending of what seems to be 4 conclusions you can get total. Im sure decisions you make and things will affect the way everyone views you at the end of the game but I will have to explore this further with future play through's.The combat is satisfying and the difficulty ramps up as you level up and encounter stronger enemies. The progression through skills is pretty nice, but I feel like the crafting Exp. is a tad lower making it a bit harder to level.Here comes my gripes other than bugs relating to the game. The city is big beautiful and full of things to see, but I cant interact with very many of the NPC's and the night life for you is non existent. You live in a big bustling city but cant try and get a date at a bar. Many things are explained to you and you can see lots of things going on but there is very little you can do to interact with them outside of the story/side missions. This makes me feel like I am forced to sleep with one/both of the 2 prostitutes and whatever other romance options you get by deciding your voice I think? 2 for masculine and 2 for feminine. I think out of this whole big ass city there are 7 people who want to sleep with you. No dates, no going for drinks. Maybe this is just my own misconception from what I thought they would do from the marketing hype whenever they dropped the long play alpha footage. Personally I would just like to be able to interact with more and have more options. Why give me genital options and no options to use them? I got to see Keanu finger blast someone but I cant try and get someones number or have a drink outside of the vendor menu / my inventory. Let me dance the night away and spend all my hard earned eddies on strippers.Add NG+ please. Not sure if its in the works yet or not but damn would it be nice to start over and try different choices while progressing my skills on a harder difficulty.The menu's feel kinda clunky and it takes two button presses to exit the map vs one button press to open it. Some quality of life things would be nice on the menus.The Mens hairstyles are lacking compared to female, but in a hat they change depending on the hat. Not sure if that was intended or a bug.A barber or plastic surgeon to edit the character would be nice, but there are no options like that in game post character creation.I had a problem of being crouched when dialogue starts and skipping lines trying to get V to not have conversations with the persons crotch.Overall this game was a fantastic experience and I plan to update this review as I learn more and its patched. I think once some of the kinks are ironed out and some things are added to keep the game play loop fresh after story completion this will be another master piece of a game. My opinion is if they add a bit more interactivity to the world and the people living in it this will redefine open world games. What good is living in Night city if you cant take part in the night life though? To be the best hired goon in history with a cool car? Look forward to updating this as the game updates.I don't really see this getting better after all the kerfuffle. If you get this get it on sale or something. Fun game but very broken. If there is a creation kit released for this it could be redeemable by the mod community."

I didn't expect it to be the second coming of Christ, nor did I expect it to cure my depression or some other silly stuff like thatWhat I expected was... well, more Deus Ex. And that's what I've gotten. Gun play, stealth, hacking, exploration, crafting and an engaging story. So yeah, if you've enjoyed the original Deus Ex, Human Revolution or Mankind Divided, then this is for you.Because Cyberpunk is still a good game, despite the Hypetrain crashing into a concrete wall. It's a good RPG, with an interesting story and well written Characters. It's a continuation on what we've seeen from CDPR in Witcher 3. Now, it's not the perfect RPG. Due to V being voiced, you can't control their character 100% of the time. They'll still loosely fit into a general template, which is to be expected when your character is voiced. But still, after so much time without a Triple-A Western RPG, this was certainly a nice change of pace.The game's obviously not without it's faults. Graphically it's... okay, though I'm personally not too much of a fan of the art-direction at time. Not in the sense of what people are wearing, or how Night City looks, in those regards this game is basically a playable version of Bladerunner. But moreso in decisions made with the lighting. Now,  admittedly, this was without Raytracing, so it could very well be that that would change it for me, but I've noticed that the lighting during day had a tendency to be extremely harsh and bleached out, sometimes looking like a nuclear bomb had just gone off above NC (especially when leaving a tunnel, to which the game has a bad tendency at blinding me for a few seconds... usually resulting in me crashing into something). Honestly, perhaps fitting to it's name, Night City usually looks the best at night, often resulting in something that you'd see in the music video of modern Synthwave, ala Carpenter Brut or PerturbatorBut, all these nitpicks aside, it still looks good. Perhaps not as ""next-gen"" as some would hope it to, but it's servicable nonetheless.Now, there are few points I could continue complaining about: For example, the minimap should be zoomed out more when driving, since in it's current state it often shows me too late that a (very very sharp) turn is coming up. The Gunplay, as others have mentioned, is sub-par and feels too much like something you'd see out of Borderlands, with Weapons *looking* satisfying with their well made animations, but *feeling* unsatisfying in that you need to shoot some punk five times in the head for him to go down (which I think goes against the idea of the original Cyberpunk... the pen and paper game I mean. Reading up on it a bit, it seems that the philosophy in the original's combat was that, if your character had a large calibre gun, they were a force to be reckoned with, despite their level. In a sense it also reminds me of what Ross Scott in his Game Dungeon about the original Deus Ex said, that guns should feel powerful and deadly, but it should be the characters ability to aim and handle them that get's improved over time. Not the raw output of damage. Basically, if your character is holding a .45, they should be well able to drop some wannabe gangbanger on the streets)So yeah... if you're playing the game, feel free to drop down to normal if it get's too tedious. It's not necessarily very ""challenging"" on Hard, just excruitiating at times, with how spongy the enemies feel. Aside from all that? Bugs... yeah many bugs. But again, it seems that people are judging this game based on how it's running on 7 year old hardware (that was admittedly already outdated when it came out back in 2013...). Basically, all I'm saying is, yeah, CDPR made a mistake in releasing the game in it's current state on PS4 and XBone, but it's unfair to throw those versions in the same bucket as those that *actually* work. If you have a PC, do yourself a favour and play it on that (or a PS5/Xboxwhatever if you have those) and for the love of Cyberjesus, if you can, put this game on an SSD. Otherwise you're gonna be assaulted by half-molten Action Figures, before they suddenly turn from burn-victim to normal Cybercivilian"

I've been following this project since 2013 and preordered as soon as it was available. If you strip away all the hype, all the promises and trailers the devs and CDPR corporate heads made, the game is decent. A good 40-60 hour time sink in a very beautiful, GPU-demanding world. In the year that it has been released, most of the major bugs have been rolled flat, though there are still moments where the game breaks.The story has gotten some backlash, but I didn't mind it that much. It was engaging enough but a bit predictable. I won't mention the ending, but I will say that the supporting cast and side characters did a phenomenal job and Keanu is... well Keanu. The guns get pretty boring once you've seen them all, and there are a very clear set of ""best guns"" while the rest are used as stepping stones. The character skill trees aren't as realized as the could've been, but there are still some very cool builds and skills to mix and experiment with. The worst part of this game is the world itself. Despite the beauty and large map size, the world of cyberpunk is pretty hollow. The civilian AI sucks, the police AI is even worse. Navigating around the map on wheels feels clunky, and some parts of the map aren't even finished (I'm looking at you, Pacifica). Similar to fallout, there are some stellar side quests, but they are rare. The majority of them are either fetch quests, or ""kill person X"" missions. The gameplay loop is decent, but it could be so much more.Cyberpunk is like being promised a new smart phone and receiving a beat up flip phone. Yeah, it gets the job done and checks all the boxes. But the promise of something greater with more functions and polish diminishes the value of what I ended up with, and I can't help but feel disappointed knowing what could have been."

Moreover, the atrocious release state only solidified my negative view. Not really because of various bugs and optimisation issues, but rather due to how it undelivered even after the numerous renouncements of presented mechanics. I simply could not swallow that, so I avoided buying it, always resentfully looking whenever it appeared on sale.Yet, even I can only last with my hatred for so long; plus, getting a new laptop seemed like a perfect opportunity to try it out—as perhaps it would persuade me of its qualities? Well, as  would say: . I mean, I enjoyed it for what it is! But the more I played, the more its shortcomings hindered my experience.That being said, diving into the Night City for the first time is an enthralling feeling; it is almost breathtaking to witness such incredibly diverse and detailed places that serve as an excellent background for its mature stories. Galavanting around the streets, hearing numerous different languages at once, and seeing all the futuristic curiosities of any kind are unbelievably immersive. The cherry on top would be its addictive compositions that I immediately had to add to my  list. At that moment, it seemed it all clicked together.While that might sound astounding, you will find out soon enough that it is all a ruse; it is a glitz around a hollow core, one that can barely compete with other open worlds. Its shallow substance desperately tries to portray itself as a deep one, presenting you with all the factions and conflicts at every neon corner. In reality, however, you will only taste that during the main narrative and a few side quests that manage to stick out from the mindless influx of repetitive gigs and activities that are mediocre at best and subpar at worst. Because those are all that fill up the streets of the Night City: an endless stream of monotonous robberies, ambushes and collectables. An uninspired checklist to deal with, where your options to interact with the world are immensely limited, making me bored when I was clearing out the map.Conversely, the storylines are its redeeming qualities that managed to make up for all my harsh criticism. Perhaps it is not surprising since  writing was always their strength, and here it shines yet again. How so? It tells mature tales – not in the sense of throwing a bunch of boobies and torn limbs around, although you will enjoy plenty of those too – as it implements many societal, cultural and political themes into one coherent narrative, where morality is difficult to achieve, let alone maintain, as you might expect from this corporation-ruled dystopia.Thus, many of its topics hit close to home, portraying authentic situations, albeit coated in a cyberpunk setting—showing the worst of humanity if it would continue with its endeavours without any self-reflection. The fact that you are mostly a mere pawn swimmingly complements that. In a way, its themes and how you decide to deal with them perhaps left a bigger impact on me than its characters. Does that mean they are not written well? No. I just did not perceive them in a more personal way like in mentioned  series. What did not fully convince me, however, were their romance paths, which felt underdeveloped, perhaps a bit rushed. Nevertheless, it is a tiny complaint, as they still manage to provide much-needed sweet and light-hearted moments; just like in our lives.This leads to the said ambivalency of my thoughts. On the one hand, there is this wearisome open world; on the other hand, its plots wonderfully manage to use the setting to their advantage, which made me lust for more. Funnily enough, I have precisely the same feelings about combat and role-playing mechanics…It is not that they would be downright terrible; like, the gunplay pleasantly surprised me! I loved my shotgun with fire-powered shells or poisonous rounds in my assault rifle. And their animations and sounds are solid, making me enjoy tons of shootouts. I think this part surprised me the most because I expected it to be much worse, given the fact their previous titles were oriented on swordfights, which are somehow lacklustre here; engaging in melee fights seems like a downgrade, frankly. Nevertheless, what I adored more was using the hacking utilities, such as immobilising or blinding your poor foes, causing confusion among their ranks—everyone has some implants now after all; make them regret it! So, even though entering in hectic gunfights is a solid option, especially because of the soundtrack, you can try being stealthy, as well. It is a viable way – and hacking definitely helps with that – but the prepared paths for such an approach almost make it too easy, which is a shame.However, as much as liked this gameplay core, its supplemental aspects make it worse rather than better. You see, just as with its presentation of the world,  pretends to be a robust role-playing experience. Yet that is not the case at all! Throwing several weapons and clothes on me after each encounter, or having dozens of skills where most of them only merely increase random stats by a few per cent, is not deep but rather lazy. There is a ton of unnecessary bloat that adds nothing apart from drowning you in all the garbage that you need to sort out every now and then. It is yet another illusion of making it all feel complex when it is just a shallow mishmash of uninspired ideas. The saddening thing is that the foundations are there, as you get a taste of how different abilities should branch your approaches a bit, but it is, again, underdeveloped.Thus,  is just as flawed as the human nature it revolves around. There are several brilliant, perhaps even praise-worthy moments, yet the terrible and scoldable downsides drag it down. In the end, its focus and presentation of the main narrative swayed me to recommend it, but as you can see, it is a  mild recommendation. Overall, it was a bittersweet experience for me, one that I could spend both hating and praising for hours… yes,  is perhaps the most fitting expression for this adventure. Would I love to try out another story from this universe? Definitely! But it would need to be much more different to make me interested again…"

However, they have promised patches and providing regular hotfixes.

Mods are already out for extra fun or better game tweaks.PS - your experience may vary please don't attack or send death threats to me, i knew this game would have not met the hype and kinda expected it to be a normal good game not a masterpiece like RDR2 or others.My score is  7/10, might update after the patches and updates."

That being said, I'd like my review to be objective and not 'DUR GAME BAD!'First off... Cyberpunk is not a bad game. It has many technical issues and can be repetitive at the best of times, but this is a passably enjoyable open world game. The likes of which we've seen many times in recent years. This may, in fact, be part of the problem. Cyberpunk, for its part, is gorgeous and some of the characters are even enjoyable. Parts of the story genuinely had me curious as to what would happen next. While character customization is lacking, the equipment, weapons and vehicles are not. What Cyberpunk truly suffers from however, is a lack of heart. At its core, this game feels empty. The world, to me, feels like a video game world. Which is the opposite of what you want. Contrast it with CDPR's Witcher 3 or Rockstar's Red Dead series and you'll see just how lifeless the game is. The NPCs are background filler. They aren't even pretending to be real people. While the map is genuinely amazing, its bogged down by its populous and technical mistakes. From atrocious pop-in, broken quests, to some of the strangest bugs I've ever seen in a triple A game, Cyberpunk does itself no favors technically. Despite the potential to do a million things, I would compare it to a Far Cry game. All those things are repeated a thousand times over each district. Truthfully the formula is fun for a solid 50-100 hours, depending on your stamina. I personally was disappointed in it because I expected more for a full price game from a professional studio. Yes all games have a level of repeat-ability, but from a studio who prides itself on making rich game worlds...this wasn't that. Personally, I wouldn't recommend the game right now. Maybe when modders get into the bones and make a world actually worth exploring it will be worth it. Or if the game drops to $20. For now, I'd wait for your next big title. This one just didn't live up to what it wanted to be."

When I heard of this back in 2013 it looked like the best thing ever, although even back then I had my doubts about the project, it seemed too ambitious.I ended up getting this game on sale and while I had fun with it I gotta say that even at 50% off I cant recommend this mess and here's why.First I'd like to mention what I enjoy the most about this game and that is the aesthetic. The vehicles, the interiors, the stores, the characters, the clothing, the different city districts, I loved how unique they felt and how well they fit the genre. The game looks great and the Cyberpunk atmosphere is very well done, that's what makes this somewhat unique and makes it stand out. Since the game has such great looking visuals and places I spent a lot of time taking screenshots and using the photo mode, depending on where you're at the game looks phenomenal. That was my favorite part of it, using the photo mode and trying a bunch of different style concepts, managed to create some very nice wallpapers out of it. The photo mode is very robust, letting you switch from 1st to 3rd person, move your character around a bit and even pose for it, I just wanted more focus related options and the ability to switch views during a cut-scene.Another great thing about this game is the character creator, while it's not the most complex I've ever seen it gets the job done and gives you good enough freedom to create a good looking player or a hideous monster, for an open world game like this it's a great addition.Some of the characters in the main story can be considered a highlight, I wish we could spend more time with them though, outside of missions.The progression system is also worth mentioning, there are a considerable amount of perks to buy, a lot of them are useless but it gives you somewhat of a freedom, enough to change some game-play elements, like the gun-play, the stealth, the hacking. Making specific missions easier and a bit different.Ok, so despite having fun with the game I have to say why I can't recommend this mess. The game's all over the place, it  very rushed and like it has an ""identity crisis"", that's where most of the problems are. Sometimes the game wants to be a big open world sandbox, other times it wants to be those very story driven scripted ""walking simulators"". For the first couple of hours you don't get the scope of how bad things are, probably because the first few missions are HEAVILY scripted, even more than the usual, because of that not many glitches occur. To be honest the entire game's scripted ass hell but the beginning is even worse, like those theme park rides that are on rails. The devs market the game as being this awesome RPG where you choices matters with a bunch of different paths, such bull****. They give you the illusion of choice when you start the story, ""lifepaths"", but they literally don't matter, you'll just get a different prologue and some random dialogue choices throughout the game that don't make any significant difference AT ALL. The game's has half a dozen different endings but to get them only a handful of choices you'll make during the story will actually make any difference. The plot has its moments but I found it too linear for what they promised, like I said some of the characters are great, that was the only time I actually gave a s*** about what was going on. Too bad you can't change anything other than the ending.In reality, it's all smoke and mirrors, at first it seems like the city is great and everything. As you progress you get to see how shallow and pointless it all is, the game doesn't have nearly enough variety to feel alive or make you come back to it. You always see the same cars on the streets, the same npc interaction and most of the side missions are very repetitive. The apartments you buy offer absolutely nothing, somethings you can only do at the starting one. The cars you own you can't even change or choose colors so if you end up buying a very cool car but it comes in brown or something boring there's no way around it. The character customization in terms of ""cyberware"" (the implants you use to enhance your character) is very limiting as well, there are a respectable variety of them and they do provide new gameplay features but they don't change anything in terms of looks, for a game that relies so much in aesthetic this is such a wasted opportunity. I wish we had more freedom in that department, like the NPC's with crazy implants and chrome, I want that!And WHY THE HELL DIDN'T THEY MAKE A 3RD PERSON MODE?? Again, for a game that has so much going on in terms of aesthetic and looks (the only unique thing about this game) they sure got a lot of things wrong. So you customize your character, buy all these different clothes and the only time you get to see it is in the mirror or in the photo mode? I cant wrap my mind around that.Ohh and the bug, how can I forget them, they're EVERYWHERE. There are all kinds of glitches, visual ones like textures not loading, blurry ads on buildings and some very weird ones , like cars exploding out nowhere, a bunch of npcs reacting with the same looped animation right next to each other, stupid pathfinding, people floating, npcs and vehicles clipping through objects , talking corpses, enemies with 0 health still fighting, the list goes on and on. Those glitches are not rare occurrences, they happen often and I have them all recorded. Fanboys like to claim they haven't encountered any ""game breaking"" bugs and they're not lying, but don't be fooled, while they're not technically ""game breaking"", they're VERY frequent and they come in all shapes and forms. A game that's been in development for such a long time with such high expectations and they couldn't get the basics of an open world, wow!The marketing campaign they made for this game was a huge deception and the way they paid out early reviews was outright dirty. The devs knew what they were doing and they chose to release this rushed mess anyway, we cant justify it by it's current state, which is still a far cry from what it was advertised as. This game deserves all the hate it got and no matter how great they turn this game in the future it wont erase its tainted story and all the people they deceived into pre-ordering this joke. Nasty things like this in the gaming industry are becoming common and we cant allow this type of behavior."

A wise man once said, ""A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."" Thankfully, we aren't in the 90s anymore and games can be patched and fixed so this quote is less relevant for gaming now. But man, do the developers at CDPR have their work cut out for them. The thing is though, the player only gets one first playthrough and if it is marred by bugs, poor performance and glitches then it is not going to be as enjoyable/memorable than if it was a thoroughly finished game. I did enjoy my time with this and still think it is a good game, but it is far from a solid game at the moment.  V's story through Night City is the game's biggest strength. The writing, characters, and the way conversations play out makes for an incredibly engaging story. The dynamic between V and Johnny Silverhand is great and the other characters are just as good and well-developed, Jackie, Judy, Panam, Takemura, Viktor, River, and even the antagonists (Maelstrom in particular) all have their own motives, interests, history, ambitions that made me so fascinated in their lives and build a connection with each. The side jobs involving each of these characters continued that great writing and was some of the best content in the game, River Ward's and Peralez' questline being a highlight. But there is also memorable content that doesn't involve the main cast, such as a sentient vending machine or a talking handgun wanting to be returned to its owner. However, the problem with the side content is that they are all marked as undiscovered on the map, so it is basically impossible to distinguish the good content from the boring and repetitive gigs. I did enjoy the story and quests but let me just say that I'm a big fan of the cyberpunk genre with government conspiracies, ""high tech, low life"", philosophy, thought-provoking questions relating to our world and all that. Unfortunately, this game barely touches on the tropes of cyberpunk, like transhumanism, it's all just surface level. And I get that they based it more-so on the tabletop, but I would've loved it if they embraced the genre more.  Let's move on to the gameplay and this is where the game stumbles.  Firstly, there are your role-playing and open-world elements. It has your standard level up system and placing points into one of the five attributes (Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Cool and Technical Ability) can open up different ways to access areas, dialogue options or perks. Cyberware is a big part of this game, offering up a variety of modifications to each body section to suit your playstyle. To name a few, you can equip Gorilla Arms or Mantis Blades for close-quarters combat, enhanced cyberdecks for those that enjoy hacking, Smart Links to be able to curve bullets, or more general enhancements that increase armour, health or stamina. Dialogue choices may influence the story slightly, discovering information in shards can open up dialogue options and such but it is not on the level of Divinity: Original Sin or Fallout: New Vegas, more on par with Witcher 3’s style. The open-world elements are lacking or outright missing though, some of which should be a staple for any open-world game. I've heard others describe Night City as ""vast as the ocean, deep as a puddle"", and I couldn't agree more. There is a lot of attention to detail to make each area unique from the skyscrapers to dinky alleyways, but once you start looking deeper into it, the cracks become noticeable.  The way the AI behaves is terrible, the bad wanted system, no minigames (where's my Cyber-Gwent?). And there is just a lack of interactivity within the city, can't sit down and eat at a food vendor, can’t play the arcade machines, can't gamble, can't customise your apartment, vehicles or hairstyle. Whoever sets up a barber shop in Night City would make thousands of eddies. It just makes me appreciate Rockstar Games more for the amount of effort they put into their worlds to make them come alive. The combat isn't bad, but it just doesn't do anything great. While the weapons feel satisfying to use, especially the smart weapons, the combat against the braindead AI just isn't all that fun. For example, you can casually walk up to an enemy in cover and they do not know how to react or they rush you without any regard to their own well-being. The stealth and hacking are fine and is a good alternative for those that enjoy that style of gameplay, but I honestly couldn't get into it because it was even less fun than just shooting enemies. It may get better as you level up, but I didn't feel the incentive to try. Hacking access points with breach protocol is pretty boring as well, where you have to input the code in the right order. Deus Ex: Human Revolution/Mankind Divided did a much better job at making hacking more engaging. The driving is terrible and doesn’t feel natural, the cars have too much oversteer when turning and handle like boats. Another annoyance being that the minimap doesn’t zoom out when driving, so I was constantly missing turns.  Now to visuals and sound. This is definitely a great looking game when it is working at 100%. Weapon models and animations are highly detailed and flashy, along with the abundance of vehicles all designed meticulously. Character models look fantastic with realistic looking movement and facial animations that just help to immerse me into the game. The issue is that bugs and glitches break that immersion constantly, it is incredibly jarring to see fluid animations during conversations with main characters only to walk past a dude T-posing, faces missing or cars stuck in the air like it is Rocket League 2077.  The soundtrack is awesome, the guns sound impactful to shoot, melee weapons have a solid feel to them as well. The vehicles sound great as well. Voice acting done by the main cast is fantastic, Keanu suits Johnny well. Although I played as male V and his voice acting was a bit underwhelming, I heard female V is a lot better so if you want a more rounded performance pick her.  In conclusion, this is an enjoyable game that is hampered from being great for various reasons mentioned above. Just remember you only get one first playthrough, so don't let it be ruined by an unpolished, buggy game. Wait a couple of months for it to be patched and tidied up. This is why I'm leaving a Not Recommended for now. I do intend to go through a second time and try different builds and endings but I don't think I can due to how messy it is at the moment. Once it is all fixed, I'll come back to it and if it has turned into a more complete game, I'll change it to Recommended. In the meantime, go and clear that backlog of games that you swore to get around to. EDIT: Patch 1.2What can I say... It's a good first step for the long road ahead. But, I think I was WAY too optimistic saying it'll be tidied up and better in a couple of months. I should've said a couple of years. There are some improvements but overall there is still a lot a jank. Driving is a lot better, no more ridiculous oversteer or floaty controls. Some visual bugs are fixed, didn't see any T-posing or missing faces. However, now I have a bug where V equips a finger-gun rather than a pistol/revolver and holds shotguns with one hand (I realise I put all my stats into body... but really?). Police spawn 15 metres away rather than 5, but still no police chases. Although, somehow I managed to get into a situation with random NPC thugs chasing me in their cars (outside of missions) so it must be somewhere in the code? What do I know though, I thought this game would be much better by now."

The game is good, playable, I can see the replayability, it's a decent game. But it's defenitely not Jesus' second coming. I'm giving this negative review for one reason : CDPR lied. I can tell the difference between nonsense hype, and actual developer informations. Many things THEY stated, and said to be are NOT in the game.First of all, after they said its an RPG game, yet after a time, they started to advertise the game as ""action-adventure story"", and this can be told after 10 hours of gameplay or so. Choices are fake lot of times, everything is railed into one ending. I can't be the V I wanna be.""Deep"" character customization. Lie. This customization is 2004 level. This customization is not ""be whoever you wanna be"". Faces are ugly, you have 4 tatoos, few percings. You can't change your body. Genital customization is important I guess, but I can't adjust muscles? Weight? Height? Cyber legs? Character customization is HUGE dissapointment. I don't think it's a big demand to have a better customization than a 2004 rpg game.NPCs. CDPR stated they will handcraft 1000 unique NCPs with their own life, interactions, and daily routines. Lie. NPCs are 2004 gta level. They just walking around, or just stare. I see the same NPC after 3 sec of walking.They stated the city will feel alive. Lie. I can't interact with anything, I can't talk to people, there are no random events like in RDR2 for example. I can't eat from food stands, I can't sit a bench.They removed a lot of content they showed us (underground train, wall running etc). They promised a living, breathing, awesome night life city, and we got this dead, empty... thing. It looks nice, but this is not 2020 AAA level.And the worst thing of all : Insane marketing, promises, delays. And after that they pay reviews, and wont let streamers and infulencers to show any console/own footage before release day. This is very shady, and dishonest. They KNEW the game will launch in this state, and they tried to cover it.People praise this game, I don't understand why, this is a marketing faliure, a lie, a scam. I wouldn't have problem with the game at all if they would not marketing it as they did, and they did not release as it is. But they did.Chinese dub is hella good tho."

Instead, I chose to wait until it improved before giving it a try, to avoid disappointment from bugs and complaints. At the beginning of 2023, I started playing the game with low expectations and to my surprise, I freakin’ loved it.I think the theme and world-building of the game are its strongest points. The game does an excellent job of presenting Night City as a city full of disasters, where even the smallest mistake could end with your dead body in a landfill and nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥. The various affiliations, such as the evil corporations that control the world with technology, healthcare, and even military services, the street kids and their gangs like Valentinos with their Chicano culture, The Voodoo Boys with their technological version of Haitian Voodoo, or 6th Street who wants to see NUSA great again, Nomads like Aldaceldos who reject the shiny walls, scrappers and the “dreams” that the city has to offer, instead cling to their “family” values.The game convincingly showcases the consequences of these affiliations in every aspect of the world, whether it be economic, political, or spiritual. It's clear that the developers did their homework on the Cyberpunk universe and brought it to life in a remarkable way, much like the Witcher series.I somehow managed to avoid major spoilers for a year and I was very pleased with the main story. The balance between side jobs, world events, and main jobs aren’t as smooth as I expected it to be. Despite playing the game without taking a long break I had trouble with connecting with some of the characters, or understanding their motivations for certain actions. It is most likely designed around the main story and “main” side jobs which are included in endings.Three specific side jobs stood out to me and showed the game's potential.These three side quests share one big commonality: they're grounded in reality and have a relatable approach, even though the technology and the instruments of the era are different. Overall I like the main story, and I feel like they did not use all the potential they had in many aspects of the game. The majority of the side jobs feel uninspired, but there are hints of what could have been better. I'm hopeful for improvement with the upcoming DLCs and sequel.The gameplay is intriguing with the possibility to test out different builds and optimize your cyberwave to handle everything the City throws at you.For example you can use Sandavista  and turn into a glorious katana-wielding Solo merc, be a knife-throwing or pistoleer assassin that prefers quiet, stealthy approach   or you can go full Netrunner, basically Cyberpunk variant of mage, and perish everyone by just hacking them over their own security cameras. Unfortunately, it gets stale & repetitive quickly and you realize that the “many builds out there to discover” is a mere illusion even though it can be enhanced to some point by mods. Just like the plot, I see a great potential in the combat and build systems but it is definitely not implemented in a “complete” way.Side activities such as NYPD Announcements and Gigs turn into mindless repetitive activities after a short time, despite my efforts uncover their story through the messages and objectives given by the Fixers. They just turned into various chores to get 100% completion.It's been over a year since its release but there are still persistent bugs that sometimes require loading a previous quick save.  The bugs didn’t ruin my gameplay, but it forces the player to take frequent quick saves to prevent any gameplay errors.The general consensus that the game being “unfinished” is mostly applies to the gameplay, and I agree on that. It is enjoyable, but definitely not polished enough.In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that has the potential to be a classic in the gaming world, but it falls short due to its incomplete gameplay, repetitive side activities, lingering bugs and its take on the side stories. Despite these issues the game is still enjoyable and worth playing, especially for those who are fans of open-world games or interested in the futuristic theme. Yet again, I believe that the gameplay in the Witcher series was not outstanding either but it was the unique theme, setting, and compelling stories that turned it into a legendary piece. I hope to see a similar emphasis on storytelling in Cyberpunk, which would make it even more captivating.The narrative, character development and world-building are highlights of the game, and it was a fun journey that I spent hours and hours on. I definitely recommend it."

The main story's a thrill ride, the combat is fantastic, and Night City is an incredible open world setting."

You can find it at this link. It's both longer and better. I consider it superior in every way to this steam review.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Six months ago when this game came out many people said, ""Underneath all the bugs, Cyberpunk 2077 is an enjoyable game with a good story."" I disagreed then, and I disagree even more now. With all the work CD Project Red has done in fixing bugs and implementing a functioning police system it's only become more clear that this game is shallow in many areas and shoots itself in the foot in others. At launch, this game was like a teenager's terminally messy room. It was so messy you couldn't tell what the room's layout was like underneath all the clutter. It could be that underneath this massive pile of dirty clothing up against the wall there's a bed, or a dresser, or it could just be one giant pile of filthy, stinky clothing. But six months later it's easier to understand the room's layout, and unfortunately the effort spent on fixing the technical issues has only accentuated that this game is mediocre at best. In spite of how awe inspiring and visually stimulating the city is, the game simply fails to take full advantage of it's setting. Cyberpunk 2077 needed to follow in Bioshock's footsteps, but instead it's more like any generic Ubisoft open world game. In terms of combat, Bioshock is a game that gives the player a ton of fun tools to kill enemies with in creative ways. Cyberpunk 2077 was practically begging for a similar combat system, but instead combat in Cyberpunk boils down to three repetitive options: hold tab and press the I Win button, sit behind cover and shoot the dumb bullet sponge enemies or sprint around with a melee weapon. The combat in this game is just not very satisfying or interesting. By the end of the game the combat left me with a feeling of extreme boredom that was only matched by the extreme boredom the gigs inspired.The side missions are split between the ones CD Project's writers clearly had a story idea for  and the ones with almost no story that are about mindlessly killing everything that moves while also looting and interacting with computers. They attempted to break up this monotony with missions that require stealth if you want to make the full amount of money, but it doesn't alleviate the problem. The repetitive nature of the mindless combat side missions actively  diminishes the immersion that the visuals and layout of Night City create. It's a far cry from Rapture, where the environment, combat and quests all harmonize beautifully to keep the player firmly immersed.When there's an actual story to engage with, the side missions do add to the immersion by contributing to the themes present in the game. But contributing a bit to the immersion and servicing the various themes is just about all they do.Spirituality, the soul, life beyond death, fame, opportunity, corporate colonialism, cybernetics and transformation. The themes of this game, and how the player gets to experience them, are the one area where CD Project did a pretty great job. They're presented to the player constantly in a million small and big ways all over the city. The news you hear on the radio or see on the TV about the last vestiges of popular government being stripped away by the corporations. The constant oppressive advertisements that are literally everywhere you look. The vast fields of trash and discarded tech on the outskirts of the city. They're all aspects of the same system, a system of violence, consumption and lies that is designed to stomp out empathy. It's a system with only one truth: this world belongs to the corporations. Your presence in it is only tolerated insofar as you contribute to keeping the corps in power.Night City is an elaborate trap set by the people at the very top of corporate society. It lures people in and grinds them into dust or turns them into controllable monsters. It's a slot machine of promises where all outcomes reward the people at the top and destroy everyone else. I think Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most hopeless settings in all of video games.Unfortunately I have to stop complimenting Cyberpunk 2077 now, because this is where Johnny Silverhand comes in.The decision to cast all around good guy Keanu Reeves as Johnny was incredibly savvy. Johnny Silverhand is objectively a human piece of ♥♥♥♥ with an ego so big that only the biggest and most evil corporation on the planet was big enough to match it. In a way, Keanu was the only person who could play Johnny because Keanu's real life likability was the only way to counterbalance Johnny's intense unlikability. In my opinion Keanu did a great job with the material. Whenever I talked to Johnny I was completely immersed, and the conversations I had with him were the highlights of the game for me.Johnny has a character arc in this game. It's a pretty good one as well, which is a rare thing to find in a AAA video game. But all of the good work CD Project did with him throughout the game gets ruined by one thoughtless error. I hated Johnny throughout the game, in a good way, and I was antagonistic to him whenever I got the option. I didn't care that Johnny realized he had made a ton of mistakes, I hated him for everything he did when he was alive and for being a brain parasite that was slowly killing me in the worst possible way. I really enjoyed the experience of being able to hate a video game character because of who he was and not because the character was badly written. When I reached the end of the game and had to make the choice, I decided to go with Arasaka. Partly because I didn't want to get Panam and her friends killed and partly because Johnny hated that idea. I loved arguing with him at the end as they pulled the biochip out of my brain. I literally laughed out loud when Johnny tried to use Jackie against me as his parting shot. But it wasn't what I really wanted to do. I desperately wanted to just attack Arasaka on my own, ♥♥♥♥ risking my friends and ♥♥♥♥ Arasaka. But since it apparently never occurred to my character to do that, I didn't get that option. And then I found out that you can do it, but only as a secret ending and only if you were friendly with Johnny throughout the game. It felt like the game developers were punishing me for selecting options they had freely offered to me. They were punishing me for not liking this unlikable guy. It doesn't make sense to me that my character wouldn't consider attacking Arasaka on his own. V can choose to commit suicide, so why can't he consider attacking Arasaka without Johnny playing into it somehow?It ruined Johnny Silverhand's character for me, and honestly it destroyed the last little bit of good will I felt towards this game. It was like having the rug pulled out from under me at the last second, I couldn't enjoy anything about the story anymore knowing how CD Project decided to treat my choices. I don't know if it was a deliberate choice by them or not, but it's baffling and I hate it. I can't recommend Cyberpunk 2077. I definitely hate certain aspects of it, but overall I don't quite hate it. That said, the things I like about this game are significantly outweighed by the things I don't. I can say this, though, I sincerely hope CD Project doesn't give up on Cyberpunk. I want them to keep trying, either by rebuilding this game from the ground up or making a sequel. The only way for CD Project to truly fail at this point is if they give up. For the things they succeeded with in this game, I'm willing to give them another chance. I hope they take it."

Safe to say my expectations for Cyberpunk 2077 were high, I didn’t expect it to be “better” than The Witcher 3 but I did think it would be the next game that you could remember for a long time – Spoiler: It is not. Let’s start with something positive though: The game is gorgeous! I played on a RTX 3080 and AMD 5900x with Ray Tracing set to maximum settings with fully ray traced global illumination. Interiors are probably the best I have ever seen and the outside areas are simply stunning as well. The world is reflecting in small water puddles after it rained and shadows are cast through the skyscrapers to the lower streets. While the open world looks beautiful though, it’s all a façade – it doesn’t feel real. Let me explain: NPCs simply walk up and down a street and do not interact with you at all. GTA V (which came out in 2013!) has a way more immersive open world. GTA also has actually good police chases, or should I say it even has police chases? When you kill an NPC in Cyberpunk you can gets stars – just like in GTA. But the police will not chase you, nooo. If they are close to you, they will just try to kill you on sight, simply drive away 200m and they forgot. With a setting like cyberpunk, you could have had drones chasing you or even just police cars, but none of that exists. Another thing I noticed is that I can’t remember anything from the open world. You could show me a picture from a part of the world in GTA, The Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2 and I could tell you where that is. Here it all feels the same, no real landmarks, nothing memorable.OK, the world looks beautiful but it doesn’t feel immersive at all. What about the story?Simply said: Its alright. Completely forgettable after one play through, the characters for the most part are boring and won’t be remembered very long. The three “background stories” you can select at the start are meaningless and offer nothing more than a few dialogue options in your playthrough. It’s a huge missed opportunity and it doesn’t help that you don’t get much if any background on V. You simply want to become a legend in Night City (for whatever reason?). One strong suit are the side quests though. They are the most interesting part of the game. You can engage in a variety of activities, with lots of easter eggs and often fun dialogue. A select amount of larger side quests tie into the games ending but in a very unnatural way. If you completed the side quests you are offered an additional option in the final quest. There could have been more elegant solutions but its passable. All in all, the story is the part that disappointed me most: The Witcher 3 had a masterful story and I expected something similar, but what we got is honestly on the same level as Watch Dogs – alright, passable, you won’t remember it.But wait! There is more: GameplayThought getting calls in GTA was annoying? Well, you’re in luck. You are getting called ALL THE TIME. It is bad, really bad. I’ve also had countless occasions where I was in a dialogue (in the main story!) and got a call from a side quest. Like wtf? Both dialogues overlap at that point and the already broken immersion is completely ruined. With that out of the way, the actual gameplay is alright. Shooting is passable but won’t win any prizes. Melee combat is straight garbage, hacking seems completely useless and I never really utilized it. That is because the AI is just not good. They can’t adapt to you quick enough, most of the time just standing in the open and shooting at you. As I said before, look at GTA V, not to mention Red Dead Redemption 2 or even The Witcher 3, the AI there was better. (If you buy the double jump cyberware upgrade the game breaks btw and the AI is overwhelmed by the positions you can reach). Character customization is also flat out bad: If you go for the best armor stats you look like a clown. Make clothing exclusively visual or look at literally any other game that released in the last years to see how to make a system where you have clothing stats but can still choose your style as you want it.Crafting: Frankly it’s not obtainable when you play the story. To upgrade to legendary quality items, you need to spend 18 points into the crafting skill tree which is just a bad decision to make while playing. But even after you’ve done that the required amount of materials are ridiculously expensive and probably won’t be possible to obtain for a large number of players. The leaves the skill tree and the inventory system: The prior is good; you get tons of options to skill to your preferred play style and I feel like the skills are impactful for the most part. The inventory system is unfortunately copied from The Witcher 3 – Its not great… The weight on items and the weight limit on your inventory is annoying and doesn’t add anything to the game.  I’ve gotten to this part and have not even mentioned bugs much, but they can’t be ignored. The game is in a disastrous state on release. You can’t get through a single quest without having three animations completely break, sounds missing and sometimes a trigger just refuses to work entirely. The performance is also not good and even with my setup, the game only uses 40% of the GPU which just shows its not very well optimized or programmed. So, can I recommend it? No, not right now. If you expect the next huge game that will be talked about for a long time because of the story, you will be hugely disappointed. If you look for a good RPG, you will be disappointed. If you look for a good first-person shooter, you will be disappointed. If you look for a good open world game, you will be disappointed. If you look for the probably best-looking open world game that takes place in a large city though, then this might be just right for you. But even if that’s what you want, wait! The game is in an awful technical state and I would not recommend buying it right now if you are not 100% sure you have a setup that can run the game somewhat stable.    Closing thoughts: The game got rated 10/10 and 9/10 by most major news outlets and I believe that’s just objectively wrong. If the CD Project Red Logo was switched out for EA or Ubisoft that game would be ripped apart by everyone. In my opinion there is clear bias because of how good The Witcher 3 was. If any other company had released a game in such a bad shape, there would be outrage by the outlets with talks about long term impacts and trust in the company… Not so in this case. I have no doubt that the bugs can and will be fixed in the future, but even if the game was running perfectly – It’s not better than  7/10."

Some cool side quests.The Braindance is braindead. The whole open world aspect is negligible in terms of both gameplay and excitement.The perks are as riculous, as the whole RPG aspect is.It looks nice and sounds okay.3rd person could have added a lot imo.For 50% off, maybe. Better wait for 70% next Summer Sale.Once again a developer promised stuff that did not happen until the date the publisher wanted the game to pay off. Except CDPR, in this case, is both."

I've completed all the gigs and NCPD scanner quests. The only thing I've missed out on was a relationship quest which didn't trigger. (Even after a year, it's not surprising.)After all of that, I can confidently say, this game was and still is one of the most over-promised and under-delivered titles I've ever seen apart from maybe No Man's Sky (but at least they've put in the maximum amount of effort to deliver the promises they originally made, Cyberpunk will NEVER reach the heights and content initially promised).The things they promised us that sold me on the game that turned out to be lies? Choices made outside of the starting prologue literally doesn't affect anything except for some very far and between dialogue options (which don't change the path of the story in any way). There is incredibly limited choices to make in the main story to actually effect the path it puts you on (won't spoil but the promise of multiple playthroughs being unique? An absolute lie. The story/dialogue options are ultimately as linear as the average Telltale game, an illusion of choice, all leading to very limited outcomes AND EVEN THEN, the story in my opinion is absolutely nothing special). The AI is braindead (STILL). Purchasing safehouses? A lie. Character Customisation? Very limited. If you want the full breakdown of promises that weren't delivered, there is an entire Reddit thread you can find with a quick google.If you bought the newest model of a Ferrari and were told by salesperson it was the fastest road car ever, you take it home and it won't move faster than a crawl, you would not be happy being told ""It crawls now but we'll patch it over the next few years until it hits its top speed"". It would be unacceptable right??? So, why do these big game devs keep getting a pass by players for bullsh***ing us? They were nominated and WON the award for the Steam Outstanding Story-Rich Game Award for their lies, when none us would accept this nonsense in any other industry. Restaurants wouldn't be getting Michelin Stars for serving bad food and Actors wouldn't get awards for bad performances, but as gamers we're sold blatantly unfinished products and are expected to accept it? The game industry will never improve if we keep taking this laying down.Anyway, remember this review when Bioware releases Dragon Age 4, inevitably in an unacceptable state and we gift them with a Game of the Year award for it!"

Just let me tell you now: If you are a fan of games that have a big focus on the story. Get it! The story is brilliantly written and keeps you going until the very last minute! Let me split this review now a bit up to make this a bit more compact and easy to follow:If you ever played Deus Ex, I don't need to describe it further. Not every Deus Ex tho! I am talking about Mankind Divided. Take that formula (Good and fun RPG elements, talent trees and with minor decision related choices) add some crafting. Voilà - Cyberpunk 2077 But if you didn't play Deus Ex (and you should) here a short summary:The shooting mechanic (gunplay) is fun and you can try many builds. You choose how to approach a situation. You can go in with a bang or go complete silent with no casualties. In dialogues you will always get caught off by conversations that are engaging and will change the outcome. The crafting is kept simple and it is indeed optional, but having the ability to craft new gear is always a nice feature.I don't really need to say anything about this one, but maybe infoarmations about the performance are nice?!I run this game on an ""Intel e3 1231 v3"" (equivalent ot an i7 4790) and a ""Nvidia 1060 6G"" while only having 8GB Ram. The settings on my side are a mix of medium and high and I can run it at 60 fps most of the time. In fights it can get down of course (too many explosions), but it really didn't kill the immersion for me. The latest patch even boosted the perforamnce so I might even can get higher now! Another positive thing is that this game even looks really good on low settings as well. So if you are near the minimal requirements you will still have a stunning looking game!Eargasm! Enough said!You know... Once in a while there is this really good idea to make a game that doesn't look as other games before. I am talking here about the aesthetics! This huge open world with its crowded streets and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up lore... This game feels like fresh air. It will get you caught off guard. This city breaths! It tells stories in every corner. If you didn't read anything about the world lore before (and you should) you will still get sucked into this world. It is even better as Deus Ex in these regards. You really have to trust me here! Also read every journal you find and try to learn how this ""Brave New World"" works. It is worth it! You might encounter reviewers who say that there is nothing much to do there. But same people also compare this game to GTA.Soooooo nothing negative?No... this game is a journey! It is one of a kind and it is fun to play! It was maybe overhyped, but that is all!"

I'm literally making this review as a reminder. Had a blast so far but jesus guys, update your nvidia drivers.ULTRA EDIT:A Flawed but Fun ExperienceI might as well actually review this game in its current state considering the attention this got, while I have not finished it I feel I have experienced enough of the core mechanics to formulate an accurate opinion at least on the gameplay.It is a Witcher 3 reskin with a cyberpunk setting, considering that Witcher 3 was amazing (and I still have yet to get through it entirely) it does translate. Narratively this game excels, the dialogue is well written and acted and the characters are hard to not fall in love with. Walking around the world is exhilarating although unengaging, it is lacking interactivity. That being said the gameplay itself is a lot of fun. The guns pack a huge punch, very satisfying to use. The melee with katanas specifically is fun but broken, I did a body and reflex melee build and was able to behead TONS of foes before they even had time to react. The game is unfortunately plagued with bugs, less severe bugs especially after the recent hotfix but there are a myriad of small immersion raping bugs that pop up here and there Bethesda style.Ultimately I invest in player agency/good writing and fun gameplay at the end of the day, the graphics are important but less so. The decision-making of Witcher is here and that's really what I like the most HOWEVER this game was clearly not ready and considering recent events with the dev I will be hard pressed to trust them again. This is an incredibly bad launch.All of that being said, if you're the type that is a fan of Deus Ex, Dishonored, or Fallout: New Vegas you will love this game warts and all just for the godlike quest design those and this game offer. Plenty of skill check dialogue to be found. Suffice to say that I have had a good amount of ""That actually worked?!?"" moments so far which is a really hard feeling to nail down with games like this, you usually only get that out of CRPGs like Age of Decadence or Divinity, etc. At the same time I do not judge anyone that refunds this game or waits for a more stable version to come out because CD PROJEKT RED really dropped the ball and should not have released the game in this state.In conclusion, this game is mostly what I expected it to be and it is a shame that people expected this game to be the second coming of Jesus. I was banking on the decision making and quest design and this game delivers on those fronts. Everything else though, it does fail here and there but, in my opinion, not enough to make the game genuinely bad. If I had to give it a score out of ten it would be a solid 8/10. Hopefully CD PROJEKT RED can iron out all of these problems in a timely manner and elevate its standing.Also driving anything is just plain awful, it depends on what you're driving but in my opinion it should just be the same for whatever you're driving but I'm just talking out of my ass at this point."

Nothing has been changed in the game since it came out. There has been a wave of positive reviews, but i do not believe the game deserves it... yet. The game was incomplete at launch and still is to this day. They released a broken, glitchy, buggy game, waited for the anger of their fans to die down, and are now trying to sell the game off as something else completely. steam award nominee for GAME OF THE YEAR?! are you kidding me? its the same broken piece of ♥♥♥♥ it was last year. Outstandingly Story-Rich Game?! You choose from 3 different options of how you start your game, and none of them matter after you get past the Prologue for each. The Cops are a bloody mess, Gangs have no impact on the city or districts, there are so many lies they threw out at the beginning just to sell the game. There are still a record of these lies called Night City Wire you can find on Youtube where the devs and their spokespeople spent hours trying to convince you that all these cool fetures will be in the game, and none of them are. I'm hoping this game pulls a No Mans Sky and creates one of the best games ever made, but they have yet to prove anything like that will be happening at all. So much potential wasted on a money grab. Thanks for turning what could have been one of the best games of all time into a mediocre photo op simulator with 15 poses.You don't deserve the awards you were nominated for this year, not yet. Triple A games from 2018 are better than this game still, so unless its on sale for half price i wouldn't recommend buying this until they put some effort into it."

I did a completionist run of cyberpunk with a mostly stealth playstyle (with some occasional handguns and smart guns) and thoroughly explored every corner of Night City. So this is my experience with this game.GameplayStealth gameplay is pretty barebones (killing or choking someone unconscious makes no difference) but I still enjoyed using the environment to my advantage with my hacking skills. It is pretty satisfying to complete an area or quest without anyone ever seeing you. That being said, enemies do seem to have a spidey sense sometimes and will just spot you when you’re not even in sight (through a wall sometimes even). And once you get caught, it’s pretty much run and gun from there onwards since they don’t reset their aggro unless you walk really far away.The gunplay is pretty solid. Handguns are fun to use (even though extremely overpowered) and smart guns are really satisfying (shooting through walls, head shotting without really aiming). Can’t really say much about melee combat since I barely did anything with it. The gameplay loop comes down to: ‘go here, kill guy, get loot’ but the story mostly makes up for that. The game also has some balancing issues because you can basically one shot everyone at level 20 if you spend your points wisely.QuestsThe main quest(s) and associated side quests are really good in my opinion. The characters are believable in the sense that they could actually exist in such a futuristic world. And CPDR does not shy away from what the ‘taboo’ and mature subjects touch upon and are done really well. At one of the main quest endings I even got a little bit emotional, which I don’t get a lot when playing games. Side quests in cyberpunk are categorized in ‘actual side quests’, ‘gigs’ (with subcategories of killing someone or stealing/hacking something) and the most basic side quests which are ncpd scanner hustles and crime in progress (which are basically go here, kill guys, get loot). With the side quests it’s mostly hit or miss, some are really great and some not at all. Cyberpunk often likes to give you the illusion that your choices matter but it’s usually two doors that lead to the same hallway, metaphorically speaking. On rare occasions it does matter what you choose and it has an impact on the world. But generally don’t go in expecting too much from your actions. There is also literally nothing to do in night city once you've completed all the quests. There are no repeatable side-activities whatsoever. EnvironmentNight City is a pleasure for the eye. I played on a mid-range rig (gtx 1060 6gb/Ryzen 3700x) and played on mid-low graphics. Even with these low settings, night city is graphically really good looking. The environment does cause your fps to dip sometimes but generally I was playing with anywhere between 30-50 fps. Night City is one of the best well handcrafted cities I’ve ever seen in a game in my opinion. Each district has its own distinct architecture and feeling which makes you feel like you actually go somewhere else every time. There were countless times where I just opened photomode and just looked at the beautiful sights for a while. On the other hand, the npc’s in the city are incredibly lifeless and walk everywhere with no purpose. Night city also does not have even the most basic necessities like a barber or tattoo shop. So you’re pretty much locked to the look you gave your character at the start. ExplorationI explored night city and the badlands thoroughly and loot can be found on pretty much every corner, although most of it is ‘junk items’ (which can be turned into crafting components). On occasion you can find legendaries hidden around the world, which is a nice touch. You can also find bits and pieces of stories as you explore. For example: you found a body from someone who jumped off a bridge and he has a ‘lore book’ on him explaining why he jumped. And later in the game you could find the other side of that story. Not everything is worth reading from these stories, but some are funny references or give more depth to the world. MusicThe OST is really good and immerses you into the scenes. The songs on the radio are hit or miss, depending on your music taste. The music is good enough that I’ve added some of the songs to the playlist I listen to often. BugsThis game has a lot of bugs, some of which are now fixed with the 1.2 update. I’ve played from release and I have not really encountered too much game breaking bugs. Mostly low level bugs like t-posing, people walking through solid objects and other weird interactions in gameplay. The only two big bugs I had was one questline being completely locked off (which was then fixed in 1.1) and one quest not starting at all (which fixed itself after a while for some reason). While that did feel incredibly bad at the time, I’m glad they fixed it because if they didn’t this review would have a very different tone. I do realize that not everyone’s playthrough will be like this, so liking this game really depends on your tolerance for bugs. ConclusionCyberpunk 2077 has many flaws but also some aspects that come close to ‘masterpiece’ quality. It’s really sad to see that this game didn’t have enough time to cook and was probably pushed out of the door too quickly. We all wanted and expected the game they promised, but it’s just not there yet. Perhaps with the free dlc’s and patches it will reach that level, but we shall see. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough and will probably do another one in the future. 8/10, would play again."

Supposed to bring us the best open world mechanics and relationships and non-braindead NPCs who poof in and out of the world just by turning your back, ever. The story is not bad really, but your decisions in this game have 0.003% affect. They cut so much stuff that they said would be in this game it's really unreal.This game will go down in history as the biggest scam game of all time. Tricked an entire world in to thinking that it was going to be the most immersive experience you've ever had, and ended up being a Fallout 76 type cash grab. I don't think I can ever forgive CDPR for this. They tricked us all because of how great Witcher 3 was and they knew it.

My heart is now empty again until I find another game that I can sink into as deep as Cyberpunk 2077. The story, the characters, the world building in general is incredibly immersive and complex. Side quests like Sinnerman, the Peralez quests, all the romance-able characters' quests, left a deep impression on me and burned my expectations on any future game that I would play. Good job CDPR!I started playing from 1.20 to 1.31 and the only game breaking bug I faced wasn't even from the game itself but rather my Steam achievement not registering for the Heywood all gigs and hustles achievement (Mean Streets, solved it by using another save). Some visual bugs do occur sometimes but to me they aren't really game breaking. This isn't a sandbox game like GTA and more like an RPG like Witcher 3 but in a Cyberpunk world. I know CDPR did underdeliver from what they initially promised, but to me this game is still worth all my penny and I would do it all over again just to experience it as a virgin once again."

I have to say, the graphics in this game are absolutely breathtaking. As one of the first games to fully support RTX technology, the level of detail and realism in the game's environments and characters is truly impressive.From the neon-lit streets of Night City to the intricate cybernetic augmentations on characters' bodies, every aspect of the game's visual design is top-notch. The level of attention to detail is truly remarkable, and it's clear that the developers put a lot of time and effort into making the game look as immersive and believable as possible.One of the things that really stood out to me in the game was the character customization. Players have a lot of control over how their character looks, from their hairstyle and clothing to the cybernetic enhancements they can equip. This level of customization really made me feel like my character was unique and personal to me.The gameplay itself is also incredibly engaging. The game's open-world design allows players to explore Night City and take on a variety of missions and side quests. The combat system is fast-paced and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and abilities to choose from. The story is also well-written and engaging, with plenty of twists and turns to keep players on their toes.Overall, I would say that Cyberpunk 2077 is a truly impressive game. The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen in a video game, and the gameplay and story are both incredibly well-done. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive and engaging open-world experience."

This one's about the gameplay.I was so hyped at the start of the game.  So much to look at, such a cool city to explore.  I loved The Witcher 3, and couldn't wait to see what CDPR had learned in the past five years.  Then I started playing the game, and felt my excitement slowly decay into frustration.  You start working for Guy X, that job goes wrong, so you start working with Guy Y, then you get a job with Guy Z, who needs you to talk with Girl X so that you can get Object Q from Guy R... I was immediately lost as to who any of these people were and why I should care about any of them.  Every mission I was like, ""Wait, what am I doing?  Who is this for?""  The game grabs you by the arm and yanks you along without giving you any time to get your bearings.  It piles mechanic after mechanic on top of you without giving you enough time to get the hang of them.  Combat is, somehow, *even less* interesting than The Witcher 3.  Basically your run-of-the-mill bullet sponge shooter a la Borderlands or Destiny with some awful tacked-on stealth mechanics.  My efforts to be a sneaky hacker have thus far proven completely futile--the most I've been able to do is get the drop on one or two enemies before I'm spotted and have to blast my way through 20 copy-pasted bullet sponges with no way to return to cover or avoid combat.As for CDPR's improvements on their formula, I was disappointed to find that many mechanics that should have died with The Witcher have made their unremarkable returns here--tedious crafting, an overabundance of meaningless loot clogging an already overcrowded HUD.  A character skill tree that requires reading a hundred different skills before deciding, ""I guess I'll go with the 10% damage increase upgrade"" or something equally statistical and uninteresting.  Hundreds of weapons that ultimately boil down to ""How much DPS does it have?""  Oh, and carry weight, as the cherry on top.Beyond the lackluster combat, the tedious and dated game mechanics, the world just feels uninteresting.  Don't get me wrong, it looks *amazing.*  But there isn't really anything to do other than the quests/content put there for you.  I remember playing GTA for countless hours without touching a quest, just driving around, or blowing things up, or getting into escalating stand-offs with the police.  I had a similar experience playing games like Fallout and Elder Scrolls.  I believe the hallmark of a truly great open world game is when it can create a world you can have fun just hanging out in.  I wasn't expecting Cyberpunk to be the next GTA/Skyrim, but I was expecting it to be a game you could have fun with just exploring around, getting into trouble... a game you could vibe to.  As of now, the setting merely feels like a backdrop for a bunch of story missions, nothing more.  Perhaps those story missions will get better, but as of now each one has been a variation on ""Spot the person who's going to screw you over,"" and I have a feeling that isn't about to change.As a huge fan of The Witcher 3, of the cyber punk aesthetic, and of open world games, 2077 feels like a huge miss."

I'll be discussing some very minor spoilers, but all of this was shown in trailers years ago, so I don't consider that an issue. Let me preface this by saying that player choice and ""roleplaying"" as a character are all over the place. Some quests are varied in their options, while others are extremely linear. Even still, there are some cases where picking the ""wrong"" dialogue option is very clearly discouraged, or throws the player into an unfavorable situation for picking something out of character. Otherwise, a lot of dialogue options are simply side-content that doesn't progress the quest at all. Further, the game throws you in without much explanation - Night City's backstory is shoved in your face a lot, but characters are given little time to develop. I felt insulted when one of the beginning characters was introduced by a ""Six months later..."" action-movie style cutscene.Aside from a lackluster plot (thus far), the game's world is pretty to look at, but quickly loses its shine. The repetitive spam of advertisements is delightfully cyberpunk, and indicative of the genre - but it quickly turns the game's background city into an indistinguishable mess that's hard to gather much of anything from. The advertisements often seem to grasp the hyper-sexual nature of the cyberpunk genre, but do little with it aside from showing off boobs. The sprawling metropolis begins to reveal its flaws very quickly, as NPC vehicles take turns unrealistically hard, clip through objects, and even run over other people. Crowds pop in and out of existence frequently, regardless of graphical settings.On that note, the game runs extremely poorly. I am aware that my hardware is far from the latest - i7 7700k with a GTX 1080 - but the game struggles to break even at 50 frames, with frequent dips into the 20-30 fps range, alongside microstuttering. If it were any other game, I would be more than happy to give this a pass - it's day 1. But even hardware that is far nicer than mine appears to be struggling in some cases, and after such an extended delay, I am disheartened to see so many graphical, visual, physical, and framerate-based bugs. Cutscenes will often freeze and stutter, objects will pop in-and-out despite the player standing right next to them. Textures will unload visually, and turning the camera rapidly causes considerable slowdown. Nearly every physics-based option in the game is broken in some way, and this can be noticed within moments. I pray that these issues are fixed with haste.This would be acceptable if there was much of a game underneath to enjoy, but there is unfortunately not much here. Driving is floaty, and feels more akin to the muscle cars of the 1960s. Granted, I am only driving ""low-tier cars,"" but cars not only handle poorly, they are often outright uncomfortable to drive, and hardly have any braking power. The roads feel awkward to drive on, and invisible walls are prevalent in places that the player is obviously not supposed to drive in - to the point that player vehicles are physically warped around at will.Gunplay is mediocre. I don't feel particularly strong one way or the other - guns feel fine, but being shot has little feedback. I will definitely compliment the weapon handling - while some weapon placement on the screen is awkward, the animations and sounds are pretty kickass across the board. By far the most annoying part of the game's combat loop is the hacking. I previously covered some issues with it, but I think the most fair assessment is instead to simply call it ""clunky."" It's inconsistent, ranging from annoying to overpowered, both in regards to enemy and player usage. Stealth is fairly standard, to the point that it almost feels like it borrows elements from every other stealth game. Hitman body hiding, Watch-Dogs style camera puzzles, and Assassin Creed/Far Cry style stealth takedowns consist of much of the stealth gameplay. I don't hold that against it, as all of those systems are quite good - but it doesn't do anything unique with it. That's fine.Melee combat is all over the place. Powerful enemies will teleport to the player and spam attacks that do damage even through the ""block"" function that the game provides for you, while lower enemies will stand still and wait for you to hit them. This inconsistency is indeed telegraphed in their levels (and within their quests), but the underlying melee combat system is clunky enough to put me off. I wasn't a fan of melee in the Fallout series, so perhaps it's just not for me in a game like this.Player customization is surface-level at best. While there are many expanded options for hair, teeth, and even eyes, the complete lack of a body sculpting system is incredibly noticeable. I don't necessarily need the ability to customize every single individual triangle of my character model, but the fact that my only two body options range between having a moderately-large pair breasts, none at all, or giving my character genitalia of some kind was greatly off-putting. Moreover, choosing the female option noticeably breaks several cutscenes, with player hands clipping through objects - from an animation standpoint, it is clear that they intended for most players to play as a male. Summarily, I went into Cyberpunk 2077 with extremely tempered expectations. I was not expecting the game of the century, nor was I even expecting the game of the year - but I at least expected it to be playable. As of the writing of this review, the game barely functions on a technical level, and it hardly holds up from a design standpoint otherwise. Save your money for when the game is patched and is on sale. Otherwise, skip it entirely."

I already pre-ordered the game since 2019 and i was so excited about it, and for one reason, it's The Witcher 3the best and greatest story game i ever played, i enjoyed each detail in itand till nowadays, I don't enjoy any story game as much as i did in The Witcher 3and that made me pre-order Cyberpunk directly without any concernsThis is due to my great confidence in this company because of what it has previously provided to us.i played cyberpunk since the first moment of its release , I play it about 100 hours and I almost finished everything in it.i enjoyed the story in many ways and i liked most of the charactersJohnny Silverhand, Rogue, Panam, Evelyn Parker, River, Judy, Takemura, Kerry, Padre, Viktor, And for sure, I don’t forget the closest to the heart, Jackie.Night City is a really beautiful city In terms of design and lighting, Everything about it is beautiful, and I have no objection to the story, the characters, or the city’s design.What bothered me deeply and I was surprised and shocked… The game's AI, stupid in a way you wouldn't expect!You feel like playing a 1999 game, not a 2020 game and here I am not talking about bugs or mistakes..I'm talking about artificial intelligence of people walking on the streetOr drive their car and stuff like this.Physics is also bad for a game that came out in 2020!You see things that make you laugh a lot, and you grieve at the same time that CD Projekt failed this way and dropped its reputation just like that.And for the open world…Didn’t feel actual activity or vitality inside the game, So there aren't many things you can doAnd I swear that GTA San Andreas had a lot more than this,It contains activity, vitality and energy more than cyberpunk 2077... like playing Billiards, Basketball, Mini-games, Slot Machine, Roulette, Wheel of Fortune, Video Poker, etc...The simplest thing, you cannot Customize anything on your car, and When you get into a car, police can’t chase you anymore.This is just simple things. I need a whole day to write about the negative things of the game and I will not even finish!But I don't deny that I enjoyed the main and side story.At the same time, I was very disappointed because I expected many, many more from this company, Especially after what I lived and saw in the world of the Witcher 3.I think it was bad idea to be hurry about release the game.At the same time, they were deeply mistaken for the hype they made about it, By saying that it will be the game of the century or the best open world game, etc.I hope that they will learn from their mistakes and not repeat them, Because I don't like to see this company go downhill for any reason.at the end i just want to sayThank you CD Projektand hope u get well soon"

Far from the next stage in the evolution of open world games, it's just one more for the pile.Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle, individual levels tied together with tarmac, masquerading as an open world.  If you're as tired of this formula as I am, Cyberpunk will do nothing to win you back.  I avoided as much of the hype surrounding this game as I could.  I went in with very little information, and I don't think my expectations were too high.  All I wanted was just a little something new, but I didn't find that here.  It feels like something made entirely from pieces of games I've already played before, both in its design and story.I knew nothing about the existing Cyberpunk franchise going in, and still don't. So many of its ideas have been explored elsewhere that it's unclear what this game gains from its source material. Despite being set in an anarcho-capitalist hellscape and partnering you with a left-wing extremist, this game is, paradoxically, not very political.  The main focus is instead on surviving this world rather than challenging it, which might be disappointing if you were expecting something deeper. There's still plenty of good story moments and characters, but this doesn't feel like an introduction to a rich world the way the Witcher games were, and it didn't leave me wanting more when it was over.My attitude towards side quests in general is that if they don't pique my interest, then I don't do them.  The game's method of trying to tease you into side questing through short text messages and phone calls usually meant there wasn't a lot of bait on the hook.  This, combined with the strong sense of urgency the main story constantly asks you to give it, resulted in me doing very few side quests over my 30 hour playtime.  This destined me to get the game's bad ending, and it felt like I was being punished for taking the main story seriously.  I've now heard positive things about the side quests, but the ending left me soured, and even though there's plenty left for me to do, I just don't feel like doing it anymore.  If I could change one thing about my playthrough, I wouldn't have given the main story so much attention.I played on the ""Hard"" difficulty and would describe the gameplay as looter-shooter-lite.  There's health bars and floating damage numbers, and your inventory is filled with guns, but it never gets too crazy number-wise.  Enemies get stronger at a gradual enough rate that you can hold onto a weapon for a really long time, and bullet sponges don't really exist outside of boss battles.  Character progression is handled through attribute and skill points, which are easy enough to fully grasp on a first playthrough, and intertwined in such a nice way that I didn't feel the urge to horde either of them.Item progression is gated by money and a stat called ""Street Cred"".  Street Cred only seems to exist to stop you from purchasing certain items until you've done the appropriate amount of grinding.  Money is hard to come by, and you won't get enough of it to buy some of the more interesting items if you stick too closely to the main story like I did.  There's a simple crafting system, and while the game showers you in crafting materials, it otherwise doesn't do much to convince you it's something you ought to be doing.My gameplay style was Stealth, which in this game is tied to the ""Cool"" attribute.  That might set certain expectations, however while encounters do feel like they appropriately accommodate for stealth gameplay, they don't feel like they're appropriately designed for it.  The options and challenges provided for stealth players are just too few and underwhelming.  Too often the game would set up scenarios that seemed to have no obvious stealth approach.  I'd observe the situation for a while and try to piece together a plan, but then wonder, ""maybe I can just walk around all of this and go in through a back door?"".  The back door strategy always works, but I never felt cool for using it.While a level might have multiple entrances, once inside your options for navigation tend to be limited.  Occasionally there'll be a locked door you can open if you've invested enough attribute points, but even these are surprisingly rare.  Security cameras should be an extra caution for stealth players, but they can always be disabled from a safe distance at no cost.  There's a non-lethal option, but it seems to exist only for role-playing.  The game won't reward you if you complete an objective without being seen or without killing.  There's a mechanic for hiding bodies, but it felt broken, and every ""body found"" alert I got felt like a bug.  Certain enemies might pose unique threats in combat, but outside combat they'll operate like plain enemies.  Nearly every enemy can be killed with a stealth takedown, and so from a stealth perspective they all feel the same, even the bosses.  The tutorial hints at special enemies that would break out of your stealth attacks, but I never encountered any of these in my 30 hours.Bosses are super aggressive and battles tend to start with you already in combat.  You wouldn't know by looking at them, but boss battles do allow for stealth.  A stealth kill on every boss plays out exactly the same way: run away until they lose aggro, sneak up from behind for a takedown, and repeat until dead.  The stealth boss kills are so disappointing and so poorly executed that playing this way feels more like an exploit than an intended strategy.For me, the Deus Ex games set the mark for stealth gameplay, and Cyberpunk misses that mark by a wide margin.  By the end of the game I'd transitioned away from stealth and into a long range sniper setup which I had a lot more fun using.  If I could change a second thing about my playthrough, I wouldn't have invested so heavily into stealth.I did encounter some obvious bugs, but none were so bad that I couldn't look past them. There's a lot of negativity surrounding this game, but I'm also seeing people who got a lot more out of it than I did, and I'm genuinely envious of them.  I'm left with the feeling that I just so happened to pick the worst possible way to play Cyberpunk, and that it deserves a second chance.  Cyberpunk didn't surprise me, but it still succeeded in holding my attention and keeping me entertained for 30 hours. It's probably hard to tell given how negative this review is, but I did enjoy Cyberpunk.  I just might have enjoyed it more 7 years ago."

Many people say ""it will be playable once bugs are fixed"". But the thing is, this game is just fundamentally not what everyone was expecting. Honestly, it's just a mess of broken game mechanics and poor design choices, I feel like they didn't test anything at all. I wish CDPR would've just stick to the idea of a full fledged RPG (which is exactly what everyone was excited for) and gave up going for a half-assed gta rip-off. They tried to kill two birds with one stone and failed in almost every way. But besides all this, I can see that some developers wanted to pour their heart and soul into making this game. In-game environments and art style are great, 3D artists did a great job, I also enjoyed some side characters' storylines, but there were only a few of them, I feel like there could be a lot more interesting stories like in The Witcher 3. I also liked shooting and reloading animations, I can see that they worked on it a lot to make it more satisfying, combat system in general had the potential as well, but it's broken, and skill trees are boring as hell and most of them don't even work. I feel like this game could've been decent if they didn't rush it and realized everything they originally planned. I think this game is beyond help unless they make some kind of miracle dlc or overhaul patch that will change it fundamentally.Update: They released the 1.5 patch, which added a bunch of nice things, a lot of quality of life improvements and things that should've been there since the release, like changing character's appearence, buying and customizing new appartments, crowds now react more lively to your actions, etc. Skill trees were completely reworked. Still kind of hopeless, because it's still the same game, people won't suddenly love it just because of those nice, yet rather insignificant things. Will people who were comparing it to Gangster Vegas be satisfied now that they added water splash effects? Probably yes. Will people who just wanted a good action RPG be satisfied? Definitely not. They might as well just reimagine the whole game and just leave the assets as they are, like I said, the graphics and just the way the game looks is pretty impressive, it's the gameplay and the whole game design that are screwed up."

No other game generated this much of hype, hate, love, disdain, and other emotions from a wide range of people, outlets, and journalists where it spawned numerous opinions that barely reflect the reality anymore. So where to start? It is safe to say that the single, biggest issue with Cyberpunk is that it was marketed and hyped up to biblical heights, comparable only to vaporware like Half Life 3. Living up to these unrealistic expectations were literally impossible and further fueled by false marketing promises on game features and content that never seen the light of day. Cyberpunk undoubtedly arrived in an unfinished and broken state with hundreds of bugs, glitches and glaring performance issues that are not in-line with the min/recommended specs. The game is virtually unplayable on last-gen consoles and low tier PCs even though it was marketed as such.This is where most reviews will stop and mention that “but, but but… Skyrim, Wither 3, No Mans Sky etc. was a buggy mess and I’m sure CDPR will fix the bugs in no time” and yes, that is probably true. CD Project RED is a 100% committed to fix the bugs and provide steady updates. I truly believe that over time this might be a new No Mans Sky scenario which is now widely accepted as gaming’s ultimate redeem act. However, there are glaring game design decisions, not bugs that will probably never be fixed especially after launch. It is financially unfeasible to redesign the game and implement what was originally the vision and marketed for years. Putting also in context the shacky 8 years of development with multiple redesigns and scope creep.The developers of this game had no clue what type of game they wanted to create. They liked the open world idea from the Witcher but wanted a linear story driven experience also, packed into a style of a first-person shooter. What ultimately resulted in Cyberpunk is now more of a story driven linear Looter-Shooter with RPG elements rather than a Next-gen RPG experience they originally advertised, falling short in every genera aspect, never able to fully deliver in any of it. The RPG aspect of the game is very limited, cut-back and ultimately unfulfilling for fans of the genera. You have very limited decisions with an on-rail storyline and most of your customizations you can do barely affect the outcome. Lifepath choices, a big advertisement point, is an ultimately disappointing feature that does not drive narrative or provide anything of value other than an additional voice line. Branching dialogue options are basic, strait forward and does not allow for any roleplaying whatsoever. Driving or walking through Night City gives the impression of a breathtaking, alive place which have never been seen before in video games. Pedestrians shopping at kiosks, cars passing by, managers arguing over the phone, police investigating a crime scene, local gang members taking a break etc. A beautiful, non-choreographed and immersive place to be in.But than you stop. You realize that NPC’s are lifeless, don’t do much at all, have no daily schedule like it was promised and unable to properly react to any player action. Night City is just a pretty, artificial bio-scenery that has no depth beyond its surface. AI pathfinding and car driving is abysmal. Nearly any action that sets of an NPC from their predetermined path will cause the AI to freeze up, freak out or to do some other weird immersion breaking action.Complete lack of Police AI wanted system, and chase mechanic with an unrealistic enemy spawn mechanic that lets police pop up in your field of vision. It is confirmed that there is no Police Ai pathfinding/driving mechanic developed so they left out the whole feature at launch resulting in the most ridiculous and utterly broken Police response. Even 2001 GTA3 had way better police and chasing system in this regard. This function is utterly broken and clearly taken out before launch as in 2019 they expressed in detail to the press of the complex mechanics of police response and even sort of bounty hunters (Max Tac) going after the player. There are hundreds of minor or significant quality of life issues, balance problems and missing features or cut content.Other than the main story or the side quest there is very little offered to enrich the experience and immersion. There are no minigames or side activities and you cannot really bond with your hard-earned NPC’s and love interest or do stuff together. There is 1 type of racing and 1 type of brawling and nothing else. Apartments are useless, with very limited things you can do in it. No decoration, customization or functionality that would want you to visit said apartment often. You also cannot purchase more desired flats, though you earn some basic ones throughout the story. Cars cannot be collected and displayed in a garage nor they cannot be customized, even though on the street you see several variants of different models. Entire parts of the city are blocked from the player and the metro/subway system (featured in the marketing demo) is completely cut. With all this said on what Cyberpunk Is not let me tell you what Cyberpunk really Is.  . The atmosphere completely sucks you in, wanting to spend just a bit more time with each session. The gigs and side quest are wonderfully hand-crafted and often charmingly bizarre. Characters are interesting, lovable and voice acted to perfection, Jackie, Judy, Panam, Jhonny, River and many more are memorable and well developed. It’s exceptional art design, graphics and mesmerizing scenery will make you awe and gaze in wonder at every step. The music is superb with a banger soundtrack that will crank up the mood of every situation. Gunplay and weapon design are well done and enjoyable. Even though the combat is very bullet spongy, easy to exploit with lackluster weapon customization, the guns are still relatively fun to use and do the job.The game undoubtedly is a buggy, unfinished mess with so much more that could have been added to enrich the experience, but still, I want to go back. I want to spend just 5 minutes more in this uniquely weird and bizarre world. Finish one more gig, explore the shoreline of Pacifica or walk in Kabuki market one last time.Unfortunately for the features that were promised, the lackluster character building, RPG options, lifeless NPCs and broken police, there really is no immediate and obvious fix and it is hard to see how CDPR would even have the means to address any of them. There is great value to be found here. An immersive world with a great story and memorable characters. However, the only way that you can enjoy it if you accept it’s shortcomings and limitations. If you have ceiling high expectations or think that this game is anything like GTA, Skyrim or The Witcher, then you will be disappointed. Cyberpunk is Cyberpunk, and it plays by its rules. I am not saying I don’t want this game to be different, to be more, but you have to understand that it just simply isn’t. And accept, hell, love it for that fact.  The glitches and bugs in the current state will often break the immersion and pull you out of this magnificent world, which is truly a shame. I would recommend waiting a few months, as stated before CD Project already expressed that they aim to fix everything and provide content DLC from Q1 2021.It is uncertain by great margin how all of this will affect the multiplayer portion. Until then, however there is another gig waiting for me in Night City."

I did not play at it's release, but there were plenty of reviews to give you sense of what the game was at that time.Now - At over 70+ hours, I literally only experienced one instance, very early in my play-through, that resulted in me needing to force and exit and reload a previous save in order to progress (V's link cable wasn't loading for the extraction point tutorial, thus wouldn't trigger the exit).  Following that hiccup, there was some occasional pop-in with traffic and pedestrians, with some questionably strategic vehicle pop-in during one chase mission, and quite a lot of NPC cloning in some areas.  However, *none* of those aspects were really enough to be outright distracting, or diminish the overall beauty of this game, and especially it's ability to tell an engaging story.  The story is somewhat knowingly in the style of Altered Carbon, as it relates to world building, and central characters behaving authentically to the environment and their background.   The *voice acting and motion capture, paired with some of the most impressive textures I've ever seen in a game, work well together to add authenticity to the minor and pivotal moments.  There are some unexpectedly heartfelt moments, especially when playing as a female V and pursuing a relationship with Judy, which results in one of my favorite moments in gaming - and a deliberate nod to Radiohead's Pyramid Song (and video).   (*Keanu Reeve's voice acting seems, at time's, slightly incompatible with the context of some scenes, but he's playing a pretty unlikable character, and anything off kilter about him smooths out as you progress to the final acts.  And even perhaps this is due to how the character 'exists' in the game, and how their personality develops throughout the players progression)The combat and controls feel tight, intuitive, and there are a wealth of perks to choose from such that there are few perks, and fewer talents containing those perks that don't feel worthy of spending your points on.  The compatibility between quickhacking and stealth can, at times, take the challenge away from opting for a combat centered approach.  Though, anything you can do to avoid the flatlining (death) screen is preferable in any event.        Again, looking beyond the micro and enjoying the macro, this world, and especially the level of detail that went into Night City is absolutely splendid.  They embellished a city that is advertising to it's consumers at every corner, whether it's hyper-sexual, or some massive hologram koi swimming above your head through a glass dome as you speed down the highway, daytime or nighttime Cyberpunk consistently delivers on the visual wow-factor. If you aren't compelled to focus on a game that didn't meet expectations on Day 1, it certainly comes very close now in it's current incarnation.  And *close*, for those of us not completely spoiled by expecting perfection, is still enough for this game to stand on it's own as a worthwhile bit of escapism.   I anticipate, with ongoing patches the user experience with only be further enriched.  As for now, it's plenty rich and plenty playable.  I'd love to see CD Projekt Red have enough of a reason to justify showing us more of this world.FYI -  I opted for Streetkid, played for the 'good ending' with the Aldecaldos support, and one of my favorite missions centered around Delamain the AI taxi company who had one alter that will sound very familiar from another popular franchise (about all I can say without getting into spoilers.)"

Cyberpunk 2077 is not the game we got promised but it is still decent after all- nothing more, nothing less. Keep in mind that most negative reviews address the bugs in the game. Me on the other hand experienced a mostly bug-free gameplay. The only bugs i had were mainly of the graphical sort like textures of characters not loading or pop-ins. Only once or twice they extented to a game-breaking level when i randomly got teleported 100ft away but like i said that just occured very rarily. Is this massively hyped action RPG as bad as the reviews suggest and does it manage to keep up with the expectations? Let's find out..The graphics are simply stunning and pure eye-candy. Night City looks gorgeous (Especially at night) and even the remote areas have their own charm. Speaking of beauty- the main character models look just like you'd imagine people living in a dystopian future look like. Hairstyles, make-up and cyberware are just spot-on and immersive. The carefully selected warm neon color themes distract you from all the corruption going on in Night City and arrouses the feeling of security. Random NPCs however, look bland and neglected- their textures can look painfully bad. Everyone has the same face, animation and reactions and i don't even want to mention how often i saw the same NPCs in the same area. Still i would say the graphics are the strongest feature of Cyberpunk 2077 and reason alone to purchase this game- if you like Cyberpunk themes. It's running pretty solidly on a GTX 1660Super + Ryzen 5 3600 with around 65-70fps on medium-high settings (1080p). In dense areas it occasionaly dropped to ~45fps but that did not break the deal for me. Assuming you want to buy Cyberpunk 2077 you have to be satisfied with a pretty average gameplay-style. Whilst there are cool futuristic looking guns- most of them feel pretty ordinary. There are a few exceptions though like Silverhand's revolver, which has one of the sickest  animations of all time. However, the vast majority (Shotguns, sniper rifles, pistols etc.) just feel clunky. Reloading feels like a pain sometimes because it does not keep up with the gameplay's pace during combat. In addition to that, melee fights do not even manage to feel one tiny bit better than Skyrim's melee system. Even The Elder Scrolls Oblivion had a more in-depth hand-to-hand combat system. The skills do not really add a lot of features and mainly serve the intention to make the game easier by simply improving your stats. Regarding vehicles; Even though the bikes and cars look and sound cool, they just feel unnatural. They make the impression that they're made out of cardboard because of their almost comical driving physics. I would not say that driving around isn't fun but still, better driving physics would have contributed to a more immersive feeling of Night City.Main story and side missions. This point is probably one of the most controversial among the reviews. Numorous amounts of reviews state that the stories in this game are repetitive and monotone. On the other hand some people quite enjoyed them. Why? It's probably because CDPR advertised this game with immense amounts of action trailers for the mainstream.  The reality is that action-packed gameplay scenes make up like 10% of the main story. V, the main character, is mostly occupied with dialogues and  there are tons of them  in this game. I  strongly disliked these parts- the ones where you can't do anything else besides standing in front or next to a person and listening to them talking. You get the expression that the story is finally  gaining up pace just to be interrupted by another scripted dialogue scene, which just messes up the overall flow of progression. I mostly skipped through unimportant conversations because they're mostly insanely slow-paced and keep in mind that the dialogue options you choose have little to no impact on the story. Boring. You can do better, CDPR.Sigh. Back when Cyberpunk 2077 was still in development we all expected the open-world to be filled with life. Unfortunaly that's not the case. As a game set in an alternate universe in the 2070s you'd expect a tremendous quantity of custimization options. The truth is: Night City feels lifeless in terms of activity. No barbers, no garages, no in-depth weapon customization except a few attachment options. During it's marketing campaing, CD Projekt Red fed us hungry fans with (pre-rendered) heart-pounding police pursuits. Turns out you can just get rid of the NCPD, Night City's police department, by just driving to the next block.  Voilà! You're a free citizen again. Apart from that, street races do not even remotely reach the expectations. All participating drivers just follow a scripted route with zero efforts to eliminate you. Compared to other AAA open-worlds like GTA5 or RDR2 it is dissatisfying and feels wrong. However, the soundtrack and overall sound-design are sensational. CDPR did a great job choosing fitting songs. In fact, the combat music is breathtaking. Make's you wanna never ever leave the fight again. In addition to that, Cyberpunk 2077 offers a generous amount of radio music (Mostly futuristic sounding genres like Synthpop.) As a lover of Synthwave/Synthpop i spent hours just driving around, free roaming this beautiful city with the radio volume on 100%.  The unskippable radio broadcasts in between the songs are kinda annoying though but you're able to just mute the car radio completely.One of the weakest aspects  of Cyberpunk 2077 is its stupidly braindead artificial intelligence. Every NPC, no matter if common thug or elite fighter owns the same combat AI and offer little variety. This A.I has a negative influence on stealth gameplay. Hostile NPCs fail to spot you even if you're in plain sight.  Besides that, they prove to be the most idiotic human beings i've ever witnessed in a game. They all play the same behavior patterns. Hold them at gunpoint- they all start doing the same animation. Notice a shooting, explosion etc- they just duck and do nothing else. You probably saw a lot of compilations and comparison to other games and we have to admit- the NPCs are just as stupid as they are in those videos. For the most part the voice acting in this futuristic RPG  is fine. CD Projekt Red did a pretty good job hiring high quality and experienced voice actors/ actresses. I played as female V voiced by Cherami Leigh, who is a talented voice actress mostly known for her participation in Animes. While i think she did a pretty good job i occasionaly  got the impression that she tried too hard to make V sound tough. Maybe it was intentional since V's a try-hard mercenary who is attempting to act unbreakable. Who knows! Same goes with the other characters. Sometimes i thought a child wrote the dialogues- words like “Biz“ sound way to cheesy for an otherwise rather serious storyline.   Cherami Leigh's  work and the voicing in general made a decent impression though.This review is obviously addressing the PC version, played on mostly Medium-High settings. Don't even bother playing it on last-gen consoles- it's horrible. I know from first hand experience. You might have noticed that i criticised lots of aspects but what makes me still recommend this game? I think the graphics and soundtrack really make up for its flaws. Some characters like Jackie really stick out and are fun to be around with. If you love dystopian settings- go ahead and purchase it. If you don't want to support CD Projekt Red for being liars and scrapping out tons of features- just don't buy this game and let people enjoy it. I could write an infinite rant about CDPR's marketing campaign but this review is just for the game itself. 5,5-6/10"

I have experienced very little in terms of performance issues, and only a handful of minor graphical bugs (tooltips not disappearing, npcs t-posing). I love this game. I am probably biased, as I have been waiting for this game for a long time and obsessed with the aesthetic, music, theme. I was going to play this game even if it sucked, but it doesn't. I can understand people being frustrated with the performance issues and bugs, but when those eventually get fixed I can imagine the general consensus of this game will sky-rocket. Night City is beautiful. I have never experienced a game with such amazing graphics. Even the base lighting (RTX off) is absolutely gorgeous, I find myself spending more and more time in the photomode trying to get my V to do the perfect pose for the area. I spent a lot of time just driving or riding through the city and enjoying the sights - it really is *sigh* breathtaking. The characters and world are so detailed, in terms of graphics and story. The side missions are fun, usually references to something, easter eggs, emotional, everything. You find yourself getting attached to characters and looking forward to seeing how their story plays out. I'm addicted to this game. Hours have sailed by and I'm loving every minute. I recommend this game, but wait until the fixes and performance is rock solid for the best experience."

However, the writing is there to keep you going. Dark, gritty, sometimes disturbing; the gameplay and storylines are reminiscent of two of my all-time faves, Fallout: New Vegas and Witcher 3. Some of the most compelling quests are random side quests, and that's one of the things that really makes Cyberpunk 2077 shine.Combat is alright, but there's nothing groundbreaking about the gunplay or melee. Driving is pretty bad, frankly, and I opted to fast travel a lot of places when I finished most of the side quests. Controls weren't terrible on the whole, though, and most things were relatively intuitive.  A few of the characters in the game really grow on you, and a few times, I even felt a bit of emotional anguish for them. I found myself increasingly immersed in the life of Night City--a city I immensely enjoyed exploring. CDPR did a solid job with the map, and there's plenty to do and see if you're of the mindset. Although the first ""act"" kind of drags, once you get through it and the map opens up, it becomes a real joy to play. The game was even enjoyable enough to play through all of the Nomad endings... The first of which made me ugly cry. Crying aside, I definitely got my money's worth; I didn't beat it until around the 80 hour mark. Cyberpunk 2077 is, in sum, an excellent game. I fully support players who wish to wait for the bugs to be ironed out, but for those who appreciate real RPGs, the bugs--most of which are graphical--are a minor, sometimes hilarious inconvenience."

But as you might imagine, it comes with some serious caveats as well.Pros:- Excellent main story, fantastic main characters. The main plot is really quite unique and it's a real blast. Some very nice concepts are talked about, without getting too heavy-handed in the 'hurr-durr technology bad' trope so common in sci-fi.- Gorgeous open world, absolutely TEEMING with beautiful locations, NPCs, places to explore. I haven't been this wowed by an open world setting in a long time (aesthetically, at least). It's quite fun to explore and find new places.- If you're willing to read all the shards, the world-building is actually pretty freaking amazing. Very detailed and authentic, and it really feels like Night City has a lot of history.- Pretty fun combat, movement (once you get the double jump), and driving is actually really fun (especially because the city is so beautiful). I can't remember the last time I fast-travelled in this game.- Well-written characters and dialogue. Doesn't feel like they're trying too hard.Cons:- The forced 'RPG-ness' in a clearly action-adventure game. The game forces sooooo much loot you can collect, EXP points, skill trees, etc. This game doesn't have deep combat/gameplay mechanics, and I really wish they gave much more limited loot and more rewards at the end of missions instead. This game tries to be an RPG. It is not an RPG.- NPC AI is hot garbage, the world doesn't react to your actions in a meaningful/convincing way. It's beautiful to explore but there's not so much to really DO. And most buildings are locked, which just makes the world feel less alive.- Gigs and most side-missions are just: receive instructions, go and kill some people/steal something, get out. There's zero variety, and most side missions don't have interesting stories to back them up like in the Witcher 3. You don't get invested in most side missions.- V HAS NO EFFECT ON THE WORLD. It's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ frustrating to get some interesting main or side missions with an actually engaging story, but I don't get to make any interesting choices that have any real consequence. It's clear that there were points when the devs had something more planned but had to scrap it due to time constraints. Very few actual 'choices' and those you do have are hardly consequential at all.- Surprise, surprise, bugs. Lots of them. Can't loot some items occasionally, weird animation glitches, etc. Not a big deal, but it does constantly remind you that you're playing a software authored by humans than a nice, seamless experience. It might seem like there's more cons here than pros, so what gives? Well, I felt I had to explain the cons in better detail, and it's also owing to the fact that this game just had so, so much potential. As it stands, this game would have actually been pretty well-received if it weren't for CDPR's aggressive marketing, but hey, what can you do. If you want a great open world to explore and an engaging main plot, plus a lot of slightly filler-y side content, this game is for you.FYI, the major bugs in the game have mostly been ironed out, so don't worry about that too much on PC."

If I can describe it with one word.8 years of hype to launch what looks like an Early Access game.It's glitchy, it's buggy, it doesn't run well unless you have an RTX card and DLSS enabled. And that's barely passable.But those can eventually be fixed. The core of the game, the massive open world, is incredibly superficial, with nothing to do in it. CDPR crafted a beautiful, detailed world, with braindead AI and overly simplistic gameplay. There's no roleplaying involved like you would find in Deus Ex. There's no extracurricular activities that doesn't involve shooting a bunch of bad guys like you would find in Red Dead Redemption 2. You won't find tight gunplay like you would see in Destiny 2.The AI completely lacks any sort of intelligence. Enemies rush you without the sense of self-preservation. Oftentimes standing there letting you blast them in the face. Cops spawn literally yards behind you without any chase, or any threat. Walk a block down and they completely forget you exist. No bounty on your head, no search and apprehend procedures. But stand next to them for 3 seconds and they'll shoot you on sight.Really, there's not much to do except shoot things. Guns feel impactful enough, if you use revolvers or tech weapons, and melee combat is passable. You can go for a stealth or hacking approach, but those don't feel as good as just pulling the trigger on some thugs. Hacking is just pointing your reticle at someone, and then make a selection from the menu. And depending on what you chose, sparks just fly out of their head. That's it.The story is engaging, yet forgettable. This is a cyberpunk setting, but it's in appearances only. There's all these talks about megacorporations taking over the world, but only one corporation takes center stage. There's no political intrigue, no conspiracy theory that actually turns out to be true, no investigation into a greater mystery. Keanu Reeves is literally taking your breath away and you go out to make sure that doesn't happen. Your personal backstory is forgettable. It's literally 20 mins long, and your entire introduction to Night City is a montage. CDPR failed the show, don't tell aspect. They could've squeezed in a few good hours of character development and worldbuilding with the opening hours. Instead, you get taken straight into Night City, told to care about certain things, and want to have this lofty ideal of becoming a living legend for some unknown reason. You don't have a story to tell, there's a story being told to you.The characters definitely carry the narrative, from Silverhand's personal vendetta, to Panam's sense of belonging, and Takemura's strong honor code.Regardless, I did enjoy this game. But there's so many glaring flaws that becomes hard to ignore.So it pains me to say, I do not recommend this game. The numerous technical issues make this equivalent to an Early Access title. But the gameplay loop, the promise of an immersive experience, a sandbox for you to get lost in are totally nonexistent. It's a beautiful world CDPR created, but it's just a glorified loading screen going from one mission marker to another.It's all style but no substance."

I'm gonna get into a lot of detes but to put it briefly, the game is in a good state now and is definitely worth playing. I recommend you wait for a discount, get it and experience it for yourself, there is much to enjoy here!Long review:The good:-Aesthetics - Do you like looking at those cyberpunk artworks of a rain-soaked metropolis, drowned in neon-light, as mile high skyscrapers engulf everything? Have you ever wanted to explore such a place, roam it's streets, drink in it's bars? Well, now you can. Personally I love cyberpunk aesthetics, which is why I was drawn to this game to begin with and I'm happy to say that CDPR killed it in the art department. Night City is beautiful, vast, varied and perfectly captures that vibe. The omnipresent advertising, appearance of the people, the conversations and news broadcasts you can overhear, all work to build a rich, living world that perfectly encapsulates the High-Tech/Low-Life dichotomy of cyberpunk culture. Any sci-fi fan needs to experience this game.-Visuals, Sound and Music - An obvious one, the game is drop dead gorgeous. The particle effects, lighting, reflections and amazing detail make the game very atmospheric, I often find myself just stopping to take in all the sights there are to behold. Sound is also amazing, all cars, guns and tech sound great and complement the visuals. The soundtrack is also absolutely amazing, both the original score and music commissioned specially for the game to fill it's diverse radio stations.  Everything works together to create a unique vibe.-Story and Characters - The story is linear, yes, but it's a good one nonetheless, exciting and engaging. The cast of characters is also varied, interesting and allow you to connect with them and their issues. It's no Witcher 3, let's be real, but it's a good story nonetheless. -Gameplay - Very fun in my opinion. Guns and melee weapons feel great. The ability to dodge also makes combat more dynamic and hacking adds an extra tactical layer to everything. Also there's a wide variety of play styles available and a lot of ways to approach missions, violence or stealth, diplomacy or force, you name it. You can truly tailor the experience to yourself. The driving is also serviceable.-Bugs - A vast vast majority have been fixed and as of writing this review CDPR are continuing support with new polish and content. The game is in a good state now, bugs will seldom get in the way of your quality experience. The enemy AI is a lot better than it used to be too.-YOU CAN PET THE CATS! TAKE THAT GTA V!!!The bad:-Bugs - Most of 'em have been ironed out...but not all of 'em. Some bugs keep popping up now and again but thankfully most of the game-breaking and more serious issues are gone and the remaining ones are more of an annoyance than anything else-Freedom of Choice - CDPR kinda shot themselves in the foot by overpromising so much. There is some freedom to your moral choices but this is a linear story not a branching one. You can't really be who you want to be, just slightly alter the existing experience to suit you better. You can't actually ""be anyone in Night City"".-Lies and False Promises - Not gonna get into the nitty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ here, you've heard this story before, if not, research it some more, it's everywhere. CDPR had no right releasing that bug-ridden unplayable turd that used to be this game. I refuse to believe that CDRP headquarters had some magical PS4 to test on where the game ran perfectly. They delayed repeatedly and released garbage on launch, so tough ♥♥♥♥ pre-orderers. Should've known better. Also a ton of stuff that was promised is not in the game and don't even get me started on the allegations of crunch times and toxic workplace culture. I can't make a judgement call there, but these things need to be acknowledged.-Shallow Open World - In terms of open world activities, there's not that much sadly. No usable public transport, no usable flying cars outside of cutscenes, life paths don't really make that big a difference, shallow customization (Penis 2, haha), there aren't many cool minigames to play or side activities to partake in (you can't even use the Pachinko machines that you see all the time!), etc.. It's sad to think that open world games that are more than a decade old now had more depth in this regard. It's even weirder considering CDPR themselves did it right with Witcher 3 already, so no idea what went wrong here. And if you think any comparison to other games is unfair, may I remind you that CDPR claimed in their advertising, that they have made the best open world game ever. They have themselves to blame if people compare their product to others and theirs falls short.Conclusion:Cyberpunk 2077 is a divisive game. However, looking at just the game itself now, I think it's a very enjoyable experience. It still has flaws but CDPR did the right thing by continuing to support and improve the game. It's not a No Man's Sky level redemption arc, but it's positive growth nonetheless and I am thankful. I am also thankful to all the talented artists, writers, musicians, voice actors, etc. that worked on this magnificent project and made it what it is, ♥♥♥♥ the corpo scum and their lies. Despite it's issues, I can't not like this game. It plays like an interactive Fear Factory album and captures the aesthetics and vibe of cyberpunk sci-fi artistry perfectly. I'm enjoying my stay in Night City and I think you will too. It's truly breathtaking!"

The game takes place in a stunningly detailed open-world city called Night City, and the level of detail and attention to detail is simply breathtaking. The game world feels alive and immersive, with fully realized characters and a deep lore that adds depth and nuance to the experience. The gameplay is also incredibly satisfying, with a wide range of weapons, abilities, and playstyles to choose from. Whether you want to take a stealthy approach or go in guns blazing, Cyberpunk 2077 has you covered.That being said, the game is not without its flaws. The game's launch was plagued with bugs and performance issues that made the game unplayable for some players. While many of these issues have since been resolved, some players may still encounter occasional bugs and glitches. Additionally, the game's story and writing can feel uneven at times, with some plot points and characters feeling underdeveloped. Despite these issues, however, Cyberpunk 2077 is an impressive achievement and a must-play for fans of open-world RPGs."

I waited 7 years since the first concept trailer, I didn’t mind the delays. I gladly would have waited till next year to play this in a better state, I recently went thru the carnage of the Dead Matter closed alpha release and as bad as that was, it was like giving the devs for that game more time and money and this is what they would come up with. I truly do love this game, the characters and the atmosphere. I was under the assumption that this would be a total dystopian rpg, I wanted a metal jaw and cyber arms, but all I get is a glowing tattoo and cool hands, oh well, at least I can change the size of V’s ♥♥♥♥. There is zero driving AI, the cops in game are clueless as well. Your choice of background matters ♥♥♥♥ all so far, accounts for about 15 minutes of gameplay then only dialogue choices. No public transportation like trains, as seen in trailers. I was sure to have limited exposure, I watched at most 2 trailers so I wouldn’t overhype myself, but it still let me down. 4/10 game, 12/10 marketing"

I planned on refunding before I played more then two hours, and I did refund it. But shortly after refunding it, I realized I did actually enjoy the game so I ended up buying it again as soon as steam gave me my money back. I don't regret doing that and I do really enjoy the game but this isn't a game I would recommend buying at full price like I did. This is a game where you wait for the 30 or 50 percent off sales.The story is okay. Would have been better if they focused more on the player character of V instead of Keanu Reeve's character which is just one of the most unlikable Mary sue characters in my opinion.The game play is fun, it isn't at all what they hyped it to be but it is fun. The Cyberware upgrades are lackluster as hell though, especially compared to any of the Deus Ex games.Anyone who is a RPG fan and thinking about picking this up, don't if that is your main reason. Fallout 4 is more of an RPG then this game will ever be. Speaking of Fallout 4, one of the main complaints I heard about that game is that dialogue choices never mattered in it, well dialogue choices in the FO4 matters a whole bunch more then dialogue choices in this game. Hell, CDProjekt Red even seems to drop the illusion of them mattering pretty early on in the game.I give this game a half hearted thumbs up. Pick it up on sale.Edit: With how messed up this latest patch made the cops super agro and broken I have to change my original position and say get it when it is 50 or 70 percent off now."

I heard about the hype and the trailers, etc., but I did not see them. So this means my play-through of this game was completely blind. I had none of the expectations I would have had if I viewed the demo. I waited 5 months after release to finally play it (it had been patched by then). Even I couldn't escape the bad press the game got at launch.It goes without saying the game still has bugs (like broken quests and NPCs), but aside from that, I got a pretty linear experience with the illusion that you had real choices. Most of the content that mattered had been pretty hard-coded to lead to a singular outcome.in the beginning the game starts strong, giving you a guided tour of what should've been to come, but then I realized that despite the several skill ""trees"" the game throws at you, that the combat is really bland. Your stats play some small convenient roles in specific moments of dialog. Beyond that, the combat is a rinse and repeat for every encounter. Worse if you put any sort of passion into netrunning, which quickly sees you bending most of the game's combat over your knee from the seat of your car.  (I'm serious) As the story progressed I was able to sense that ""crunch"" territory as certain plot devices faded away or were discarded completely in the middle of the game, rendering this an offline MMO shooter with repetitive encounters and quests. Many of my choices were just variables that never truly had an effect on the game world, or the outcome of the story. The best reference you could find regarding what the game should have been like at the very least is Fallout New Vegas, but it didn't even accomplish that.The game is still full of gamebreaking bugs (I got locked out of my favorite car until I beat the main story, certain quests made hard earned guns disappear, access was blocked to important NPCs, etc.).The game occasionally neglects to inform you of vital information regarding general gameplay and progression (Spent most of the game lacking certain upgrades and components).The AI is pretty stupid, failing even to match GTAV.Combat balance is lopsided and the NPC primarily only responds with general difficulty spikes at certain points.Car handling is spotty.The story takes a nose dive and side jobs become poorly written later on.The endings are all horrible.Yes I sank 200+ hours into the game and don't intend an hour more. With a relatively linear story, there of course is no replay value. If you can help it, save your money. The controversy surrounding this game's development and release is enough for me to believe CDPR is planning on abandoning it. There have only been a few patches since release, and many bugs still remain.As always this is just my take on the game, someone else could have a wildly different experience.... somehow.CDPR should've just released another Witcher 3 DLC instead. After this, I don't want to touch anything they've had their hands on."
214,22,A Silly Goose,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198411876733/,"1,044",51,0,176.9,"Posted: December 25, 2020",44,57,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/f646bf38c822399f3700239f8a5e57ecdc7b5208.jpg,"Apologies for the manifesto that's below.This is a tough one.I distinctly remember where I was when Cyberpunk 2077 was announced, all the way back in middle school. And now, it released just before I finished University. To put it simply, CP2077 has been a long time coming. It has been said countless times before, but I still feel like it's important to be seen: If you have been eating, breathing, drinking, sleeping about CP2077 and took everything CDPR has showed us as gospel, you WILL BE disappointed. If you thought this game was the return of Jesus Christ or the cure for cancer, or that it's release would somehow revert all the misery 2020 seems to infinitely produce, you WILL. BE. DISAPPOINTED. And unfortunately, that is your fault for thinking so. The game is, with some exceptions of course, a mile wide but an inch deep. It's also great, until it isn't. Allow me to explain that further. CP2077 tries INCREDIBLY hard to suck you into it's world, and 9 times out of 10 it truly works. In my play time, I have never been so sucked into a fictional world than CP2077. Characters like Jackie or Panam are incredibly fleshed out, their dialogue and scenes with your character are truly some of the best in the industry. In those scenes, i feel like I'm there talking to them, not V. But then, that 1 out of 10 times happen. Perhaps Jackie T-poses during an incredibly inopportune time. Or maybe Panam just decides to venture off to the shadow realm mid-conversation, leaving you talking to yourself. Maybe your car will turn into a submarine if you hit a lamp post and take you under the map at jusssst the right angle. It's these funny to game-breaking bugs and glitches that really take you out of the simulation that CDPR tried so hard at creating, making you remember that this is just a game. The map is gorgeous. That's undeniable. CDPR put a lot of detail into Night City and its surrounding locales. From the immaculate areas where the rich and corporations are situated to the industrial slums that surround it, all the way to the grimy oil fields and dirty badlands. However, it's just that. There is no depth to the map whatsoever. CDPR tired to counteract this with side missions, gigs, and mini missions dressed up as police dispatches. They even dressed up car purchases as missions to bloat up the map. I managed to complete every mission offered in the game, and I have no compelling reason to return to the game. Sadly, there are not a lot of open buildings you can explore. While the map size is generously large, the map itself is cut up and gerrymandered in such a way that the map size is more of an illusion. For example, the playable area of the district of Pacifica is only half of what the map implies. As for graphics, I have a modest rig with the exception of a 2080 and everything ran smoothly on high settings. I decided to leave the film grain option on, and while that may be a controversial move, I'm glad I kept it. seeing the grain interact with the night sky and the light pollution remind me of movies like Drive/heat/blade runner, or my old photos on my film camera. Perhaps it's nostalgia talking, but I thought it looked great. As for the story, I won't reveal much for the sake of people who wish not to be spoiled. The First Act is definitely the most polished, and I wish that it was stretched out. This is not to say that the rest of the plot is trash, but it is noticeable when CDPR heard feedback from some players say that the story for Witcher 3 was too long for them (which I think is crazy, but I digress), they scrambled to trim some fat. I also do wish that the missions that dictate your character (Nomad, Street, Corp) were longer or more important, as at the end of your first mission, V will be identical no matter what life path you chose for the rest of the game. The main Side Missions were all really well executed (most notably Panam, who i'd argue is the most fleshed out character after V and Silverhand). The dialog choices you are presented are more Fallout 4 than Deus Ex. The music was really well done! The original soundtrack was fantastic, the radio stations were good but could get repetitive. I for one really enjoyed the jazz station for a nice change of pace compared to the other stations that kinda blended into one in my opinion. Gameplay was fine. I used a controller for a majority of my playthrough and experienced little to no issues with input. Driving was passable, but only just. I swear that the brakes don't work as intended, as I have to brake a football field ahead of a turn. Gunplay was fine, more CoD than a typical RPG (which I'm not complaining about). ---- (The part where I actually say if you should buy the game or not) ----So, would I recommend the game? That's an incredibly tough question to answer. It's really all in the mindset of who is purchasing the game. If you are someone who had a calendar date for the game's release, bought merch, and complained that it got delayed multiple times, I would not purchase it. let's be honest here, you already DID buy it. If you were expecting this game to be such a technological marvel and game changer that Keanu Reeves himself comes out of your monitor and give you a huge kiss on the lips and tuck you into your bed every night, i would not purchase it. If you were someone who was interested in the game but didn't fall for the hype train, I would wait for this game to go on sale. You are not missing out on anything important. Personally, I bought this game because I had a Deus Ex itch that needed to be scratched. And it did! it has similarities to Deus Ex, but is also separate enough to be a somewhat fresh breath of air for me. If the Devs at Eidos are peeking around, the level design and story of Mankind Divided/Human Revolution and the control/combat of CP2077 would be fantastic. So if you're in the same boat as I was and craving some more JC or Adam Jensen action, this is the next best thing! But wait for a sale. If you want to purchase this game, at it's current state, I strongly advise you wait for a decent sale. Only if CDPR make some drastic improvements and quality of life would I recommend this game at full price. It's a shame, as I was excited to play the game, and while I did enjoy my playthrough, I was left with a hallow taste in my mouth. This game needed to have been delayed by a full year at minimum. I hope this was helpful."

Within moments of driving the car, the car swallowed some civilians made me do a barrel roll then get hunted by cops cause I guess I killed them lol.

Which, generally, is a bad thing. I don't like when I'm misled. But was I really? Did CD Projekt Red ever lie about Cyberpunk? I mean, everything that was shown in gameplay footage and media kits was there in the final product. Everything. And this Déjà vu was a lot more frequent than usual because it was still fresh in my memory and the main storyline is rather short, taking me 37 hours of gameplay, along with a couple side missions and gigs. I was counting the days to play Cyberpunk and got extremely pissed when CDPR announced the last delay, because I would probably have to stop my marathon half way through because of Christmas (wouldn't be home). I would have just 10 days to play it, how awful! Can't say I wasn't surprised when I sensed the inevitable approach of the ending, in just 3 or 4 days of intense gameplay. It felt way too short, all things considered, but it felt right. Short games usually leave a bunch of loose ends, this one didn't. Closure, at last.To sum it up, Cyberpunk could have been much better. It's not that it's bad, but there are so many aspects where they could put some more work in. Things that aren't even complicated or far fetched, generally common in open world games. Night City is massive, very alive, full of NPCs running their daily errands, cars rolling down the many virtual streets, countless high-rises, stores, night clubs, adult playgrounds, pubs, diners. So much yet so little, because there's absolutely nothing to do in the city itself. Wanna go bowling with your cousin? nah. Billiards, perhaps? nope. Poker? I'm afraid not. No side activities whatsoever, other than the ones tied to the main storyline and its hundreds of side missions and gigs. It's like Night City is just the background for the story, living no room for sandboxed experiences that we are so used to in open world games like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Watch Dogs, etc. Then again, I fully understand their reasoning. It's an RPG, which happens to have a living environment as the setting. But there's no denying it would be nice and make things a lot more interesting. The storyline and side missions can only go so far when it comes to retaining attention. I really didn't want it to be one of these games that you finish once and then to the hidden corner of the shelf it goes for the rest of its life.  Perhaps I just assumed that because CDPR made something so fantastic out of The Witcher 3, they would pull that off again and surprise us with something out of the ordinary. Turns out Cyberpunk is just ordinary.People complained The Witcher 3 was too long. CDPR then decided to not make the same mistake again and cut Cyberpunk short. Way too short for my taste, though. The part that mainly stuck out was the one year jump after the intro, showing that cutscene with brief bits of every job the character did in Night City after his arrival (I started as a Nomad). From zero to hero in a few seconds and you do absolutely nothing. Would it hurt to at least let us play through a bit of that struggle? That would have added an extra ten or so hours to the already very short main storyline. It's too fast paced. Not to mention that missions interlace which each other very weirdly, creating strange timelines. Let's say you are supposed to meet with someone in the morning, but instead you decide to meet someone else in the afternoon, and then one day later you meet with that first individual and it's like you never stood him up. I do know that it's a compromise they have to make, but at least make it a little less tied to time. How about ""call me when you wanna meet up"" or something rather than meet me tomorrow morning when that tomorrow morning could be literally any tomorrow morning. Breaks the immersion. And I won't even mention the times when you are on a mission and then you get a phone call to do something else, and V answers the phone call against your own will and suddenly the voice lines are overlapping each other and your character becomes a professional multitasker. Bet he would make a lot more eddies working at a telemarketing company of some sort. It's not game breaking, but it certainly ruins the experience. Even worse when it happens during critical conversations that could interfere with the direction your story is taking.Then again, it's their first go on something of that magnitude. It's not easy to build a new graphics engine from scratch, a massive city on top of that, then slap a decent story, character development, all the bells and whistles that gamers enjoy. It's a very hard job and there's a lot of pressure from the corporate (Mr. Silverhand hates them for a reason), media and the general public. They've raised the bar pretty high with The Witcher 3, and people couldn't expect no less from Cyberpunk 2077. And a high bar means making compromises, to avoid biting more than one could chew. It's a rather minimalist game, considering what it could have been. People think too highly of CDPR, and having the public opinion at your side is a double-edged sword: it's all games and fun when things are going great, but oh boy, run to the hills when things go south, ever so slightly.Cyberpunk is not what we imagined it would be. It has its quirks, bunch of positives like the good storyline, insanely great character development, visuals (the graphics are mind-blowing, and so are the frame drops with RTX on), flawless voice acting, KEANU REEVES, good gameplay mechanics (shooting is so much fun, with M&KB and controller), beautiful environment (one of the most impressive virtual cities I've ever seen). The negatives were all thoroughly described above, with the exception of the performance because it is certainly being worked on by CDPR as I write this review. Masterpiece? nope. GOTY? unlikely. But it's a good game, in its own right. Once one understands that the Cyberpunk we have at home is not the Cyberpunk that we imagined, I fully believe that it's possible to come to terms with it and enjoy the game as it is. A flawed, yet enjoyable, experience. Now, if you excuse me, I have a city to burn (again, for the sake of getting each and every achievement)."

A man who, having completed an unsuccessful order, received a construct of Johnny Silverhand (who is Johnny Wick) in his brain. Throughout the game, together we will try to share our brain with the construct for the sake of survival.The game has several endings, which are good in their own way.In addition to the main story, there are a number of additional missions. Some of them are not very interesting, but there are plot stories that are worthy of attention and are very well written.The gameplay of the game corresponds to its genre. This is an action shooter in an open world. Enough not bad shooting and the possibility of hacking. I didn’t really like driving, it’s kind of sluggish, but riding motorcycles is not bad, I always rode them. Viewing the braindances is a very interesting feature and in the story missions it goes very well.The game has quite colorful graphics in cyberpunk style. A lot of bright lights, big futuristic buildings, everything is very large and beautiful. Lots of different details on the street and in the buildings. Maybe not everything here is cool and correct, but this can be forgiven.I liked the game, good story, not bad NPCs, good graphics and gameplay. I did not see a lot of bugs, there were no freezes, crashes, loss of saves and other things. Right now I advise everyone to go through the game, who did not go through it or tried to go through on release. Now is the best time."

I tried so hard CDPR. I really did, but this game is not good. First off, lets get the glitches out of the way. This game has way too many of them and even after multiple patches I run into them frequently. Things like not being able to pickup items that you should be able to, cars randomly spawned floating in the air, or the all famous police spawn where they spawn behind you outta nowhere and shoot you. It breaks the immersion, which is a shame, because Night City is beautiful.Secondly, lets talk about what's good in this game. The scenery, the characters, the story, and quite a lot of the side missions are great. The music is amazing. Sometimes i'd just drive around to listen to that PONPON song (you know the one).Third, lets talk about what ISNT good. Oh boy. Here we go:-Going back to the side mission thing, id say its a 50/50 split here. The other 50? B.O.R.I.N.G. These side gigs feel like fetch quests or some really basic ass concept. Go kill this guy. Loot. Sell. Go steal this thing. Loot. Sell. Gig complete, nice job V! Its cool at first, but the tedium sets in quick. Even using the main story as a ""break"" from the side quests its very easy to get burnt out.-The combat. Im sorry. I tried many different builds. But they all revolved around one thing mainly - passives, and you know what passive are? Non-engaging. Your katanas bleed enemies, ohp now they restore health when you bleed enemies. Your tech guns charge up more, ohp now they can be held when fully charged instead of firing off. This does not change combat in any meaningful manner. As such, you will find yourself using the same strategies until you have effectively bored yourself to death. You don't suddenly get new combos to pull off flashy moves. You just increase attack speed, etc. Netrunners probably have it the worst, as hacking becomes OP very quickly and youll be itching for a fight when you're clearing an entire camp before setting foot into it. Melee builds are a close second though. At least ranged builds can change their weapons when they get bored.-Balancing. Dear lord does this one anger me. I need anyone reading this to know something, armor effectively does almost nothing meaningful besides reduce damage A LITTLE BIT. This does not matter if most enemies are downing you in a couple shots anyways. Very Hard mode, if you get the burn debuff on you its pretty much GG, time to quickload. Spamming inhalers on a body build can sometimes not even keep up. Then, all of a sudden ENTER CYBERWARE. Grab legendary Sandevision for a not too high cost and guess what? Everything is now effectively your ♥♥♥♥♥. Whole building full of enemies? Hah. good luck when I can slow time for 16 seconds and one shot everything. Double jump, mantis blades, etc. I found the power balance all over the place.-AI. There are so many memes about this its pretty great, but not when your someone who wanted to actually like the game. Guy in a wheelchair? Punch him and watch your miracle fists cure him. Park your car in the street? Watch as you cause every car in the area to come to a halt. Save someone from a mugging? Watch them cower in fear and say nothing nor reward you with anything. You see the point. Immersion breaking.-Crafting. I know the techies here are waiting to jump down my throat about how awesome crafting is and how im missing out. But thats just it, my first build was tech. Even then I didnt craft much. Why? Because a rare recipe requires epic ingredients, an epic recipe requires legendary ingredients. It makes crafting a non-sustainable venture with very little pay off since there is SO MUCH LOOT you will never want for anything. I never got to a point even on Very Hard mode where I felt like crafting was necessary or even worth my time. Never. It CAN be good, but the time investment vs, payoff is atrocious. A melee build simple walks in with their katana, activates Beserk or Sandevision and clears the whole camp in seconds. A techie does something similar but using their superior weaponry to kill enemies fast/shoot through walls. But theres the thing....you had to spend the time to craft and optimize your stuff just to be at the point where you could do what a melee build does with a godamn common rarity katana and a sandevision. Thats stupid and not balanced.-Customization. This has to be one of if not my biggest gripe. Guys, how in the world did you make this game and then not add the option to change your look or hair IN A SETTING WHERE THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT PEOPLE DO ALL THE TIME. It's baffling. Want to know the kicker? You'll feel compelled to wear new pieces of armor for the better armor rating only to end up with some horrible looking mismatched outfit only to findout the armor doesn't do much as a stat anyways. Hats? Hahaha. They were so lazy, they couldnt get hats to work with any long hairstyle. Instead, your hair *changes* when you change hats. Not even in the same realm as what your original hairstyle is. Have a curly manbun? Watch at that baseball cap magically straightens your hair and makes it lower then shoulder length. It'll still clip through a bit too. In a game about never being satisfied with your body, always seeking the new ""chrome"" and the new look, the customization is woefully sparse. For reference, GTA 5 has FAR FAR FAR more customization options then Cyberpunk. Overall, I think the game appeals to certain people but if you are looking for compelling gameplay you better look elsewhere. When combat is 90% of what you do, and it is boring, the strong story, setting and characters just can't pickup the slack. The lack of customization will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth and the constant immersion breaking AI or bugs will annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. You will likely burnout on this game.If you do get it, I advise you to focus on completing the main story and picking a non-melee centered build so you can try out all the guns. Do not try to do every assualt, crime, or side gig. Just do them as they appear in your path and don't go out of your way. Once you complete the game, maybe go back and try to do everything but recognize you will likely not as the gameplay will not keep you hooked long enough."

Instead it turned out to be an amazing open world game, with a large game world, lots of variety, an most of all, a great story full of amazing NPC’s you learn to love….or hate.        Especially the world building got me hooked, it feels all so organic and natural and not just like another future Sci-Fi Metropolis. Night City feels alive, something is happening everywhere. May it be the usual traffic/NPC’s on their way around the city (which also changes with the time of day), to little shops on the site of the street or markets between the Skyscraper gorges, NPC’s talking to each other and and and. CDPR did a fantastic job there, Night City gives you a great feeling of being at a real place.     I, of course, don’t want to spoil anything story wise and I’m not done with the Main Story Quest(s) but so far, I really enjoy it, it's well paced, the Character design of the people you meet is great and they are diverse, you feel for them and slowly can understand them and what drives them, how you react to that is obviously on you.    Even the side missions are worth doing besides their rewards, many tell their own little interesting stories or even develop into entire quest chains.  I don’t want to do a deep dive on the skill system but there is enough freedom to play as you like, from not killing anyone and being sneaky. Over solving most issues with hacking to be a full melee Rambo that hacks their enemies into pieces with heavy weapons and Melee weapons. And yes, BUGS there are still a ton of them on the game, from rather annoying to very obnoxious at times. I thankfully only got one where I got stuck, and it forced me to complete a mission in another manner than I wanted to. But then all went fine. But every other one I encountered was easily solved, with saving, going to the main menu and loading back in.  But even with the bugs, on which CDPR is hard working to fix from how it looks. The overall experience is just too good to pass on."

I bought this game a week after launch and have played it off and on ever since. The bugs are ever a minor problem at worst and Bethesda level comedy at best. For anyone who avoided or avoids this game for the bugs, the bugs are not the issue with this game, it is the core of the game itself. Put simply, this game is not an RPG and at most has very light and minor RPG elements, including and limited to: Basic starting character appearance customization; One of three starting character paths that effect only the beginning of the game not the main story or who your character actually is; Five core attributes that can be increased through level ups along with different perk ""Trees;"" One of five endings that you get to choose right before the game ends, nothing done throughout the story effects any ending you pick not even what stats you have; ""Branching"" dialogue in which every conversation choice has the Fallout 4 problem of all being basically the same option with the same outcome. Nearly all of these features are found in good RPGs except that they are not limited to such a degree as they are in cyberpunk. In actual RPGs character choice and build matters to the core of the game and not on such a surface level as this, not to mention being able to actually choose who and what your character is. For a game based on a tabletop RPG that already contained plenty to work off of from roles(character classes that provide unique abilities, all missing), lifepath(repurposed into the limited starting 3 role choices in character creation), and character stats(2077 uses 5 basic stats found in nearly any basic game possessing character stats, the tabletop RPG possesses 9 unique stats most of which could have easily been workshopped into this game), the most Cyberpunk 2077 does with what already exists is with its setting. The ONLY two things that are praise worthy for this game are its (badly optimized) visuals and the expansive map, an absolute megastructure of a city with countless areas to explore, just don't expect for the game to lead you to those interesting explorable places.Conclusion: Cyberpunk 2077 is to RPGs what DOOM is to the field of literature, DOOM is not a very good book, in fact it's not a book at all. The store page and tags for this game are a lie. This game is NOT an RPG and at most is a character action game straight out of Ubisoft's nightmares. It can be fun and enjoyable but only if you understand what you're in for, which is not an RPG experience. AND GOD THE DRIVING IS SO BADEdit: Thanks for the responses and interaction from everyone, especially those who actually read the review and know that the bugs and performance weren't an issue for me. Weren't, past tense. The day before the next gen 1.5 update my game ran perfectly fine but as of now it's practically unplayable. Due to this update my game performance has been completely ruined. The game will run fine for maybe a minute or two but after this brief lull the frame rate completely crashes, making the game totally unplayable. Props to CDPR for at least trying to implement features that should have been in the game from the start but if those implementations completely kill game performance that issue needs to be fixed before being released. (And for anyone who wants to say this might be because of mods, I've not modded Cyberpunk once)"

It has vast and beautiful open world, with a lot of side missions to do. The storyline is decent, and some of the characters are memorable, especially Johnny Silverhand played by Keanu Reeves.However, this game is far from being exceptional, and a far cry from what it was promised to be. Night City might be big and open, but there aren't many accessible buildings. The side missions are often repetitive, and provide no satisfaction. The only reason why I was doing them, what btw took me around 50 hours out of my 76 hours gameplay, was to make my character more powerful. However, at the end, there's no reward for that. There are no unique side mission boss fights, where your high level and good weapons could come in handy. Tbh there are not that many main storyline unique boss fights either - only two. You just do side missions for the sake of doing them. The looting system doesn't seem rewarding either. There are no unique weapons or items, same set of guns with a little bit tweaked stats. Money system is a joke. Side missions often include killing a bunch of people. After such quest you'd think that you're set for life, right? Not really, you only get around 4000 E$ for such mission. Luxury cars cost above 100k E$. I've also seen guns which were like 300k+. So you need to complete around 25-30 side missions, during which you most likely will kill hundreds of people, in order to afford a luxury car. Besides cars, guns and some body modifications, you can't do much with your money. There's no property to buy, no apartment, no business, no side activities (besides sexual encounters with prostitues which always have the same cutscene).AI in this game is a joke. Police officers can't chase you in cars, so you can drive away for around 200 metres and your wanted level disappear. There's no single mission after which you have to escape the police. Enemies are really stupid. The difference between low difficulty and high difficulty is whether they can one shot you out of nowhere and how many bullets can they swallow before they die. And on the very high level they can swallow a bunch, let me tell you that. For some reason, assault rifles in 2077 have only 20-25 bullets in their clips. At the beginning, in order to kill one regular opponent, it takes roughly about 2 clips. Moreover, despite being able to carry 30 pistols, 10 jackets, 20 pairs of boots, 15 kevlars, your character can only carry 500 bullets for assault rifles and 100 bullets for shotguns. What's the point in finding bullets if you can't keep them? Also, enemies despite shooting you endlessly, they rarely drop bullets, so you often find yourself in a situation where you have no ammo for your guns, and you can't find any even though you just killed 20 people with guns. Obviously, a way to avoid that is to equip yourself with bullets before the mission, but that's really tedious.The storyline although being captivating, it's extremely simple. It's basically about getting relic chip and then getting rid of it. Branching storyline is a lie, 98% choices you make have to effect on the game whatsoever. The dialogue options give you illusion of choice, but at the end it doesn't really matter what choice you made. Three fractions which you choose at the beginning of the game is yet another lie. The only difference between starting as nomad, corpo and streetkid is the very first mission, and some meaningless dialogue options later on. Doesn't matter which fraction you choose, you always end up playing as a street kid. The main character has no substance, no real goal or agenda, he just copies other people's goals. The list goes on and on - no trauma team, bad physics, lack of many details etc. Obviously, there are many bugs as well, but it'd me take hours to list all of them. Honestly, even if the bugs get fixed, there are so many things wrong with this game. In conclusion though - is it a bad game? Not necessarily. The bar in the game industry is lowered by companies such as Ubisoft or EA Games. Cyberpunk devoured around 300 million dollars in production, but at the end of the day, customers pay for it as much as they pay for another Need for Speed or another Far Cry. People got used to the idea that not every game has to be up to par with such titles as Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption. I don't regret buying Cyberpunk, since I had a lot of fun with it. However, it's a shame that the game that supposed to be the game of century, turned out to be such a sham. I believe if all of the promises, the developer made during their marketing campaign, were fulfilled, this really could be a game of this century. However, money got the best of CD Project Red."

This updated version of the game itself should be the one was released year ago. One year wasted to fix it. Can't imagine what could they've been accomplished during that time. How many DLCs could've been released? But no. Their ego and ""money hungry"" kicked in and they disrespected all the immense effort their innocent team put while making Cyberpunk 2077.Game is good. Solid Cyberpunk experience. Characters are cool. World is alive. Tons of side missions, many of them are so unique, i would like to congragulate the person responsible for the creation of them. Missions introduce us many original characters which all are fun to do stuff with. Main story could've been better and those endings were ""meeh"" at best. Graphics are great. Event with the AMD FSR i haven't seen a huge loss of quality compared to the FPS gain. I wish i had a powerful GPU can set Ultra-Psycho at 1440p and play but sometimes you just gotta be content with what you have. RX590 still rocks.I played C77 after ""Outer Worlds"". Which was a dialogue heavy RPG game. So compared to it, dialogue options are not good. But yet, still OK. You kinda hope for more detailed variety of options but as i said, they released it so early and unfinished, they couldn't have the time of polishing it.Gameplay wise, a Katana-Samurai build was my decision. Close combat, chopping arms and heads like a butter. It was so fun and enganing to play. But again, why there is no reset attributes option, (there was a perk one only). 70+ hours with the same build could be boring sometimes. I'm a type of player who likes to try new builds, weapons, gameplay types... I was in between deciding whether to play ""Netrunner"" or ""Katana"" before the game. Now i need to spend another 70 hours to see the how Netrunner build works? For the game i almost 100 percent completed? Naah. Nope. Bad call CDPR. Musical theme of C77 fits the worlds. Nothing mind-blowing but OK. Some decent songs there. Effects are nice.Variety of items, cars, houses, upgrade options, armors, weapons are so detailed and so plentiful, i can say it's one of the strong sides of C77. Gives you the options of approaching enemies in many ways. Smart weapons that can target automatically, revolvers and sniper rifles that can one shot heads, shotguns can knock cars down... Mantis blades.... Cyberwares to upgrade your body and the most importanly... ""Fashion"". Yes! As a fan of Fashion Souls genre, i love to dress up nicely. Collecting armors and clothes that fit my build is one of the many things i enjoy playing RPG or Soulslike games. And again. Cyberpunk does the trick. Perfectly.So. The BUGS. I think this game had 5-6 huge updates to make it playable at least. And i can say after the 1.5 update, game itself is very playable. The bugs and glitches i faced were nothing unsolvable.- 2 times my characters and world goes pitch black. Solved it by returning to last WHQL AMD driver.- Few times missions stuck. But quick load to another save solved it.- 2-3 times NPCs stopped talking but subtitle didn't. - One time my car exploded for no reason.- And few crashes at start by skipping intro so fast. Just wait a little before pressing the button.I mean for a game that was totally unplayable before, these can be seen as a small bugs. To consider I'm on Windows 11, another buggy software, i think i can easily say game runs fine.C77 is now at the ""ZERO state"". It was like minus 100 before. So i hope CDPR team can keep work on it to add more content while solving those little bugs and performance issues left.My last words, I feel really sorry that huge potential of the game and many people's efforts wasted with bad call of a early launch. This is a solid, enjoyable game and i recommend people playing it.Side note: Turkish subtitles are so localized and on point. Loved it. Many thanks."

Please read this and don't make the mistake I made.This review isn't about technical issues -- the game runs great on my PC. No crashes. I've only seen a few instances of clipping. This review also isn't about the undeveloped (nonexistent) driving AI. This isn't about the flawed stealth gameplay or the spongey enemies that absorb clip after clip of ammunition. I honestly can overlook those issues.This game is DEFINITELY NOT an RPG. I didn't follow the development of this game as closely as others. Apparently, they changed the marketing in the 11th hour and this game is now officially considered an Action/Adventure game. Dialogue options are severely limited, character customization is nonexistent, vehicle customization is nonexistent, the prologue/backstory options are SO rushed and (so far) mean nothing. My biggest issue is that there's no sense of natural progression. Think of how any great RPG starts: you begin as a prisoner in a jail cell; you take your first blind steps out of the vault; your crew abandons you and you're forced to strike out on your own. In other words, you start with nothing and you're forced to (re)build your life. You build connections with people and places slowly. You begin to understand the world and you put the pieces together. Cyberpunk couldn't be more disappointing in this regard. I chose the Nomad start because I wanted to approach the city from the outside. I hope this isn't a spoiler -- it's something I would want to know before buying this game -- but there's a montage about 25 minutes into the game that just flat-out shows V developing a relationship with another key character. This montage transports you from the desert to the heart of the city. It sets you up with a place to live and a core group of people to interact with. It establishes you. Why? That's why I'm playing the game -- I want to do all that stuff myself! Also, after you finish Act 1 and the Interlude, side quests just fly at you from out of nowhere. I couldn't understand why all these random cops, corpos, and gang leaders trust me and are trying to give me jobs when my Streetcred is so low. You are constantly bombarded with text messages and phone calls from people who should want nothing to do with you. Again, there's no sense of progression. The game fast-forwards you through the most meaningful part of an RPG and then makes SO MUCH available to you without having to earn it through gameplay and character development.On top of all of this the main quest is SO URGENT. If I'm actually trying to roleplay as V then the only quests I would complete are the main quests. This is an issue that plagues many RPGs, but Cyberpunk might be the worst case of it. I'm not one of the ultra-hyped and ultra-disappointed people who are devastated by the state of this game. I'm certainly dissappointed, but mostly I just want RPG lovers to know that this game is so far off the mark. Play it as a scripted Action/Adventure game and you might enjoy it."

On one hand the gameplay (combat, npc behavior, collision, etc), feels unfinished and just generally lacks that level of polish that you'd expect from a AAA game. It's obvious to me that this is the weakest part of the game and I'd give it a 5.5/10. It's not awful, but it's not incredible. On the other hand the world design (graphics, map design, music, ambiance, etc) are on an entirely different level from other AAA games. I'd give it a 9/10 which is a number I'd never give any other game as far as world design goes. If you like getting immersed in your games and like the cyberpunk aesthetic you absolutely NEED to play this game. As far as how I ""feel"" the game should be rated I think it deserves a 7/10, absolutely incredible in some ways, disappointing in others.The game may not have lived up to the hype, and certainly didn't come out in a state that I found acceptable, but the foundation is extremely solid. If you are someone like me that find immersion in video games to be very important, this game has it in spades and I'd argue does it far better than just about any other game out there. The world building in this game is insane. I've never played a game before where I was more interested in exploring the city than I was playing the game itself. I've never seen such a beautiful and detailed city before. It's very apparent while playing this game that the devs have spent a ludicrous amount of time making the city feel as lived in and as believable as possible. In my time playing this game I developed memories I don't think I'll ever forget, which I can't say for most other games I've played. It just gives off a specific vibe that is not easily put into words. At times it really felt like I had escaped my life and become someone actually living in Night City. The music, the graphics, the characters, the ambiance, the story, and all the tiny details and hidden spots across the entire map. I wouldn't recommend this game to people at full price but if you like the cyberpunk aesthetic and like getting immersed you owe it to yourself to play this game. I can honestly say this game holds a corner of my heart that no other game that I've ever played has occupied. I can only imagine the kind of masterpiece we'd have on our hands had it stayed in the oven for a while longer."

Unfortunately, it's not. After 8 years of hype, 3 delays, and 64,348 promises, Cyberpunk 2077 was released on December 10, 2020. Set in Night City, in a dystopian future, you play as V, a mercenary trying to find the Relic to everlasting life. The story actually has nothing to do with everlasting life, but that's how it was advertised. Anyway, here's the review.We'll start with the setting. Night City is stellar. It's lit up and actually looks like something you would expect from a Cyberpunk genre game. There's all sorts of things happening around every corner, from gang shootouts, to random guys on the side of the street playing guitar for money, to medic units tending to people. The world has a sort of intrigue about it that isn't matched with other open world games. Night City is very dense and vertical. There's constantly some kind of crime that needs solved or some random quest to be done, that range from funny Easter Eggs to full blown story lines. Being in Night City and admiring the detail that went in to crafting the world is really one of the high points of Cyberpunk. The role-playing elements of Cyberpunk 2077 are present, but not to the same degree as CDPR's Witcher 3. A lot of illusion of choice is implemented. The life paths advertised over the last few years amount to nothing more than a 30 minute intro of dialogue that gives you a few dialogue choices to use later in game to give you an advantage. What's upsetting about it, is that the life paths actually start off really good, and they're all so different from one another, but to have them end so abruptly was really a disappointment. Clothes are strictly based on stats, so you'll either play 'Style over Substance' or 'Substance over Style'. Doesn't make much sense when a hazmat suit has more armour protection then actual combat armour. So yeah, no transmog apparel options here. In a game that emphasizes how important looks are, it would have been nice to be able to get a haircut or a new earring. However, missions can be approached in several different ways, as advertised. Guns blazing? Sure, go for it. Wanna throw poison knives at enemies from a distance? That's fine too. Not to say choices aren't present, because they are. There's not just as many as you would expect from this particular game. The gameplay in Cyberpunk is completely busted, and that's mostly excluding bugs. With bugs, it takes over New Vegas as the king of busted ass games. The gunplay is good. It's tight, it's fun, and it feels good to use as a whole. The melee combat, not so much. It's floaty, and in general, melee in first person rarely works out well anyways. Driving in high populated areas is almost impossible to do. The mini map is so small, it's infuriating when trying to judge a turn, so get ready to wreck. A lot. For driving, I recommend driving motorcycles. The bugs are everywhere. This game is literally a cockroach infestation of bugs and glitches. NPC's take cover for absolutely no reason, they'll stare at you when you pull a gun on them, the AI for driving (and pretty much everything else) is non existent, textures won't render properly, cars randomly get launched in the air, sometimes the radio stops working, and sometimes V stops working. There'll be times when you get into a car, go to accelerate, and V steps out. For no reason. And don't get me started on the cops. The AI system of the police are the worst I've ever seen in a video game. If you commit a crime, 5 cops will spawn on your ass and wreck you. And all you have to do to get away, is get in your car and drive down the road. 2001's Grand Theft Auto III had a better police system. That was 20 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years ago. Lastly, there's missing content all over. No bribery system within the police, 2 police chases in the whole game (and they were scripted), no train station, no way for V to have multiple apartments, and as mentioned before, the life paths are meaningless. And the sad thing about this, is that for as good of a setting as Night City is, these bugs rip you completely out of any immersion that you might experience. But despite all of that, when Cyberpunk works, it's fun. A blast really.The graphics in Cyberpunk are solid if you're able to max them out. It really shines in the neon lit areas with water reflections and ray tracing. But most people can't run the game at its highest potential without sacrificing a decent amount of frames. The saving grace for Cyberpunk 2077 is the stories it tells and the characters you meet. The main story is great, but in this rare instance, the side quests and random encounters and stories you'll find in Night City are better. I didn't meet a single character who felt out of place or wasn't intriguing in some way. CDPR really nailed the writing in this game. The voice acting and the fleshed out characters all make the world feel that much more alive. And yes, even Keanu did a great job as Johnny Silverhand. Perhaps one of his best roles, even though he's the weakest voice actor in the game. Cyberpunk's stories and quests will give you so much background and lore on Night City, and the writing will keep you coming back to see what happens next. Truly a fantastic job in this sense of the game.Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game. Sometimes great. When it works. It's not the huge blockbuster game we expected, but it's still a really good game. And that's what sucks about the bad rep it gets. Within the disastrous launch, the class action lawsuits, the Cyberpunk special edition Playstation 4's and Xbox One's that blew up trying to run the title screen, and the bugs, there really is a good game here. A great game sometimes. But when fans of the gaming industry and a gaming company spend 8 years building a game up to unreachable heights, a great game becomes a good one. And a good one becomes an average one. I believe the game will be fixed in time, but Cyberpunk 2077 could never reach the level of expectations that everyone set for it.Setting: 19/20RPG Mechanics: 15/20Gameplay: 12/20Graphics: 18/20Writing: 19/20Final Score: 83/100"

Enjoying the hell out of the characters and storyline especially, but all the side quests and easter egg extras for exploring are just icing on the cake.  A few bugs yes, but nothing even close to game breaking and no performance issues/crashes at all, not even one.  Only real thing that gets a red mark next to it for me is the vehicles. Controls are pretty shabby and make driving pretty much a nuh uh for me, but they're pretty much the same as in Borderlands 2.  So for the most part I just quick travel or travel on foot while I explore everything that Night City has to offer I mean it is 2077 after all, cars are so last century!  It's affected a few quests but isn't a deal breaker for me, not even remotely.  I avoid cars in most games cos only thing I'm good at is smashing them into walls :)Solid 9/10 hands down.

Say what you will about the higher ups forcing the developers to launch the game earlier than needed, but the fact that a very buggy (even sometimes broken) video game is being sold at full AAA price is not something I can ever recommend.In a year that at best can only be described as terrible, casual and hardcore gaming enthusiasts had one last hope to turn the year on its head, Cyberpunk 2077. That's not to say that 2020 has been a bad year for video games, in fact I would say the opposite. 2020 has been an amazing year for video games, however, at a time as listless as this, everyone was hoping that Cyberpunk 2077 would be the sweet Cherry on top of a mountain of great experiences.Sadly, reality is often disappointing. Now, Cyberpunk 2077 is not a bad game, actually, it is quite a good game. However, the game does more than just fail to live up to the insurmountable hype, I think we all knew it wouldn't. No, Cyberpunk is disappointing because it is, in all senses of the word, a misleading game. Earlier in the year, The Last of Us 2, among its many criticisms, was heavily criticized by fans for its 'misleading' marketing. Well, I have yet to play The Last of Us, but I feel as though in the face of Cyberpunk 2077, they should find a better word, because Cyberpunk's marketing was an outright lie.The Story follows the lone mercenary V who, through unfortunate circumstances, is placed on a path woven in betrayal, suffering and bloodshed, all while they try to become a legend of Night City. Overall, the story is intriguing and self-contained, with well-thought out twists and turns that ultimately make for a solid experience. However, there are a couple faults worth mentioning. Firstly, the lifepaths may as well not be a part of the game, holding nearly no relevance to the story aside from the occasional piece of dialogue, most of which have no real effect on the world around you. Secondly, your entire character's backstory is rushed within the space of a 60 second montage that does nothing for the character and voids any chance to truly understand who your character is. Thirdly, the decisions you make in the game have little to no effect, save for one decision which decides the ending you get. Finally, the story does not live up to the world it tries to build. Despite how often the story builds up the hierarchy and functioning of Night City as a city controlled by corporations, their presence is rarely ever felt, and your actions never really seem to have an impact on that society as a whole, at least not until the very end.Save for the surprisingly solid melee combat, Cyberpunk 2077 has some of the most stiff and underwhelming gameplay I have ever experienced in a First-Person Shooter. Some Guns are fun, others you never use. While some guns just make all the other negligible all together which kind of defeats the purpose of an RPG. Seriously, it's just about which weapons have the highest DPS. The Quickhacking is actually really well-done but very uncreative and ultimately boils down to how long can I get the enemy to stand still, with very little innovation in environment hacking.Overall, the gameplay was decent, but could have been a lot better.This is where the game truly shines. The big side missions secondary to the overarching plot are some of the best I've experienced in a video game. They enhance the story by adding more layers to the world as well as the characters you explore it with. So you may be wondering, why only give it an 8 when I've praised it so much? Because, of the dozens and dozens of side missions, only about 10% are actually worth doing. 90% of them are just repetitive and uninteresting Gigs and NCPD missions that involve going to one place, shooting a few people, maybe get a decent crafting recipe, done. The problem isn't that these missions exist, its that there is so f****** many of them.Honestly, most of the characters were incredibly solid. Johnny Silverhand is an absolute blast, and well, it's Keanu Reeves. River is a joy, Judy is spectacular, Kerry is fun, and Takemura is an absolute bro. So why such a low score? I have two main complaints. Firstly, the Antagonist faction Arasaka, led by Yorinobu, is the most underwhelming, and downright lame antagonist I've seen in a while. Sure he isn't the story's main focus, but considering certain aspects of the game are heavily involved with his faction, I was expecting a whole lot more other than the ramblings of a dead man. Secondly, V, the protagonist of the whole game, is the most inconsistent protagonist I've played in a while. His reason for living may be that of a simple man, but it is very shallow and set in stone, no lifepath or choice changes who V is, and unfortunately that hurts the game more than anything.Not much to say. The audio was extremely crisp, and elevated the mediocre gameplay to be decently entertaining. And most importantly, it nailed the Cyberpunk feeling that the game needed.The Soundtrack of this game is downright awesome. Chippin' In in particular just makes the soundtrack for me by itself. The  reason it only gets an 8 however is that you rarely actually get a chance to experience said soundtrack.All Style, No Substance. I would have only given this category a 5 or a 6, but the problem is that we were lied to. CD Projekt Red marketed a truly immersive experience in a once in a lifetime open world. What we got was comparable to Ubisoft's worst open worlds and barer than GTA Online was when it was first made available. 90% of the vendors are absolutely garbage. 95% of the buildings have no real intrigue and the ones that do are very borderline and  provide no real value outside of missions. The Police and Wanted System is broken and not fun in the slightest. where either you fight the cops and get shredded, or flee and lose them in seconds. The Driving is so mediocre it could give the first Watch Dogs a run for its money. The only thing the city has going for it is the spectacular visuals.Absolutely stunning, but in some instances the loading can make it look a little off. I loved the look and feel of every weapon, crevice and building in Night City. I'd go as far as to say that if I had an RTX card, I'd give Visuals a 10.Everyone's said it already so all I'll say is that there is no way that a 1080 Ti should have this much issue running a game like this. It's unacceptable. My framerate generally steadies at 60 even on Ultra but the frequent dips, are incredibly annoying, and driving... Jesus the frame drops while driving.Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game and I definitely enjoyed playing it. But even if this was a perfectly optimized game, it would probably only be worth 7.5. Is that a bad thing? Not in the slightest, I had fun and that is what matters. The problem is that this game was marketed to be so much better. It's one thing to not meet expectations, and an entirely different thing to fail to deliver on what they actually promise will be in the game.  Firstly, wait till the game is fixed of its bugs and performance issues. Secondly, I would only recommend buying this game on a sale of at least 20% off. The game is not worthy of its buying price, very few AAA games are and CDPR does not get to be an exception. Honestly, the tragedy of this isn't that the developers failed to deliver on the hype, it's that the higher ups never gave them a chance to."

There are few mods to select. But can't customize them like fallout or metro series.- No transmog feature ""yet""- No garages. Can't store your vehicles.- Crowds barely react and have no awareness to the game world. Expected to antagonize them like RDR2.- Very few interactive NPCs outside of missions with meaningful dialogue. Can't hangout with friends you meet later via storymode.- Lack of non-action oriented stories and quests about meaningful themes of cyberpunk distopia.- Weapon mods and skill trees largely irrelevant outside of marginal and mostly numerical improvements to combat.- Lack of gameplay events in the world. Random cop car chases, bank robberies, etc.- Unable to customize character once you're in night city. No barbershops, plastic surgeon, etc.- No ownership of items. No karma for robbing poor NPCs.- No prison or lasting crime system.

They have lots of stats to choose in melee but melee combat animations doesn't feel satisfying.  Deus Ex has far more impactful mods that actually change the way you approach combat.- The lifepaths are cut content and extremely short. They have little impact other than dialogue choices. V is essentially the same character regardless of past.- The traffic AI is really poor. Once you park your car the AI just waits there without even trying to overtake and also often roadblocks itself.- Trains seems like another cut content. Even though the whole infrastructure is visible.- The world visually looks really good but interaction is quite minimal. Among items that should be interactive: smartphones, taxi, most merchant stalls.. (can't even have a meal there), arcade games and pachinko.- No reliable cover system. You just crouch behind a wall.- This one is critical. Loot system overdone, invasive and distracting. Except to have atleast 200 meds which make the fights easy. You are constantly showered with redundant and marginally better items and have no attachment whatsoever with your fashion and weapon choices. This also means you can totally ignore crafting items.. you can just loot for better gear.- Enemies are too spongy. Feels like futuristic division overall again. But if you make a proper build they will die fast.- Robotics and drone control largely absent (outside of scripted missions). Was atleast excepting a personal drone or flatbot which is shown in game."

However, without rehashing the same BS you hear from every other review about bugs and unpolished gameplay, I would like to take a moment to talk about what really makes this game faulter. The main character. The muddled personality of the main character drags this story DOWN from very good 8/10 to like a 6/10. The devs couldn't decide whether or not to have a Geralt from Witcher 3 style character where you play through him, or have  your own guy or gal to rp through. Throughout the game it constantly flip flops between these two ideas starting with the pathway selection(which mean nothing to the progression of your story). You get to decide your characters background which IN THEORY is a cool idea (make your character have his own story beforehand sort of thing) but what actually happens is you are thrust into an alien environment that uses your select story as a excuse not to explain everything at first. (similar to how Geralt and other witcher characters aren't really introduced or explained in witcher 3, but at least they had previous stories to go on.) After the first ten hours of partial confusion wear off and you become familiar with everything other issues arise with main character dialogue. Whenever you are in a convo you are either the character V, the sarcastic bastard who is cynical and slick OR you are John doe who says inoffensive character-dead repeats of what you were just told. It never feels like you truly are yourself/own character or V though as similar to Geralt in witcher 3, whatever dialogue option you pick is going to come out slightly different, which makes is hard as hell to ""roleplay"". On top of this certain dialogue choices feel unfair when presented to you as your character disconnect makes it harder to determine whether or not you are going to come off in the right tone or with the right cadence in conversation. It makes dialogue feel almost ""minefield-ish"" at points especially since making critical decisions can get lost the mire of conversation. Idk, if CD PROJEKT RED ever decide to do something like this again they need to make sure their main character is either a clean slate nobody or a already determined protagonist, no more half baked crap.Along with this nearly every system in the game is slightly broken causing for your immersion to shatter every other second. Driving sucks, gunplay sucks, stealth sucks with how jank and unwieldy enemy AI can be, conversations can suck with first person perspective cutscenes making dialogue feel awkward and strange, the open world partially sucks( feels dense until you explore for like 3 seconds and realize its not) and obviously the bugs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible. It all serves to break your immersion as you constantly realize your just playing a buggy tech demo-esk mess. PS I NEVER PLAYED THIS ON LAUNCH I PLAYED THIS OVER A YEAR AND A HALF LATER, THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE. ALSO I DON'T REALLY WRITE REVIEWS LMAO."

The game's city is massive and easily the most detailed set-piece I've seen in a game thus far, however aside that there is practically no depth to the world. Exploration in this game consists of clearing out brain-dead mobs in back-alleys and side-streets, nothing in this game evokes mystery or a sense of exploration after the first few hours. If you like the game's setting you're probably best off just playing the game's main quest-line, because the open-world aspect falls flat. 'Sleeping Dogs' came out eight years before this game and has a more immersive open-world. Unfortunately Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most overhyped games in the last several years."

I've seen one floating NPC in my 16.3 hours, and I believe 3 NPCs clipping through something out of the thousands you pass in the streets.Are they annoying? I guess, if you're going to stare at them and post them on social media. Otherwise you can just move on and forget about it.The only other bugs I've run into since were one quest I completed didn't actually complete, but after I quit and loaded back in later, it completed. Then I crashed on the motorcycle, flew 100 feet in the air, landed and died and had to reload.ORIGINAL REVIEW_______I'll put this review in now and update as I get farther through the game.So far I'd really just say it's another open world RPG game. Nothing in the first 5 hours stood out as amazing. Not that it's bad or anything.For bugs, I've had two so far. An NPC floating in the air, and a few NPCs walking through objects. Nothing gameplay or really immersion breaking.For performance, I'm on an i5-9600k and a 2080 (non-ti), and I get an average of 80fps with dips to the 50s on mostly High settings, no Ray Tracing. 1440p resolution. (WIth Ray Tracing it's 50s with dips to 30s)I'd recommend if you're a big fan of the setting and enjoy the genre of game for now. If you're not too into either, it's a wait for sale or just pass on it."

This is mainly due to the narrative dragging you along without really providing any substance to the characters you are introduced to. There is not enough backstory or context for V other than ""night city is a harsh environment but I want to be famous/successful/remembered"". I chose corpo but somehow feel as though V was always a street rat anyway? Night City is supposed to be on the west coast yet V at times sounds like he just walked out of a Red Sox game... So, even if it were only a few paragraphs, some backstory for V wouldn't have gone astray. There is quite a bit of uninterruptible dialogue in this game, so when you become detached to the characters/narrative as I have, things become pretty stagnant and you start to wish you could simply click through it all. In terms of the gameplay, every action and interaction feels completely hollow, as though the world is made of cardboard. You can barely notice that you are taking any damage until the third bullet kills you, that is after emptying 3 clips into a street thug without them flinching. I put a couple of points towards the brawler perk, and i found it was shockingly quicker to punch 5 men to death than shoot at them, all while sucking down my 15 health pack inhalers.And then there are the bugs, the icing on the cake. I can happily overlook bugs if the game is engaging and fun to play, but in this case, it is simply adding insult to injury. I love discovering games that make me want to take time off work just so I can jump back in, but sadly, I don't get that feeling from this one ;("

But it released months, if not well over a year too early.  If this is the state its in in December, I don't want to know what state it was in when they were considering an April release, or even September.- Optimization.  Runs like ass for, just about everyone.  My system is a Ryzen 7 3700x, an MSI RTX 3070, 32GB of ram, and the game is on an SSD. I play on a 1080p monitor.  Yet even with ray tracing turned off, I very frequently see frames in the 40fps range, occasionally running smoothly in the 60s. - AI.  Traffic AI doesn't exist. AI vehicles follow pre determined pathing, but that's it. AI don't react to shooting, guns pointed at them, make no attempt to go around if you're blocking the road, and police vehicles don't even chase you, they just spawn next to you.  aside from this, there are numerous bugs involving NPCs- Bugs.  There are a lot of bugs, involving just about everything.  Most are easy to overlook, bugs were expected with launch, but occasionally a bug will break a quest forcing you to have to reload not just the most recent quicksave, but a save from several minutes behind of progress to ""fix""- Low end content.  For a game and world that focuses heavy on body customization and augmentation, it's amazing how you can't even change your character's hair style.  Or in a game where you can buy vehicles and seemingly participate in street races, you can't customize them whatsoever.There's other points I can make, but plenty of other reviews make those points, this is just what I wanted to say about it.I believe this game will be great, but right now, it just isn't.  The base content and storyline is there if that's all you care about, but the game will need a lot of patches, bug fixes, and content updates before it should be considered a finished game.  I'll gladly update my review to recommended once the game doesn't feel like an unfinished mess"

CDPR's anticipated magnum opus turns into CDPR's apologetic mea culpa. Cyberpunk seethes and bursts with BURN CORPO ♥♥♥♥ outrage, only to be undermined by its very own and very corporate master overlords. The game is good but sometimes it's... bad. Gah!Imagine a famous artist is meticulously crafting individual pieces for a massive masterpiece. He announces when he will unveil his work and everyone is very excited. However, he encounters a myriad of problems, halting his progress but not the reveal date's as it looms closer and closer. He delays the unveiling a few times but eventually decides that he  done, after all, and reassures everyone of the quality of his work. As the curtain lifts, the onlookers are presented with an unmistakably rushed and unfinished product. In his haste, the artist had cobbled everything into an amalgam of fine, intricate details and rough, crude shapes. Some of the beautiful craftsmanship is apparent, but it is altogether a bit of a bloated and awkward mess that is held together by duct tape, delusion, and deception. That is Cyberpunk 2077.However, for a game that was vomited out at the last minute, Cyberpunk does have some impressively redeeming chunks floating around in the muck. For one, the game looks quite amazing. It is the perfect canvas for creativity, with Night City posing as a gorgeous model for the one too many screenshots you will inevitably take. Unfortunately, the city itself only serves as a beautiful cardboard backdrop and not much else. It manages to appear full of life and yet it's lifeless at the same time. The excellent writing at least infuses personality and vitality into Cyberpunk and is the greatest strength of the game. When I beat it for the first time and got my first ending, it was a bad ending and I absolutely loved it (that particular ending is still my favorite after experiencing all the others). I was genuinely fascinated by its very cynical tone and the dark questions it raised about life and technology and the latter's ability to define the former. But whatever significance you might like to draw out of Cyberpunk's thought-provoking narrative, it's diluted by the large and empty open world and dull filler quests. This kind of self-sabotage happens throughout the game. CDPR will dazzle you with a bright little gem, only to dunk it moments later into a pool of rubbish.And so I treasure the small but brilliant positives of Cyberpunk, glittering in the morass of bugs, glitches, half-baked bits, and a swamping of other problems the red-thumbed reviews will elaborate for you. If anything, in the few areas that CDPR succeeds with Cyberpunk, it succeeds extremely well, and well enough so that, for me, the game ends up more good than bad despite its issues. But Cyberpunk is a mixed bag to be sure, and one that requires waiting for a sale, careful sifting of the contents, and a willing blind eye to overlook the flaws."

Mind you, I was hyped for this game back in 2014. I saw the first trailer of the cyborgs in freeze frame being hunted by corp sec and my mind only roamed further from there as CD Projekt Red promised ""unlimited"" character customization and that they were working with the original TTRPG designer to bring the role-playing game designed for the table to life on your screen.This isn't a Cyberpunk-slice-of-life sim, nor is it a digital adaptation of the Tabletop RPG. This is a rail-roaded first person shooter amusement ride on an open-world map. Now that could be fine, but this undermines all of the hype that was built around the game. If I'm stuck as V, don't give me false promises of ""unlimited"" customization and freedom to make meaningful choices. Your choices don't matter if it doesn't change the outcome of anything meaningful. Your story isn't yours either if it's just flavors of a pre-scripted protagonist. Play as Good V, play as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ V, play as Selfish V, but at the end of the day you're still stuck playing V, the clumsy hero struggling to keep their head above Night City's sewage water.Without spoiling the game, the story proverbially flows like this; bad guys cram you in a barrel and send you over Niagara falls. Cool, very compelling plot-hook, my character has an adversary, a circumstance, and a context to struggle against. But instead of letting the barrel deposit you on the shore so you can pursue vengeance against those who wronged  you of your own volition (Far Cry 5, Conan Exiles, etc.), the game keeps you in the barrel all of the way up to the very end. Sure you can shift your weight around inside to decide which shore you bounce against, but you're still just going to wind up in the sea every time you play. You never reach that moment of freedom where you can just do what you bought the game to do in the first place (i.e. be your own heist-artist, run the city, live the nightlife, dig yourself into messes to explore ways out of them).No, by the time you ""break out"" of that barrel, it's credits.How am I supposed to fall in love with Night City when none of the adventures are my own? How is there any replay-ability if all the branches lead back to the trunk?Why should I care about these characters when I don't have the freedom to make up my own mind about them?This game was rushed, even with six years of waiting and desperate pleading to take their time and make sure this didn't turn into NMS round two. Even with all of that, they chose to take the PR hit because of how colossally they botched the management of this project."

I knew nothing about the game post-release past the setting and its incredibly buggy nature. Hell, this was my first CD Projekt Red game. I was always interested in at least giving it a shot considering it holds the title of one of the biggest PC launches of all time. Years later, following hundreds of bug fixes and after a nomination for the Labor of Love award, now seemed like there wouldn’t be a better time to try it. As for what I think of the game? If you enjoy Bethesda’s open-world adventures like Elder Scrolls or modern Fallout games, play this game: I think you’ll enjoy it infinitely more so than those games. And that sentiment will probably extend to other lower-quality open-world games that have flooded the market. Cyberpunk may not have been what was promised at launch to this day, but I think it’s still an enjoyable experience.The biggest elephant in the room for Cyberpunk’s gameplay is that it’s barely an RPG. I have already made a comparison to Bethesda’s open-world RPGs, but the one Cyberpunk is most similar to has to be Fallout 4. The roleplaying elements are present, but fairly limited when compared to others of the genre, especially when you factor in how it was advertised to excel in this way. When you hear about how Cyberpunk straight-up lied with its marketing, this is how. The effects of your chosen backstory are restricted to a few dialogue options and a different opening cutscene. Your choices will matter, but not for very long outside of specific character questlines and the main quest. The skill trees are flooded with simple stat increases, with most of the interesting upgrades being behind the various cybernetic enhancements instead. There are tons of options for builds and weapons, but the way the game is built encourages you to spec heavily into one weapon type and stick with it. I honestly think the skill tree and leveling system could be scrapped entirely and I would find the game more enjoyable. The shooting isn’t all that refined either. As I said earlier, you have plenty of options on how to handle combat. Hacking, sneaking, going nonlethal, or just going in guns blazing are just brief examples of the unique ways you can interact with enemies. The problems stem from enemies not being nearly as adaptable back with the player. You’ll fight vehicles, drones, mech-suits, robots, and various cybernetically enhanced humans, but roughly 90% of combat encounters are composed of just normal people. I never had to adapt my playstyle to a new threat and my monowire just shredded everything. I never thought to experiment with a new playstyle or weapon because nothing ever posed enough of a threat. Even though the gameplay is subpar, I just could not put it down.The main selling point is actually the massive and immersive open world you have to explore. The world of Night City feels incredibly realistic and it’ll take you forever to completely run out of things to do. Night City is so well put together that I didn’t start using fast travel until I hit the 30-hour mark. I was constantly pulled into the experience and the illusion was almost never shattered. And it’s not like exploration stops at a generic future city. The outskirts of the map include more suburban neighborhoods and a vast desert with mobile camps and raiders. If you enjoy exploration, you will love Cyberpunk. The game even rewards you for walking around the world with unique encounters, sidequests, gear, or just the simple ability to admire the scenery. I personally recommend choosing to do side jobs more than gigs because they’re the more narrative-focused quests. Some of my favorite encounters were stumbling into Cyberpsychos that were boss fights. My favorites of the bunch involved dodging a sniper in the open badlands and fighting someone in a mechanical skeleton that fired laser beams. I don’t think anything else other than the story would’ve solidified my opinion on Cyberpunk. The writing in this game is one of the strongest I’ve seen in an open-world game. From the main plot to the sidequests, every piece of the English language found here is delightfully put together. The characters were the strongest element for me personally. Characters that were just talking cars and vending machines have more personality than 90% of video game characters. Johnny Silverhand is the clear highlight as the deuteragonist, but that is far from saying others never stood a chance of competing with him. The animations and voice acting do a lot to sell these characters too. The themes of the plot aren’t limited to the standard cliche cyberpunk ones as well. It’s not revolutionary for the genre in that sense, but I still think it’s a highlight for this subsect of fiction. I personally enjoyed that each of the game’s endings felt like a satisfying conclusion to the plot in entirely unique ways. It’s very rare for a game to have multiple endings and for one of them to not be the “Good Ending” and I adore Cyberpunk for that. People are going to take away a vastly different message from the game depending on what you choose in the final few moments. Quick note, the soundtrack is also really good. Been Good to Know Ya, New Dawn Fades, and The Rebel Path are some of my favorites of the standard original bits. But there’s also a large chunk of songs composed by Johnny’s band that are actually in the game. Never Fade Away is likely the most iconic of the bunch, but it’s a full album. There’s a bunch of licensed music as well that you can listen to while driving.And there’s something I feel that I probably don’t have to mention but I feel inclined to. While nowhere near as bad as its launch, the game is still at a Bethesda level of quality when it comes to bugs. While Cyberpunk 2077 never crashed for me, I did get soft-locked and experienced dozens of graphical bugs and technical glitches. And for a game that focuses so heavily on immersion, this will pull you out of the experience every time it happens. NPC’s faces won’t load in until you’ve looked at a PS2 model for a few seconds. My voice actor swapped genders for one scene only to immediately fix itself the next time I opened my mouth. Vehicles would float in the area on the regular. One dialogue section at the very end of the game had a character holding a gun while using his tablet. There were people t-posing in the opening cutscene for ♥♥♥♥’s sake. Not only is this the patched version, but this is also the PC version. God help you if you played on a last gen console. While it’s amazing that the game is in a playable state now, it was unethical for the studio to release Cyberpunk in the state that they did. Cyberpunk isn’t a “labor of love” out of passion, it’s out of necessity. CD Projekt Red shouldn’t be applauded for doing the bare minimum and fixing a broken product. Cyberpunk 2077 is far from the best RPG out there. It’s probably not even close to the best open-world game. But it is one of the most immersive games with a very compelling narrative that constantly pulls you in. Only for the hundredth bug to immediately pull you out. While it would’ve made the game less glitchy, I don’t think any more time in the oven would’ve make it any better. There was a clear conflict of interest in what gameplay genre the developers wanted to make.  I think the people arguing that this game is one of the worst out there are dead wrong. But it’s still far from what was promised. And excluding the bugs and disastrous launch, I’m ok with that."

The way side-content is delivered is the hollow ""throw darts on the map at random"" and expect the player to want to head to their respective markers. This is quite boring. However, once you're there, the mission is revealed to you and you are allowed to play it out how you want, but can often be rewarded for playing it a specific way... sometimes defying the desires of the person who hired you. These missions feel rich in story, lore, background... but delivered in a text message rivaling the length of this review. Not to mention all the data shards... Token replacements for entire conversations that likely had to be scrapped.Then all the little cracks. There are plenty of moments where objects NPCs are interacting with will duplicate and stay frozen in the air near them.  (Edit: Fixed as of 1.3) That said, the GPS navigation is often broken and will zigzag through streets rather than take the fewest possible turns within reasonably similar distance traveled. It does at least adjust whether you're on foot or in a vehicle. NPC scripting often breaks forcing you to use an autosave to backtrack a bit to give it another shot at working as intended. This also teaches you to use your quicksave at prime opportunities so you don't lose much progress since autosaves aren't frequent. Even just quicksaving and reloading will often fix a lot of NPC scripting on-the-spot. Weapons, attributes, stats, and skills are horribly balanced.  (Edit: Stats now seem to be shown properly as of 1.21)  (Edit: Instant deaths were identified and fixed as of 1.2)  (Edit: Reloads are much faster now as of 1.2, but still tedious.) and many more minor annoyances and glitches will be encountered along the way. None of which is consistent on a user-by-user basis either. Many have it worse than me, many have had a near flawless experience, and there's no accounting for the standards of the masses.EDIT: April 1st 2021I read through and tested the 1.2 update for a few hours. This fixed a solid chunk of my nuanced details regarding bugs/glitches/issues, and is at least that much closer to its intended vision, but there's entire systems and mechanics missing here still before that vision becomes a reality. On top of that, many functions that were working before now don't work as intended. Such as scan toggle. Each time I launch the game now, scanning is on hold. I have to go to my keybinds, switch it to hold, apply, then switch it back to toggle in order to get scan toggle to work again. And there are more minor new bugs/glitches/issues as well. Tested AMD DXR functionality on settings that get 120+ fps, and full DXR drops framerates to a staggering 30. I feel full control of DXR sample rates needs added so we AMD users can tune this.EDIT: September 1st 2021Version 1.3 dropped with some free content added, a simple improvement to the minimap while driving, and more quest scripting fixes. Ray-Tracing implementation is still broken on AMD considering Doom Eternal and RE8 run just fine with it enabled.EDIT: December 1st, 2021No real changes, just doing this dirty edit for the nomination awards.Finally the real reason I don't recommend the game... There's so much potential here not being realized. There are no less than five gangs in the city and I genuinely feel that core progress should be locked behind gaining reputation and prestige with at least one of them. This could also drastically alter how the ending unfolds. I hope someone at CDPR reads this because I would genuinely like to see full-on gang wars between their respective borders in the city. NCPD and MaxTac jumping into the fray shortly after these battles begin, and let them be dynamic. I would like to see a system where you could earn reputation with all the gangs using an alias and keeping your face hidden - if ever discovered on the other side of the fence instantly marking you a traitor and to be dealt with in the way that gang operates. It could be as simple as shooting someone who saw your face and not realizing they are still alive. They report to their superiors and flip a coin whether or not the gang finds out it was the player. On top of that, the player could turn the tide of war and go Saints Row on them by claiming territory from one gang for another. They could even join the NCPD and eventually MaxTac in much the same way. Even Arasaka, Militech, and Biotechnica. Not to mention the Nomad clans... There should be exclusive mission boards per fixer, gang, NCPD/MT, corporation, or clan rather than marks all over the map for missions. I've seen how the fixers can be visited; why not have them give you a roster of potential missions to take on? I wish you had been able to take another year or two developing these systems. I see the potential for them like it was intended from the start, but had to be cut because it would take too long to complete. And I'm well aware of the five-year investment rule. I know why you launched it like this, and I know you're not allowed to admit this cold truth of business. I wish you had waited to take on investment until you had a timeline for finishing what could've been a real masterpiece for your studio.The reason I do not recommend this game is because as it is now I feel it is a work of art masterpiece video game that is lacking a great deal of its true potential. It is indeed worthwhile to buy and play as it is now, but Cyberpunk 2077 clearly isn't everything it wants to be, and should be... at least, not yet..."

However, it's certainly not without its faults — in the interest of full disclosure, I did pre-order this game but ended up refunding it. I've only recently purchased it again for 50% off.I find myself pensive, wistful and introspective after the conclusion of this narrative — a set of emotions I do not normally need to contend with after finishing a game. Perhaps contradictory to this, I cannot say the narrative is expressly unique, it's actually quite predictable. You can probably figure out what's going to happen pretty early on. But it's extremely well told and the character development is some of the better I've seen within the medium.That said, the game still has a bunch of weird bugs but none of them prevented me from completing a mission — occasionally I needed to re-load to trigger a few things. And the performance is subpar — more on that later. But honestly, the bugs are not dissimilar to things you'd see in many other giant open-world games.Mechanically, the game is simply uninspiring. That isn't to say it's bad or not worth engaging with. It's simply not doing anything new. Imagine RAGE 2, Borderlands, The Outer Worlds, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Watch Dogs and I would even go as far to mention EA's Syndicate — not Bullfrog's — I'm talking about the cyberpunk styled FPS, not the isometric RPG by the same name. Imagine those games were all forced to merge and create some sort of hybrid monster — that's Cyberpunk, only with a lot more  due to unconstrained marketing and an even more vitriolic audience. I think there is some crossover narrative elements as well with some of those titles.Some of the perks are strait out of Borderlands, such as “Cold Blood”, a perk that increases movement speed after killing an enemy with additional effects like reducing recoil if you level into it — they even stack. Some weapons (mostly tech) have different firing modes based on whether you're zoomed in or not. There is cyberware that will release a shockwave if your health depletes below a certain point, it's almost exactly how Nova Shields operate. Plus, I'm pretty sure this game has just as much loot as Borderlands.Interestingly, the body stat may seem like an endurance or vitality increase but it also dictates your ability to pry open vents or doors with brute force as well as other various stat checks. The “cool” stat allows you to give more level-headed responses beyond its additional stealth buffs. Whereas if you level into stealth, killing an enemy silently gives a boost to crouched-movement speed. Low physical stats will disallow you to commandeer vehicles that are being driven. Low technical ability will prevent you from hacking certain doors. So your base stats do matter. For instance, you cannot stealth-kill larger enemies without also leveling into body. I took a perk early on that auto-dissembled junk items, so every time I picked garbage up I was effectively passively gaining XP in crafting. Health items range from all sorts of inhalers and injectors making it feel very Fallout/Outer Worlds-y.  Equipping mods in your cyberdeck will allow you call for backup similar to Watch_Dogs, moreover you're able to hack into the camera network to scout a location beforehand. But other mods can be used as well to augment your quickhacks such as reboot optics that will cause an enemy temporary blindness.Beyond these sorts of traditional open-world FPS/RPG... things — every game needs 10 genre tags now, you can also perform investigations from what are effectively memories,  the brain remembers — a “Brain Dance”. They remind me a lot of the game “Remember Me”. Some missions are centered around them.Street cred acts a bit like the Face meter in Sleeping Dogs where you'll need to increase this in order to wear more prestigious outfits/clothing. It also allows better gear, cyber-enhancements and missions to become available. The game actually bombards you with phone calls and text messages. You'll probably get 2 or 3 phone calls from Fixers you've never even met while on your way to some point of interest. And end up responding to 2 other texts in the middle of that.  I'd estimate I had only done maybe 40% of the side jobs, gigs and hustles after my 51 hours through my first playthough. Some of it is kind of filler content but it ranges in true CDPR fashion from taking down criminals, doing random contracts for fixers, investigating politicians to helping a fractured AI stop the flamingos from screaming — you'll figure it out.The very few dialogue options in a given situation are clearly marked as to which ones will provide exposition and which will progress the story/situation. Marked blue and yellow, respectively. Some dialogue with be unique to your chosen lifepath.The PC I used to play this a 5600X and a 6GB GTX1060 and 16GB DDR4 3600Mhz. There's really only two native resolutions with ultrawides, those being 3440x1440 and 2560x1080 so you're forced into resolution scaling if you don't have the hardware to back it up. My monitor is a 2560x1080. Realistically, if there wasn't a frame counter on-screen I probably wouldn't notice the frame drops — not without extreme dips.Two settings I found to be “playable” used 70% static scaling — dynamic scaling had too much fluctuation and I value consistency over occasional high FPS. I'd turn all volumetric stuff off as it provides next to no visual improvement and costs a ton of performance. I lowered crowd density as well.At  UW medium-low settings I got 37FPS using half refresh rate v-sync.At   medium-high settings I got around 50FPS. I did have to go into the Windows settings to alter my audio quality to 96K Hz to avoid a static audio glitch that was persistent without changing it.Dropping scaling to 60% improved performance to about 50-82FPS with medium-low settings at 2560x1080. Depending on how many lights, enemies and things were getting blown up. 180W was my peak wattage usage — but it'd hover around 120W-140W. These settings are what I actually ended up settling on with v-sync set to 75.I've seen APUs weaker than the 5600G running this game at 720@30 on low settings. And I know that isn't great — but it's substantial for a solitary chip without a discrete video card. (Just imagine it on a Steam Deck or an Aya Neo.) Look, what I'm trying to say is, It's a game about being a mercenary first and foremost, but it's got some really great stories to tell along the way if you let it. Given 5 years time, especially with expansions, I see this game becoming as revered as Witcher 3 and as redeemable as No Man's Sky. I would still wait for a sale, though."

I played for every ending, completed all side missions, all gigs, jobs, all NCPD Scanner missions and assault in progress world opportunities. And yeah, you might wonder why I don't recommend this game after sinking over 110 hours into this game, so let me elaborate a bit for you.This game was advertised as an open-world RPG, but what you really got was a story driven, action looter-shooter. The overarching game loop after the first 30-40 hours in the game starts to grind on you a bit, where everything is ""Go to point A, kill X amount of enemies, and leave"". You then repeat this, with a sprinkle of ""don't kill enemies, just incapacitate them"" mixed in. But when you can just slap a mod on a gun that makes it non-lethal, this defeats the challenge and just circles it back around to shooting enemies. The Perks feel shallow and skill trees are barely explained. It took me until my character was about level 20 to learn that skills won't level higher than the attribute they are underneath, and since your character will max at level 50, you will be locked out of ever getting to experiment with the level 20 skills of certain trees, or even all trees if you spread your attribute points around. The RPG setting just isn't there, and this is a story being told to you in first person, not a game you can even self-insert into.Now, let me touch on the story. The entire time I was playing, I was expecting every choice I made to have consequences down the line. I was hesitant to say certain things, and wondered how it would all play out. Well, to be blunt, your choices leading up to endgame ultimately don't matter. There will be a point in the game where it will warn you to finish up missions and side quests because the story is about to reach it's boiling point. And only after this point will your choices really matter. The things you say and do will change dialogue or add some extra flavor after this point, but ultimately you can load a save from that point and get every different ending to the game. All the time I spent hesitating and debating on choices prior immediately felt wasted.This game can be beautiful, and that's one of the pros I have to give CDPR. The environment is a delight to look at and there are certain viewpoints in the game that make you appreciate it. But like so much of what is said in the game, it's largely superficial. The AI and people around town are braindead, and if they weren't there it would take away nothing from the game. The conversations with meaningful characters in the story just kind of drop off after they don't contribute to the main storyline anymore. The romance options in the moment are nice, but immediately afterwards they become an afterthought in the game, and really feel shallow.And then there are the endings themselves. I went through each, reloaded autosaves and made different choices, got different dialogue, and largely none of them gave me the butterflies I wanted to feel. A couple endings felt empty, hollow even, and then there were endings that felt like they took it in a direction just to slap you with shock value. Only 2 endings I can say I even relatively liked, and even then they didn't feel ""right"" to me.And then there are the bugs. This game is the most buggy game I've played since Fallout 76, and the amount of save scumming I had to do was ridiculous. Visual bugs popped up all over, there were occasional bugs that prevented me from saving the game, I would sometimes die randomly from jumping on flat ground while running. They nearly drove me insane. Anybody who has already stated that this feels like an early access title is correct. There was so much dropped content in the game, that I can't even understand why some of what made it to the game is still there. The backstories don't make sense when they just merge to the same point anyways, and it was said people would react to my appearance. That never happened, and I still don't understand why genitalia were even in the game when (for me at least) they had no apparent effect or even appearance in the game except the inventory UI.All in all, I just can't recommend the game. Perhaps it was overhyped, perhaps it just needed more time to bake before release. But in it's current state, I can't recommend it. Even then, with the direction the game took in the story, I still couldn't recommend it.Edit on 12/23:Some PC Specs for those curious - RTX 2070 Super, i7-9700k, 32GB Memory. I would say I have a rather high-end rig, and I had to play this game on low-medium graphics quality, RTX off, to maintain a 50-70 fps range at 2560x1440 resolution. My overall review is still based on the game itself and not on how it performed on my PC since I was able to play it rather unhindered except for gameplay bugs."

I played a bit when it came out and put it down until hearing about how it's improved over time. It definitely has! It's mostly stable, has a lot of content, and does a good job of mechanically representing the various kinds of cyberpunk one can be. However, it suffers from the not-too-uncommon problem of RPGs becoming movie-games. You can't really play a role, instead you are mostly a talking camera that follows the plot. You have very little influence on what happens and how, your reactions to events, even a lot of your personality. I think there's a place for movie-like games, where you fight and then sit back while the plot happens at you, God of War being a prime example, but in RPGs it's just frustrating because I'm given choices in some places and not others. You spent a lot of time stuck while long scenes of dialogue play out with no real influence, following people at a walking pace, picking a number of information options and then yes or no, and then going back to gameplay. The Lifepath does nothing, and you have no real opportunity to make a character your own. As a story, it's fine I guess, but I wish they just made the entire Johnny Silverhands subplot an anime like they did with Edgerunners, and instead crafted a story where you direct what happens rather than the developers.However, the gameplay is just sick. Running around doing random jobs is actually the best part of this game, ignoring the story for just being a person in Night City fighting to survive. I played as a netrunning ninja and as a gunslinging pistol user and both were incredible experiences. There's lots of verticality in the open world, interesting building layouts to sneak around in, and fairly competent AI to fight or sneak around. If they took the mechanics and worldspace of this game and crafted an interesting, dynamic, branching story that made the game worth playing and replaying, this game could be great. As it stands, it's a fun cyborg criminal sim which wastes that world on a story you can't really influence.If you're reading this before 3/23 or it's on sale again for 50% in the future, go for it! It's not devoid of fun by any means. However, at full price you could buy other games which have more emotional impact and replayability."

If you want  The game is great, it has some non-gamebreaking graphical glitches, the story, setting and characters are great.When this game came out, I said that even though I like the setting of the game, I won't ever play it. The reasons were my PC (i5 750, yes first generation core type CPU, and GTX1650, very low mid-range card) and the requirements and state of the game - it couldn't run properly even on new hardware at the time. One year later I got an e-mail saying the game is in 50% sale. Before buying the game though, I had to look up if my hardware is really that bad or if I could run the game at some decent pace. I watched a few videos of the game running on GTX1650 and when I discovered it can run 30+FPS, I was hooked. I bought Cyberpunk 2077.And so it began. First few hours were benchmarking. I had to fiddle with settings A LOT. The biggest impact was when I turned on the ""Slow HDD"" even though I have SSD (MX500) - the game runs fine from that point, even on Medium details. Game runs 28 to 35 fps for me with dips to 20 when cruising busy parts of town at high speed. This may be caused by HW, but also by playing on Linux through Proton.As you can see, I'm not a part of 60 fps gang. I care only about smoothness, for me 30 frames per second are good. If they are stable, that is.I started playing the game right away. I loved the setting from the start. I was quite surprised to learn that first few hours are actually prologue before the big unveiling of the story itself. When I finished prologue, I really got hooked up. The city is big. I don't mean there are many streets, I mean it's BIG. There are so many back alleys and elevators to look into, so many people and shops and everything. You will be overwhelmed.I started doing some quests, main story and side quests and even ""gigs"" as the small ones are called. Gigs are like fetch-quests from standard fantasy RPGs, but every one of them is different from each other, yet they are simple, they lack depth/backstory.What is really great about this game are characters. Starting with V, your character. I picked female with big boobs... :-D And started as a Streetkid as it is, what I believe authors of this game meant to be, the main role. V is really a street kid. Kinda nobody, but she knows the tricks and how it works. You meet another strong character right away and the game really doesn't stop giving until the end. Every character I met has a backstory. I liked a lot of them.Cyberpunk reminds me of Deus Ex. In Cyberpunk you play as kinda technological wizard. You can pick the way you are gonna do the game. You have weapon arsenal at your disposal and you can brute force your way through the game. I went more stealth and hacky way. I really enjoyed playing the game and I will replay it, but I will go different way that time. Male with big ♥♥♥♥ :-DThe weapons, armor, cyber implants. skills and perks, ... you can do so much in this game. I can't really write much about it as I haven'ŧ explored it that much.You can craft. And I'm telling you specifically because you can craft ammo. Remember that. It saved my ass many times.How can cyberpunk-style game have fantasy vibe? I doesn't. But when you open inventory, character info screen, when you see dialogue options... It's straight up copy of Witcher 3 in some regards. If you played it, you will see it a lot of it in this game too.Before I realized it, I was at point of no return in the story, that was around 37 hours in-game time. I was level 24 at the time with many side quests still being of ""High or Very high danger"", meaning they are for higher level character. I went for the story. For the next three hours, I couldn't get up from my PC, it was so intense!After watching one of the endings, I went back into the game straight away. And this is why I'm writing this review right now. This game kept my interest after finishing it. I'm not done with Night City. It still draws me in, I still want to play the game, finish more quests. And that is how I recognize a good game. I want to play it. I want to play it more. It doesn't become a chore, I still enjoy it the same.The one thing I don't enjoy is driving around in the game. My driving on the keyboard is rusty, I know. But this game seems to make it even worse. I'm not kidding when I say that Cyberpunk gave me the worst driving experience I ever had on PC. I played my first racing game in 1998, it was F1 game of that year. I had my share with NFS and Test drive games. I played GTAs. Cyberpunk is the worst. The cars and bikes are unreadable until you hit 100mph. But you can't cut city's corners at 100mph... When I turn at slow speed the car overturns every single time. You try to correct, you end up in the opposite way. I drove over so many people unintentionally because I couldn't control the car. Not good, especially in the game where you are meant to drive quite a bit.Note: When reviewing before posting, I forgot to mention here that I tried driving on gamepad. It's not better than keyboard. I struggled with it the same.And here we are at the second thing I quite don't undestand. This is more ""me"" thing than the game's. I have played for 40 hours, I did quite a lot of quests, met a lot of characters, yet I still don't know my bearings in the NIght city. You want me to go to the Afterlife club? I don't know where it is. You want me to go to the Pacifica district? I don't know how to get there. You want me to simply join the highway circle around the city? I would have to get on it by chance... In Witcher 3 I got to know every settlement, every cave. Cyberpunk doesn't provide me the same experience. The city is foreign, alien to me. Even after spending so much time in it and going through some streets multiple times, I don't remember even the names of those few city districts. The city is impersonal. But the story setting supports it to some degree.I still know my bearings in GTA3, Vice City and San Andreas up to this day. Hell, I could even navigate Oahu in Test Drive Unlimited better, than I do Night city. And we are talking playing without GPS! I learned the streets and roads of Oahu and GTA games WITHOUT the game telling me where to turn. 15 hours into Cyberpunk I turned of minimap. That was the point where I started to learn the city a bit. I still don't know where I am or how to get to the next point, but I started to notice landmarks at last. I don't enjoy driving without purpose so I won't learn the layout just by ""living"" in the city. If you are like me, turn off the minimap. It will help you to get to know the city better.While the game got patched a lot, it still has some glitches - shopkeeper standing on top of other shopkeeper, people going through other people on the street, cars parked half-way inside other cars, NPCs turning the steering wheel without moving their hands, NPCs going through objects, ... None of those are gamebreaking. I consider them funny. Everytime I saw something like that I stopped, had a look and with smile on my face, I went on to my quest.So here we are. End of the review, if only I knew what to say here...Too bad it is one year after release that the game finally got to the state in which it should have been at the launch date. I'm still glad I bought it. This is not an ordinary game, this one will have that special place for me. It doesn't make it that high as some iconic ones, but it sits pretty high nonetheless."

Thing is, had they left many promises out, the game would have been received better and maybe they would have enough time to Polish it before launch (pun intended). Finishing up in 'rona lock-down times didn't help either. This is apparent by patch 1.5 which fixed a HUGE amount of problems this game had. But coming 15 months after launch already had lots of people lose interest. I pre-ordered the game but after reading about the launch didn't touch it until April of 2022. And I am SO glad I did. I will go right ahead and mention the strongest part of CP2077 - the story telling. Most dialogues are really good, and make you realize how most other RPGs have ""robots"" talking to each other in stare-downs. There is just something more organic here, and while not perfect, it flows nicely. The characters often start as your standard stereotypes but get more interesting as you learn their stories and motives. And, by the end, you will be left with many memorable moments etched in your brain by a superb soundtrack. Then we have the gameplay and all you really need to know is that it's FUN. There's a big bunch of side stuff but not once did I want it to be over with already. And the variety here is cool - stealth is just as useful as full sprint combat, and while a couple of missions prefer you to go in quiet, most leave it up to you entirely. So much replayablity presents itself here that everyone can find something that's fun for them. For weapon there are three main types of guns - power (standard ricochet bullets), tech (wall hack laser slugs) and smart (auto-targeting missiles). Honestly, they all feel great and it's up to you to pick your favourite (mine were tech pistols, Burya FTW!). Melee can feel clunky at start, especially hand-to-hand combat. But once you get used to the camera-to-enemy distance it's actually pretty strong and viable. There is an abundance of pistols and katanas so it's easy to guess what the devs aimed for the most. The other stuff is just as great though, albeit less varied. Third type of ""weapons"" are cyberdecks, which let you hack your enemies or their surroundings. Eventually, you can walk into a room full of enemies and kill them all by just looking at them. The skill tree and crafting complement this gameplay but you can beat the game without checking out either. Probably a good thing because the balance between them isn't that great (some are meh, some too OP). They are there to just enhance the experience but in the end it's all up to how YOU move and aim. The variations are crazy and I didn't even mention all the other gadgets you can use. It is very rare for a game to engage me so much that I think of what's the next playthrough going to be like while still in the ""prologue"". And even more rare to have that momentary feeling of ""what do I do with my life now..."" after finishing the main story line. You might not want to support CDPR with the full cost for all the things wrong at launch ... but I'd say at half off most people will not feel like a gonk by getting this game.

I, like many others, got really invested in the world after Edgerunners, and gave in to the desire to pick up the game. It was a mistake, honestly. The story and characters are pretty enjoyable so far. I like the world. The gameplay is pretty solid- even if the way weapons scale makes things a little disappointing sometimes. The updates since launch seem to have brought some pretty welcome changes and additions, from what I can see. But idea that all of the game's flaws have been fixed since launch is greatly exaggerated. Many animations and scenes are completely broken. It is very easy to find yourself stuck in geometry and needing to reload. The game doesn't explain a lot of its mechanics and concepts very well.But the nail in the coffin for me? I encountered a gamebreaking bug during a quest 40 hours into the game- but the way it broke things was subtle enough that I did not realize it until 40 minutes later, when all of my auto and manual saves before that point had been written over. At that point- very critical main story quests, and most side quests, became unstartable immediately. And after an hour or so playing- it progressed to completely remove the ability to speak to any characters- entirely softlocking the game at certain points.It turns out this has been a well-known bug since launch, and after contacting support- they've been able to do nothing for me thus far. As have all the (very kind) people on the internet who tried offering their own fixes. The entire run was unrecoverable, and when i play once more- ill have to start from square one and just hope it doesn't happen again. Don't go through this hassle. Save your money. The devs appear to be more interested in the upcoming DLC than actually fixing things at this point.Edit: Just in case you do happen to get this game and want to avoid the bug I got.It seems like sometimes the phone system will bug out during the cutscene of some quests- particularly start of the Delamain quest 'Ephistory'. Its very hard to notice, but if you see that (after doing a quest and returning to the open world) your phone icon is red and you cant make or receive normal calls: your phone is broken entirely. If that icon sticks around even when you arent currently on a quest- you will not receive any fixer, sidejob, or quest related phone calls- breaking many quests later on. If you DO get a quest phone call after this point- then you will get stuck in a state where the game thinks you're always on the phone with no option to close it- making it impossible to select dialogue or interact with most objects- leaving you softocked if you ever start a quest. In my case- I only noticed the first half of this bug when the second half appeared an hour or so later- when all of my saves before that point were overwitten. So. TLDR: check the phone icon often. Keep many saves. If the phone seems to not work despite you not being in a quest- reload quick to before that was the case."
281,29,Mel,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079745572/,630,25,0,55.2,"Posted: December 19, 2020",734,62,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/2401b22735f38583e04739a87aff6a1774f5be87.jpg,"People say the marketing team absolutely bombed, but in truth; they did their jobs successfully. Never have I seen before the hype surrounding a game cause over half the friends list to preorder it or bring that one friend who has been offline for 1000+ days out of retirement just to purchase it. I have not followed all the trailers and hype myself, but I had to bite the $80 CAD bullet and see what all the hubbub was all about. After completing the main story, notable side quests and some extras 42 hours in, I have some thoughts to share on why I would not recommend Cyberpunk 2077 currently.Cyberpunk 2077 has the ambition to be an amazing open world and RPG and unfortunately falls flat in both genres compared to its competitors in both spaces. Night City is a breathtaking and detailed world with not much to do in actuality other than sightsee and turning the local thugs into cyberpulp. In comparison to GTA, it is a mediocre playground to create your own fun in and the severe lack of minigames to fill the in-between of missions is a downside when considering games like Yakuza have you spending a large portion of your playtime in extracurricular activities willingly. The open world is even a negative to the experience at the times when you end up wanting to minimize the travel to the next side quest so three police officers do not fabricate out of your rectum because you splattered a citizen on a turn due to a combination of the overly zoomed in mini-map and poorly implemented wanted system. Combat is not the greatest either, but I kind of anticipated that since I felt it was the weakest point of Witcher 3. It truly does feel like Skyrim with guns (actual Skyrim with guns, not FC or FO) in all the bad ways. You got iffy gunplay with half-done stealth that you will end up save scumming on. I appreciated the quickhacking, perks (love the perk icon references and song names for certain quests) and cyberware equipment, but it does feel disheartening when simply blasting gets the job done quicker or you hit a stats wall because of the difficulty options + enemy level system that only makes ending the enemies take longer and them ending you shorter with gunfire. The RPG aspect and story has fared better than the open world and I genuinely had an enjoyable time with it. The main story is solid enough to be intriguing and while I did not care too much before about John Wick from Fortnite being a part of the story, he carried the game for me. He is relatively monotone in the dialogue of Cyberpunk 2077 sure, but it was really nice to hear Neo from Payday 2 give his input on the quests and your choices in both the main quests and side quests. Speaking of side quests, Cyberpunk 2077 shares its strong suit with Witcher 3 on spectacular side questlines. The characters involved in the important side questlines are memorable and even the gigs designed for quick loot have tidbits of story within them. Keanu Reeves from the Matrix aside, there were a lot of things that revealed to be inconsequential and made the story and RPG aspect lacking. Most notably the lifepaths. Beyond thirty minutes of gameplay, they mean nothing other than a few dialogue choices. This kills the replayability heavily and it is depressing when RPGs have executed it better with less flash. Dragon Age: Origins from 2009 is still one of the best examples of a well done “lifepath” system in my opinion. Most of the end of quest choices were simply for non-impacting roleplaying purposes or extra rewards and only a couple questlines and endgame choices make a factor in the ending like Witcher 3. Your reputation in this “RPG” game seems inconsequential in general when factions do not fully adapt to your interactions with them, the lack of respect & awe at high street cred and even the main story feels strange when NPCs have forgotten or treat the events of the prologue as yesterday’s news.There are also some other things I would like to mention that are more subjective and varying on the player. The soundtrack outside of the car radio is splendid as there were moments and firefights where I was completely vibing. In particular, there was one segment with a sick cello and even sicker reload animations and you will know which segment I am talking about if you are planning to play or have already played. There is the obvious buggy mess and optimization issues covered by the community in pretty funny videos (can’t wait for the magnum opus that’ll be the Crowbcat video on CP2K77). I have not had too many game breaking issues except for weird physics jacking up the velocity in some spots and causing me to flatline instantly. Lots of immersion breaking stuff though like for example, when my sweater puppies decided to noclip through every shirt equipment because I chose the big bosom option in customization. Performance is subpar and I had around a playable 45fps on a 3600X + GTX 1080 at medium settings 1440p, but I suspect this will be remedied in multiple patches. If the open world and RPG aspect was more fulfilling or the game was stable on release, I would have considered Cyberpunk 2077 to be worthy of a recommend. However, I cannot recommend coughing up $60 USD in its current state over RDR2 or Witcher 3 if you have not bought those already.The true winners are the folks in the future who will buy Cyberpunk 2077 with all the optimization patches, gameplay additions and expansions for $20 USD in a time where GPUs are in surplus."

I just feel bad that it took me 14 hours to realize this.I don't have any technical problems, the game runs smooth, no crashes, no broken quests yet.Sure, not all keys can be remapped, but I got used to it.But the problem is the side quests. 14 hours in the game and the side-quests feel nothing like the ones from WItcher 3, which had a lot of story depth, and I was expecting the same from the same company. These side-quests are more like ""go there, do that"" without much story. More like a checklist. They don't feel part of something more.I feel extremely disappointed, because my expectation were wrong, or I just misinterpreted the news about the game.I know a lot of people can't accept this, but this is not the game of the year. Far from it. Even for me it was very difficult to accept what this game is, because I was also very interested in this game since I saw the first trailer and played the Witcher games.I am glad for the people who enjoy it, and feel sorry for the disappointed ones (I am in the same bucket).-Update-Ok, so I finished the game, and I come with an update to my initial impression.So this is one of the few games I had no more patience to finish it (did it anyway), and to move on to better games.The only acceptable thing are some of the main and side-quests (this is saying a lot about the rest of the game), but even there you don't have too many options. Your choices don't really matter so much, not like in Mass Effect series or in Deus Ex (where if you pay attention to the story, you realize you have to fail a side-quest to avoid something during another main event, or where you have to chose who will die, A or B, but if you search carefully you find an option to save both). In Cyberpunk, the depth of the quests is very lacking for what was advertised.So I stick to what I initially said, side-quests don't have the same dept as the ones from Witcher 3. The clothing items are so bad... you just want to get the most armor but the only way to do that is to look like a clown. In Witcher 3 they had more taste.The vehicle controls are awful, compared with games like Watchdogs (I have played only the first one, and I don't have GTA to compare). Hell, even the hacking is cooler in the first Watchdogs.Very bad hacking minigame and too often. The one from Deus Ex was a fun to play, and just wanted more. At least you had some strategy there, where you could apply modifiers. Here, I want less, it's just the same ""find a pattern to match the shown pattern"". After a while feels like brain damage, doing the same thing over and over, without any variation. As I said, in Deus Ex it is more complex, and really feels challenging and needs some strategy.No skills for stealth, like some ""noise reduction"" or ""stealth takedown"". Plus I was surprised to find out later in the game that hiding in containers non-lethal takedowns invalidates optional ""do not kill"". Just then I realized that the containers kill enemies.So good luck if you try a non-lethal run.You can even kill enemies with blunt weapons (which are described as non-lethal).And you can't takedown like in Deus Ex, with one button. No, you have to grab them, and then decide what to do with them (knock or kill). Because in 2077, you can't think so far in advance.And the police, man the police has personal teleport packs. Strange that the criminality rate is increasing in that case. Maybe they are all bribed. Not sure how to do that myself.Yes, I am sarcastic. In a 2020 game, the police instantly teleports next to you. Damn even in GTA 3 it was more realistic, and that one is really old.Copy/paste gigs, really boring. I am a completionist (even for Witcher games, cleaned the maps), but for this one I barely finished all the gigs (it was like a bad dream that never ends), and for the rest of the blue events, I am not even curious. I have other games to play. When you have a game that is trying artificially to expand the duration, just to have the devs and die-hard CDPR cult fans to say ""look how much content we provide for 60 bucks"", then this is quite sad. And it is even worse when people still defend them, without a real reason. Proof that marketing can brainwash.This game negativity is not so much about bugs, as it is about an unfinished product, and a falsely advertised one. 15M (or whatever M) sales? Yeah, based on a lie. But what is disturbing is not the lie itself, or the final product, no. What is disturbing is people defending this practices. That way, next time CDPR can do a weak product, because they will know that they can get away with it. If the consumers don't make a stand, not so sure about the future of gaming. I am the one talking, with preorder and no refund. But I was duped as a lot of those 15 mil (or 13M or whatever, not sure I really care so much), and had (false) hopes until past the point of no return (14 h in, a lot after the 2h refund policy). But like Johnny said in game ""crash and burn, otherwise it will just get worse for us"" (not sure if the exact words, but it doesn't even matter anymore).And a lot of people say ""how dare you accuse CDPR, our saviours, when ubisoft and EA?"". Well, at least for Ubi and EA you know what to expect. They are constant in their products. They are so low already that the only surprised can be positive ones. But CDPR raised a lot the expectations, just to deliver ... this. So, the higher the stakes, the harder the (deserved) fall.This game is a joke, technical issues aside. It is a joke mostly because I can't understand why some people and publications claim ""best game"" (ever or whatever). I mean, why? Were they paid as part of the marketing campaign? They didn't played any other games? Or is it just that they don't want to accept reality?Game of the year for what? For a beautiful city? I understand that because of the pandemic you can't visit the world, but maybe after the pandemic, try to visit real beautiful places, they could amaze you. And leave for the games the... gameplay and story. Not saying the game worlds should not be beautiful, I am saying it should not be the only factor. Because for a walking sim, yes, Cyberpunk 2077 is the best walking sim of the year.Again, I am not talking at all about tech stuff, I am only talking about game design. There is nothing new in this game (maybe only the need for a good HW to play it).This whole thing looks like a very good marketed amateur product. Because let's be real, if the game would be as good as the marketing, then maybe this game could be better.People are expecting patches for performance and bug fixes. I finished the game with minimal bugs (more like missing features), and I can say that the bug fixes can't make it a better game, except for a ground-up reworks of the game elements.If I preordered (my fault, never preorder), I should expect to what was advertised and payed for. Otherwise, you conned me to buy the product.CDPR did not let anyone to show footage before release, maybe to cover their lie.Anyway, even if you saw footage, I needed 14 hours to realize what this is, and to wake up from the lie. Unfortunately others did not (yet) wake up. Maybe after the dust settles. Here's me, hoping, again. I never learn.I don't hate the game, I hate the lie. I hate how marketing can brainwash so good, that not even the release some people don't want to see the reality.So, 11/10 to CDPR for marketing. 7/10 for final product, not taking bugs into account (with those I would say 5/10). It's a playable game, but there are better games out there to throw your money at, and they deserve it more than this one.This will sadly be the future of gaming - strong marketing focus, not game develpment focus. Because good marketing sells more units."

While I feel really bad for everyone on console, the PC version was doing really well for me. I started playing from 1.06 on and I have been ever since mesmerized with the game, dumping over 320 hours in it since 15.01. and thoroughly enjoying the experience, the city, the story, the character builds and the branching choices and opportunities.The Good:1. The Story and quests - the story is beautifully crafted, believable and wonderfully cyberpunk. Be it in the main story, or the side quests, all of the dialogue is polished and thoroughly enjoyable. The game has 3 different starts (nomad, street kid, corpo-rat), 4 different gender-specific romance options and 2 additional ones (each and every single one coming with a beautifully crafted and believable story) and 5 different endings to explore that shouldn't be rushed and explored over multiple playthroughs. I'm going to go out on a limb and say, do the Bill Jablonsky quest. You will not be disappointed.2. The overall city life experience - I felt that the city is believable and it was so much fun stumbling upon all kinds of events all over the districts. Sometimes the janky driving can actually deprive you from finding some real cool art, loot, character lines, etc. that the developers have so lovingly and cleverly put in the game. While I would agree that there are things missing (wasting money in casinos, slots, etc. - there are such locations in the game), I personally never cared about these activities.3. The combat - the first person experience is amazing. It is difficult enough to keep you occupied, but also not too punishing, especially as you start learning how to use your chosen build's strengths properly. As I have tested it myself from start to finish over these 320 hours, every build is viable and works - from full on get in their faces to picking enemies from distance with snipers and hacks - it is all very enjoyable. Admittedly, some Weapon/perk combinations work better than others, but as this is an RPG, it has to cater to multiple playstyles and playthroughs - and I can tell you, it does.4. Weapons  - this deserves a separate point, as there are no useless weapons in the game and cater to every possible option a player might desire - close combat to long distance sniping. Every weapon can be accommodated in a build and a specific playstyle. Get in their face with bats, katanas, mantis blades or guerilla arms; get in close range with shotguns, pistols, the monowire; be a true soldier behind cover utilizing submachine guns or assault rifles; or just go the sneaky long range sniper route and combine them with silenced weapons to take out enemies from stealth. The variety is great, and the additional weapon variations (power for ricochets, tech for wall penetration and charging for more damage, and smart for no brain aiming while negating enemy's armor) work well towards creating the character that you want.5. The Music - damn if it isn't damn near perfect, it thoroughly deserves the double damn in this sentence (which became a triple damn, and in the brackets, a quadruple damn and with this damn... quintuple...). I listen to some of the tracks almost every day because they are so amazing. Some are good for pumping up, some are chill but they will satisfy fans of almost every genre - from techno and pop to throat-bursting metal. And of course, you can choose which radio station to play based on your mood!All those 5 points are more than enough to create a good open world game to explore and feel sufficiently engaged for many, many hours.The BAD:1. Bugs - let's just get this out of the way and be done with it. Even as of v1.12, there are multiple issues that, at least on PC, thankfully don't take that much out of the experience.2. Missed opportunities - the building blocks for multiple random activities are present, but not implemented, pretty much like in a live service game - ergo, we may or may not see it. There is the opportunity for gambling (casinos, pachinko), playing various mini-games, and various others, but they are simply not implemented. It's clear that the devs thought of adding it, but it was pushed back in the development cycle in favor of more important things.3. The driving - janky at best and you may be stuck in traffic way too often. While the devs really tried to add realism by having heavy traffic between 6 and 9 and 16 and 19, sometimes it clogs up the engine and creates way too many roadblocks (including cars stuck in one place for no reason). While you can roleplay and say that that guy's car just broke down, if you are in a quest that requires driving or chasing enemies... that is way too irritating. Most of the time the best vehicle you can use is a motorcycle to avoid said problems.4. The police system - it is clearly rudimentary, pushed back in the development process and not properly implemented, simply teleporting police officers in your vicinity, including in closed rooms. Nope. Bad development work on this one. Just nope!5. The 3 different starts - nomad, street kid and corpo could have had more impact than just 1 measly side quest at a certain point of the game. I really hoped for more quests based on it, and not just random lines in dialogue that sometimes amount to nothing. Based on dialogue alone, corpo is the best starting option, as that life path really allows you to deal with multiple problems.Conclusion:I had and still am having a blast with this game, over 300 hours in. I always want to double or triple my cash investment in game hours, and in Cyberpunk 2077 I can see myself dumping over 600 hours exploring, testing various character builds, and even more with the free DLCs that are coming. I can only hope the game will get better and better from now on. Once again, I am very sorry for my friends on console, but... I have a PC, I bought the game on PC and I need to judge it as I experienced it on PC, which started from a 7/10 on patch 1.06 and is now sitting on a  since patch 1.11. I am positive that with the right additions and DLCs, CDPR will get this game into 10/10 status."
285,29,♠.brT,https://steamcommunity.com/id/brtftw/,174,12,1,430.0,"Posted: April 17, 2021",275,22,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/1093545b7a2eb512da1d5f873585eeb953619690.jpg,"I first learn about Cyberpunk like a lot of people did, some 7 years ago or so, when they released that announcement trailer. That trailer was the only thing i knew about this game for 7 years. I didn't read a single article talking about the game, didn't watch a single trailer after that point. I didn't even know the name of the main character or what the plot was going to be about. and what a blessing that was.   By starting the game in such a situation i had no expectation for the game, and was able to simply sit back and let the game show me what it had to offer.                                                                                                       Cyberpunk is a videogame, not a world where you can jump into and lose yourself in order to live it like if it was a simulation. The game is designed to be played for its story, with sidequests to provide a bit of backstory for the world, but more important, give the players the means that the player needs to just have a bit of fun with its fantastic combat system.   Cyberpunk 2077 Combat system is fantastic, I was specially surprised with its gunplay. Usually in a game like this i'd expect the gunplay to be the weakest link, due to the nature of stat base shooters creating, well bullet spongies. Not in Cyberpunk, the guns (as long as they are in the correct level) will feel like actual weapons, and the damage they are inflicting feels authentic, as long as you keep your weapon at the correct level, and get the right perks, bullet spongies will only really be a thing for the ""Boss"" fights that you will run into ocasionally. Cyberpunk has some light RPG elements, so don't go into this game expecting deep character builds like in Skyrim, It has less RPG depth than Skyrim, but more than the newer Far Cry games. Its there to provide a bit of diversity of playstyles but not to drag you into a hole of complex character builds where it becomes the complete focus of the game.Cyberpunk story is fantastic, i really liked it, its not about saving the world, and it doesn't end like that either, its a very authentic story for the world where its based. And through out the story you'll meet characters that are genuinely interesting and complex, its not really surprising to me, CDPR knows how to write good characters they have done before in The Witcher 3, and they kept that quality here. Every single character, even relatively minor characters you meet have fascinating story to tell, and by the end of it i was left wanting for more of those characters, which for me its a mark of success for a story in a videogame.Cyberpunk 2077 to me has some of the best graphics i have ever seen in a videogame, sometimes when i'm driving around i have to stop and just admire the amazing city that they created in this game, it looks really good. I don't have RTX on, but boy this game makes me a bit jealous of those who can turn that feature on. But even without RTX, the game looks amazing and that's all i can really ask for. Other than maybe asking for an  RTX card lol.When it comes to Performance the game is running okay on my computer, its not the best computer ( Ryzen 2700 16GB of RAM with 5700 XT), so i can't complain too much about the performance, but i heard people with more powerful rigs having issues so your mileage may vary. When it comes to bugs, this is where Cyberpunk becomes a bit of a rough diamond, its beautiful, and definitely worth having, but there are some rough edges that you have to watch out for.I encounter a lot of bugs while playing, but most of those bugs were not that big of an issue for me, they were small annoyances here there, but nothing that would prevent me from enjoying the game. The slightly more annoying issues like quests getting stucked or something like that, were relatively easy to solve, by just reloading a savegame.However the trick for me is to not look for bugs, if you stand and look at the NPCs walking you'll see problems, if you hang around in an area, you'll see things breaking, So my advice is this, don't look behind the curtain, just enjoy the magic show, or in the other words, don't look for the bugs, just try and move past them so you can have a more fun experience."

Ignore the reviews that say there isn't anything to do. There is plenty. The side stories are EXTREMELY well written, the gigs and side jobs are fun and different with enough variation to keep them fresh. The world and characters are very believable and I honestly felt connected to them in ways I have never experienced before. The music is great! As a metal head, I never thought I would ever hear Dark Funeral outside of youtube/spotify/concerts, but hot damn, they got it on Ritual.FM.The gunplay is standard fare for the FPS/RPG hybrid, think Fallout 4 but twice as good. The guns have weight and recoil realistically instead of the same recoil animation playing over and over. The enemies, while kinda spongy, are diverse and require different methods to overcome on higher difficulties. The hacking is great, hands down one of my favorite parts of the game. I give it a 10/10.  And for those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about hardware, I did my playthrough on a Shadow VM which uses an Intel Xeon (8 cores at 2.5 GHz) an NVIDIA Quadro P5000 and 12 GB of RAM and had high, stable FPS @ 1080P on high settings and only had big dips in the very center of the city with traffic out the wazoo. Your mileage may vary, but my close friends have all had great results too. Not a single crash, minimal bug experience, though I will say I did have a persistent bug with the UI that I had to semi-frequently quicksave and reload, but nothing even close to gamebreaking."

The plot progresses when you want it to progress, if you want to do other things, no problem. Also no constant action, there are times when you just drink beer in a motel and that's immersive. You build friendship, you explore the world - that part was done very nicely.- Combat is satisfactional. There is decent amount of guns to choose from and they all fall from one of categories. There are weapons that ricochet, penetrate though walls, auto-aim enemies... pick your poison. The only problem with combat is that if you want to have action... you need to look for it. Gangs are not hostile from start, so you need to find a group and pick a fight. And because they are neutral towards you, a frag to their feet makes them explode in a second - where is fun with that? I would like to see more gang-wars areas, where the constant action is happening. Now we have random events where some people are fighting police or other gangs, but that's something you have to find and not always is at hand. But that's only a problem when you are really blood-thirsty, usually those random events are enough to satisfy (at least me) and move forward with whatever I'm doing in the game.And I must say that the immersion from picking a new weapon and watching the ""prepere to fire-up"" animation is just great!- Stealth is okay, I guess. Hacking is a nice tool helping you with it, beucase at first you can hack devices in the area to distract opponents, allowing you to pass. Later on you can make them blind, what kinda feels like invisiblity from deus ex - but hey, those are the tools. The only problem with sneaking is... level design. Most location that encourage you to play stalthy have 70% of enemies turned by their back to you, making the whole experience super easy and not rewarding. Not all locations are like that, but quite a few.- World is not as populated as on first trailers, but that depends on location. There are crowdy areas (in mega-blocks or marketplaces), but some are rather empty (outskirts of the city). That option can be also changed in settings, I play on max and can't really complain much on density of population. - I'm not a dedicated driver, I haven't played in any racing game since childhood, but I must say that I have fun while driving though Night City. Faster cars are obviously much harder to control, not to mention how hard is to stop the car from full speed to zero, but hey, that's part of having the fast car :). At first I was mostly fast-traveling, but I quickly noticed that there is a lot going on in the city - and that content would be missed if travelling that way. - Bugs are there, but bugs can and probaby will be fixed. I was able to beat the game without any major problem, so that's something. Nowadays almost every game on Day 0 is released in less or more buggy state and while I don't defend CD PROJECT here - I think the game is in good enough condition to be playable. On previous release date it was obviously much worse :P- There are TONS of content in terms of world-building. Many articles, textbooks, emails or text-messeges left here and there for you to explore. There is the internet - and websites are changing as you progress though the quests, so that's a nice addition.- Flesh-modification is a nice addition, but I think it could be explore further. In comparison to Deus-Ex I believe Deus-Ex comes on top. Here we have mostly passive-bonuses, apart of legs and arms modification, I don't believe there are many active-actions to be unlocked here. That's a bit dissapointing.There are more aspects of the game I haven't talk about, but I don't have a whole day for it :) Go and expore, you won't regreat it. Singleplayer games are definitely not dead :)For now: 8/10"

Not all of them have been met, still CD Projekt RED has created a stunning video game. An immersive and stunningly crafted RPG, which has raised the bar for cinematic quality in open-world games.But maybe rather than saying a pure ""RPG"" I want to say, it is more like an ""Action-RPG"" Because, the choices we make do not shape the world around us unlike most of the other RPGs on the market but ofcourse we, distribute the experience points we gain to our skills. Even in some tasks, we have the opportunity to persuade the other person just by speaking without any fight. Our choices determine the destiny of some people, yes. Also the background we choose at the beginning of the game change our character's dialogue options but still they are not strong enough and few to say Cyberpunk 2077 is a pure RPG. So even though the RPG side is not as strong as its promised Cyberpunk is still a very solid and stunning game and I think this is more important thing. Just be aware of the bug issues though but they are not at the level of gamebreaking, like in the AC Valhalla for example. It's quite odd that nobody is mentioning about the serious bugs Valhalla had that causes you to close the game or restart the whole mission but everybody talks about the basic bugs in Cyberpunk like where your dong is clipping through your pants Even though one of the real problem is AI. Anyways... where were we. I am addicted to this world and everything in it, it is a brutal, dirty, naughty, hyper capitalist world to live in. Cyberpunk mostly feels like a constant emotional elevator thanks to the writing and the dialogs in the quests. Those quests can be emotional, funny, dark, exciting, and sometimes all of those things at once. Every quest every mini side quest literally everything in this game has a background. I think that's one of the strongest and greatest part of this game. Even if you watch the news in a random TV you find in open world you will learn lots of stuff about the world you are living in and lots of references to our real life. Rpg elements in character progression system is quite good. You can choose how you want to play the game. There are good quantity of builds that you can create. Most basic ones are stealth, melee, shotgun, rifle, handgun, hacker and so on. Those basic builds even branches off within itself so you can combine few things in your basic build as well. All of these builds are different from each other and to get maximum efficiency from your build all of them requires special items to build up. Thats why this might give you a reason to play the game again and you can make different choices in dialogs to see different results while you are playing again. Even though the choices you are going to make won't effect the core ending, at least you would be able to see what different things happens to some of the important characters or companies with this way.  There are five core endings, which include the secret ending. But for four of these endings, there's also one more choice you'll need to make, so there are various different outcomes to be had for each of them. And before finishing this mini review I want to mention one more thing: I would like to give extra credits for this amazing Turkish translation. I don't know how the other tranlations were but if they are like the turkish one, then that would make the game even better.: 8.5/10"

Just reached over 1,000+ hours in Cyberpunk 2077... :)UPDATE: 2,500+ hours now!""Can't stop diggin' Night City!"" - as Jackie Welles says during the prologue :')The game could have been better, and I KNOW it will be better, yet I still enjoy it for what it is. Living that mercenary fantasy - a cybernetically-enhanced badass!EDIT: After Patch 1.5 (and now 1.6) the game is simply stunning! It's fundamentally better. I love the energy of CP2077's new Game Director, Gabriel Amatangelo; that man has stepped up, giving the game what it deserves. Soon we'll be getting a complete re-work of the police system, along with vehicle-to-vehicle combat, bigger MaxTac presence and other highly requested features by the community. I can't wait.Now, I could write a huge, in-depth review of why I love this game so much, despite all the backlash it's gotten from various fans, false promises / false marketing, etc... we all know that story, right?... But my game hours should speak for themselves. This is just my opinion.In short, this game's graphics (especially when maxed out in 4K, HDR, DLSS and RTX, it becomes a technological marvel. Its atmosphere, immersion, deep & dark story, complex lore, characters, soundtrack, hidden secrets and overall gameplay replay-ability have left their mark on me. There's a certain comfort to Night City that I can't quite describe. Which is strange, because the city itself is a f*cked up place. Driving at night through the city streets, the various districts, the Badlands, etc... feels nostalgic and somehow relatable.I love trying out different builds, tactics, choices, reading everything, looting everything... I like to roleplay my characters' builds based on my chosen lifepaths. There is Nomad, Streetkid and Corpo. Each has a different intro, along with different dialogue options during main / side quests / gigs which either gives more insight when dealing with the respective faction, or unlocks entirely new, unique outcomes. The only other games that have left me in a similar state of passion and addiction have been TESV: Skyrim, Mass Effect trilogy, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and a few others... Even now, after 2000+ hours, I'm discovering new things!There are many great games that I've re-played numerous times in the past, but not to this extent! And certainly not in such a short amount of time. There's also mod support, which is pretty cool! UPDATE: As of Patch 1.6, we have official mod tools. REDMod has been released, which, with time, will bring Bethesda-level modding capabilities to CP2077. I've been playing since launch, and somehow I've come across very little bugs / glitches. Also NO crashes! Lucky me, I guess... :) Makes me wonder if the game really is as buggy as it's made out to be... The less Reddits / social media posts I read, the more I enjoy the game. But this is just my personal, biased experience running on a relatively high-end PC.I'm just here to leave my positive review and show my support. I should have done it a long time ago, but I thought I'd leave it until I hit a big milestone... Which is now, as of this review, 1,000 hours! What a beautiful number! Maybe now my review holds more ""weight"" ... I hope more people decide to try the game for themselves and not have their experience ruined by the internet... I know CDPR are hard at work with the new patches, free DLC and expansion(s), I've been watching Pawel Sasko's streams (Quest Director at CDPR) and I trust him over any leaks / speculations and other crap you might come across on the internet...I know for a fact that there's still many more hours left for me in this Cyberpunk 2077 universe. :) Possibly hundreds! Looking forward to the expansion, Phantom Liberty. I hear its size will be in between The Witcher 3's Hearts of Stone / Blood & Wine expansions. For the best news updates with perfect track record, I suggest Tyler McVicker, Kazuliski and LastKnownMeal. Check them out on YouTube. They are also great with lore.""A Thing of Beauty, I Know, Will Never Fade Away"" - SAMURAI :')"

HOWEVER a few small bugs like flying cigars or an eventual flying weapon glitch might be seen during your playthrough.By now you probably know you that in this game you play as V, a mercenary in Night City who gets caught up in a conspiracy that could change the city forever a very old pertaining philosophical question of when life begins - but with a twist! Now the more contemporaneous question would be: if another person's conscience was being uploaded in your brain, when would your life end and their life begin again?The characters you meet along the way are mostly unique and interesting, and the voice acting is top-notch. E.g: Keanu Reeves plays Johnny Silverhand and - let me tell you - he absolutely kills it.Cyberpunk 2077 customization options are numerous, allowing you to create a character that looks like they've been through the wringer and come out the other side stronger than ever. And let's be real, who likes cyberpunk and doesn't want to give themselves some cybernetic enhancements and become a total badass? And if you're really into the cyberpunk vibe, you need to check out Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. It's an anime set in the same world as the game and makes the whole experience even richer!The gameplay is just as wild as the world it's set in. You'll be shooting, hacking, and sneaking your way through Night City, taking down anyone who stands in your way. With that said even with all the technical corrections Cyberpunk 2077 still carries the scars of a game that was rushed: most vendors in the streets are not interactive and just exist for showing but the player is unable to even speak to them, which makes some streets feel a bit depthless/one-dimensional. There is also a very silly flaw: you are in a futuristic city where people can change almost anything in their bodies however there is not option of listening to radio songs while you're walking/ running around! It's like no one ever invented even a simple walkman!With all that said, fortunately there are mods to fix those flaws (check out nexus mods for more).So if you're looking for a game that will transport you to a neon-soaked dystopian future, where you can hack, shoot, and enhance your way into becoming an overpowered Behemoth, then Cyberpunk 2077 is the game for you. Just buckle up and enjoy the ride!"

In a very bad way. Once you get to the end of the 1st act, you won't be able to experience the story without grinding out levels (not items, levels). There's a point in the game where you can use a super high powered charge sniper rifle, and you don't even one shot unarmored human enemies with full charge headshots.That is my only problem with the game, and many games have destroyed themselves by using this formula. The assassins creed series has fundamentally been degraded strictly because of the levelgating formula they adopted, and that feeling is present here. Levelgating in a story heavy game is very detrimental to the experience, it takes away from your feeling of being skilled because an arbitrary number says you can't win this fight yet.If you're looking for a recommendation on whether or not you should purchase this game, you shouldn't. Not right now. Wait for these problems to be addressed.Post Game Edit:Now that I've completed the game, I can see why they wanted to inhibit the player from powering through it. Without spoiling anything, the quality of ending you get is dependent on how many of those ""side jobs"" you do. As I mentioned however I have a personal vendetta against levelgating, and this reason doesn't excuse it."

Jump out to the options and set everything to Low and still only get around 30-50fps. There does not seem to be further options to disable things like AA so I can't test any lower settings to where the game is smooth. Setting lower resolutions only results in stretched images as they do not maintain perspective on resolution change nor does DSR seem to be supported supported. Explicitly setting exe profile in Nvidia Control Panel makes no difference either.After another driver reinstall, system restart and setting the textures to Low as well now (prior to loading into the game, since they cannot be changed once in a game :/) I can get around 50-60fps, yet the entire experience feels super laggy still. Mouse movement is delayed or something else causing latency, even after disabling auto-aiming and trying a higher response rate on mouse. Just walking around the bar area at the start feels like my balance is off. Recommended settings? .. No, I don't think soBare minimum settings? .. Perhaps, if you don't care if your game is responsive or not.An extremely disappointing experience that is just not enjoyable to play in the current state.

And certainly not ""a next generation of open world adventure"", quite behind the competition actually. Story and characters are the highlight of this title. If you stick to the main quest and scripted content you can actually get immersed for a bit before the game kicks you out from this oblivious state with bugs, bad design and poor technical state of open world. You get 3 lifepaths which are short and matter little. Endings are 5 afaik. 2 are always on the table, 2 you get from side quest and one you get if you are nice enough to Johnny. What happens at the end you decide in one conversation :)  So, I dare to say this game is pretty linear. World building is questionable. One of trailers highlighted gangs of the Night City. Do they matter? Do they give quest? Nope. Just targets for your guns. Kill 100 and they won't mind. Another highlighted NetWatch and the danger of pissing them off. You can also scrap that. They and the Voodoo Boys are in one mission and it doesn't matter who you kill and you can kill both. Trauma Team? They never drop by for the people you try to flatline. They do sometimes show up around a city which is nice. Perhaps Militech? The biggest foe of Arasaka also largely opts out of the game. Only Aldecaldos are fleshed out. Quality side missions are far and few between. Most of them are extremely boring (kill X, grab Y, release Z) with no story and rarely extend beyond one location. Missions where you have any branching choices are like... two?  By sheer coincidence the more fleshed ones were showcased before the release. I tried to do them all but at one point I simply had enough and decided to go for the ending. That said good stuff do exist, it is just very hard to find it on the map. Few examples. Repenting murderer is probably something people mention a lot. Another one is the search for Swedenborg-Rivera - very cheeky, my favorite. Both of them have no actual combat which is rare. Then there is a side story related to Jefferson Peralez which presents interesting conspiracy to work through but unfortunately does not give player any payoff and just leaves things hanging. Searching for detective Ward's nephew was also an impressive quest. AI in Cyberpunk 2077 is more A than I. Enemies behave poorly during combat. NPCs are just weirdly behaving background. Vehicles do not know what to do with themselves and, outside of the scripted content, player is the only person to ride a bike. Because AI is what it is wanted system is extremely simplistic as well. Badges just teleport behind your back and engage immediately. They do not give chase, do not ride cars, do not drop from AVs. Also far cry from corrupt police sending ""powerful people"" after the player which was promised.Shooting is kind of fun, although you get very powerful, very quickly. Most of engagements offer very little in terms of targets. Usually like 5-6 hostiles max. The best mission in this regard is the infiltration of Arasaka's warehouse. We have large space to work with, lots of enemies and even a mech to shoot at :) I didn't try hard to melee but I had gorilla arms and it was fun to use them from time to time. Without committing yourself to certain perks you can die easily in a world where most enemies prefer to shoot. UI is Rockstar level bad. Wanna quickly check the map? Click M. Wanna go back to the game? M again? No! ESC. Twice! Minimap does not zoom out during driving therefor at high speeds you get your directions way too late. You can craft ammo in the game. But nowhere in the crafting menu you can see how much ammo do you have and how much you are crafting. You can push a button to answer calls... but if you don't the game answers calls anyway! xD Sometimes during other missions and/or conversations. My V had conversation with Judy while simultaneously talking to Delamain and with Goro while talking to detective Ward. And for the love of god, Regina, please stop harassing me with your calls. You have missions to acquire new means of transportation. Nothing exciting, you got to place X, pay for the car or bike and there you go. But in the mission menu you cannot see how all of that junk looks like. You have to go to another menu and find text message from your fixer. And so on.Last thing. It is one of the most visually impressive games released so far. It is clear now why there was so precious little gameplay before the release and what we have seen was carefully edited. Clearly, large amounts of tomfoolery were flying behind the scene. Some day we will read a nice article about it. Do I recommend it? For the price, no! Wait and buy with a discount. By that time most bugs will be fixed. Unfortunately game will never be what was promised but at least it will be a decent experience."

Yes, it's just a game, there's so many things we could imagine and maybe one day get to play in a better way, but altogether it's not even close to bad like some people are screaming and atmosphere you get when you scratch the surface a bit deeper is amazing. Reminds me, in a way, of VtM: Bloodlines... and that's a good thing, even if it took mods and community patches to get that one into shape. That said, I've personally experienced only some minor glitches so far, even if I've heard from other people they were not so lucky."

Since it is a story driven game where you have to complete certain side-quests to unlock different endings, I have to say it is well written with interesting character development. Especially when you have Keanu Reeves constantly showing up and giving you feedback. Now, when I say bugs in the game it doesn't mean it's unplayable. Its just annoying and sometimes hilarious. If you can ignore those and just enjoy the game, there is plenty to like. The graphics is great (especially with Ray Tracing), the leveling is also quite helpful in certain situations, and the stories are varied even if some of em are repetitive but it's an open world game what did you expect? The game play is also good and smooth, but there isn't anything groundbreaking or new. And don't bother to buy any cars since driving is quite awful, I just use the fast travel system.All in all, I think they did miss on what was promised as a game and hyped it up a lot. But this isn't as bad as No Man's Sky and it's still a decent triple A game with a lot more fixes to be done. If you haven't bought the game, I would recommend waiting for them to release more patches or when they have discounts. Who knows, they might throw in some extra content to entice you."

Just Run&Gun everything down? Include Robot-Bodyparts so you can punch people across whole apartments? There are sooooo many possibiltys. I've found the Looting System and Money-System kind of irritating and not completly thought out but overall Cyberpunk 2077 makes a lot of fun.Patch 1.5 made this game actually playable and I'm so happy I gave this one a second chance.

Not an unplayable mess either.There seems to be two things mainly irritating people, the bugs and performance. You need a good rig to play it, sadly they've lied about the specs, so don't trust them (I play on a RTX 3070, runs fine). Bugs are plentiful, but i haven't had any problems with them really.Saying it's bad would seem like lying to myself, as I've played it for 20 hours in the short time it has been out. However it is a disappointment, and it feels like so much wasted potential. They've tried to pull off so many things at the same time game-play wise, but it ended up all just being above average. If they had just delayed the game indefinitely at the very start, and released it when it was truly ready, we'd probably all have been better off.The best part of the game is the very alive conversation, the first person view approach coupled with amazing animations make talking to the NPCs quite cool. However outside of quests the world falls kind of short, here it feels like they really could've picked up some inspiration from a game like RDR2. Little things, like ordering a shot at a bar and seeing your character do it isn't there. Instead you just get thrown into a buy menu with alcohol. This isn't bad, but it's more of an RPG experience than the ""immersive"" cyberpunk game they were selling. To take this example further it makes the bars a place to go to pickup short buffs, not a nice place to visit just because. Exactly this feeling gets repeated in other things, like food stalls and such.I had expected Witcher-esk RPG elements in the combat, items and leveling, not the city. It looks to me as they were quite torn in whether they would focus on making an RPG or an immersive cyberpunk game, a good example would be clothing. Instead of making it more of a cosmetic aspect, or a game-play influencing part where stats mattered, they mixed it. So... there are loads of pretty cheap but random pieces of clothing at a store, and they nearly all have one stat: armor. It kind of brings out the worst in both options. You'll have a headache if you're going for style, as you'll try to balance a theme and actual good armor rating. And on the other hand ""min/maxing"" or putting on the piece of equipment with the highest armor stat is just a bit plain, and not at all as cool as other RPGs where you can really feel the impact of what you wear.All in all, it feels like a game that lacks a true identity, or at least tries to be many things but doesn't perfectly score at anything. Is it worth the price? not really, wait until things get fixed and it'll be a pretty okay game worth buying. But it probably won't ever be the masterpiece so many people anticipated."

Love the cyberpunk setting, and it feels like it  have been such a good game. It's just....disappointing. I'm not even talking bugs, which aren't really a big issue on PC (though I did have a conversation with a headless torso at one point).There's no faction reputation system, or even personal reputation. There're less RPG elements than in games like Fallout 4 that got derided for their RPG system. The loot system is just pathetic, with more medical items than you could ever hope to use even on the hardest difficulty and an ocean of loot so forgettable you forget about it as soon as you pick it up. Police literally just spawn in beside you when a crime is committed; no need for a witness or anything, you can be at the top of a building and suddenly they're there. 95% of all the doors are just for show. Outside of story missions there's just nothing. The world feels hollow.Mechanically, the AI is terrible and the combat system is surprisingly weak. The stealth system is just tacked on and feels half-finished. Gunplay is atrocious, melee is literally a case of ""walk up and spam left-click"" that feels shallower even than vanilla Skyrim. Hacking, which is part of the charm of similarly set games like Shadowrun, is nothing more than a menu where you can you can tag enemies or cause some minor status effects. More than anything it resembles a simpler version of the remote control drones from TC: Ghost Recon, except without any movement or anything distinctive. The minigame used for breach protocol or access points is both easy and generic, especially compared again to games like Shadowrun (even worse when considering the Shadowrun games were made by a studio with a fraction of CDPR's resources) that employed similar types of hacking minigames.Honestly, they could rescue this. Witcher proves they can make better AI and combat than this, a better open world than this, better quests than this. As it is though, it's just too disappointing to recommend."

Basic things such as factions, customization, even part of melee combat (katana supposed to be able to block bullets) are missing or barely implemented. The 3 life paths you chose? Only affects the first 20 minutes, it looses basically all meaning after that. Prime example? Take street rat life path, Parde will still treat you like its your first meeting if you meet him later on.The prologue? well it didnt have any meaning, you get a several month time skip shown to you in a few cutscenes, icing on the cake is that characters make mention to events you didnt even know happened or are shown in a 10 second scene before flashing to the next one.Performance issues are a dime a dozen, many players are unable to even run the game. Bugs plague the entire game, many of which game breaking and requiring a save reload (such as getting stuck in a window and not being able to move). Combat such as attempting to use the Mantis blades, sprinting while attacking an enemy cause an animation lock where you stab your blades into the enemy and lift him/her into the air for 10 secs all while in the middle of enemy fire. I have died so many times to this I stopped trying to role play a cyborg character and used a katana instead.AI is a mess, cops teleport behind players with no chase or anything. Cars do not have basic avoidance system and if you park a bike at the side of the road, you will cause a massive traffic jam. Enemies are brain dead and dont respond to stimuli during combat at all, and yet can somehow spot a dead body through walls (floors even). The story while somewhat engaging, is a mess when you look deeper into it. Big dystopian world with mega corporations holding the leash? Cool story, except you will only be dealing with a single corporation your entire game. There is no secret conspiracy theory that turned out to be true, no real engaging element. Its just Johnny is in your head, gonna kill you, join his vedenta against Arasaka, help Arasaka or just plain ol shoot yourself in the head instead?Did I have fun? Maybe? I went into cyberpunk without much expectations and did not really watched any videos. It had its moments but I can safely say, unless CDPR is willing to overhaul the entire game system such as AI, police response, customization and most importantly, story and factions, Cyberpunk 2077 isn't going anywhere."

It's been more than a year since the game come out. I refuse to believe your team spent over a year just fixing bugs. That would be embarrassing. We want more interactivity, more customization (hair salons, plastic surgery), better AI, better police (car chases), expanded romances, with options to actually interact with them at our apartment and in the city. Why can't we invite the romance option to our apartment to shag? Or kiss them or hug them or do ANYTHING with them after their quests are completed!? They all just stay in their apartment or camp, and repeat the same few lines of dialogue. Give us a more interactive Night City. Let us actually sit and order food at restaurants with animations... you know, like those that ALREADY exist in the game. Let us go to night clubs and sit and have a drink, let us interact with dancers at strip clubs. Let us have those one night stands you talked about years ago and showed in the E3 gameplay reveal. Let us interact with furniture more. Let us sit on chairs, benches, let us lie on our bed without having to go to sleep. Give us a lot more MEANINGFUL side quests, with branching stories and the ability for us, the player, to influence the direction of those stories, and fewer boring ""gigs"", the ability to purchase more apartments etc etc etc.Next, do SOMETHING to fix the HORRIBLE pacing and the irritating sense of urgency. After the mission to rescue Sandra, have Jackie just text us the next morning telling us that he returned the car to us, and then just let the player decide when they want to call Jackie. Maybe I don't want to meet him the very next morning. Maybe I want to explore that first part of the city for a few days, and then call Jackie after like a week. This leads me to my next point: LET US REFUSE TO ANSWER PHONE CALLS! What's the point of giving us the 'answer' button, when we MUST answer each time!? Let us refuse phone calls, and then later call the NPC at OUR convenience.Have the NPC/Companion/Fixer etc. call us, and if we refuse, they can just send us a short message saying ""Call me back when you have the time."" Maybe I want to call them in 2 days. This would fix A LOT of pacing issues, and not make the player feel so stressed out, like they always have to rush and do these jobs quickly.I was barely able to explore the city, without feeling stressed out, because I had these urgent jobs and the YOU KNOW WHAT from the main quest always pressuring me. Like, I never felt right just exploring, knowing what was happening to V. I knew that I should not be prancing around a beach, when I had the URGENT main quest to do. Ignoring it felt stupid.Next, fix the way we interact with Johnny. After that first night when he reveals himself to us all angry, he and the player are in A REALLY bad relationship, right? So, then the very next morning we get a phone call from Goro to meet him at that diner. If we go there, the convo we have with Johnny flows natural and V is angry and mistrustful towards him. However, we also get a call from Delamain that same morning to go get our car. So, if we go do that first, V talks to Johnny like they are already friends, which is super immersion breaking. Fix that somehow. Let Johhny start appearing only after we've done the first few main quest missions or something.Also, I don't know if it's just me, but the journal in this game is terrible. It's close to being useless. Like, most of the time it doesn't even tell you what the mission is, who gave it to you, or why you need to do something. It just has some clever little monologue by Jackie or Johnny. So, if you decided to leave some mission for later, then, when you finally decide to do it, but you've forgotten what it was about, chances are that the journal will tell you nothing useful. Rewrite that, if you can. Man, I could rant for hours. Oh yeah, expand on those few endings that are such obvious cliffhangers. Give us at least ONE good one. Man."

I didn't really play the Witcher games aside from idling for the Steam cards but I have played pretty much every Fallout game to completion besides Tactics, BOS and '76, as well as all the Deus Ex games and Alpha Protocol so I feel like I'm pretty well versed in the the type of game this was trying to be. I'll say right away, this ain't it. It tries to be it, in some spots, but it fails even by the standard that the original Deus Ex set 20 years ago.Keen observers - or anyone who followed the heavy marketing blitz - will note that the game's own copy no longer calls it an RPG. It *kind of* is one: it has skill trees and you can make builds, and there are definitely choices you can make and there are pitfalls/trap skills (this mostly has to do with skills that plain do not work rather than useless skills like Deus Ex's swimming though something similar is present). However these choices are pretty limited. A running joke is how these sorts of games will provide you with a door to break open, a computer to hack or a vent to crawl through as gameplay choices. Cyberpunk often reduces further to ""door you open with Technical Ability"" versus ""door you force open because you are Strong enough"". Hacking has combat applications but I rarely found it helpful as a progression tool; I mainly used it as a source of making money.There are a variety of combat systems and while I found the melee to be too clunky and imprecise, the shooting is competent enough and you can make a variety of extremely broken shooty builds. I eventually settled on a shotgunner build that had a ton of speed bonuses stacked that also gave bonus damage for maximum hilarity. You can invest heavily in tech weapons that pierce walls or homing weapons that do less damage but fire seeking bullets, or just straight up become full hacker dude and kill everything from a computer interface outside of any given combat area.Cyberpunk includes a very terrible attempt at a loot game style itemization. Items have rarity and stats based on rarity, but it doesn't do the sensible thing of gating item rarity by level so you can very well find a low level Legendary gun that becomes useless very early on along with level capped white or green items. The even more sensible thing would be to not have this sort of dumb itemization in the first place. You can bypass this sytem with crafting, which, mind bogglingly, has a whole tree tied to it. The game is never really hard enough that you need to invest in crafting, but going deep in it fundamentally upends the economy and further trivializes difficulty. It is also the only way you can make use of some of the game's rewards; often your reward for exploring somewhere is a legendary blueprint that you cannot do anything with without a nearly maxed out crafting tree.So it's kind of not great as an RPG, but Cyberpunk also advertises itself as ""the next generation of open world gaming"" and that might be even more laughable. Night City is large, sure, and it's pretty well designed and vibrant but also completely dead. NPCs and vehicles are basically animated props with no real AI and spawn/despawn based on line of sight and the police/wanted system is so non-functional it makes you wonder why it's even there. Aside from the icons that litter your map there's very little to find/explore and even by that standard it's worse than your average Ubisoft factory slurry game.I've basically spent hundreds of words saying why this game sucks, but I'm still sorta recommending it because I enjoyed a lot of the quests and the main quest, while deeply flawed like so much of this game, was intriguing enough. A lot of the game's main characters are pretty well fleshed out. As far as story choices go, this game fails to deliver even on the illusion of choice. I'm not expecting Alpha Protocol levels of reactivity here across a 100 hour game but it can't even achieve the level of a Mass Effect ""you get a different email based on how this quest finished 20 hours ago"". Hell even during most quests or quest chains you will rarely be presented with a story choice or a way to affect how things play out; most of what is actually possible to change was showed off in E3 demos years ago and is almost entirely frontloaded in the first act. I will at least give them credit for having the ending missions and cinematics that diverge quite drastically and do change based on what sidequests you did.I didn't encounter too many bugs, and almost all of the ones I did were weird clipping issues/T posing etc that would get fixed by quickly reloading my last save. Saving is quick and easy and the game also autosaves often, thankfully. Had quite a few crashes but those mainly happened during loading screens or when the game decides it doesn't like when I Alt-Tab.If you kind of remove it from the absurd marketing hype, Cyberpunk is kind of okay? It was interesting enough for me to finish at least. I would wait for a sale; if you own and haven't played any Fallout or Deus Ex games play those first especially if it's New Vegas or the original Deus Ex/Human Revolution. Supposedly CDPR might revamp this game further down the line but I think too many of its features and systems are broken as is to really expect much and they have said themselves their focus is fixing the console versions rather than addressing any systemic design issues."

Let’s see what I think about it.We are V, our past changes our path, our future is up to us to decide but our objective is clear, as a mercenary looking for our big opportunity to become a legend in Night City, one of the latest Megalopolis that exist in the US, we will do whatever it takes to get the job done.One day our big opportunity comes, a risky but well planned contract, a hit that will shake Arasaka. Preparations go well and the mission too but something unexpected happens and changes everything, this is now a much serious business. After this job nothing will be the same, not only for those around you and Night City itself, but also for you, this job triggered a race against time to uncover a conspiracy and save your own life. The question is, will you follow your own path or will you listen to the voices of the past? Main story is really great, in general I felt the pace was correct and long enough to not feel excessively long. Main story is important but don’t forget about the Gigs but more importantly side-quest lines, not only they are amazingly well written they also have amazing characters, situations and special dialogs, a big part of my time has been spent in this kind of activities, each character has an special line you should follow but the outcome is always the same, no matter what happens, Night city always destroy those who matter to you.Sidequests are full of Love, hate, sadness, despair, joy, all the feeling spectrum is present and some moments will hit as hard as a rock in this dense but obscure world which I’m going to be talking about right now. The world is a very different place in 2077, multiple armed conflicts have torn the land apart, mega-corporations control everything and Night City is one of the latest megalopolis in the US; Cultures from all over the globe and their respective perspectives of religion, tradition or language merge with an aggressive, violent and sexualized publicity designed for an extreme consumerism, in this society there are no limits, rules are different and while every area is distinctive and unique, the same kind of marketing will pop-up everywhere. Speaking of distinctive areas, Night City sure is a diverse environment, separated in 5 main districts and 17 inner districts within the city you will see a lot of cultural changes from one side of the river to the other.Not only the cultural roots are different (American, different Asian cultures, Hispanic, Haitian, African, etc…) but also the gangs, fixers and even the technology present in such areas, for example, the vehicles, each are has an economical level, a gang or two with their own behaviour conduct and Fixers with their own rules, not just that but the architectural style will also be completely different, from the almost dystopian brutalism of the mega-complex from Arasaka or Militech at Corp Plaza to the more traditional Japanese architecture that fuses with neon and holograms in Japantown, while all the city follows a very specific trend of architectural futurism there are traces of their own cultural roots within the areas in which I include the Badlands even if they are not part of Night city per say.All this world is visually beautiful and immersive, from the dense and crawled streets of the city to the vast desert of the badlands that await outside the city, I think I’m not alone here if I say that is probably one of the most visually spectacular games I have ever seen, not only in terms of fidelity to the future style but also graphically. The amount of effects present here is stunning, the lights, the holograms, the smog, everything helps a lot to get you immersed in this dystopian chaos that is 2077, it feels coherent and credible, not realistic as I would say in my first thought. If there is a Raytracing’s benchmark, this is it, I can’t think of a better game that will showcase the potential of real time light effects than this, not only because of the light sources but also the climatic conditions, weather sure affects visually the scene. What about sound? Absolutely great and much like visuals it does a lot to the immersion; The streets, the announcements, the flying ships, traffic, gunshots even the silence of the countryside, all the technical elements are high-quality and damn god, I enjoyed this work a lot, the voice work of the staff? Superb.Game is an absolute beast when it comes to both technical aspects and story content, but what about the gameplay loop? Does it stand a chance? Well, we must keep in mind that the game has multiple loops so I will try to keep it as simple as possible. Combat is in my honest opinion a mix bag, gunplay is not bad but it is clear that is not a top notch system, same goes to melee combat, while it doesn’t feel bad, it feels a bit off however it’s nothing too worrying that gets you out of the experience or at least it hasn’t been the case for me. Hacking on the other hand feels interesting, like a mix between Watch_Dogs and Deus Ex, hacking combined with Stealth is actually a really interesting way of approaching conflicts, in fact it is my preferred way of doing my objectives so in this aspect the system is well done and functional. Using augmentations changes the main gameplay loop by giving you options, some feel really great like the double jump or the movement agility but some like the mantis swords feel off inevitably by how the melee combat system is designed, let me be clear here, it is functional, just nothing out of the ordinary. Driving is kind of a mix bag because each car has different statistics like weight and speed and that is clearly reflected in the way you drive and maneuver, however, while cars feel good, motorcycles were kind of tricky or at the very least I didn’t get the touch.Said this I think it’s time to talk about the performance and the elephant in the room, the glitches and bugs. At the moment of this review I have played around 40 hours and I have encountered mostly small bugs, nothing worrying like some floating objects, a few weird animations in cinematics and that would be it, as a major bug, at the very beginning of my adventure, the save file got corrupted and had to load an earlier save point, just once, aside from that, nothing happened but I’m well aware that this is not the situation for a lot of people, even tho on PC the game is running way better than on consoles that doesn’t mean it’s bug free and unfortunately that smashed the a lot of people’s expectations for this game.Game is also a juggernaut when it comes to requirements, running with a 3080 and an i7-7700k I can say that I’m quite happy how it is running in my rig, however be warned, this is a very demanding game that requires a beefy system, it is beautiful and superb when it comes to visuals but visual fidelity comes with a price. In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 was what I expected and it delivered, I found an exotic and vibrant world to explore with amazing stories to enjoy, one of my favorite games of the year without any doubt and while 2077’s release has been a troubled one due to a multitude of things, I think the final result is very well worth your time, in fact I absolutely recommend this game for everyone, but I also recommend to be cautious for the technical problems and the requirements.I seriously hope you enjoy it as much as I did, wonderful game. Recommended."

Police and wanted system is broken in this game. Anytime you killed a civilian, a platoon literally spawns besides you out of thin air, making them impossible to fight. Yet, just go in a car and drove away, since for some reason, there's no police cars running around and chasing you. Enemies have levels and supposedly each areas have their own designated level ranges. You can have enemies on side jobs / objectives that are 20+ levels higher than you, and they will one-shot you, while you won't do any damage to them due to the level differences. Both of these breaks the immersion of open-world, since you're much more limited in where you can go and what you can do.The 3 character background stories are not meaningful in any way, and after a short time, they all converged into the same path. Some of the dialog choices in the main missions don't actually have any different outcomes.It's a shame because the world is beautiful and I like the concept of the game, yet as of this moment, Cyberpunk 2077 is all style and no substance.-- The million dollar question --Is the game fun? Yes, it is, but I would wait for a sale before buying it."

Be aware these issues may get fixed in the future. I will play again sometime next year or even in about 6 months to see how it is.Hello friends,Today i write a review on Cyberpunk 2077. NOTE: This version i am reviewing is 1.06. Be aware that some things may change when patched in the future from this review. When it does, i will play again and review at a later time.As for the game, i really enjoyed the storyline, but sadly, the bugs are really bad. Mostly the bugs have to do with graphical things in the game. Let me break it up for you...90% bugs are graphical and 10% are quest related. I have run into some bugs on the side gigs and such, but nothing a last checkpoint save will fix. I have reported some of these bugs and even sent a save to CD RED to fix in a future patch. Hopefully they can recreate some on their end and fix such bugs. Anyways, here are my pro and cons:PROS:- Great storylines about transhuminism and about human's souls.- Open world game where you can go around and check out places.- Some good music in the game if you can hear it.- I really liked some of the side missions. The writing was pretty good.- You have mutliple choices on the ending and different endings.- There are lots of side quests and such.CONS:- The volume for the actual music on the radio is very low in cars. Sometimes it is very hard to hear the music on them.- There are many graphical bugs in the game sadly. This ruins immersion and many things in the game.- I only experienced personally 2 bugged side quests. MY main quest was fine.- The length of the main storyline is considered short by many. If you look at my time, i did that with all side quests before i finished the main quest. If you finish the side quests, it will add more time.- One other thing..many promised things in the game are not there as of now. Hopefully CD RED will fix their issues in their game.I would rate this as a neutral rating till CD RED fixes the issues in the game. The storyline is absolutely great, but the graphical bugs really ruin the game. Some are outright funny too. Check youtube videos on some of them. Because i cannot give it a neutral rating, for now i will rate as recommended. Still, i think players should wait a bit for it get fixed up."

For God's sake CDPR...The detail in the textures the world is made up of is incredible and I found the game a treat to look at, from the things like clutter to structures and landscapes. It’s not without faults but generally, I’ve never seen a better-looking vanilla game. In-game lighting is stunning, and night-city is a beautiful mix of darkness, filth, and neon lights. Characters generally look great, affected in a way that feels realistic by physics and sporting high-resolution textures that bring their emotion and features to life, from hair to the pores in their skin. However, already I’ve seen an abundance of textures popping in, vehicles that appear as low-resolution blurs, and distant scenery through fog showing horrid solid black shapes. The game also by default has film grain and chromatic aberration turned on, which look awful, I don’t know why they did this.  I appreciate the intention to make a Cyberpunk-themed HUD but I think this execution was horrible. Almost every aspect of it, from the icons over loot in the in-game world, to the looting, crafting, inventory menus, information is not obvious against the messy UI. Everything looks too busy and distracts you from the information you need.Dialogue is good. Speech between NPCs and you (V) play out well for the most part, without long awkward pauses some RPGs give. It feels like a fluid conversation, and I like this. Voice acting is generally strong, and I found times where characters were angry, sad, scared, etc. felt surprisingly more genuine and less acted than in other games.Most of the prompts you choose to initiate your character’s responses (which are voiced) are good enough that you know what’s going to be said, so you don’t end up giving a reply that you didn’t mean. A lot of the dialogue is 'filler', though, and almost never significantly affects the story, which strips away any sense of it being an RPG at all.One thing that is really annoying is that you get many calls off NPCs which play over dialogue you’re already in with an NPC right in front of you. This is stupid, and really needs fixing. These are generally fine and help with immersion. Footsteps, chatter, and other realistic bustle is simulated well, but I noticed many glitches, especially when driving. Car engine sounds are not good, and many times when crashing, no sound would play to indicate it.  Guns sound great! I was pleased to find a game that finally has quite harsh, meaty sounding gunshots that add a nice sense of force and weight to the guns. This is completely undermined by the bullet-sponge enemies, sadly, but the sound is on point. Melee weapons aren’t so great but sound heavy and brutal enough to make landing a hit on an enemy feel satisfying.You’re straight away thrown into a situation with a cast who you are then ripped away from, and then again with a new cast… and again... I wouldn’t mind if it felt organic and I had time to connect with the characters, so it felt purposeful, but I this wasn’t the case. Nobody was very deep, or likeable or unlikeable. They were clearly supposed to be, but it felt like the game just told me that rather than genuinely making me feel it. The first few hours felt painfully predictable and with characters so shallow and trivial, despite trying to grind on to see if things improved, I gave up. Amendment: For me, the second half of this game's story saved it. Later on, you meet some interesting characters that actually stay around long enough for you to care, and things start to feel more genuine and meaningful as a result. I still wasn't as moved by this game as plenty of others I've played, but it would be dishonest of me to say I hated the story. It's worth pushing through the first few hours to find its redeeming parts later on.They updated this and it's now serviceable, thank God. It's not great and cars still feel too light or cumbersome depending on type, but it's an improvement.Enemies are not very interesting, the AI is stupid, and the enemies are way too bullet-spongey. I would much prefer more skilled/lethal enemies who, in turn, died in one or two hits off me.These are a nice idea. It doesn’t feel like it interrupts with the fighting too much and some grant useful features, like disabling cameras, distracting enemies, or using them to turn on each other. I get that 1st is more immersive, but not allowing 3rd to me completely negated the point of character customisation as you can rarely see your character. Denying the option made this feel even less like an RPG and was another nail in the coffin for me.This was underwhelming. Customisation helps players invest more in their character, but the options in Cyberpunk 2077 are dire. You have the things like genital customisation, but you can’t alter things like your weight or your beginner outfit.I wish I hadn’t pre-ordered this. It fails to meet advertised standards. The world isn’t living and you don’t feel like you have any meaningful choices in the game. I was so excited to play this game that I could hardly sleep on release night, and I’m pretty disappointed. The game has few redeeming features beyond a fairly good storyline and, when they work, rather beautiful graphics. I expect we will get a few updates to iron out glitches, but I don’t know that they’ll remedy a lot more than that, and there's a lot more that's wrong with the game. Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 just doesn’t feel like it tries to do anything new, and in its recreation of old, is painfully average."

Idk what to say. I can either wait in a doorway and kill them with a sword as they walk through or they just hide unmoving behind a piece of cover and let me throw grenades. Idk what to even say about it. The AI is horrible and I'm on hardest setting which is honestly very easyGRAPHICS:Not next gen or groundbreaking unless you are running an absolutely insane setup that plays 4k with ray tracing and every setting on ultra. That being said I find the art style and overall quality to be quite good.PERFORMANCE:Horrible. DLSS is basically required for steady frames so I hope you all know how to add Sharpening filters. Needed more time in the oven to optimize. I'm running a Ryzen 3700x, RTX 2070 and 16 Gb of G.Skill TridentZ. 60 FPS on high/medium with DLSS set to quality and ray tracing off. COMBAT: predictable gameplay loop. Satisfying but again, nothing groundbreaking here. If you've played any other shooter with basic stealth elements you have already played this games combat system.CONTENT:There are a TON of side missions and so far all of them have been good. This is a huge plus for the game.MISC You CAN NOT CHANGE YOUR APPEARANCE AT ALL AFTER THE INITIAL CREATOR. This just felt strange considering I can augment my whole body but can't get a haircut.CONCLUSIONIf you want the best experience on this, wait. It needs patches and I honestly think it's missing some content that was expected. For a game hyped up so much and I'm development for so long, I'm disappointed terribly.Honest rating 7/10. Still good, but not what we were expecting.UPDATE Thanks for the awards and discussion here. I appreciate people taking the time to read this.I think the game has HUGE potential but truly wasn't ready for release. I gave it a 7/10 because  it's still a good game, but the thumbs down is simply because as I stated in the review, it needs patched. YOU ARE NOT BUYING A FINISHED GAME. The bugs alone will make that very apparent. Its fun and if you wanna jump in then go ahead, i'm just reviewing it at release and this review is subject to change, but there are some very serious problems in its current state. As far as comparing it to RDR2, that game felt very alive, Cyberpunk only *looks* alive. It's a fair standard to compare the two."

Constant visual bugs ruin critical, emotional story beats with accidental hilarity. Even when the bugs are fixed, the game is at its core mediocre. Skill trees are boring percentage increases with hacking being the only tree that offers truly unique upgrades, but the hacking playstyle is so boring that it's not worth perking into. The city has little going on to convince you to explore it; Almost everything you can do is marked on the map, so you'll fly right past any random scripted event that might be happening because they occur so rarely you'll just assume it's another one of the 3 points of interest you've seen repeated 50 times. I went with a hacking playstyle on my playthrough, and it was some of the most boring combat I've ever experienced in a game like this. You either one-shot people from stealth, or you spend minutes at a time squatting behind a wall waiting for your RAM to recharge to slowly chip away at an enemy's healthbar because most of your RAM recharge is based off one-shotting enemies. Boss fights for hacking-focused builds are a true nightmare, as your largest damage increase comes from hacking enemies while undetected, and it is impossible to stealth through any boss fight (I had rendered the final boss of the game literally incapable of killing me, and it still took me almost five minutes after that to kill them by headshotting them with a sniper rifle 80ish times while hacking them on cooldown). I could go on for hours about how let down I was by the hacks available in this game. At least one perk on the hacking tree is bugged and does not function at all; Anamnesis is supposed to keep your available ram from dropping below a certain number, and this simply does not work. Unfortunately hacking becomes even less engaging once you reach the end of the game. Getting a legendary Ping hack allows you to hack a single enemy to reveal all other enemies near them, and allows you to hack these enemies through walls. Your endgame encounters will consist of seeing a single enemy, hitting them with ping, and then killing their entire squad one at a time through walls while they blunder around doing nothing.The cool trees are so bad they deserve their own section. The stealth tree is useless (One early perk grants the ability to throw knives, which are expensive melee weapons that you have to manually equip through your inventory each time you want to throw one, do minimal damage even on a headshot from stealth, and cannot be recovered once thrown). The cool stat is useless, aside from opening up dialogue options. The cold-blooded tree relies on you getting kills to gain stacking bonuses, but there are very few fights in the game that involve fighting more than 3-4 enemies at a time. By the time your stacks have reached noticeable levels, the fight is over.The story has some good points but is at best competent. Very little is done with the cyberpunk setting; this game could easily take place in a modern day setting with very minor story changes. There are some good emotional moments, but they are very few and far between. Even in heavily scripted story missions, story beats are often undercut by hilarious bugs; Objects will slip from NPCs hands and remain floating statically in the air forever, NPCs will frequently fail to animate, occasionally dialogue and subtitles will simply fail to play at all, and you'll be left staring at an NPC for several very long seconds before being prompted to respond to whatever unknown sentence was skipped over.Your choices throughout the game have little to no impact on the overall story. None of the NPCs you have interacted with throughout the story make an appearance during the ending, except for the NPCs directly related to the ending you choose to pursue. There's no indication of what your choice of ending will actually ultimately lead to besides the obvious bad end choice, which is a first for me in an RPG like this. Nobody picked an ending in something like new vegas or skyrim and was surprised by the results. Disappointed maybe, but you had at least an idea of what you were getting.Romance integration into the game is bad; After completing an NPCs questline it's impossible to ever interact with them again in any way. They simply stand where you last left them, and will stay there forever. They feel like a reason to add sex scenes to the game rather than a natural inclusion. If you're playing a female V the primary romance option for the game made me feel so predatory and uncomfortable in context that I chose to forego it entirely rather than complete it.The city itself is nice to explore as long as you don't look too deep. NPCs are completely lifeless. Remember walking past NPCs having the same conversation over and over in every town in the witcher? Still the case here. Due to how the game loads, if you stand in place and do a quick 360 every NPC around you will change into a different person (Or disappear entirely), as will every car. On long stretches of road you can see cars in the distance that will fail to load and disappear as you get closer. You can't purchase anything from vendors at street stalls, and they're the same as every other NPC, so it's normal for a food vendor to scream at you to get the ♥♥♥♥ away from them if you try to walk up and talk to them. NPCs cannot get into cars except during scripted events, and can only drive in straight lines along predetermined paths; They can't go around a roadblock, meaning if you park in the road you'll come back to a line of cars as long as the game is able to load stuck behind your vehicle. Overall a 5/10 game, up to a 6 or maybe 7/10 if the bugs are patched. All the commentary for this game right now is focused on how extreme the bugs are, and this is fair, but they are hiding a game that is at best mediocre and a far cry from the level you may have come to expect after playing other games from CD Projekt. Would not recommend buying at all right now, and wait for a steep sale after the patches."

Nope, none of that. Neither have I ever played any Cyberpunk boardgames (though familiarized myself with the general concept and lore). Instead I'm just a regular fan of the cyberpunk genre (Bladerunner movies, Gibson's books, 'Ghost in the Shell' anime etc etc). And this review is from my humble perspective of a genre-geek who was waiting for a massive game in his favorite genre.Visually the game is definitely a great one. Graphics, design, assets all that was made by people who actually cared. The city itself keeps surprising with interesting locations, stunning views and all that 'megapolis' vibe I once felt myself on my first trip to NYC.Same goes for audio - the music is great, big variety of sounds, great acting - a bold ""A+"".After 50+ hours I am in the middle of the main story, distracted myself so much to sidequests in the middle of Act II, and really the side-quest content is just being thrown at me continuously, I am afraid it will take 50 hours more.And now I have to tell you that for the past 30+ hours the story (including sides) was pretty much the only factor that kept me in the game. If not for amazing quests - the game would have been dropped until the end of times, like if it was a typical Ubisoft arcade grinder for school kids.After first hours of freedom, when this 'wow-effect' slowly settles down a bit, and more problems, bugs or holes pop up, this kind of honeymoon period is being replaced with the feeling I can't really explain with few words, so I'll try to explain it wider, why I don't recommend the game as of today at 1.06 version.This is game is a bugfest. Even at 1.06 after various patches, and this is Bethesda level bugfest in its worst meaning: floating NPCs, interface glitches, CTDs at specific quest moments, T-posing, cigarettes stuck in people's hands, wrong weapon models, dead enemies reviving themselves - all that actually happened to me.  Quicksave is your best friend here, and I'm not overstating (and even that doesn't help with few quests that I had to start over several times). You may hear that some people have played the game without bugs, and I'd rather believe them, I haven't seen most of those popular on youtube in my game (like elevator doors being stuck or T-posing main NPCs). Clearly the game is ridiculously raw. Further you go - more bugs you see, as if QA didn't make it this far in time (Panam quests are probably worst ones so far in terms of stability). To put it simple: This is completely unacceptable level from a renown 'gamer-friendly' developer studio. This is something that should make your rally in front of CDPR HQ.I don't really care who's to be blamed for - managers, owners, astrology or Polish government. What matters is that such release is not acceptable, period. This is an absolute failure that must be abolished by the gaming community itself, if the developers can't do it on their own. How? Well it is simple - don't buy the game now, don't preorder games ever (I did, for the first time in many years, and definitely the last time), unless they come out in early access and even then - think 100 times before investing into something that can turn out to be a 'star citizen' level of scam. And never believe the PR, E3 footages or paid journalists. Because even if CDPR has fooled us, well that is indeed one of the world's end warnings.Smaller problems include - broken balance (in the mid-game you can just craft a one-shot wunderwaffe), stupid AI (non-essential, but hey, Lego City videogame had better driving and pedestrian AI), god-awful interface and very weird controls layout... The gameplay is so uncomfortable and messy, I don't enjoy it at all.Summarizing:I like the game, really. I'll probably finish it after the next patch. It's visually stunning, my F12 buttons is gonna break soon. I love the characters and actually care about them.Nevertheless - technically - this game, despite all forgotten promises and cut content, should have stayed in the development for another year AT LEAST. If you have missed other great games of recent few years - please clean up your backlog first.**************So please, if you still want to check it out, if you want to have best possible experience - wait for GOTY edition and all DLCs. Give it a chance after it's finished, and consider this current version an open beta to see if your rig can handle it.**************It is sad, really. Not many good devs that care are out there, and we lost one more.But here's hoping they can redeem themselves at some point in the future. Yeah, I am an optimist."

It is a beautiful game but the grind, redundancy combined with clunky control of combat and driving is outrageously poor.You will enjoy the story and the graphics but the rest needs a lot of work. The story is not extensive and I don't feel there is much replay value within the story - at this time. They seem to still care about this game so hopefully it will continue to improve.I have this game on 2 accounts and finished the story (on my GOG) in about 35 hours.I would say the game is not much fun to comeback to after story completion. Saints Row Third (with a linear story) is still a favorite of mine - a game that I still replay today."

Now, with some time and patches, have things improved and can Cyberpunk 2077 redeem itself?Well, i guess that heavily depends - There's a lot of light, but also, still, a bit of shadow.In Cyberpunk 2077, you're playing as the character ""V"", a Mercenary trying to become famous in Night City. You can fully customize your character and you got quite an extensive choice of doing so.After a heist going wrong, you must find a way to fix the damage that has been done, with a new ally at your side.Finding the solution to the problem you caused will lead you through Night City, doing several main and side-quests for a multitude of characters.This is usually where Cyberpunk 2077 shines. The voice-acting of the characters is fantastic and each one has it's own unique personality.The quality of the main- and side-quest is also mostly very good. There are obviously some that are more memorable than others, but a lot of them are quite intriguing with some being really fantastic.Visually, the game is great as well. Night City itself, with it's neon lights, advertisements everywhere and huge mega-blocks is a fantastic looking city, with the outskirts being a dry desert-like environment with huge trash dumps throughout. Immersion-wise it's a hit and miss. There's actually little to interact with or do in Night City, besides following quests or doing the smaller Gigs (which are mostly just little flavour missions to earn money and level up).Now, there are some easter-eggs to be found throughout the world, but they're very few and far in between - one for example was a reference to the infamous Indiana Jones fridge-scene, where Indy was hiding from, and surviving, a nuclear blast. It did get a chuckle out of me, but it's mostly just not that interesting to really explore things, as you mostly just find items or crafting components which you'll get plenty through missions themselves. There is detail in the streets, on the walls with graffiti, art etc. but it's all surface level.A lot of that is standard nowadays with open world titles, but i just feel it's a missed opportunity to bring in more things to do, interact with and give the player a deeper dive into the City and world of Cyberpunk.From a technical perspective, i had little issues. No crashes, no huge bugs or anything. However, there are still glitches and bugs that pull you out of your immersion. It's not necessarily too bad, but it can be annoying, especially if it's in (cut)scenes that want to convey a more serious tone or a heartwarming moment. This ranged from characters grabbing a bottle and having a drinking animation, while not actually having anything in their hands, a character running around with a gun in it's hand in a crucial and serious in tone endsequence. Sometimes traffic behaves erratic without my involvement, hearing sound close by that sounds like a fight or car crash while not seeing anything.I also encountered pop-ins every once in a while and the view distance could also be quite low-quality sometimes.Overall, those all were smaller issues, but not as rare as i would have hoped.Gameplay wise there's a lot of variety, from being a stealthy quick-hacking expert or jumping into the fight head-on with a wide variety of guns or getting some implants for your arms to either slash up your enemies, punch them or hit them with the mono-wire. It's fun to try out things and play differently each time, though you can't re-specc completely (only perks, not your main attributes), which is a shame imho and a choice i also don't really understand.Nowadays, you can also wear whatever items give you the best stats AND not look like an absolute clown, as they've added the option to make you appear in any outfit that you've found, regardless of what you are actually wearing.The fixes and additions are, all in all, in my opinion relatively minor in scope, but they do improve the game, especially the smaller quality of life improvements. Is it a totally different game or experience now, than it was before?Eh, not really, unless you were absolutely plagued by bugs and technical issues.But overall, and coming to my personal conclusion, it is a good game. Put aside the disappointment from what it could have been, it's a good experience, with memorable characters and quests in a visually impressive world, that's unfortunately a bit shallow.The cyberpunk themes, world and lore is interesting and the gameplay is quite fun.While it's still janky at times and has things that could be improved (seriously, why is the view of the mini-map so limited and small???) it's a good game in my opinion.Unfortunately, i think this game tarnished it's own brand and that of CDProjekt Red quite heavily. Not sure if they're planning a sequel/prequel/another entry but i doubt it, which is a shame, cause if it wouldn't have been such a technical disaster at launch, this could have been quite a hit.Now, it's legacy might just be being a good game with a lot of disappointment attached to it."

I held out for a few months but then decided to get it as a birthday present to myself last week. And honestly? I have zero regrets. I’ve basically played it every free moment since. The game is absolutely beautiful. I love just driving around the city and seeing how the cityscape changes as I travel from neighborhood to neighborhood. The whole game has so much character - from skyscrapers down to item descriptions, Night City definitely has a distinct sense of time and place. And even though the main storyline is (supposedly) small, the world is not. There are tons of cool things to explore and fascinating side quests to discover. I think I logged over 20 hours, the reported length of the main story, before I finished the intro. Combat is super fun too. The shooting feels good and gets better as you upgrade your character. Where the game really shines though is in the hacking abilities. I love finding a good vantage point, hacking the camera system of whatever building I’m trying to infiltrate, decimating everyone inside by overloading their cybernetics or just remotely blowing things up, then rolling in the clean up the stragglers. 10 out of 10 makes me feel like a badass hacker spy every time. One of the major complaints I’ve seen about Cyberpunk 2077 is the NPC and enemy AI. Honestly, if you liked The Witcher 3 and could put up with the AI in that game, I don’t see why you would have any issue with Cyberpunk. (And if you were expecting Rockstar’s RDR2 level of AI, ... well, let’s be honest it was never going to be that). Similarly, I’ve seen some complaints about lack of diverse choices in conversations trees, but most of Geralt’s responses in The Witcher 3 could be boiled down to 3 different tones of grunts and everyone seems to have loved RPing as him. Although dialogue options in Cyberpunk 2077 are similarly limited at times at times, I had no problem finding responses that I felt fit my character. Your choices can also have an impact on the outcomes of situations. There is a bit of railroading (just like in almost every RPG game out there) but it never bothered me. As someone who buy CD Projekt Red games for storytelling and world building, Cyberpunk 2077 exceeded all my expectations. Are parts of the game rushed? Yes, without a doubt. But I’ve been having an absolute blast with it so far and I can only see it getting better as it continues to be patched and as DLCs are released. As is, it’s the most engrossing and emotionally engaging game I’ve played in ages."

I knew I'd be playing this again but, we'll get to that shortly... here is what I thought (apologies for any minor spoilers here, there won't be many)In terms of character build, my go to is a stealthy play style and wanted to be a Corporate sneaky hacker... and we'll get to that shortly as well...First impressions of the game are like woah - really ambitious world building. Night City is a triumph of design, full and rich in design. Easily one of the best city sandboxes I've played in. There is some goofy stuff going on occasionally, cars magically driving into the floor and stuff like that, but it's generally ok, nothing I have not seen before in other city sandboxes.Driving around the city - as cool as Night City looks - is not always that fun however. I couldn't place my finger on why but ultimately I concluded it was because none of the vehicles were that interesting or varied. I mean, there are a lot of vehicle types, and they all look the part, but driving them felt a little flat and underwhelming. I generally stuck to one of the first vehicles you get, a motorbike, simply because it was the nippiest to get around when I needed it, or fast travelled.One very nice touch with the vehicles is that you can summon any you own at any time - I appreciate this feature greatly.So let's talk about missions. In typical open world style we've got main  missions, side missions and what I'd call side-side-missions, to which there are a few variants. Side-side missions are a mixed bag; Steal something, rescue someone, kill someone etc. I found these quite fun, kind of reminiscent of Deus Ex HR side missions in that there was always more than one option for the player to complete it. Being a stealth hacker with knives these were no problem - even if it kicked off I was able to mangle through it.There are also these missions called Cyberpsychos where you've got to either kill or capture a person who has gone a bit mad from all the mods they've installed up their arse - These are fun and varied in that each one have a different 'thing' about them - one might be a sniper, and one might be an invisible katana wielding ninja, you get subtle clues just before the encounter. It was interesting to get some background on the person afterwards (like context as to why they went crazy) I challenged myself to capture these guys instead of outright killing them - which unfortunately doesn't make a huge difference (as far as I could tell anyway)Ordinary side quests are to give you depth to some of the other main characters in the game - I hardly explored some of the characters, like Panam I think I did the one main quest and never spoke to her again. I intend to on the next play through.A frustrating part of the character interactions linked to the side quests was that I found 'V' as your character, sometimes was completely off point with some of the dialogue choices. Most of the time you're a hard arse, but other times, out of no-where, you're almost too empathic and caring, I disliked this inconsistency and it actually became quite distracting at times. It felt like the game was not letting me play like I wanted to play.The main mission and overarching story of the game is -ok- I'm not sure if the point got lost on me or I was distracted by other factors but I found the main plot was alright. During my play through I had to reload a save from one mission due to a bug, where a vehicle I had to tail ended up inside a wall and couldn't move, but otherwise I never found any other game breaking bugs. There are a few other glips like enemies seeing bodies through walls, or reloading a save and enemies are 'alerted' for no reason - nothing that really caused me a big issue though.I found the gunplay pretty good. There is a decent selection of weapons. I tried sticking to my throwing knives and katana loadout mostly but you do need to shoot sometimes and the game encourages, even forces a shootout sometimes. Guys dodging bullets in realtime Matrix style, the first time you see it is like - holy sh*t that looks good!Quick hacking during a fight is pretty awesome too - even if it is like casting digital spells, it still felt cool to overload a guys optics just before stepping out and slicing his head off - Never saw it comin'What I wanted to say about a stealthy play style; You're not particularly rewarded for being passive or stealthy. It's also not possible sometimes to stealth certain sections - although oddly stealth is really encouraged a lot of the time. There is even an optic camo mod that really helps you out in this aspect, but you should know stealth is not the primary mode of play in CP2077, IMO. Shooting is.I have to talk about Keanu Reeves' role in Cyberpunk as Jonny Silverhand. I genuinely thought it was some sort of marketing gimmick, a celebrity endorsement, that he'd play a small 5 minute role, and boy I was wrong - His role in the game is probably one of the strongest out of all the characters. [small spoiler in the remainder of this paragraph] Anyone who played Batman Arkham Night, where Joker appears to Batman in the environment, makes comments or jokes, or gives an opinion on something - this is a lot like what Jonny role is for a large part of CP2077. Even in small side quests he can appear when you don't expect it, and has lines of dialogue that are sometimes humorous or insightful. Sometimes he just appears and is looking at something. I can't talk too much about this character as he is tied into the main story line, but I was really impressed with his dialogue and voice acting throughout. [end of spoiler]Character development to me, seemed to be broken - From what I understand, if you invest points in a skill tree, you should get more perks for that tree, but I never did. I only ended up with about 5 perks and couldn't seem to add any more points into that tree. This was especially obvious with the ninjitsu tree, I unlocked everything I could, it was practically my main weapon (a dagger and a katana) yet I never seemed to be able to progress it any further than the initial unlocks. Next play through I'm going to figure this out.There is also a crafting aspect to the game, which I can honestly say I never used. I can't really see its place in the game, seems a bit pointless when in every fight / mission you'll likely find a new weapon which is better than you're old one. You can also upgrade your weapons and clothes and stuff - but again, I was never short up upgrades from people I'd just killed.So to sum up... This is CD Projekt and they gave us Witcher. They clearly worked hard and attempted to deliver something big, and anything following Witcher 3 would be extremely difficult to top.... I can't make excuses for the initial release of CP2077 and I certainly have not found CP2077 to be as impactful or profound as Witcher but despite its flaws, its definitely a good game. I would recommend it."

Now that enough time has passed, and even the most devoted of the CDPR cult-like following have moved from denial to acceptance we are left with an unfortunate reality - Cyberpunk 2077 is a shallow game, that is not worth your money and time under any circumstance, unless you are desperate to experience it yourself.I initially wanted to call 2077 a game of highs and lows, but thinking back on it, there is only a single positive thing that I remembered about the game. It was during its opening hour or two, before you get to experience the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, and the repetitive, mind-numbing gameplay. It's when you first experience night city, and as you are following your companion down a busy street, you are just taking in the sights, overhearing the conversations of passersby. You will, however, soon discover that the game takes you through that street on purpose, because that's the one they spent the most time designing, and the meat of the game isn't about enjoying the pretty neon lights of night city - it's about shooting the same four enemy types, that have the a level of intelligence that is insulting to even call 2004 AI, in similar environments that are essentially just branching corridors, or driving your car that feels so bad to drive you almost wish there was no driving in the game.The main story doesn't help either (slight spoilers).  The choice between the 3 life journeys has 0 significance outside of the first 15 minutes of the game. New guns and equipment that you collect don't change anything - they just have slightly bigger numbers, with very few exceptions. The map is filled with tons of side activities to trick you into believing that there is plenty of side content, but once you've done one you've done them all. Skill upgrades gained by levelling provide a damage increase to your preferred weapon class without adding anything to the gameplay. These things quickly add up, turning the game into an overwhelmingly negative experience.After finishing the game and looking up all the other endings, I can safely say that this game can't be improved by patching bugs alone. Systems like skills, gunplay and car handling need to be redone from the ground, there needs to be more enemy variety, encounter variety, side content that actually expands on the lore... I could go on. Do I believe that this is going to happen? No. This game has made more than enough money. They will release a few patches, proudly claiming that they fixed hundreds of bugs which shouldn't have been there in the first place, maybe release a free DLC to sweeten the deal, climb to 85-90 positive, then boast about it to investors and move on to the next project. I would be pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong.TL;DR This game is a waste of time and money, and I strongly recommend against buying it, unless you are the biggest Keanu simp. If you really want to try it, wait a few years to buy the enhanced edition at -85% discount."

It looks like everything was rushed in almost every department. Be it Story, Gameplay, Graphics or A.I. So the story started off pretty fun until they had Jackie killed. After that It went downhill, It felt lackluster and booring, Literally the only shot they had at a more interesting character relationship, they killed him off way too early and so the rest of the story from that point seemed pretty lacking. Some certain side missions saved it for me especially Panam's and Rogue's Questline, As for the graphics, I dont really have any complaints on this. Graphics are absolutely amazing, those open world textures are simply one of the best I have seen. But they gotta work on that shadow glitch. Its pretty annoying and funny lmao. Some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CDPR added to it>The Hacking/BD system was also childish, A lot childish actually. Watch Dogs and Nier Automata did a way better job on this. >The Cops system and Wanted level is also just dumb, You get only 1 star wanted level and apparently all the cops are behind you out of nowhere? Bruh learn something from GTA. Rockstars knows how this is done. >I didnt understand that booring Cutscene structure, It didnt suit the game. Separate Cutscenes would have been a lot better for a game as big as this.As for the bugs which everyone's been talking about everywhere, I havent encountered a single bug until now except for the Shadows Glitch, maybe just upgrade your PC before lashing out on a game and saying *Its buggy* ??My personal rating would be 7/10 and most of it is due to the the amazing graphics and some certain side missions, they saved the game for me. The story had potential but they ♥♥♥♥♥ it up."

Food stalls you cannot eat at with nobody around them, bars you cannot drink at, clubs where the doors are locked and you hear nothing but the bass. The city is as gorgeous to look at, jank to wander around in. Cars are on rails and any mild interruption creates a line of them just..sitting there. Cops spawn out of thin air for any offense, the gigs are so generic and all 3 paths play out to the same dialog after a mild change. Nothing you do really matters in the end. This is just a generic action adventure game masquerading as an RPG with none of the benefits and no matter how much they promise to buff and polish the game, I doubt it'll get much better than this. I hope to be proven wrong but until then, stay away. The game looks beautiful but that is it. Driving is not satisfying, the hacking is not satisfying and hell the intro broke the most important rule of show don't tell, it's all a cutscene.

On one hand, you have 40-50 hours of decent content to mull through. The city is beautiful, the main story is intriguing and the early game is an enjoyable experience. It has some of the most stunning looking set piece visuals you'll see in the past decade. It's an impressive visual experience.On the other hand, a lot of the content is unpolished and repetitive without much unique or re-playable value. The city is limp with placeholder dummy pedestrian AI, the wanted system is atrocious and they have a loot system that follows the same formula of many other games (common, rare, legendary, etc). It makes me appreciate games with half the graphics and double the depth. You'll find most systems implemented in Cyberpunk 2077 have been done better by other developers. I purposely didn't read much pre-release info about this game so as not to overhype expectations, and it still let me down. Some of the biggest issues I had: -Looting quickly becomes a chore to find a higher level of weapon, and they completely botched this part along with the crafting system. They chose the wrong loot system for this game entirely with the same old colors used in Destiny and Fortnite. Even the weapon mods are mostly uninteresting. -Choosing a play style barely makes a difference in story or combat. I was a stealth hackerman with silenced weapons playing on hard mode. There was one section that got frustrating, so I tried blasting everything with a shotgun. Despite having no perks or experience invested in shotguns, it proved the easiest way to complete most levels in the end. On hard mode you will die after taking a few shots, but somehow you will not be hit as easily when charging into battle. Despite having high points in hacking, the turrets would just glitch out and deactivate when attempting to turn them on my enemies.-Your background choice (Corpo, Night Kid or Nomad) makes very little difference outside of the intro and a few speech options. The night city montage early on gives you a taste of what they wanted to do with this game, but could not achieve.-You are more so playing a character in an on-rails type story than role playing someone of your choosing where decisions matter. The relationships you build through side quests wind up mattering more than anything, and even most of those feel forced. There's also a chance some side quest for a faction can glitch out and they wind up hating you because of it. -The wanted system is a complete immersion breaker and should never have been placed in the game with its current state. Police spawn in like agents in the matrix whenever you do something 'against the rules.' There is nothing at all interesting about these fights, and there are no real engagements to be had with the famed Trauma Team either.There was so much potential to be had with this game, and its clear that business decisions triumphed over the will of developers once again. I had read some about how CDPR wasn't one of those companies that would pull an EA and release an underwhelming title, but this is further proof that no company is exempt from greed. Hopefully modders come in to save the day with content that is both deep and engaging. The irony is not lost on me here, where a game that highlights the soul sucking malicious deeds of corporations has its soul sucked away by the board members commanding its creation.""Function comes 2nd. Looks are what matter."" Here's hoping CDPR changes that slogan next go."

Your interactions with this world, however, are pretty shallow. NPCs walk through the streets on a scripted path like zombies, only to eventually despawn and be replaced by another NPC. Cars do the same, and will despawn after you move away from them a bit. Neither cars nor NPCs have AI, so they don't actually respond to what the character does, unless scripted to. For example, if you park your car in the middle of the street, cars will just pile up until the obstruction is removed. They won't go around it. If you so much as bump into a police officer, they will turn hostile. Accidentally brush an NPC too hard? They all flee in terror. Punch the air? NPCs will duck and beg you to spare their lives.Speaking of the police system, it isn't passable for a game released in 2020, especially after 8 years of development. Once you are wanted, police will spawn a few yards behind you infinitely until you move out of the area. Alternatively, you can duck and hide briefly and they'll go away. You can hack someone with a sword, police come, hide for a couple minutes, and then hear them say ""oh I'm sure they won't do it again"".The world itself features very little interactivity too. NPCs only say one or two things if you try to talk to them. Most of the doors are ""locked"" in the world. Initially I thought that meant I could eventually unlock them, but no, it simply means they are inaccessible.  If you help police take care of a criminal, they won't realize the criminal is gone and will still speak as if he or she is there. (This could be a bug, not sure). I once saw a man pounding on a vending machine, because it ate his money. I hacked the machine and made it dispense many cans. The man continued to beg on the machine, not responding to the myriad of cans on the floor.Compare this to the kid chasing the rat in Fallout New Vegas. If you kill the rat, the kid will thank you and begin eating it. Small details like this makes the world feel alive. Unfortunately for Cyberpunk, everything feels for show, and if you look even somewhat closely, it all falls apart.It falls completely flat as an RPG. Your decisions will rarely have consequences, and the ones that do only have very short term effects. Dialogue options are poor, giving your normally only 1 real option, and 1,2, or 3 side options to get more exposition. Every couple of hours or so, the game may give you a speech check, but this only yields more information and doesn't have a real impact on the story. You also cannot fail checks and get a hostile or comical response, the option is just greyed out if you do not meet the requirements. You can't flesh our your character's personality, its all pretty much premade for you.Cybernetics, one of the core parts of the game, have a marginal impact on the story. The enemies and characters you will encounter will get pretty neat implants, but most will not be available to you. Outside of the ones on your arms, cybernetics do not change your character cosmetically, and most improvements are superficial. For example, I've noticed many implants just give additional carrying capacity, or increase armor. There is also not cutscene for installing said implants, though there is 1 cutscene when you get the very first one in a story mission, and that is it. You install cybernetics the same way you buy cup ramen, and it seems so anticlimactic given how cool the first scene is.Crafting is pretty much pointless, and the upgrades are marginal. You are better off finding a new gun or looting one off an enemy. In this regard, the game often feels like a looter shooter, but not a very good one. Searching for items and looting in general both suck. The combat itself is decent, but enemies become bullet sponges very quickly unless you constantly upgrade your gear. On the other hand, they will also kill you very quickly if you do not upgrade your armor. On the topic of combat, the AI is so basic in this regard you can pretty much cheese through any encounter, and enemies are only ever real threats if they are seriously overleveled in comparison to you, though even in this situation, you might still be able to cheese the AI by stunlocking it or hiding behind cover. During a mini boss encounter, I took cover behind a crate. Instead of chasing me out, the enemy just looked at me as I shot it in the head dozens of times, not moving once until it had died.Side quests in general are pretty uninteresting. There were some good ones, but overall most of them feel like filler content, used to get money and gear for the main quest. The main quest tends to give more than enough money and gear anyways, so doing side quests doesn't seem all that necessary, and when most of them are pretty uninteresting, I doubt a lot of players (including myself) will go out of their way to finish them. That said, there were some real gems, but most were ""go here, touch or kill objective, get reward"". There is also a radiant quest system, akin to Skyrim or Fallout 4, where quests will generate randomly. These include hostage situations, assaults you can intervene in, shootings, stuff along this line. For me, these scaled very poorly to my equipment. Enemies would take dozens of headshots and lose a fraction of their health, but would kill me in one hit. At the same time, the main campaign seemed more appropriate in difficult for my progression. It was odd and frustrating. Overall, the story is decent, and the combat can be fun at times, though the AI is pitifully easy to manipulate and not going at using tactics. As an RPG, the game falls completely flat, and feels more like a hallway shooter than an open world adventure. The setting is mostly a cosmetic backdrop, and while good lore was written for it, they do little maximize on this in game."

One major contributor to this project has been Mike Pondsmith, who is renowned as a cyberpunk author and RPG creator.++ Night City, what a sight to behold! A beautiful, dystopian habitat filled with an absurd amount of details, crass contrasts, and constantly changing environments; the overstimulation has been pretty hard on me in the beginning.++ The side quests and its characters are the hidden stars of this show. With their personalities and stories they perfect the immersive setting. What I love the most is that around every corner, another opportunity awaits to earn some eddies, go after a gig, or hang out with your chooms.++ As far as the gameplay goes, I am impressed how customizable the protagonist is with regards to cybernetic choices and skill trees. Basically, you raise your skills by using them, and the implants significantly impact your tactics. It boils down to your own niche build. For example, my nomadic brawler runs on cold blood and military-grade cybernetics. His hobbies are bathing in blood and collecting servo-skulls.+ The campaign is well done in regards of narrative style and characterization of your relationships with Jackie Welles and Johnny Silverhand; they have grown dear to my synthetic heart. I also like how the underlying topic of transhumanism is handled, especially the cyborgization of humanity and its effects on social life.- The police system is a disaster. Cops must have teleportation devices, because they spawn out of nowhere directly behind you. And they will do so, repeatedly. -- Bugs, a ton of 'em; clunky collision system, clipping issues, cut dialogues, frozen enemies, inconsistent frame rates, and desktop crashes. A few times I have felt like a beta tester.The aspects mentioned above are also the reason why this game has been delayed several times. I pity the quality assurance team working their fingers to the bone, in order to fix the gravest issues of this colossal project before the final release.-- From a marketing point of view, its unfinished state was deliberately obfuscated and the review process conducted in a very restrictive way. A sobering reminder why I should not pre-order a game, and wait for the hype to die down.Cyberpunk 2077 is a diamond in the rough and I can see its potential, which will likely take months to reach. Unfortunately, the initial state of release combined with the deceptive marketing did irreparable damage to the community's reception of the game and to CD Project Red's reputation.Estimated time for 100% completion: +120 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 44Multiplayer achievements: none"

Period. I have no doubt CD Projekt Red will churn out a patch that'll fix the issues a lot of us are having as soon as they can. And once they have, I will gladly change my rating. I don't have any issues with the core of the game itself as of now. The characters were great, the setting was interesting, gameplay and so on and so on.But the bugs.. I've never, in my history of playing large scope games on release, seen something quite this bad. With maybe the exception of bad PC ports. You simply cannot walk five feet without something breaking or ruining your immersion. From characters, vehicles, and props sliding into existence through walls and terrain. Or watching a vehicle appear out of nowhere, looking like playdough. Audio errors, such as weapon sounds or dialogue not playing. No UI feedback in combat. Horrible lip de-syncing, sometimes not even moving their mouth at all. Terrible performance, despite having specs higher than ""recommended"", and being up to date on drivers. Getting stuck in a death loop. Crashing to desktop (Although I haven't experience that too much compared to the others). Floating props. Loot & interactable objects just ""not existing"" i.e. Won't let me interact with. The list goes on, and on. I'm not going to ask for a refund, because I'm confident in CD Projekt Red's abilities. I know they can do this. I really do. But right now, incase you haven't purchased the game yet, hold onto your cash for a little while. Wait for them to fix these issues. I myself, will hold off on playing this for now. I'll come back at a later date. Disclaimers: - I am not generally a fan of the Cyberpunk genre, nor did I follow 2077's development until this year. I'm unbiased in my judgement. - There's no hard feelings. I'm just disappointed."

I have such a huge love/hate relationship with this game that constantly alters my opinion on what I’ve experienced every other day. On the one hand, you have a gorgeous looking story driven game telling an interesting and memorable story that is driven by its brilliant cast of characters, and on the other hand you have an “action & adventure” game that can feel so dull and monotonous to play, which is brought even lower by the onslaught of bugs. So yeah, Cyberpunk 2077 is pretty interesting.  CDPR have a funny idea of telling the truth, but one thing that they weren’t lying about for sure is just how beautiful the city looks. They went all out when it came to making a city that had the ability to make you go “wow” around almost every corner. The city has a design that feels both familiar and futuristic. You have massive skyscrapers covered in holographic adverts to worn down slums and suburbs to culturally influenced locations such as China and Japan town. Each district of Night City has character. The scale of some of the districts is immense, and quite unlike anything I’ve seen in a game. Right from the get-go you can see just how much work went into making this city. There is a huge attention to detail all over the map. The more linear sections of the game world hold up just as well. The game stays true to the idea that looks are everything. In doing so however, the game world lacks a seriously important element; life. Night City is truly a dead place to live in. So much work has been put into making the game world look good and not nearly enough time into making it feel alive. Player interaction with the world is miniscule, and as a result, travelling from one mission to another makes the city feel like a glorified loading screen.This is further damaged by the abundance of bugs. The AI is laughable at best. NPCs don’t have any realistic paths to follow and will sometimes just walk in circles. As for traffic, cars will stop in the middle of the road for no reason. Hell, sometimes the cars just disappear when you look away. While these bugs are funny at first, they start to hamper your immersion in the game world. It’s sad to say that Night City is all looks and no substance.Cyberpunk 2077 follows protagonist V as they journey to Night City with the ambition of becoming a legend. However, after a job goes horribly wrong and a string of events unfold, the story becomes one of survival.Along the way you meet a variety of interesting and brilliantly voice acted characters, each with their own personality and backstories. If I were to pick a favourite aspect of Cyberpunk 2077, it would definitely be the characters. They were the driving force of this game for me and they really helped carry the narrative. Even Keanu Reeves’ character was superb.The story itself is really good too. While I do think it takes a while to get there, by the end of act 1 it really picks up. The pacing of act 2 and 3 are fine, and I was more than satisfied with the ending I got. Side quests are a mixed bag, but the ones involving characters you meet throughout the story are well worth the investment. Dialogue options allow for a variety of outcomes to happen in some situations, and the writing as a whole is fantastic.Most of the narrative’s shortcomings appear in the first act. If you watched the trailers, you may have heard about the lifepaths. Three different backgrounds that are supposed to have an impact on what kind of person V is. Well… they don’t. What you get is a 20-minute prologue that feels like cut content and has no impact throughout the game. After that you are thrown into the city to be a mercenary, no matter which lifepath you pick. The only differing factor is you may sometimes get one extra dialogue option based on your lifepath.Another problem I have with the narrative is how it skips V’s introduction into the city. You get a cutscene that is a time lapse of V arriving in the city, meeting crime bosses and doing big things. Then when you actually play in Night City you are always being contacted by people your character knows, but you as the player do not. It’s quite jarring, and although you get used to it, it’s a shame you can’t experience all of that for yourself.The gameplay is where the lackluster elements of Cyberpunk 2077 really become noticeable. In short, most aspects of the gameplay either felt rushed, unfinished, or incredibly mediocre. Let’s start with the combat.The combat can be split into three categories: guns, hacking and melee. My opinion on the gun play varied depending on what type of gun I was using. I typically found the pistols and assault rifles to be rather tame, whereas shotguns and sniper rifles had a much better feel to them. Most weapons you find can be modified and upgraded to improve their strength and effectiveness.     The hacking is a bit of a mixed bag. I usually used hacking when in stealth related situations. Stealth in this game… It’s there, but hacking makes it much more memorable, and you can unlock more hacks as you find new equipment. I found the interface for hacking to be quite clunky and because of that I rarely used it outside of stealth. The melee combat is strange because sometimes it can be really good and other times it can be really bad. Sometimes it feels like you’re hitting a wall instead of a person. That being said, throwing a grenade at enemies and then charging in with a katana never gets old. The main thing that lets the combat down is the poor AI. It is really bad. Enemies are really stupid and will sometimes just stand in the open wanting to be shot. It doesn’t help that enemies are usually bullet spongey which results in combat sequences feeling dragged.The more I played Cyberpunk however, the more the combat experience improved, and this is thanks to the game’s skill system. As you level up you acquire skill points that can be invested in different areas such as pistols, body strength, hacking, stealth and many more. The game offers you complete freedom in how you want your gameplay experience to evolve, and while the skill system is a bit messy to look at, it does have a positive influence on the combat.I’ll finish off this section by saying that Cyberpunk’s gameplay is far from the worst. If I didn’t enjoy it to some degree I would’ve stopped playing. My problem with it is that it just doesn’t go far enough to impress. There are definitely moments where the intensity is raised and the gameplay feels great. But the majority of the gameplay felt slogged and repetitive. Bullet sponge enemies with dumb AI only make that experience worse. Cyberpunk 2077 had a lot of work put into it and that is clear right from the start. The game boasts a beautiful world with immense scale, and has some of the best cast of characters I’ve seen in a long time, and with a cracking story to go along with it, it’s an incredible success in the writing department.As far as everything else goes, - the gameplay, the technical issues, the lack of finalisation in some areas - It's a disappointment. Giving the game extra time to fix bugs won't fix some of the fundamental issues. While I do recommend this game, I would wait for the bugs to be fixed, then buy it on sale.-Really good main story-Some of the best characters I’ve seen in a game-Breath-taking city design with impressive scale-Decent gun play-Good skill progression-Feels unfinished in many areas-Way too many bugs to be acceptable-Mediocre combat and bad AI-Lack of interaction and life in the city-Life paths are disappointing"

Now a days though the more I play this game the more I love it.It’s like If Deus Ex had a threesome with GTA and bladerunner, you would have Cyberpunk 2077… It’s  basically Skyrim in the future with better writing and a lot more immersive. Actually better writing is a gross understatement. This game has an actual story and sidequests.The problem with Cyberrpunk was two things: overhype, and a rushed launch. The game had way too high of a bar set for it that it was never going to reach on the timeframe they had set, and on top of that the pressure to launch the game without deviation despite technological setbacks shot the game in the foot.As somebody who played the game at launch on console, I had a great time. I had a couple of small bugs but overall it was a good experience and I had fun playing it. Having said that, a LOT of people were greeted to an essentially unplayable game. Now that we are post launch the game has improved a lot in playability and stability.The world itself is AMAZING. I can’t stop walking around the city and just looking at the assets. Taking pictures of random people because of how wacky they look. TASTE DA LOVEEEE…never gets old. There’s an incredible amount of detail, so much life in Night City. The gameplay is engaging, albeit a bit complicated. The aiming isn’t the greatest, but gunplay is overall satisfying. Reminds me of Fallout’s clunkiness. The cyberdeck stuff is confusing, but it should finally click after a few hours…you have limited amounts of stealth tech available to you, so you have to be tactical on how to handle encounters. Inventory management is horrible, but so was Witchers, so not a big deal.If you are expecting this otherworldly game that you become so immersed in that you feel like you are living in the cyberpunk universe, then like people at launch you're setting yourself up for disappointment. If you want a fun game that's good but not world changing you should check it out.I’ve really enjoyed this game and I hope that CD Projekt Red recovers from how they handled the initial release.

One of the most adored game developers. Eight years of waiting. The result? One of the most chaotic release debacles for a triple-A game ever… And yet, that didn’t stop Cyberpunk 2077 from being one of the best games I’ve ever played. Maybe I was lucky – my game was exceptionally stable compared to the complaints I saw from many people – but once I dug into the actual content of Cyberpunk: its world, gameplay, quests, and story; it was clear that this was a well-designed, innovative, and incredibly detailed game. By now, everyone knows about how poorly optimized and buggy CP2077 is for many people. But not many know just how good the game is in its content. I want to give you the full story, no details obscured by a NPC T-posing on a city street.Beginning with the basics, let’s talk plot. Cyberpunk 2077 is set in an alternate timeline version of Earth, in which cybernetic technology that alters the human body was invented in the early 1990’s. Throughout the 90’s and 21st century, several economic collapses hit the global economy, and many natural and man-made disasters also destabilized nations across the globe. Between 1994 and 2020, the U.S. government was embroiled in coup after coup, and the assassinations of many politicians. Much of these 25-odd years were spent in a state of martial law. During this period, roughly one hundred million Americans die to violence, disease, and famine. By 2020, the power vacuum is finally filled by giant, multi-national corporations; most notably the U.S. based Militech and the Japan based Arasaka. This game is set in Northern California’s “Night City,” the largest in the New United States, which has been thoroughly enculturated into the libertarian-right, corporate run, cyber-infused new world order.Let’s get what you already know out of the way. The launch of CP2077 was a mess, and roughly a month later, still is, in many ways. Graphical bugs plague Cyberpunk, whether it’s broken animations, physics, or NPCs. To make matters worse, the game, while not  in my experience (I had ONE crash in 95 hours), is poorly optimized, and runs under 60fps on all but the best hardware. That’s the bad news. The good news is that when the game is running well (which was 90%+ of the time for me), the presentation is PHENOMENAL. Visually, Night City is spectacular. Everything in the game is graphically cutting edge, whether it’s the textures, lighting, surface reflections, or otherwise. Also, Cyberpunk 2077 has, hands down, the best original radio songs of any gave I’ve ever played. The ambiance bleeds the cyberpunk aesthetic too, a perfect fit for the setting. It’s a shame there’s so many issues out of the box, because the presentation is If there’s one thing that can’t be disputed about CP2077, it’s the intricate, lived-in, believable setting of Night City. Ads play when you ride an elevator. The dense city skyline is legitimately jaw dropping. Markets are filled with city goers. City streets are bustling with vehicles. Gangs have their own turf, and will both rob and murder pedestrians, and engage in gunfights with the NCPD. When you come upon a troubled area, “fixers” will call you with jobs to do in the very location you’re standing in. To have this breathing, over-crowded, visually stunning ecosystem all at your finger-tips is genuinely overwhelming and electrifying. It’s a singular experience, and one I can never forget.There’s been some puzzlement over whether Cyberpunk 2077 is primarily a FPS or a RPG. It’s a hard question to answer because it’s clearly both, but I’d say the game skews toward being more of a FPS. First person gunplay and melee combat are the central gameplay mechanic, as there are several flashy weapons for every kind of play style, and cyber ware that enhances however you’ve built your character. This level of variety brings in RPG components. The leveling system is detailed, but a little too focused on number crunching over new abilities. Cosmetically, your character is plenty customizable, with a great character creator and numerous outfits and vehicles to suit up with later. On top of this, you get three story backgrounds to choose from, which changes many dialogue options throughout the entire game. Dialogue within itself is also bent toward roleplaying, but important decisions are clearly telegraphed, and much of it is otherwise expositional. Altogether, in its gameplay, CP2077 is a well-designed FPS with strong RPG mechanics.When talking quests, it should be said that none of them are auto-generated. There are some less interesting quests, like clearing out gangsters from an area for the NCPD, but many of the side quests are complex and intensely entertaining. One of my favorite involves being contracted by a candidate for mayor of Night City to investigate the death of the previous mayor. Another excellent side quest sees you aiding a psychologically fragmented, possibly sentient AI who runs a taxi service all by itself. Another still allows you to accompany an old rock star as he lives out a personal vendetta against a bunch of weeaboo pop-stars – yes, they still exist in 2077. The writing in these quests, and many more, contain some of the freshest and most original subject matter I’ve come across in an open-world RPG. They utilize the cyberpunk setting flawlessly for narrative purposes, it’s really engrossing stuff; the kind that keeps you up playing until 4ÆM in the morning. Even better, all of these major side quests have multiple story branches and decisions, allowing you to express your character’s personality and affect others. I really couldn’t be more impressed by the side quests.Getting into the nitty gritty of the narrative, you play as V, a cyber-enhanced mercenary in Night City with a past life of your choosing. Your partner in crime, Jackie, has scored “major-league” with a job offer from one of the biggest players in Night City, Dexter DeShawn. Only problem is, it’s a job that requires you to steal from Arasaka, possibly the most powerful corporation in the world. I won’t spoil, but this mission takes a turn for the worst, and you end up slotting the stolen tech from Arasaka into your head to keep it from destabilizing. Inside is the mental construct of Johnny Silverhand – an old rocker boy and terrorist who died in 2020. He now appears to you in your head, but is also slowly restructuring your psyche into his own. Before Johnny takes over your mind and body, you have to find a way to remove the chip, without killing yourself in the process.On the way you form intimate relationships, friendships, and become nemeses with several characters, which truly turbocharges the writing in Cyberpunk. I’m not exaggerating when I say that many of these fantastic characters made me smile, laugh, and feel pangs of sadness or anger. Cyberpunk’s writing is truly masterful.The feelings of awe and total absorption I had playing Cyberpunk 2077 were ones I haven’t had since I played The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine in 2016. I know it’s an unpopular opinion at the moment, but Cyberpunk is right up there with the RPG greats. The setting is incredible, the gameplay is fun, the quests are brimming with novelty, and the writing will pull your heartstrings and headstrings like you wouldn’t believe. This is a 10/10 game… when its issues are fixed. For now, I’ll give it a 9.5, to prevent the perception of being a total shill. Play it as soon as there are major patches."

Know first that I did a lot of side content, though not all of it, and only went through one ending so far, and that because bugs are inconsistent between experiences, I will be omitting them as a factor.This is NOT a GTA game, and if you go into it looking for that, you will be disappointed.Cyberpunk 2077 places you into a detailed and immersive world where cybernetic enhancement is commonplace and most of the power is held by a few megacorporations. Going through the world will show you the consequences of this power disparity and the hedonistic, consumerist culture of Night City, from the enormous megastructures towering into the sky to scrapyards of discarded assorted junk straight from Wall-E.The world has plenty of quests to do, many of which of have the same good writing to be expected of CDPR, and almost all of them are more of the same game, no tedious or gimmicky shoehorned in bland missions, they're just more Cyberpunk. The side quests for romanceable characters are especially good, and these characters are exceptionally well-written, to the point that they feel like real people.On the subject of characters, Keanu Reeves' portrayal of Johnny Silverhand, the long-dead rebellious rocker-boy turned terrorist, is simply flawless. His input during both the main story and side missions, as well as some points throughout the game world, really helps bring you into the world, and can make you question some of the decisions you make throughout the game.I will not spoil the main story, but I will say the writing is good and it takes you to encounter all major factions in the game, and the endings will give you feels. However, it does imply a time limit to complete the main story, which I am personally not a fan of, as there's a huge disconnect from ""you have 2 weeks"" and then doing every single side mission while Takemura waits for you to swing by and advance the main quest. In case it's not clear, there is no time limit for playing the game, even though the main story implies it.Story is all well and good, but if you're like me, you also need fun gameplay to really enjoy the game. Cyberpunk's gameplay puts you in first person and gives you several options to approach combat or avoid it. You can run around and take out enemies at close range with a gun or melee while remaining mobile, you damage enemies with quickhacks or cause things like weapon malfunctions, you can play it as a cover shooter, or you can avoid combat entirely, knocking out enemies one at a time, using quickhacks to distract them or even take them out from a distance hacking them through their own cameras. In many cases where your objective is not to take out all enemies, you can given multiple ways in, either through some climbing or by using skills checks to open new paths. As for the weapon and loot system, it is straight out of Borderlands, and that is all there is to say about it.All in all, this is a great game, if you can run it, and I look forward to going through again when any future expansions come out, at which point I hope to have a better computer."

Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really.There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.Every ending when you finish the game is quite emotionally charged And there are quite a few life stories . My first ending - The Devil ending was so dramatic. it was like just pretty sad and my hands were shaking because it was feels like u was so alone for everyone and u just have to die in the white room where the Arasakas people are  tested you . The Star ending is so good and lovely ending  with Panam but still there is another sad moment that If you had an relationship with Judy you would have to leave her in town and go with Panama. then what about the Temperance ending .. this ending was so strange When John becomes the main character and it was very weird that he was more depressed and friendly and then when he leaved the night city it was feels  like that he does`t needed anyone . the sun ending is more like ♥♥♥♥ sad ending when Judy leaves you and you have to let her go .i dont know why they made all the sad endings but all this endings gives you emotional damge ."

You can do other sort of activities ,encounter weird things etc Don't expect immersion much in this game. Immersiveness is out of the picture. Don't get me wrong,I still enjoy it.The story itself is good. Especially the interaction with Johnny. If you care about the story only, then yes the game should be fine. TLDR: Story driven RPG with big map, hollow world and dead npcIs it bad? NOIs it impressive? NOI would rather rate this as A instead of S tier game."

I was disappointed as everyone was at the state of the game on launch, but instead of trying to power through a broken game, or joining in on the mindless hatred and abuse of CD Projekt Red, I opted instead to wait to play. I had heard good things about patch 1.5 and decided that it was time to give it another try. I won't lie, there are still several bugs, but I did not encounter anything that broke my save, or stopped me from being able to progress. This game has become one of my favourite games. A game where I wish I could forget each playthrough so that I could experience the story again. I was continuously impressed by the music, visuals and voice acting. The story was like a cyber noir novel, and I was constantly engrossed in the lore of the world. It left me wanting more Cyberpunk, and I was eager to play again immediately after my first playthrough. I desperately hope that we will see more Cyberpunk 2077 content in the future, and hopefully a Cyberpunk 2078!"

I played through the game twice, and have completed virtually every side-quest and collectible.I held off on writing a review for this game because I was trying to give the developers time to finish it. I decided that now is a good time as we've had 9 months since release, and they've released the massive patch 1.3 for it. The entire Cyberpunk 2077 game folder is around 65GB before and after the patch, and patch 1.3 is around 36GB, so you have to assume they're replacing over half of the files in the game. With such a massive patch, you also have to assume it would fix a lot of things... well...GlitchesThis is STILL the main reason to avoid this game.There is no doubt that this was one of the glitchiest AAA games ever released. Yes, I'm including Bethesda games as AAA titles. Sometimes amusing, most of the time frustrating, but they were (are) always immersion-breaking glitches. Those of us who bought the game near launch day hoped that these glitches would get ironed out soon. Well, a lot of the glitches did get ironed out, but ""soon"" isn't how I would describe it. Most importantly for anyone looking to buy this today, as of writing this review, there are still a TON of glitches. If you look back on patch notes for all of the post-launch patches, you can see the massive amount of glitches they've fixed, and there are still a lot more. You WILL experience glitches, and I advise saving often if you buy this game. Though, some glitches are so severe, even a reload won't fix them, but hopefully the numerous patches have fixed most of those. Save often and don't overwrite every time, make a new save.Story (No Spoilers)The story is pretty good, but it isn't as open-ended as you expect an RPG to be. Perhaps that's why when the game got closer to launch, CDPR downplayed the Role-Playing aspect and started referring to it as an action game. To me, that's fine, and I agree that it's an action game with deeper than average role-playing elements, but it's nowhere near Witcher 3 levels of depth, which is what most CDPR fans were expecting.The story itself is well told, and you will like a lot of the characters you come into contact with. I will give CDPR points for this. Your actions do affect the game's outcomes to an extent, and there are a ton of optional questlines that heavily influence what is possible for the story ending. I would recommend playing through the game once without any spoilers, then looking up a guide for how to get a desirable ending and going through a second playthrough. That said, for me, there's no desirable ending. The ending is just that, The End. There is no ""keep on playing"" option. The best version of that option is that the game will take you back to before you started a final quest line, and then it constantly pushes you to go through the quest again. The biggest problem with that is that your choices up to that point are already set, people who have died are still dead, relationships with those still alive are the same, etc. This will not change your available options for the endgame, so there's no point in doing that mission again, so why even have it as an option and show up (incessantly) as an incomplete quest?GameplayFor the most part, the gameplay is fine. there aren't too many points where the cutscenes are too intrusive or overly long. The cutscenes are all skippable and are interactive with in-game POV, so that's good. The driving, though patched to make it better, is still a bit clunky. Shooting feels alright, and breaching (cyber-attacking enemies) is satisfying. It is really easy to become over-powered compared to generic enemies, but I like that. I hate the trend over the last decade or more that all the enemies upgrade along side you, which defeats the purpose of leveling IMHO. I want to be able to feel like a God by the end of games like this, and this game delivers on that. The special enemies that you encounter later in the game's story are appropriately powered for what your level and skill-set are capable of handling, but that is expected and welcomed.RPG ElementsThe RPG Elements regarding leveling and upgrading your character are pretty deep, and really affect your playstyle. Shooting Game, Hack-n-slash, Net-Runner/Stealth, even Bare-Knuckle brawler can be you main attack style. The game's various patches have (supposedly) fixed a lot of issues with how the various ways of upgrading your character affects their abilities, so hopefully you shouldn't run into many issues there anymore. You can swap out your character's hardware and reset skill-points to change playstyle at any time, but it will cost you eddies (in-game currency)Crafting gets pretty deep as well, and you can modify higher-level weapons and gear with various augmentations. You can upgrade most if not all the weapons and gear to legendary level as well, though there are definitely some weapons/gear that are better than others. You do need to find the crafting recipes for just about anything you want to craft or level up though.Open WorldAt first, the game gives you a lot of stuff to do. You of course have the main questline. You take on a lot of jobs for various clients and fixers. You have random encounters that send you on little scavenger hunts. You have Police contracts all over the map. There is quite a lot to do... at first. Once you complete all of these encounters, contracts, and sidequests, they're gone. There is no regenerating quest system like some games have, even though it seems like it would be a fairly easy thing for this game to implement specifically with the police contracts. I guess this just drives home the ""End Game"" system that the Devs chose to go with. They really don't want you playing the game after you beat it. Either completely start over, or just stop playing. To me, that makes more sense for a linear game, but this ""Open World Until We Say Stop"" just seems counter-intuitive.Also, why are the police so overpowered in this game? You take on several military-centric companies single-handed and lay waste to the toughest soldiers and mechs they have to offer, but a few beat cops can take you out with ease and cannot be hacked? This also make the game not worth a continued playthrough, because not only does it not make sense, it means you can't have some fun and go all GTA on the city without the game saying ""Okay, now we're going to cheat because, reasons"" ... Sure, losing the cops is easier than anything, but why not just let us fight them and increase their forces and power in waves? This is yet another missed opportunity. You have this super-powered character, but once you beat the game, the only thing you can use that power on is little groups of 3 generic gang members found randomly around the city. woooo... fun. ConclusionI could honestly keep going with criticisms I have for the game, and maybe a lot of them are just nitpicking beyond what I've already said. I just can't get over the regular glitches that are still in the game after all this time. People spawn or despawn regularly right in front of you. Physics often just go bat-sh** insane. Quest triggers just don't happen at all. Get used to seeing the T-pose. Judy's Ghost won't leave her apartment (that one might have been fixed) Like I said, glitches are the main reason I think people should stay away. Then a close second is that the Devs really seem to not want you to continue playing this game after you beat it despite the style and genre begging for continued play. Okay, it's your call, CDPR. That just helps me conclude that is game is NOT recommended as of writing this review and at its current price. That might change if either the regular price drops to around $30 or less, or they release some significant FREE DLC that actually makes the game worth playing beyond what's already there."

The most hyped title of 2020. Does it live up to the hype? Well, yes and no.Story - The story isn't really something mind-blowing. Much of it so far is pretty straight forward, hitting some cliche tropes, you can pretty much tell who's going to be who and what's going to happen to them very early on to obvious character design and hints. If you're expecting an insane story that will blow you out of the water, its not here. However, that said, the story delivers extremely well. Very well. Every scene and chapter plays out like an intense action movie. Characters talk and feel real, and there are lots of voice lines that add to the immersion. You will definitely enjoy your time here. This is akin to going to a cinema and watching an Avengers or Transformers film. The story isn't going to rival RDR2 or Interstellar, but its fun.Presentation - This is the strongest point of this game. Night City is very well done. Buildings are chock full of details and colour, streets are lively, trying to write it down here is doing it no justice. Set pieces are all very well done. Luxurious hotels and buildings feel like they should, seedy alleys and nightclubs feel like they should. Every place has its own charm, filled with life and makes you want to explore more.  The amount of detail and variation of props and buildings makes the game very pretty. Downside of course is that on a mid range or lower end PC the game looks a little blurred, which might be due to settings, but the settings are a little confusing if you are new. The game looks very pretty, downside being a loss of detail when you are up close to something, but its still a very good looking game.Missions - The game plays out like a standard AAA open world RPG. You have main quests, side missions and open world free roam activities. The main quests are amazing, and this is where you get to see the best parts. In between you do side missions, which are really just small missions that can be done in 10-15 minutes max. They are often about a small story in the area, though nothing deep. Most of them are pretty shallow, but there are quite plenty to do. The free roam activities are standard stuff, like attacking gang areas, or rescuing hostages.Shooting - The guns feel great. They sound good, have a heavy thud to their shots and operating them feels good. The downside of course is that because CB is firstly an RPG, for several encounters the enemies are straight up bullet sponges, which make shooting feel pretty terrible when it happens. There are quite a few guns, although most of them are just copies of the same few sets. There are ""smart guns"" and ""ricochet guns"" that add some effect, though I have not found much use for them.Sound - Another amazing aspect well delivered. Music is great, sound is amazing. It feels like you are playing Blade Runner as a game. Downside here is that quite often voices don't have the proper spatial mixing, so it feels like the person is talking and shouting in your ear when they are in the other room. This might be a bug.Misc Downsides - There are a number of bugs. Some are very frustrating, such as when your character keeps drawing their gun in a conversation and you cannot change the conversation choice. AI tends to walk into walls, get stuck on geometry or doors and can derp out, though it doesn't happen THAT often to break your immersion.  The interface can be tricky to use at times. Trying to reposition yourself just so you can loot an item on the floor is a thing. Hacking feels like its too many steps to do a simple thing. Watchdogs did hacking better imo. Here it takes more process to do a simple hack, and even then your hacks are limited by a resource. Overall the game is still a solid recommend. If anything just for the first playthrough experience it is well worth the asking price. I think the RPG aspects don't feel good here, as the looting makes you lose a lot of the intended immersion flow when you do a mission and have to run around groping bodies and boxes. Inventory management becomes a slog as you have to dismantle and check your weight, and I really don't think this whole system is needed. They should have made it similar to RDR2 where your guns have no levels, and you buy new guns or acquire them and they are forever yours, instead of having to throw the exact same gun away 100 times just because another copy dropped with +1.2 damage. Once again, the world design, sound design, visuals and delivery as a whole is just excellent. Buy it if you have disposable income, if you are strapped then wait for a sale."

I already wasn't bought by the over hype so coming into this I had a bad taste in my mouth knowing it wasn't going to reach expectations and it doesn't. It took them 8 years to develop this game and I finally understand what ""Quality of life"" in gaming means. This game lacks it. So many things that make ease of access in other games aren't here. UI is terrible, Character creation is terrible, the A.I is terrible, soundtrack is an abomination. Difficulty spikes are as basic as they are in every game (Bullet sponge enemies. Yay!) My biggest issue with the game is the way the story and character choices unfold. Spoiler Alert there are no character choices. You are forced into cutscene's and forced to respond to the mission giver in 2 ways. Option A ""K I'll do whatever you say because I'm your lapdog"" Option B ""More information please"" The first 2 hours of this game are sitting in co-pilot watching things happen around you and simply because you're the main character these problems are now yours. Why? Because. PROGRESSION!! After the lack luster intro where you sit through a montage of things happening to your character ""Hey look my character is at a bar, can I play now?"" you are opened to the world where A.I are soulless empty husks walking around just to be background noise. I've walked around for 10 minutes straight up punching these guys thinking they'd fight back instead they just curl up and scream until cops arrive to shoot you dead. (On a small note you can't even cooperate with the cops. Bribe them? Allow yourself to be arrested?? Talk my way out of my crime?? Where are these options??) At the end of the day I don't know who to blame, the community for hyping this game like it was going to be biggest thing in the world it would revolutionize gaming like Shenmue once did, or CD Project Red itself for taking 8 years to develop this game with mechanics that date back to 2016. The best way to describe this game is with Fallout 4. Without the option of character development, without the open world that brings you into conflict, without any reason as to why you are doing this except BECAUSE!. The game just is. 4/10"

The story takes place in a vibrant and beautiful futuristic world that regrettably, lacks the substance to take advantage of its setting and leaves something more to be desired. Keep reading to find out why! is one of the games that had me hyped up for its release, I fell in love with  after playing the Witcher 3 in console way back and I was sorely disappointed in the result of this title. The vibrant world it presents and shows us with amazing reflections and lights illuminating the city, giving life to it is brought down by the gameplay and the way the systems are designed.To illustrate this, the perk system is based on bonuses such as ""deal 10% more damage with light machine guns"" or ""reload 5% faster"" and those are boring upgrades to attain while playing. We as players want to do crazy stuff, meaningful stuff and to see most upgrades just be bonuses leaves a feeling of desiring something more. I would have preferred being able to soak up the damage by using a steel arm or slowing time in gunfights rather than the skills we got. While there are mechanical upgrades, these tend to be few and are insignificant as well half the time.Gunplay is also sort of clunky, giving a sensation of being dull and slow while integrating numbers into the mix that adds more into an already heavily packed HUD. You aim and shoot while getting to cover and playing  recently has shown me that you can make shooting a gun very fun. There is not enough movement during combat to feed the trigger and make those explosive situations action-packed and memorable! It behaves more like a classic RPG rather than a true shooter in that regard.A lot of the issues that  suffers from have been seen in  years ago and yet  keeps committing the same mistakes. Granted, is an open world so is bound to have glitches and such but the number of issues you can find here can give you such a migraine…like in my case after losing all my progress 10 hours into the game.The story can be interesting at points as they use suspense to make you play more to find out what happens next and during the first few hours, it can pull you in with a fantastic storyline job. Then it ruins it by introducing to you way too many characters for you to be able to bond with any of them, go here and obey A, go here and work with B, go here and listen to C, and up to the letter Z. It must be painful for  to have to remember all those people, right? It convolutes the plot by adding too many subplots and characters into the fold.But Keanu Reeves is in it! How it could be bad?! Sadly, the famous voice actor does not equal a good performance and before you start dragging me to a pyre, do not get me wrong Keanu is fantastic. But you know who isn't fantastic?  The way Keanu portraits the character comes off as stiff when compared to the rest of the cast and it just does not cut in the convincing department. Silverhand is also a problem because it diminishes your character presence in the main story while also adding a deuteragonist that is not very interesting…The strong point of  is how beautiful and vibrant the world is. The neon lights shining on the dark streets while in the daylight everything feels compacted, like a maze that makes you want to explore it. The characters look great and so do a lot of the aesthetics and designs you will find during your playthrough! Also, the music is spectacular during gunfights, featuring a badass-futuristic vibe to it that adds more to the encounters you will have.The weak point is that those elements are downplayed because there is no flavor to them. The perk system is pretty standard and boring. The main story can be interesting at times and then have you yawn at others and the gameplay itself feels inferior to games that have been released years ago (just so you know, is not about Titanfall 2, a lot of shooters do have better gunplay than this). The glitches range from partial nudity to going through walls, to losing save data, to objects disappearing, items descriptions getting stuck in the HUD and that is only the tip of the iceberg that is  messy release.It was tested on an RTX 2070 S, I found it to be very annoying that when quest asks the player to unequip items or equip other items (which happens more than what I would like to) one has to re-equip all of it again. A couple of times it could be ok, but 7 times is bothersome. The more I played this particular title the less interesting it became for me and I truly wanted to love  but I am just, disappointed.The detective bits were cool the first few times but after that they became tedious, they basically sum up as “rewind here, now rewind there, rewind here again and that’s it”. They do not make you feel like a detective or something and rather is just a point click to which you already have all the answers to.If you read this far, you probably must be thinking that I hate  I do not, but I would be lying if I said I think it is a masterpiece or something. The game is not bad but is not amazing either so is more along the OK lines which is why I would give it a positive rating. Except…that in this case, we should not settle for mediocrity, it was supposed to be THE game and ended up being something standard, something that failed to deliver and that ended up being a letdown. Get the game if you want to jump on the bandwagon but otherwise, wait until they patch more stuff and keep in mind, is not that action oriented. If you like this review, give it a thumbs up!

I never got to experience the glitches and problems it had at launch since I couldn't run the game to begin with, however after the updates it has had it seems more optimized and actually runs pretty well. It isn't perfect and there are silly clipping glitches and weird things like a bottle flying super far after you walk over it, but nothing game breaking. Honestly, it is one of the best story open world games I've played and may even replay it in the future."

I played through all of the available game content and CD Projekt clearly show they have a passionate and talented team that poured their hearts into this game, similar to the Witcher 3. The narrative, graphics, immersion and environment are absolutely second to none. I just love strolling by foot or cruising via car/bike through little tokyo downtown with all the colourful neon lights, advertisements, futuristic sounds, dark alleys, etc. The game offers you a comprehensive RPG choice how to develop your character which determines how you want to play the game and I absolutely love the addictive combat which I think is quite innovative (I played as a quick-hacker + blade specialist + tech/smart-gun slinger) with the ability to mix between your skillsets which never gets old. Each combat encounter always feels unique as I for example would start with a hack, then switch to a tech sniper and shoot through walls, then throw a flashbang, slide in and slice some baddies with blades and finish up the last guys with missile locking smart guns from behind cover...damn that feeling of badassness feels good! The negative perception this game has was probably highlighted primarily by folks playing the weak ports on PS4/Xbox one and they make big catchy headlines like 'CYBERPUNK IS A FAILURE' to prioritize views without a constructive assessment. It's easy to watch a youtube video titled such as 'all bugs/everything wrong with cyberpunk' and just have a perception of distaste before even considering the strengths of the game.Yes there are flaws in the game, including in this PC version such as technical bugs. These bugs to me were funny most of the time (check my screenshots) but nothing game breaking at all. FurtherThere are missed gameplay opportunities based on the scale of the environment or what people thought from the marketing trailers, but this is how I see it:1. This is their first entry in the franchise. They had to prioritize creating a playable and immersive universe from scratch which is a lot of work. Remember Mass Effect 1 and Witcher 1? Were they perfect? No but I fell in love with the universe and the sequels refined the gameplay. So I can't wait for the cyberpunk sequel.2. I did not buy into the massive marketing hype before the game release. Sure it is nice to have Keanu Reeves being breathtaking on stage but I felt it was the perfect storm for people to slam the game once released. I knew it would be a great game but thought people were overly excited expecting sheer perfection. I adjusted my expectations to let the game speak for itself.3. This is CD Projekt's first attempt into a shooter-open world RPG game (they weren't a big developer just a few years ago if you can recall). So I bet on the business side to expand their team and work on a game this complex this was a huge endeavor. For example their in-house game engine had to be expanded from scratch to support a massive city and probably contributed to a flawed launch. It seems this is why CD Projekt also decided to use Unreal Engine for their future releases given the technical issues.The game ultimately felt like a long +150 hour journey where that was so memorable as you develop as V with Keanu Reeves and a solid cast of characters. What was a blast and it felt unfortunate once I ran out of content! I don't get this feeling from a game often!Further, it is important to give kudos to CD Projekt prioritizing overall quality improvement updates in the past year instead of rushing in paid DLC content like many other developers do. That speaks to their acknowledgement of their rushed release and goodwill to prioritize their customers to fix the game first and win back public trust for future games.My [*cough* controversial] opinion is that I enjoyed the game much more than GTA V. I feel GTA V mechanisms and combat are a bit simplistic for my taste and lacks the gameplay/character development and the environment is pretty but static outside of missions. Perhaps that simplicity is the actual appeal to the average gamer and is one of the reasons cyberpunk may have not hit off with some folks. Cyberpunk is a complicated game without a perfect explanation of mechanics for average folks (I had to manually look up on wiki to find out how to get mantis blades or get slow motion, etc). I certainly feel cyberpunk will appeal to a niche demographic of patient gamers. Cyberpunk 2077 has it's flaws, it's not perfect, nor did I expect it to be. But I think over time in future years people will look back at this game and say ""Cyberpunk 2077 is an underrated game if you don't focus on the negative articles...it was actually a very ambitious endeavor and did many things great!"".One of my main complaints of the game is the end of the game after I played most of the side and main missions. I have all these upgraded cool weapons, skills, vehicles, assets and plenty more money...but I have limited opportunities/remaining gameplay content to use them. So may be future DLC will address this now that they kinda of fixed the bugs?I rate the game 9/10 as one of the most memorable and engaging games with rather unique gameplay since I played the Witcher 3.Dear CD Projekt, you had some bumps along the way but you are on the right direction! Thank you for the experience!"

Cyberpunk 2077 gives you a whole new atmospheric experience where you can explore the futuristic-like Night City or what's surroundig it, The Badlands. You get to meet some interesting people or somewhat strange. An overall story-rich game with cool interactions and the amazing ability to customize your character to fit the loud and action filled streets of Night City. With amazing graphics and voice acting, Cyberpunk 2077 really gives the player the feeling of living in a second life. They really made an amazing job bringing out the smallest details in things, as well as pointing out some everyday topics that aren't seen in a lot of games. And for those who's been debating on getting it or not because of the complains, give it a chance. I have personally not experienced any major complications with bugs/lags through my many hours of playthrough."

I fully believe recommended specifications are actually a RTX 3070 and a GTX 1070 for minimum.Bad performance aside game is very clunky. Movement, jumping, menu, interface, hud, everything just feels off if you are used to polished games.Even if you ignore the performance issues there is still the numerous bugs the game has that makes it borderline unplayable at times. If they straight up said that the Recommended specs is for running the game on MEDIUM/HIGH settings at 30 fps then MAYBE this whole thing could have been avoided.  The story is genuinely interesting but you literally have to buy a 2000$ PC just to run this game like you run every other AAA game. The RTX cards just came out and aren't really available in most countries at the launch price(similar situation for the new consoles). I can run Doom Eternal and RDR2 maxed out and they look beautiful. This game looks choppy and blurry even on high settings there's no excuse to be made.It might take a few days until everyone stops cũmming over this game and give the devs the criticism they deserve. I really don't understand people saying it will be fixed in a matter of weeks. Be realistic... the amount of bugs right now will easily take months to almost an year to completely remove. Just because this is the studio that made The Witcher 3 doesn't mean they get a jail free card. Releasing the game in it's current state was unethical.It's 2020 and you expect people to play on 30-40 fps? that too most machines will be probably running this on 900p for 40+ fps.  We should make a prayer for last gen console players(which makes up to 80% of the playerbase). It's a major let down for fans that supported them since the start, given the fact that this game was promoted for years and was originally intended for last gen. Not everyone has a PS5/Xbox X already.EDIT: Another thing I should mention. The devs didn't let the reviewers show any footage or give them access to the console versions. They obviously didn't want people to see the state of bugs on the console versions so they never handed them out to reviewers. This is disgusting, they stooped that low to secure pre-orders. They basically hid all footage because they knew it would affect sales. Many game review websites have started mentioning this and it's a good thing!"

Random pedestrians all look different, you very rarely see any duplicates.Cons:- AI. When NPCs drive you around it's super jittery, they make odd turns, crash into things, teleport etc.- No transmog. My character looks hideous in a random mish mash of clothes with the highest stats.- Bugs. They're going to be patching bugs for months, years even.- Characters (besides Jackie) are super uninteresting. The game will introduce you to a character and then you'll never see them ever again. You aren't given the opportunity to build any sort of emotional attachment to any of these characters. There are MULTIPLE side quests that involve around you trying to empathize with literal strangers you've never met before.- Choices are basically nonexistent. ESPECIALLY in the main storyline. Side quests are where all the choices are but even then the choices you're given aren't interesting or well thought out at all.- Dialogue is very bad, the very few dialogue choices that exist lead to nothing, once you have a few points in all the trees you're an expert on everything and can talk about any topic you want throughout the whole game. There is no reason to spec heavier in one perk tree than the rest (dialogue wise).- V is voiced, and the whole game revolves around your character being voiced, you aren't allowed to feel like you're the one making choices and V's generic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ personality is not interesting whatsoever.- So many actions your character does in the game are heavily scripted, sometimes you feel like you're watching a movie rather than playing a game.- Progression feels bad. Very few things to look forward to, no real need or incentive to level for any specific perks or weapons.- The perks you get are awful, they are very minor gameplay changes and they're such a disappointment coming from literally any other decent RPG.- Driving is bad. Whether it's you driving or an NPC driving it's very bumpy and unsmooth. Cars control too well and not good enough at the same time. Cars drive comically slow, you feel like you're driving at 20 mph the whole game.- Car chases are terrible. They're HEAVILY scripted, with invincible enemies that only die at their scripted point in the glorified cutscene. They're also hilariously awkward because of how slow all the cars are moving.Man this game had lots of potential and is still an amazing foundation as is. But they really dropped the ball on this one. CDPR's company management is atrocious. They had 3 years to make this game after a 5 year long pre-production. The devs couldn't have possibly came out with anything decent in that time and were crunched extremely hard to release this disappointing and underwhelming product. 5/10"

I really enjoyed the theme on this one and that alone made the game very interesting for me.Only real problem with it is despite being out for a good while now there are still a ton of minor bugs. It only crashed once on me so it's definitely playable but you'll run into a lot of flickering traffic, wonky textures, janky animations, sliding NPCs, and other little things like that.

Side quests are genuinely enjoyable. No matter what kind of person you are you'll find a few characters within the story that you particularly conntect with. Writing is above and beyond what you'll find in other trash AAA games(i.e dying light 2), CD Projekt Red unfortunately just bit off more than they could chew with their goals and ambitions in Cyberpunk 2077.

Dialog overlapping, checkpoints missing, people/cars stuck in objects,etc but nothing I haven't encountered before in other games. Nothing a simple quick load can't fix. Besides all that. The story, the characters, the art, environment, music, abilities, skill trees, there's literally everything in this game and I'm continuing to find so much more and I'm over 100 hours in. So many paths to take, people to meet and stuff to do and they all impact the story more than any other game I've ever played before. You have to play the game through multiple times just to be able to see everything as somethings aren't unlocked and vice versa depending on decisions you've made in the game.   Mad max looking cars, guns that track enemies and ricochet bullets to mantis scissor arms and super jumping with missile launcher arms, there really just is no end to what can be done. Haven't even mentioned the crafting. Only thing I do wish they added was the ability to customize your vehicles.At this point with patches and updates the game can only get better. If your computer is 10 years old and you don't know how to optimize settings, than maybe wait till it's better on performance.

You play as V, a mercenary that wants to be a legend in Night City, and for this to happen, you'll need to steal The Relic, a biochip invented by Arasaka, one of the most influential megacorporations in the whole world. Now that I've just scratched the surface of the plot, I can begin with this review. Cyberpunk 2077 has the most beautiful city that I've ever seen in a Video game and at first sight the most vivid city in game history. But only at first sight. When walking through Night City you can see all NPCs going on with their lives, working, shopping, or just walking around, but of course like in any game it is just an illusion to make the city feel alive, however, they failed trying to build up this illusion, mainly when there is no major interaction with the NPCs, just a one-line dialog that repeats over and over again, just like in The Witcher 3, but here in cyberpunk hits different. Another thing that killed that illusion for me personally was the crowd AI, oh boy, that AI is terrible. When you look back at GTA V and older games even and compare its AI with cyberpunk, well there is no comparison, Cyberpunk 2077 AI, in general, are awful and totally immersion breaker. Continuing on with the world itself, CDPR managed to handcraft a beautiful and immersive open-world full of details that you can get lost in its beauty, although there isn't a lot to do in it. In my point of view, night city as I said, is the most beautiful but at the same time the most empty city that I've seen in the past years, because there is absolutely nothing to do in this huge city, besides walking and doing some repetitive activities that pop up around the map. Yet, there are no random events like we've seen in Red Dead Redemption 2 for example, nor extracurricular activities as we see in many other games, hell, even in GTA San Andreas (2004) we could go to the gym, barbershops, casinos, even take a taxi, so on. Another one of its downsides is the lack of character customization after the character creation. For a game where style is everything, this is a huge problem. I'm pretty sure that CDPR planned a lot of those activities but to meet the deadlines they've had to cut it out of the final game, now we just need to wait and see if they're going to implement some of those things in the game.Back in 2019, CDPR stated that Cyberpunk would have a 'Wanted' system and corrupt police. Well, at least we got a wanted system, but not as you expected. The police system is just awful. Literally, there is no car chase or a proper AI for the police, they just spawn behind you whatever the place you are at. I remember GTA 3 from 2001 having a better police AI than Cyberpunk, and that's ridiculous.At the end of the day, Cyberpunk 2077 tries to be an RPG, but is it really? When they first announced the lifepaths I got really excited, and even more when I read that every lifepath choice would affect the world around you, and that was a big fat lie. First of all, lifepaths just change the game introduction and some minor dialog options, and that's it, no major changes at all. About the general choices, yes, a lot of the choices that you made in the main quests or even side quests can have an impact on your ending or at least some important dialogs throughout the story. When it comes to RPGs, one of the most important things is the skill tree. Here in Cyberpunk, we have a huge skill tree, and it works quite similar to the Skyrim skill tree, you can upgrade your character to be a melee specialist, heavy weapon specialist, or combine everything in one and be an overpowered one tap machine.The gameplay itself is pretty average, nothing spectacular but not bad either. We can carry 3 main weapons and toss a variety of grenades. There are the implants that we can only buy new ones or change the currently equipped on ripper docs. The implants that you acquire on ripper docs can play a huge role in your gameplay, as you can upgrade your max health and carry weight, etc.The best part of the game so far is the main story and the main side quests, if I can put it that way. CDPR did a great job telling the story in a way that you don't feel overwhelmed or tired and gets even better when you get to know the characters and their stories. You can connect really easily with the characters, and that's a huge point for me. In this huge game industry, lately, there's been a lack of good characters that you feel for, and Cyberpunk 2077 makes you care about the characters, even more than you should.The soundtrack is impressive, even if many of the songs didn't suit my style, they did awesome work creating the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the main quests are too short compared to Witcher 3, about 20 hours if you rush throughout the game. I finished the main plot in 50 hours, however, half of my playtime was doing side missions and exploring the map. I've had so much fun doing side missions, and some of'em are, I dare say, better than some of the main story-related quests. Nonetheless, the bugs. As everyone might know by now, Cyberpunk 2077 is full of bugs, I can make a book with five thousand pages about the bugs. In my playthrough, I didn't encounter any game-breaking bug, thank god, but there's a lot of glitches, for example, cars flying around, NPCs appearing from nowhere, and a lot of clipping glitches, more than usual, etc. The most annoying bugs are quest-related ones, even though I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs, there are still some glitches that ruined my immersion, and I hope that they'll fix those very soon.I'm really divided about this game, in one hand, there are the great main story/side quests, and the great characters, but on the other hand, there's a lot of bugs, glitches, and main issues that make this impressive world, well, less impressive. I'll recommend Cyberpunk 2077 more because of its great story, characters, and fun gameplay. However, we should treat this review as a mixed one, but steam doesn't allow us to do so. I'm looking forward to seeing if CDPR will pull off a Hello Games, and make cyberpunk a more enjoyable game."

In Cyberpunk we get a glimpse into a not so distant future that revolves around technology and tells a bleak but believable story.→ The narrative in Cyberpunk is the focal point of this game CD Projekt Red has crafted. It tells a tale of V’s journey from the bottom of the barrel all the way to the top. You are able to select three origin stories that really only affect the first hour of gameplay then all the origins are on the same track. The story of Cyberpunk is a thrilling one from start to finish, with many complications that you will encounter along the way. V has found himself in a heap of trouble, and has to find the right connections in order to solve his problem. In Cyberpunk there is never a dull moment, from ASMR brothels to Metal Gear Solid like infiltration missions you will always be on the edge of your seat!→ The characters in Cyberpunk are what really sells the narrative, they are every bit as interesting and convoluted as the plot itself. I don’t believe I have come across many games that are able to give such believable and memorable characters. Each and every ‘main’ character you will come across have their own personal challenges, history, personal goals, and secrets that have you really form a bond with who they are. Untangling their inner motives and getting a deeper look at each character is a joy. Many characters have side missions that only further strengthen their personalities. → While there are many characters that come across as my favorite only one man can truly live up to that title, and that is Johnny Silverhand. Love him or hate him, he will grow and open up to V as you near the end of the story. At first he may seem like a selfish rockstar who has no regard for consequences but like most characters there is more than meets the eye. Learning his background and struggles, you will grow to realizing why Johnny is the way he is. Every other side character is just as fleshed out as him and it really sells the real world of Cyberpunk→ While the combat initially turned me off it eventually grew on me as I unlocked more perks to play around with. The combat is actually quite enjoyable when everything is working as intended. The guns feel meaty, the perks feel impactful, quick hacking is satisfying everything is headed on track. But then we get to the roadblock that is enemy AI. We have been spoiled by how far enemy AI has progressed over the years, and in this case it sure is a step back. From not reacting to the player to shooting through walls, there are all sorts of issues here.→ Throughout your journey you will come across many different kinds of weapons, but only a limited amount of weapon classes. While it sure was fun for the first twenty hours to get any minor DPS increase, eventually I realized most of the guns are copy and paste with minor stat increases as you level. While weapon variety may be lacking, that doesn’t mean what is available isn’t enjoyable. Depending on your build any weapon class is a viable option, whether you choose to spec into pistols or shotguns you will wreak havoc regardless. → As you level you will receive points to pick into your favorite attributes and perk points to further solidify your playstyle of choice. This was one of the more enjoyable aspects of building V, as with each level you really feel the power increase. One other aspect of leveling I loved was that as you used pistols your actual sub-tree in each attribute increased in levels. It's almost the Skyrim system where you define your playstyle as your progress overtime. → Now what fun is a futuristic cyberpunk game that doesn’t involve robotic enhancements to your player. Thankfully this game delivers on allowing you to build your own super human of destruction. There are many implants that give you the ability to double jump or even turn getting poisoned into healing. Not only are you building the perfect cyber-human you are also able to modify your weapons to your liking. While Cyberpunk might not let you build the deepest backstory, it does offer various ways to define your playstyle to your choosing. → I dislike doing side content especially in ‘open world’ RPGs, they are usually half-baked content that is solely there for the purpose of inflating playtime. But Cyberpunk does it differently, many of the side quests have as important reveals and choices as the main plot. It has everything you could want in side quests, from street racing all the way to chasing down a taxis alternate personalities. → Now we can talk about Cyberpunk without mentioning one of the biggest characters next to Johnny, and that is Night City. CD Projekt Red has failed to deliver on some promises regarding content in the game, but what it wholeheartedly succeeds at is creating a believable and lived in world. The city is cramp packed with details that most players will never get to see, taking the time to wander around and explore is one of my favorite past times!→ This is the first truly ‘next-gen’ game I have experience in the visual department. Cyberpunk includes many of the latest features including RTX, DLSS, and more. They all come together in tandem to bring Night City to life. The textures are all incredibly detailed from V’s clothes all the way to the vendor's noodle stand, everything is realistic and beautiful. Lighting plays the prominent role in creating such a photo realistic environment. Every shadow is realistic and calculated by CD Projekt Red’s engine and only further enhanced with RTX on. The neon lights of Night City are jaw dropping and realistically disperse light across different textures. The textures, shadows, lighting, and more all come to bring such graphical fidelity.→ Now performance on the other hand is another issue, without DLSS this game would be unplayable on the highest graphical settings. I ran this with a 5600x and a RTX 3080 and I was getting 45-80 FPS throughout the game, this is with every setting to the max. While I did certainly get playable frame rates, keep in mind the power needed to run this game at high fidelity. → Sound is also extremely well done in this game, gunshots in the distance or densely packed markets are all realistically recreated in Cyberpunk. The voice acting done is top notch, they help sell the characters with such greatly delivered lines. And it is all tied together by a licensed soundtrack that only further enhances the atmosphere. With heavy metal to heavy dubstep you have everything you could imagine to listen to in a Cyber like future.Let's be honest no game could live up to the hype created by Cyberpunk 2077, even though that CD Projekt Red delivers a fantastic RPG set in a Cyber realistic future with a thrilling narrative. But what is stopping me from rating Cyberpunk at the range it could be are the bugs, quality features, and horrible AI bringing it back down to Earth. Lastly, the game is a bugfest at the moment, I won't go into detail as I am sure you have heard a lot about Cyberpunk and bugs these past couple weeks."

Well, sucks to be me because all I've wanted to do is play but the new update has completely bricked the game. DO NOT BUY until they get these random crashes sorted out. At this point, it is quite literally unplayable as it crashes before the opening screen even comes up for me. I've been reading for other folks that the game might start, but will crash at random intervals after a short time playing.   I don't use any mods and play completely vanilla, so that's not the issue. From what I've been seeing online, many others who are playing vanilla are also experiencing crash issues. Projekt Red has yet to even address the issue"

The game is pretty smooth now. A lot of bugs are already fixed. But some physics issue is still there. hope Dev will fix those defect as well in later patchesThis is truly a next-gen game. Graphics are amazing with Ray Tracing. I played in 1440p Ultra settings, Ray Racing Ultra with DLSS quality mode. I never experienced a single crash in my 130h playthrough. Got solid 60+ FPS with my RTX 3080. I highly recommend running this game on NVME SSD. Cyberpunk's ray tracing implementation is amazing. I never experience that kind of RT experience before. Without ray tracing, this game feels like a different game. The main story can be completed within 30 hours. But a lot of sides activates are there. You can easily spend 100h+ in this cyber universe. NCPD activities are quite repetitive. But gigs and side quests are really amazing. like Witcher 3, your every decision will impact the later part of the game. So choose wisely. There are a few main romances. But some romances require a female body type. and there are 3 life paths and Nomad is the overall best life path in the game. Cyberpunk has a very unique and complex progression system. You can reset Perks but cannot reset the attribute and cannot change the appearance and gender after the character creation.Cyberpunk is a good game. and it is a next-gen game.

After playing for a total of 30 hours or so, and after an update and a driver install helped to fix some issues, I can change my recommendation on this title. I would recommend it, so long as the other bugs that I experienced get fixed.Some of these bugs are characters clipping into each other or the environment, and a really annoying one where you can have 3 conversations at once and everyone is talking but you have no idea wtf is going on.Unfortunately, I think the graphics need a bit of work too. Not that they're ugly... But just that I feel the game is not completely optimized.In short, when the game works right, it's breathtaking. But when you experience the issues I have, it makes it really annoying to play.I had to reduce my resolution with the dynamic resolution scaling in order to get a decent frame rate - and that's with an AMD Ryzen 5 3500x, 16gb 3200mhz of ram and ZOTAC RTX 3060ti OC vga. You would expect a system like that to run the game at 60 fps on high to ultra settings, but I was barely hitting 35-47 fps.Once those other issues are resolved,now 57 - 61 fps the bugs and performance issues I mean, I will be happy with my purchase.I can recommend the game because it is a great game indeed. I just wish the issues are fixed, and quickly."

It is obvious to me so many was disappointed of the bugs and from the aggressive talk that wasn't about bugs it seems that so many didn't get the game they had imagined. 'No mans Skyed themselves' so to speak. Let the hype take them. - Some themes are missing here or implemented very lightly such as cyberspace. wow. Cyberpunk game and cyberspace plays second fiddle i know... but still. It is CD Projekt Reds vision of this and i approve this vision now although early on i did find some things somewhat hard to stomach. - Main plot short? No. My game clock stopped at ~55h and main is done. That includes some side stuff while waiting for main plots. The amount of content here is just staggering. Also plot is one of the best ones i have seen pretty much ever. Think Fallout Vegas multi path plot was that good? or HL2 that was left unfinished? Or any of the Elder Scrolls games? Please. No. - I have probably said this before in my other reviews on open world games: Take it easy, look at the details and don't play these games as quickly as possible. They are not designed for speed, check-a-box mission running and gunning. This game also clearly requires a proper rig. I had the privilege to play this with max details and good frame rate and it left a real deep impression that i will now use as a reference in the future. This game will be something to remember. - Forget about google giving 'why did cyberpunk 2077 fail' as first results when you search for stuff. None of that early release anger and stuff matters now. Buy the game, enjoy the game. No i really mean enjoy the game. Take your time. Be the digital escapist tourist you should be and just take a deep breath and enjoy the show.  Bugs? Sure. Some noclip stuff we have seen since HL2 still around. Completely harmless now. Good for a smile but nothing much else. Also a mission or two that could use some more testing but other than that a very VERY solid experience. GTA style 'go to A and then B and C and talk smack inbetween' -missions are not a major feature in this game. Oh some exist but the devs have really put time into make enough missions that leave you with a good ol' 'WTF was that all about' -feeling.  And oh yeah talking about weird no night vision nor flashligt in the game so sometimes darkness is a real issue. But what kind of critique is that even considering the release day rep this game got? Nothing. Get the game and immerse yourself."

Most of the complaints are unwarranted, needlessly pumped up, and misrepresented. What a lot of people show you on Youtube is NOT representative of what playing this game is like. What they will not tell you is that they will be recording hours and hours of game-play and stitch together every instance where they encountered (or forced) a bug or glitch to make the game seem like its just riddled with those instances.Cyberpunk 2077 while not perfect by any means doesn't have to be. Bugs are not as common as you would expect given the reputation of this game. The game still does require monster hardware to play with Ray Tracing. You will need at least a 2080 ti to enjoy the ray-tracing on good quality -- A RTX 3080+ would be ideal. The world built here alone is VERY impressive. I do believe this was the most ambitious game to ever have been released within the last 5 years. If you listen to popular opinion and nit-pick every little thing that you see you are not going to have a good time. Instead I challenge you to appreciate everything that went into making this world live. Everything from the beautiful architecture and design of the buildings you explore to the ""lived in"" feel of the world is absolutley amazing. The cars that are in-game are also very original and imaginative This is a very fun game and well worth what you're paying for."

A huge warning to future buyers, the way the game was marketed was a complete lie. Cyberpunk 2077 is not an RPG at least not in the pure sense, it's an action/adventure game with rpg mechanics with a huge focus on linear storytelling rather than ""making your own destiny in Night City"" as CPDR claimed it will be up until the release date. That being said I won't downvote the game based on what should've been but what it is and as such, the gist is, Cyberpunk is a wonderful game, an amazing work of art when it comes to story and atmosphere, a world that will be hard to surpass but a flawed and janky experience ruined by technical issues.👍 +The best open-world atmosphere to date.+The story, especially the ones in the side quests are really impressive, emotional even.+Incredible voice acting especially from male V. +The quick hacking gameplay mechanics, aka the ""mage"" of cyberpunk were fun.👎-Huge amount of bugs, technical issues, and incomplete/""they didn't bother"" missing mechanics.-Choices in the main story, besides one particular quest and the ending, don't matter at all.-Lifepaths are pointless.I'll be blunt, Cyberpunk 2077 is not a ""make your own"" kind of story at all and besides one particular quest at the beginning and the ending, nothing you do or choose will have any major impact. All the dialogue choices do is either allow you to access a story side quest or they change the next line of dialogue from the characters you talk to. Lifepaths that CDPR lauded are nothing but 20 minutes intros and have no impact at all. They did not even bother finishing the lifepath quest in the main game, for example, I played as a Corpo and the path starts quite nicely as you're thrown into a betrayal type of quest with powerful characters and intrigue and it just ends. You never hear about it until later in the game in the form of a 5-minute side quest. At the end of the day you should never trust a corpo, and that includes CDPR. Leaving the lies and bullsh#t out of the way, the linear main story and especially most of the side stories are top quality, good ol' CDPR stuff. The main story has its up and downs and even if you know what happens to one particular character because pretty much everyone saw the cinematic trailer years ago, it still felt incredibly emotional and it does not stop with him. Keanu aka Johnny has a cringe acting everyone knows this but you still love the guy. He has an incredible charm in his voice and it shows quite well in the game. I honestly felt like an as*hole for choosing negative responses to him. You will laugh and you will feel sad and many other emotions when it comes to how Johnnys' story is told but it does not stop there. The side quests, the romance ones are honestly among the best stuff I've seen. They're full of charm and emotions and the atmosphere of it all is incredible. I wish I could write more about the whole stories how random and stupid some are and how well written others are but I have limited space. Suffice to say, disregarding the lies, Cyberpunk 2077 comes with an incredible story and you won't be disappointed. Story rating: 9/10So CDPR lied about the stuff regarding the story but you may be wondering what about the gameplay mechanics? Well, it's a mixed bag, to say the least, but overall it's enjoyable. If I were to describe it perfectly it would be a great eurojank. You have a leveling system where you can spend these points in 5 main ""paths"" and each major path has a sub-path. These 5 main attributes are Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, the Technical path, and Cool and each governs your playstyle. The leveling up is simple, if you use quickhacks you gain xp in the quickhack path, if you take down enemies in stealth you gain xp in that respective path, and so on. Each of these attributes or paths or whatever you want to call them have their own skill-tree where you can upgrade V as you please. As with any skill-tree, there will be a lot of useless stuff, especially in the melee/brawling ones at least in my opinion.I tried to play as a Deus-Ex kind of guy, specialized in quickhacks and stealth with non-lethal upgrades. Stealth takedowns are bad, they just did not bother fixing and animating them properly at all besides the fact that the AI is a joke and random as hell but playing as a stealth ""mage"" never got boring.There are a lot of things to craft and upgrade and the weapon variety is quite decent as well as the fact that some of the weapons you can use are cool as hell but the armors you wear are below average and ugly as hell.  It's insane when you look at the other characters how well designed their outfits are and then you look at yourself in the inventory menu and you look like a fing clown. For people looking for stuff to do in the game besides the gigs, side quests, and main story you'll be disappointed. There are no fun activities to do or minigames. It took me 80 hours to complete the game and I did all the side quests I could find as well as some gigs to level up my character and I never felt bored which is quite an incredible achievement.Gameplay rating: 8.5/10As I mentioned above it took me 80 hours to finish the game and not once have I heard a bad voice acting in the game. Everyone does an incredible job voicing their character and I do have to give a special shoutout to male V for having so many dialogue choices and every single one being incredibly well-acted and his moments with Johnny and Panam were one of the best in gaming.The music in the game is quite nice as well, fits well with the atmosphere and I really loved some songs in certain special moments, not to mention certain radio songs will just force you to keep driving with the Night City in the background. Great stuff and it adds so much to the already incredible visual atmosphere of the city. Audio rating: 9.5/10Going to start with the bad, and that is the technical issues. Yes, the game is a fing mess, there are so many bugs that it would take me hours to list them all and they all range from UI getting stuck on the screen to dialogues not triggering and I think I've reloaded the game a thousand times to say the least. There are so many jarring issues with it that I was baffled how they did not bother fixing it. What the hell have they been doing all these years?The game can be incredibly taxing on performance but this is not entirely a bad thing. It's a demanding game for good reason. The world, Night City, is incredible. It's the best open world to date and it has a huge amount of details and you'll be shocked at how many places you can enter. People were disappointed that you could not enter every building in sight which is not fair considering this is a game that had to be released on last-gen consoles. It was just not possible unless they created loading spots.It's clear as night and day that the team that designed the map are on a higher skill than everyone else on the development team and it saddens me to see such an incredible world filled with bugs and dumb AI roaming the streets but I won't downvote the designers for stuff that will get fixed.Graphics, performance and tech analysis score:  9/10Take away the lies, the bugs, the incomplete features, and Cyberpunk as you can see by its score, is an incredible experience, probably one of the best but it could've been much more, something that would remain in history. Alas, the team behind it, just like all corpos, got greedy, overambitious and management ruined it."

The world is lifeless even in a clogged NPC area. 80% of the side missions and activities are dumb and pointless aside from giving you money and stats.

Watch Dogs had this mechanic figured out years ago.- Stealth is tedious and boring. Deus Ex: Human Revolution and many other games had this mechanic figured out years ago. It's the same ""hold crouch to be sneaky"" as in every other game ever, except it's clunky as hell because the other things you want to do while you're crouched make it difficult to stay crouched, thus risking unwarranted detection.- Shooting is tedious and boring. Pick the gun with the highest DPS because nothing else matters. Aim at a head, hold down left mouse until the target's health bar disappears. The guns aren't interesting.- Melee combat is tedious and boring. Light attacks work unless the enemy is blocking, then you use a heavy attack to break the block. Counter by blocking just before you get hit. - All of the dialogue options within the refund period are a railroad with the illusion of giving you choice because it takes way too long to get started, concerned with trying to get you invested in a revenge story instead of selling to you why you should care about it.I haven't even mentioned all the glitches. It plays uncomfortably like an un-patched Bethesda game in terms of its performance and stupid things happening. You can tell me they're gonna fix it all you want but fixing the bugs isn't going to fix the fact that it's a mediocre game and absolutely not worth the hype."

I followed cyberpunk's development for 3-4 years, pre-ordered the game, and was very excited to play it for the first time. Additionally, I played since the beginning on a 5800X + RTX 3090, and never had any performance problems.While I did encounter a number of glitches, bugs, and various problems during my primary play through they never really turned me off to the game as a whole. What really  killed the game for me was the realization that it is entirely dead, empty, and unfinished. Retrospectively, the entire experience has convinced me think that CDPR lacked the necessary experience to pull off a game of this scope, and deluded themselves into thinking it was possible based on their prior successes.What detracts most from the game is its entirely un-finished and inconsistent narrative, the promises of an interactive world that were never realized, and the extremely weak gameplay mechanics; all of which are, for all intent and purpose, impossible to fix. CDPR built a world that was too large for their ability to manage, they wrote a story that is rampantly inconsistent and implemented within an engine that doesn't support much in the way of dynamic story telling, and they implemented a rudimentary gameplay system that resolves around static spawns, extremely limited AI, and damage + skill scaling mechanics straight out of Diablo.I will say that I did, somewhat, enjoy my first playthrough when I did buy into the illusion of choice with respect to origin, quests, and overall outcome; but once you realize that you have no real effect on the world, the story, or anything else, it just seems disappointing. I can easily say that I would hesitate to purchase a CDPR title in the future, and would never pre-order from their company again."

Some can even soft lock the game were you need to reload your previous save or use cheats to fix it without losing your progress. When bugs happen so often that you don't know if its a bug or that's by design. It's just sad. I wanted to like this game, i really did, but this is just bad.Simple things like for example mouse cursor on in game PC's disappear and you have to navigate it blindly.After reloading a gun it starts shooting automatically for no reason.Audio problems, one person talks loud as hell, the other is silent, or there is no voice audio at all.Simple stuff like reflections, police cars rear lights sometimes become brighter than the sun to the point where you have to turn on first person camera while driving cause you can't see anything.Radio in cars doesn't change or start playing properly, there were times where i have to stop the car, get out, get back in, then the radio station changes.When you need to use a MOD to fix multi-core performance issues so it uses all the cores and actually boosts your FPS you know the game has serious issues.The fact that the bug that was on launch in 2020 still exist in 1.5 where when you're driving normally you suddenly get yeeted in to space for no reason is mind boggling.I can go on and on about bugs in this game, there are plenty, in the end, is the game worth it?Not really, don't waste your money unless you really, really want it and its on a sale 50+% off.Is it playable? Yes, but its not acceptable giving its been over a year and the game feels like its in Early Access. It's just sad.I played it when it originally launched and passed it in 2 sittings i was so exited(haven't touched it sense), now bought it on steam(to keep my games on one platform) after 1.5 was released hoping its better, but it kinda was a waste of money.Gonna finish my second playthrough and most likely never touch this game again, maybe in 2077.I really hope in the future i get to change this review in to a positive one, but for now;Not Recommended."

It only seems to serve as a background to the main story.- NPCs act strange and their reactions are not realistic. Every NPC you try to interact with somehow seems to be offended for no reason. You may walk by them and they'll great you in a nice way, but as soon as you press ""F"" to interact, they'll be treating you like you slapped their mother in the back of a dark alley.

Random objects floating. You're having a convo with an NPC and chopsticks are just floating in front of you. You park your car and when you come back to the area not only has it moved but also it's levitating 50cm above the ground.

This means countless hours poured into grinding for ""Steam Based"" achievements and completing everything and anything that the game had to offer. Now that I'm done with this, decided to put a very thorough review of the game and my experience for anyone that is interested in playing the game in the future, or wants to achieve 100% completion on steam. The review is spoiler free 🚫 and is for people that will and has played the game 😎Lets start-off with the General ratings.➊) Gameplay - 8.0 / 10 ( Still feels a tad bit unoptimized )➋) Combat - 8.5 / 10 (Melee combat & weaponized combat was pretty decent, but lacks more animation layouts for melee weapons such as Katana and batons)➌) Grpahics - 9.5 / 10  ( Ran the game on medium to high and averaged around 35 - 40 FPS & and it looks pretty decent, now imagine the game on' Psycho' settings along with RTX and DLSS turned on, that's bound to be a real treat to your eyes.➍) Story - 6.0 / 10 (The main story line felt Mediocore and very little was offered.➎) Questing - 6.5 / 10 ( Side questing felt a bit rushed and gave no unique alternative, it was always kill or save kind of quests.➏) Story-boarding - 5.5 / 10 ( When compared to its predecessor ""Witcher 3"" CyberPunk 2077 could not fully deliver in terms of connecting character arcs and making choices and emotional decisions made throughout the game have any significant impact towards the overall RPG quality nor the endings of the game.➐) NPC - 6.5 / 10 (NPC & Quality of life in Night City and in the badlands felt somewhat dull and most NPC's offered the same set of dialogue throughout the whole game.➑) Character Development - 7.0 / 10 (Throught the entire play-through of the game a medium level of character development was shown towards V and the rest of the side characters. Anyone playing the game would feel as if most characters have an emotional range of a celery stick 😒 and that everyone moves on or forgets in game incidents real quick.➒) Steam Achievements - 3.0 / 10 TERRIBLE ( Anyone trying to achieve 100% completion on whatever platform but specifically steam, you would have to sacrifice a lot of carefree and experimentative gameplay for that to happen. Mainly involves going back & forth on manual saves for god knows how many times ! 😡)➓) Customization - 4.5 / 10 ( From the get go, the game has limited customization of only a very few items, which then denies the player of a full immersive and role playing experience.)    |   FINAL THOUGHTS   |All in all this game did have its Ups and Downs, but I did somewhat enjoy my time playing this game.I can't help but feel bad for the review of this game by most players on the 1st year of launch, but I do feel that the expectations of Fans where aimed to that of Witcher 3 by CDBR, which is setting the bar really high! 😅😅😅. . . . . ╰──╮  A handy tip to anyone that wants more out of the game and to have a upper hand on it's set limitations, I highly recommend running the game through various MODS through Nexus Mods. Makes the gameplay and initial play through of the game a lot more enjoyable and offers up a lot more options in the game.  ╭──╯ . . . . .Lastly, I am still pleased with what CD Projekt has managed to put out and I sincerely do hope that in the years to come they start listening to the fans and audience more. Who knows, they still could revitalize ✔️   I Shall end this review by giving Cyber Punk 2077 a solid ►   6.0 / 10   ◄   ✔️                                       ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

I also think at a certain moment gameplay starts to feel stale. I played with many builds, one example is a melee build. It was cool at first, but it got very samey quickly, When I did get mantis blades that changed it up a bit, but it didn't progress much after that besides other cyberware. Most perks tend to just add bonuses to different stats in combat aswell. One aspect where this game shines however are the characters especially in the main story, but these stories tend to play out quite linearly, which means the player doesn't have much agency (accept for the first act). The lifepaths don't influence much besides the beginning mission and a few extra dialog options. Compare this to clans vampire the masquerade bloodlines, or backstory options in mass effect, these can open up whole new quests and player homes (in bloodlines) and at least give more in game dialogue relating and expanding on these backgrounds (such as mass effect). Ultimately, I feel this game fails at being a good rpg (because of its lack of choice), fails at being a good shooter (gunplay feels good, but gets samey quick), fails at being a good open world game (because other than looking pretty, you don't actually interact much with the city in a way that feels truly immersive besides really surface level stuff). I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't. So many other games in these genres do it better (deus ex, VTMB, etc). I just wish there was a game that has the stunning visuals and general presentation and atmosphere that 2077 delivers, but with more actual substance."

Just wait. I know it's hard and probably nobody will do that. I didn't and I regret it.I guess the public (read: all of us) forced them to rush this game in the end. But in its current form I cannot recommend playing. Ever played a Bethesda game (I love them almost all) upon release? Well, this is worse...The bugs and unfinished mechanisms for me ruin the experience of what could otherwise - and I am sure at some point will - be a great game and might potentially be a next milestone, even though I am not sure about how revolutionary it is yet. It could also be just a very elaborate and lovingly crafted copy-mix of GTA, Deus Ex and Fallout / Elder Scrolls set in a Cyberpunk world. And given that these are some of the greatest franchises ever and Cyberpunk is an awesome setting, this alone would justify sinking a few hundreds hours of gameplay into it happily.But so far...Bugs I experienced in the intro, tutorial and very first mission (maybe 3-4 hours of slow net gameplay):- Game plain crashed for the first time after 5 minutes in when I tried to change my mouse sensitivity - Constant clipping of NPCs through stuff, even in very early scripted scenes (e.g. the nightclub).- Frequently too late rendering of stuff. This ranges from blurry blocks driving around instead of cars (at least for the first 2-3 seconds you look at them sometimes) to complete characters not being displayed at all, except for the drink they are holding, or you only realize they are there, because another NPC stumbles around themBugs can hopefully be fixed fast. What's potentially worse and more time consuming to patch is the lack of honed out gameplay mechanics:- The main story seems completely on rails so far. Absolutely 0 choice - even in situations where it is by now common in almost all games. This comes pretty unexpected- E.g. dialogue options so far (3-4 hours in): EVERY dialogue I had so far had options but I ALWAYS had to choose the one option that the story wanted to progress as plannend (the first one listed), everything else was just chitchat without effect (or any valuable info added).- Despite being on rails, the main storyline for me already lost track / jumped right after the first mission. Not to spoiler anything (I don't know what's going on so I really can't): I am suddenly supposed to go talk to someone to  for a specific job from a specific person that my character talks about having gotten, but none of that ever happened. This is in the - I think - first mission of the first act already. - A living city like this requires A LOT of of mechanisms to work, mainly in how the NPCs and city respond to your actions. Here it shows strongly that they didnt have Rockstars multi-decade experience with this on deck.- E.g. touch a random police tape anywhere lightly with your hip? Immediately get shot without warning (well they do warn you while they already shoot) by dozens of cops and chase you until death.- Or: You come across an ongoing firefight between police and a gang. The game tells you, you can intervene in such situations of leave it. You shoot the whole gang dead. Nothing happens. The scene just switches to 1 police standing around and telling you to bugger off. Around the corner are some of the same gang just hanging out. They wont react to or even talk to you. See below. - You can talk to most NPCs standing around. Not all, which is weird because you don't see where the difference comes from. But expect 90% of them to not move their lips while talking... Why?- Also, the only bystanders/NPCs you can NOT talk to are cops, bouncers, gang members, etc. Meaning everyone that would potentially have anything meaningful to interact on with (all displayed with a yellow sign above their heads). Guess this can only be a bug, but it is pretty annoying.All in all, this currently ruins immersion and I cannot really get into the game, which is a shame. I hope they will be able to fix/finalize this great looking game over the next half year or so, so we can all enjoy it, as it surely deserves.To end on a positive note: The game looks pretty stunning (as we all have seen before) and you can see the enormous amounts of detail work that went into crafting all the scenery especially. Very well done. Can't say I am a big fan of the whole ""washed out"" and blurry look, but I think that can be edited in the settings."

After 1.5 this game is solid, it will never live up to what the general audience had expectations of what this game would be, but it makes sense why fans would hype this game up so much. After The Witcher 3 gained popularity and was widely known as one of the best open world games out there, its expected that Cyberpunk 2077 would do the same but fell extremely short. Pushing that to the side, Cyberpunk 2077 has graphically one of the most breathtaking experiences ever. Even on the lowest settings this game looks phenomenal. A major issue I have is the gameplay, guns feel extremely clunky in my opinion and a melee build is always 10x more fun. The story also feels pretty rushed overall, but its a bit too late to make major changes at this point. Honestly the side quests and side characters make Cyberpunk what Cyberpunk is today. I would honestly say that the side quests combined are significantly better than the main quest.uhhhhh 7/10 very cool"

The ad campaign that surrounded the project was so invasive and ubiquitous that even after almost 60 hours of playtime, I’m still not fully equipped to separate what the game is from what it was intended (or advertised) to be. That’s not wholly CD Project Red’s fault, either. I ultimately bear some responsibility for creating something in my mind that no developer has ever fully realized. Part of that has to do with the high esteem that I hold for their previous projects, specifically The Witcher 3. So it’s not completely fair to CD Project Red’s creative. And yet, it was also  marketing that constructed the hype train I was riding. Regardless of how we got here, the sheer amount of dissonance from what I thought I would play (partly my fault) from what the game actually became (mostly their fault) creates a tricky ruleset for reviewing. Aside from the game figuratively crashing headlong into the hurdle of my expectations, the game is still sometimes fun. It’s a usually charming, occasionally dull, always buggy, relatively beautiful mess of a game. The exhausting vacillation between positive attributes and negative characteristics makes for a rather arduous game of mental tennis. Few parts of the game come without greatness. Likewise, no part comes without lethargy. The incongruity between the positive and negative makes a reviewer somewhat hesitant to state the game is good. Or bad. Or fair. But I will. With a lump in my throat say…The game is ok. And when it was over, I was ready to move on. There’s an RPG problem that exists. And it’s pervasive in two ways.Firstly, the character you control, V, is already a paint-by-numbers character for whom the player will fill in the canvas. I’ve seen this criticized in a general sense and I’m not completely on board. Thousands of RPGs like this have already existed without complaint. Geralt, from The Witcher, works in similar fashion. You never take the reins of characterization completely. This is no different (aside from a book series’ and three video games’ worth of establishment) from what came before, other than it seemingly contrasting from what was advertised. But make no mistake. V is already a person, and people have problems, goals, and aspirations. You will not decide these for her (or in my case, him). Occasionally, though, there are general inconsistencies with V. It seems weird, for instance, that a streetkid would work with police officers and politicians, yet he does if you allow him to. So should I simply not allow it? Or is it a mistake for the developers to have allowed it? The onus is ambiguous. The answer, unfortunately, appears to be of no consequence. V can or can’t: you decide. Any streetkid code in your head is just that — in your head. Which makes the roleplaying feel superfluous.Secondly, the main quest of Cyberpunk 2077 is time-sensitive (not actually, but story-wise). This is an enormous issue. It creates a story template that conflicts with the player’s desire to explore. If the main quest has a deadline, and that deadline not being met results in something terrible happening, why in the world would V (if this were real) bother doing anything else that CD Project Red went through the trouble of creating? The answer is that V would not. Because it doesn’t make sense.How can Cyberpunk 2077 justify that anyone with even a slight measure of intelligence (particularly its protagonist) would go through the trouble of falling in love, racing cars, beating up nobodys, having sex, eating, drinking, or shopping, if they had this totally separate issue that renders all of these earthly pleasures utterly meaningless? The main story breaks the world.  The player simply cannot, based on the game's own story, rationalize doing anything other than the main quest. And that main quest isn’t that long. Especially in comparison to the amount of side content. And because the plot moves so quickly, and V so slowly, a disconnect forms, and the plot can’t sustain itself. You see, it’s possible that V (the player) will be just too busy messing with hookers, or dirt biking in the desert, or getting drunk in a bar to adhere to the all-important details of the quest Cyberpunk 2077 says is the  important. It’s easy to out-roleplay the narrative because any main plot, particularly one that is time-sensitive, simply dissolves in an open world like this. Basically, why give the player tons to do, then by the nature of the plot, tell them there’s no time to do any of it? Because, as stated, if this were real — they surely wouldn’t.  V looks like an idiot for having fun. Despite the lack of sense it makes for a character who should be doing anything but, there are lots of fun things to do in Night City. I was regularly captivated by the vistas, the populace, the pulsing radio, and the night jaunts through the city’s underbelly. While not being revolutionary (I felt this much and more in the fantasy realms within The Witcher 3), it still achieved a high level of verisimilitude for the city proper. There’s something to Night City, even if it was less than advertised. Many of my favorite moments of the game were the straightaways, with my figurative foot on the gas, speeding into oblivion. It was in these moments when Night City felt alive…For a few seconds, at least, until I would suddenly glitch outside my car and be suspended in the air just above it, surfing on the hood.Bugs and glitches are prevalent. I casually surfed on top of my car often. You will see anomalies like this everywhere. And the real tragedy with these regular irregularities (other than their predictability) is that they ruin moments that would otherwise work exceptionally well. Imagine a sensitive moment between two lovers or friends — or a glorious shootout where V, against all odds, blasts his way through a legion of adversaries, only to be met with invisible goons, random floating objects, or decapitated people (who are still very much alive). Despite its potential for danger, bugs colored the whole of Night City in something goofy and unintimidating. It’s a circus clownhouse. Night City is supposed to be as much of a character as V is. And either by content, or unintentional moments of moto-surfing complete with floating inanimate objects (or people), that goal is never fully realized. And that is the biggest shame of Cyberpunk 2077. Cyberpunk 2077 does not feel especially innovative (or finished), which is shocking considering its marketing. Truthfully, it just kind of exists. Another contemporary. Neither truly offending nor pleasing. Owning nothing it really excels at, or really even anything it’s particularly poor at (save quality control).It’s a pretty, glitchy RPG/Shooter that exists in an open world. It grants the player the freedom of exploration and the freedom to level up via a skill tree. You’ll meet some interesting characters, do some interesting things, and in the end, spend 50+ hours completing it all.Sound familiar? It should. You’ve been playing it for years."
475,48,¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/,49,4,1,139.1,"Posted: September 11, 2021","1,918",0,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/7ce420c6917924c41277119894fe5290900b6149.jpg,"Cyberpunk 2077... There's a lot to unpack here, so this will be a lenghty review. The game that was gonna revolutionize gaming as a whole, offering an unique experience we'd never seen before, hand-crafted by the masterminds at CDPR... And then, when it released, it was a bug-filled mess, practically unplayable on last gen consoles, and practically destroyed CDPR's reputation overnight. Still, after more than half a year since it's release, and having finally finished it, I guess it's time to share my thoughts on it.So, where do I start? The setting. Cyberpunk 2077, as its name implies is set not only in a cyberpunk world, but rather, THE Cyberpunk world, as in, the universe first explored by the table-top RPG that gave the cyberpunk genre its name. And I must say, I love the setting, and the design of Night City and the surrounding Badlands. As I played the game, I couldn't help but stop at every corner, just to admire the beauty of the city, with its glowing neon lights, its tall buildings, its mix of American and Japanese architecture... I was blown away by it all. Truly, despite its flaws (which I'll talk about), CDPR managed to craft a really beautiful environment to explore, though sadly, it gets dragged down by the issues the game has.As for the story, I think this is another strong point of the game. You play as V, and at the start of the game, you pick a lifepath which determines your prologue. While I praise the story, I do consider that having the lifepaths limited to a single, relatively short prologue mission, was a huge mistake on CDPR's part, and they could've built them some more. Anyway, I digress; once you're done with the prologue, you start the story proper, with V living in Night City, being best friends with Jackie, and getting ready for the heist of a lifetime... Of course, things go wrong, and Johnny Silverhand's engram ends up in V's mind, trying to take over his body. I won't go into further detail, but I gotta say, it was a pretty engaging story, especially if you're like me, and do everything the game has to offer.As a counterpoint to the previous paragraph, though, the story pacing has some issues. One of the main complaints I've read online was about how the main story was really short, and the ending, unsatisfying, and, in my opinion, those are valid points to an extent. If you focus on the missions the game marks as ""main story"", you'll actually miss out on some options by the end. Certain story-related side quests get lumped together with the rest of side jobs and gigs, and so, you might end up unaware of them.As for gameplay elements, it's basically an FPS with RPG elements, with Attributes and Skill points, and also perk trees. These can obviously influence your playstyle; certain attributes can help you open new paths, while skills relate to the abilities you use in combat or out of it. To make a clearer example, the Strenght attribute might allow you to force open certain doors, meanwhile, the handguns skill determines how much damage you do with pistols. Still, skill levels are capped by their related attribute, so you might want to take that into consideration. Being an RPG (or at least sort of), there's also equipment, clothing items, weapons with different stats. There's a pretty large selection, and you can even craft newer weapons and mods to install them. Also, given the cyberpunk setting, cybernetic enhancements are a given, with some really interesting options, like invisible camo, or my personal favourite, the Mantis Blades.I talked about the setting, but let's focus a bit more on design. The graphics are pretty great in this game, as I mentioned in the paragraph about the setting, the city looks beautiful, but again, the impact gets diminished when the game's shortcomings start popping up. While the streets are crowded with pedestrians and cars, if you pay attention, you'll soon notice their rather limited AI. Personally, this wasn't as much of an issue to me, as I usually consider NPCs as background dressing, and don't pay much attention to them, but I know it might break immersion for some. The sound design is very good as well, the many noises from the city make it sound alive, and the soundtrack is excellent.Now, for the shortcomings, because this game has a lot of them, and I already mentioned a few things here and there. When it first released, it was plagued by bugs (and still is, to some extent); I actually stopped playing for several months before coming back to it recently. On PC, it wasn't as serious as on last gen consoles; in my case, I was lucky enough that most of the bugs I found where of the amusing kind, though there were many instances of pop-up issues (and there still are to this day). Bugs aside, the game was also a disappointment to many due to what feels like a severe reduction in scope; the game that was delivered seems almost like a shell of the one that was promised. Although I really enjoyed the story and gameplay, by the time I was finishing it, I could still feel that there was something missing, that this game could've turned out amazing, but simply ended up being good. The story could've been fleshed out a bit more, and there's several instances, both on the main quest as in the side jobs, in which it feels like they had set things up, only not to follow up on them.Anyway, I think this review has gone on for too long. Personally, I had a great time with this game, and it's basically the main reason I got myself a decent PC last year, having gamed on laptops for the past decade. However, you should keep in mind it's a deeply flawed experience, and might never manage to live up to the expectation there were before release. Still, one can hope that CDPR can at least keep supporting the game with bug fixes and maybe some more content."

Time after time, updates after update and decided to go back to the game after Patch 1.05 and its was blow my mind. The game still good and became stable.And one thing that I did like of this game developer, they still update this game and try to accomplished what they promised. They still support this game, alongside with other media like Netflix's Cyberpunk Edgerunner anime and announce this game future DLC.Well, Cyberpunk 2077 still had good atmosphere, good soundtrack, good gameplay, good story, good lore and brilliant world building. It still the best game ever made in my humble opinion.So, I never regret to nominate Cyberpunk 2077 as Labor of Love in Steam Award 2022."

It's supposed to play like a high speed shooter/brawler but the overall clunkiness of the game makes combat unrewarding and infuriating."

Managed to fix the first time but haven't the faintest how to fix it again. shame, was really looking forward to the next expansion.Edit: This has been patched with the most recent hotfix, however my point remains that both updates broke the game.

I'm 7 hours in and I haven't even seen Keanu Reeves yet.*A note to RTX 3090 owners, I had terrible performance. Cyberpunk was running a very unstable 50-30fps with medium settings and performance DLSS. Maybe you won't have any issues, but if you do, install the Nvidia STUDIO drivers (instead of the game drivers) and try that. I'm now able to run max settings / maxed ray tracing at 1440p with a pretty stable 60fps on foot and only dip to 50fps when driving in 3rd person (driving in 1st person doesn't have any dip, so I guess the game struggles with rendering your vehicle."

During launch day it was definitely a flop. There were many bugs; game breaking, the graphics weren't optimized, and it was very obvious that, this game was released in pressure from the community. However, as the years have passed, there have been many changes. The bugs no longer interfere with the game as heavily as they did before, the graphics have been updated, guns and items polished up, vehicles mechanics, driving, npc behaviours, and much more that you can only really feel while playing this game. Now I won't sugar coat it, it's  not what it was intended to be pre-release, but its a game thats still worth playing. Now this may be a biased review, but I will put both the pros and cons I see from this game. Pros:Atmosphere..It's beautiful. You may be thinking to yourself, is it really beautiful from what many people have said where there are headless npcs. Yes, of course, that's the best part. Jokes aside it truly is. I've ran about 80 hours into the game, and I can tell you, I don't think I can bored of the city. If you wanted to play a game, which brought the future infront of you, and made it realisitc. This is definitely it. As you drive around the city going from gig to gig, you will feel it. You feel the changes in districts, you feel the changes in atmosphere, the lives of the npcs, the buildings that surround you, even the parts that lay inside the buildings. They way you hear the news buzzing around you, telling you about the corrupt world that refuses to change. The way the npcs talk about trying to get out of their rough lives, thinking that maybe they've finally found a way out. The quite empty roads, to the gunshots in the distance, to gangs picking on innocent people; as the neon lights truly fill the street. The immersion is one that's truly taken from granted, and as you finally leave the grasps of the city, you can feel the quite hmm of the badlands, still crawling with action, and a thirst to find a way out. Storyline.. Each character you can truly feel. This game has been awarded story-rich for a reason. That's what it was made for. For you to get the feel, as a person working in corporate. Or starting out from the dumps, as you progress the story you feel every bit of the city. From the people you interact with, and people you change paths with, you grow more and more attached, wanting to spend more time, learn more, as to how did they start off; how it's so different for every character you meet, and how they got to where they are now in this buzzing city. You yourself, as you travel, fight, discover, explore, you can feel your own character grow, and your own sense of self blends into the choices you make throughout the game, and maybe how you would be in this world if you lived here. It truly is beautiful, and only something you can grasp when playing this game.Cons:Now there are always pros, and there are always cons, some games have more than others. I think cyberpunk, has its cons, its not the worlds greatest game, but it's not something that doesn't make the game not worth it. BUGS... :_)Yes yes, bugs are there, they have been there from the start. BUT NO, they aren't game breaking. CDPR has got, a lot, and I mean a lot of backlash for the buggy game they released back in 2020. However, I can say this much. Their game, is still, in my opinion, perhaps one of the greatest games ever made. They have spent, a lot, and I mean A LOT, of time fixing these bugs. From yes, the headless npcs, to you being chased by T-posing mobs, to even your car flying from a hit from, who knows what. It's been handled very well. You still encounter bugs, like for my case there have been times where the perspective was stuck in story mode while actually playing the game, which was fixed just by me going to main screen and coming back. As well as me driving really fast into yellow barricades, and them getting stuck in my car, which would send me for an inception time flying experience, which was actually a nice refresher seeing something so silly. It wouldn't stop me from playing the game, or have me miss out on something important. It still kept me going, and gave me a good laugh here and there. The bugs in this game are very subjective. If you are the type of person who's gonna bawl over a bug you found and never play the game again, thennnn... maybe you shouldn't get it, but if you aren't like that and don't mind your car flying every once in a while, and can even get a good laugh from it, this game will definitely give that you. The bugs are there, always have been, and always will be, but they don't outweigh the other aspects of the game, still making it worth your money.Storyline..?? Yes, I talked a lot about how this story line was beautiful, and it is, my only problem with it, is that it's too short. There are plenty of side gigs and fun people to meet, explore, and things to do, but the main storyline is short, and that's one thing I definitely wished was longer. CDPR is adding expansions and it's been rumoured that we will be getting more things to do while we wait for the expansion, but it's still short. Side missions can last from 5 minutes to anywhere around 30. I'm still playing the game and have more stuff to do, but the more I play the more I enjoy how well this game as been made. As for CDPR, they've done great, not what was promised, but none the less respectable. Conclusion:In my opinion, this game has improved a lot since it's release, and will continue to improve in small ways making the game more fun. As for expansion many players still wait to see what will happen with that, as well as future updates. But the current stage the game is in, it's beautiful, and worth trying. However, my only thing is that I would recommend getting it on sale. Is it worth the whole $80? Maybe not, is it worth 40 tho? 100%. And as long as you are enthusiastic about the world, the concept, of cyberpunk, you will come to love the game and what it has to offer. However, if you are playing for it to have the same level of depth as elden ring, choose elden ring. IT definitely is, something different, and something truly worth appreciating. If you decide to get this game, have fun playing. Chooms :D"

It’s like trying to tell someone you’ve discovered the world’s best cheeseburger. We all know what a cheeseburger tastes like and, for the most part, they’re all fairly similar. But sometimes, a special, magical combination of ingredients comes together in a way that has to be experienced to be believed and understood. Cyberpunk 2077 is like that. It’s an open-world, first-person RPG with hacking but it’s also so much more. It’s a sublime experience from the moment it begins to the end of the (35+ minute) credits. No matter what kind of gamer you are and how you like to play, Cyberpunk 2077 caters to you.Playing as mercenary V, players are dropped into the fictional Night City and let loose. V’s personality, skills and class are all shaped and developed by the player while playing. And they’re never locked in to one specific thing. Are you a gung-ho, guns blazing, wise-cracking arsehole? Cyberpunk’s got you covered. Do you prefer to sneak up on your enemies and stay tight-lipped? You’re covered too.Do you want to tackle each and every situation, conversation, mission, combat scenario and traversal across Night City based on how you feel at any given moment? Well, that’s also an option. The freedom to play how you want and be who you want in Cyberpunk 2077 is nothing short of breathtaking and the fact it affords players this level of freedom while delivering a seamless, fluid and engaging experience is mind-blowing. Many games buckle under the weight of their own ambition, but Cyberpunk 2077 avoids this pitfall and instead, creates an experience which is never less than completely dictated by the player’s whims.In Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt Red has created a phenomenal tour de force and a game that’s unlikely to be matched anytime soon. It is an important game and one that demands to be played."

I've not yet seen a solution which doesn't have at least one user reporting it doesn't work so you might be unable to play indefinitely, however these things have all worked for at least one user:1) Launching from the exe directly rather than through steam (Find it in your steam/steamapps/common/cyberpunk2077/bin/ If you can't remember where you installed steam you can also find it by right clicking on it in your library, selecting properties and then ""browse"" under local files)2) Find that exe, but rather than launching it, right click and select properties. Toggle ""run as administrator"" (I have seen both ""turn it off if it's on"" and ""turn it on if it's off"" reported as successful solutions)3) Go to your graphics card manufacturers webpage and manually download the latest drivers (Windows automatic update will tell you that you have the latest driver when you do not, check the version number against the manufacturer's latest offering)4) Verify game files (Okay, I've not actually heard anyone say this has worked for them, but always try it before doing a full reinstall. It's quick and some day it'll work!)5) Uninstall, delete all relevant files and reinstall. The files are (From a comment CrimsonRider made on another thread):Cyberpunk 2077 folder from here: ...\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077Cyberpunk 2077 folder from here: %userprofile%\Saved Games\CD Projekt Red\REDEngine folder from here: %userprofile%\AppData\Local\CD Projekt Red folder from here: %userprofile%\AppData\LocalCD Projekt RED folder from here: %userprofile%\AppData\Local\ProgramsIf you're not using cloud saves you need to back up your save files or you'll lose all of your progress.If you have mods you have a more complicated time, but anyone who can install a mod should be able to figure out how to remove them properly.Unfortunately the game is 100% unplayable to some portion of the userbase, even unmodded, even trying every fix. Obviously that makes buying it a bit of a gamble, which is a shame, because it really is quite good."

It is pretty good, the story isn't repetitive. On the other hand, it's pretty cool with more endings. Yea, sure, the Life Path doesn't change much but it's still a pretty cool idea. Overall, I really enjoyed this game. The driving is a little bit arcade-like but that's fine. After all the patches, it turned out pretty good and I think it deserves a chance. Lot of fun for 30 Euros in sale. I really liked some of the characters and the way they developed throughout the game. The love-hate relationship with Johnny, where he is the coolest guy ever at one moment and then a complete A-hole in the other. The songs were pretty cool as well, lot of genres. And one thing that I totally love in this game are the side missions. Like you have a self-aware gun at one point, guy that sees himself as the Messiah or Monks that still choose pacifism, even if it means one of their brothers get killed. There is just so much to the game than it seems. Lot of different cars, weapons and outfits to unlock as well. SO MANY individual fighting and play styles that replaying the game makes it something totally different with new builds. I know that it's not what lot of people expected, after all those years of waiting. But people like me, who haven't waited for the game's release that long, weren't really associated with it before the trailer with Keanu Reeves/it's release or the anime Edgerunners, this kind of people won't feel that wronged. As I already said, this game deserves a chance. The vibe of it is something no other cyberpunk game offers.And if you have watched the anime, it's something completely unique. I really want to stay at your house. IYKYKTo summarize this, it's a fun game with a great deal of stuff to do and places to explore.It isn't something world breaking but still a good game after being patched.Some bugs may occur but they aren't frequent anymorem they are a rarity just how it's supposed to be. The grame has crashed only once, with lot of mods installed.Characters and story isn't on the level of RDR or TLOU, but it's still appreciable. In the end, it's a 9,1/10. Little flaws and sort of repetitive contracts, but ultimately a satisfactory experience."

I have a special connection to this game. I bought the first boxed set of Cyberpunk when it was released in 1988--yeah, I'm that old--then I bought the updated Cyberpunk 2020 and GM'ed that with flesh and blood players--then I coauthored R Talsorian's Maximum Metal add-on system book for the paper and dice RPG. In summary, I've watched CP go from Friday Night Firefight through CP 2020 and owned all of the volumes and mags. It is its whole world now at least as deep and detailed as anything in Elder Scrolls, GOT, or perhaps even Tolkien. And I'll tell you why in a moment...The computer game is altered from the paper and dice RPG, of course. Paper and dice CP was made for a team of human players, with netrunners, solos, fixers, rockers, nomads, corps, and other classes. In this game, your character is basically all of the above. Netrunning had to come out of computer virtual worlds onto the street battlefields. The game does feature some of the trippy original concepts of netrunning, including re-experiencing a virtual world (a la Strange Days or Brainstorm), hacking machinery, and the potential of dying in the machine.Now, let's talk about bugs... I've watched the reputation of Cyberpunk 2077 suffer exactly as did Mafia 3, a magnificent accomplishment similarly bedeviled by bugs and performance issues for months after release. Did the devs catch up? Yeah, 95+% in both large, story driven games. At the time I write this in early-mid 2021, Cyberpunk 2077 runs very well, with very few bugs in PC play, and the devs are providing constant updates and hotfixes. Despite the continuing effort, negative Steam members still rant and flame. Respect!In truth, Cyberpunk 2077 is a breathtaking accomplishment. It features THE most immersive city EVER on a PC. The streets are crowded--I mean crowded--with pedestrians, and cops, and loiterers, and crooks, and... etc., with a wide variety in body styles, ages, races, health, sobriety, attitude, and socioeconomic status--and they have different walks. Watch em. Some swagger, some limp, some sultry sway. (No, GTA 5 doesn't have anything like the volume and variety of gen pop that walk these streets!) The game is also crazy deep, with more than half a dozen distinct regional gangs with their own styles and means, different cops, and different corporate mercs. There are dozens of hundreds of items in the game: a huge array of clothing, cybergear, weapons of all kinds, hacker attack softwares, a wonderful variety of cars and motorcycles, useless items and debris for the immersion, and the whole spectrum of buildings, neighborhoods, and residences you'd expect from a city mirroring LA. You can also craft your character from a very wide range of facial, hair, body, tattoo, and cyber implant styles--as well as your custom privates. There are bars and apartments and offices and elevators and shops and brothels and shops and vendors... And if you want sex... there are parts of town you can go to, or sometimes you can choose to let it happen in some storyline encounters. I repeat: I know of no other PC game of any kind, anywhere, with the immersive urban quality of Cyberpunk 2077. I don't know when we'll see it again this side of full VR. So, to the critics and hypercritics, ""Get real!"" Have some respect for the colossus. In addition to what I have listed above, there is the story. Oh... my... goodness... There is literally 30+ years of multi-author detail in this world and backstory. Tolkien, as one man writing over 30 years, could not have the breadth and depth of the multi-writer Cyberpunk authors and the backstory of this game. I know that sounds crazy--I do--because I also coauthored Iron Crown Enterprises' Lords of Middle Earth. But there's a reason that CP 2077's convoluted story fits together so well, a tale bigger than the original Bladerunner motion picture, but just as well crafted. This story progressed as an organic thing and it's had time to grow.So, how do I summarize? Cyberpunk 2077 is, simply put, one of the true magnum opus of computer gaming. It is fun and immersive and slick, with a nearly open world as you traverse the main story milestones. The many characters and supporting characters will get to you, whether or not you admit that to your gossip buddies. Every combat provides a variety of tactical options including better stealth mechanics than Deus Ex or Far Cry, and the ability to do cracking head shot ambushes. You'll feel the tension of enemy hackers burning you while you run and shoot, searching for them. The character attribute and perk development system will also force you to define your character. Go for intelligence and hacking, and at higher levels you will be like a wizard killing bad guys in groups and exploding machines from afar. Or you could be like one of my sons, and create a bat wielding brawler that can solve any problem with a piece of wood and a shotgun. The game allows many focused approaches to succeed.Is Cyberpunk 2077 perfect? Of course not. The devs are still putting out a catalog of fires that resemble California in 2020. But they're on it, and the game just keeps getting more and more solid. The game also suffers from a classic issue in PC RPGing, and that is that as your character nears level cap, you can become near invulnerable with godlike powers to melt multiple enemies while your armor turns bullets into gnats. I look at the mods people are creating and some modders are taking those late game balance issues on. You can build quick levels by farming respawns for XP. Finally, as a critique, some original R Talsorian concepts may be broken--like smart weapons. I tend not to use them. Someone who's ever read an issue of Popular Science will laugh at what these bullets do; they'd need intelligent micro fins and thrusters and everything you'd give a missile. So, yeah, they're comic book. If you're reading this for whether you should buy, I'll put it like this: if you like the genre--you MUST buy this game or miss out on the most legit representative of modern or near sci-fi urban fiction on a computer, not to mention the very best incarnation of cyberpunk genre available at this time. If you want to ""spray and pray"" and you don't care about depth and story, go back to Saints Row or GTA. But if you want to lose your awareness of when you live in a story that's bigger than a single writer can write, enter CP2077, and let it blow you away. It is finally here, and it is good. Scratch that. It's fantastic!"

The good news is most of these seem to have been patched out.  When I say ""most of"" I actually mean ""I have not seen a single issue since I started playing again.""

You can see all the hard work put into the story and environment and game overall, but those last minute issues of optimizing and squashing bugs didn't get the attention it needed. Super odd since CDPR was doing all that crunching on their employees. The saving grace is the the actual game itself is good, maybe even incredible in my opinion, but the optimization is pretty bad. . I activated my windows and my FPS almost doubled. I feel like a moron, but I will say my friends who have more than the recommended specs (1660TI) are having a bad time with FPS. I am playing on Ultra with DLSS on quality and hit the 100-140 range which is something I can totally enjoy.But hey, optimization and bugs can be ironed out, fixed, and improved. I can quite confidently say this game is going to be one of the best I have ever played, but its just being held back by the formerly mentioned issues. I've waited years for this game and will be playing it multiple times in the future, so I am willing to wait for the future patches to come out.Was it worth the hype? In its current state, barely. Only if you can run this consistently at your desired frame rate. I can, which is why I give this review a thumbs up. The bugs are still a very real issue though. While it's very disappointing for many people, it isn't the end of the world. The game isn't ruined for me, nothing makes me more excited than to play this game on my second play through. Its quite obvious this game hit stupid hype levels that only games like Half Life 3 hit. At that point, it is your own job not to buy into those stupidly high expectations. I hope those people learned their lessons today."

Honestly the list could go on. Pros: Compelling story & cyberpunk theme.... yeah that's pretty much it.I wouldn't suggest you buy this game at all. But if you do decide to buy I'd wait for a GOTY edition to come out which will be many years from now. But even then I wouldn't recommend buying it. This company sold us a broken product. Gamers are the only consumer that get sold broken products and accept it. You wouldn't accept any other product that arrived to you in a broken state. Not a car, a washer and dryer, or phone.

It was worth 60 eddies. Don't get discouraged by everyone complaining about the glitches. Sure, there are many of them. But as you get immersed into this world, you will forget about them. Pro Tip: I finished all the life paths, doesn't really matter which one you choose, only the first few minutes are different and only rarely it gives you an extra option in a conversation, other than that it does not change anything at all. Also, I finished the game on the ""Very Hard"" option and it was not hard at all, so do not fear it.

I think this is a game you will either love or hate, you will put down after a couple of minutes or hours of playing, or you will play it fully till there is nothing left to do. I think it depends how you approach it, if the countless bugs destroy your immersion or you look beyond them and focus on the ""soul"" of the game. For me it was the second case. There is no secret I am a huge fan of the Witcher 3, still my favourite game of all time, and felt CD Project Red managed to keep the magic of it in this game too, at least for me it worked.Let's start with the obvious issues however, there is no denying the game is buggy. The biggest problem I see is the visual bugs, that might drag you out of the world very easily, but I encountered a lot of issues with bugs with the crafting and inventory items as well. Inventory management is clunky, and it just feels not modern, the fact that after an inventory change the whole screen refreshes feels cheap and doesn't look next gen at all. The same issue is with NPC interaction, the way the police is working, the way driving physics is working (or not really working), it feels not finished at all. On the other hand there is a lot of ""filler"" content in the form of shards, every inventory item has a funny description to it, the database information is huge, but I often felt instead of this more attention should have been given to the crucial game mechanics.Now the good parts, combat is just fantastic, it feels good, it plays good, there are multiple ways to approach a given situation, you can combine it with different character builds and come up with your unique style. Weapons are great, I absolutely enjoyed every moment of the combat. I think the cyberware mechanism is excellent, adds a lot of variety and feels futuristic. Map design is good, I liked roaming the countryside (badlands) around the city, gives a nice variety of getting out of the concrete jungle, has a great feel to it. I also liked the character development mechanics and the character management and configuration when it comes to clothing to attribute utilisation and cyberware management.The music is just awesome, it works so well with the world and the combat, it is one of the strongest points for me in this game. The strongest part for me however is the story, the characters and the fact that in some miraculous way CD Project Red managed to create a world (at least for me, highly subjective), where I wanted to return to interact with, to do the main and side missions and to just roam around and do things, customise my character, be in this world. Just after finishing everything did I realise how much I am missing it, and I am really sad that there is nothing left for me to do at the moment. Overall it was a great experience, not a lot of games got this close to me and I look forward to return to Night City as soon as possible when the DLCs come out. It is hard to objectively recommend this game to everyone, it definitely worked for me and it is one of my best gaming experiences ever, but this is not because it is so polished and all the promised features are there, it is just because I enjoyed it and I got attached to it emotionally, hard to say if it will work for you. I would definitely recommend giving it a try though. Farewell Night City, I miss you and I hope to return soon :)."

I will try to do this review with my knowledge of game development. The Good:+ Quite impressive graphically. Expected nothing less from the developers behind The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.+ Very well crafted character customization. There are tons of ways to play and unless you're playing on max difficulty, they're all viable and can become very powerful.+ I like how this game feels like a ""Fallout type character development, meets Grand Theft Auto style of game, with a dash of Warframe in terms of cybernetics and futurism."" Basically this is just futuristic GTA with a better character customization.+ I actually did feel emotions towards some characters. To get a player emotionally attached to characters in the story is a really good thing. The Bad:- The amount of bugs and glitches is pretty insane. Right off the rip you may see problems with actors clipping through solid objects, I've fallen through the world a few times just running across the street, and sometimes the dialogue doesn't appear, making you literally unable to make choices. - Some of the mechanics are absolutely busted. For instance, being a ""netrunner"" in this game is hugely unrewarding until very late game when you can afford to buy a better operating system with enough slots and then having good enough RNG to have decent hacks. Why go through all that when you can just dump all your stats into reflex and shoot things down in just a few bullets? Especially with pistols. Pistols do not need to be stronger than rifles. I don't know what logic comes in from ""Smaller bullet (pistol) deals more damage than larger bullet (rifle)"" but it doesn't make much sense. Balance-wise, pistols should be very good bang for your buck, not stronger than rifles. - Some of the upgrades for your character should really be a perk you get from progressing through the perk trees. I've actually made a character with near unlimited slow time. As long as the difficulty spike doesn't allow the enemies to shrug off the damage, my character quite literally can't die. The Ugly:-- There are just things missing from this game that really should be there. Like  - Why do I have to buy vehicles from fixers? Why can't I just steal a car from the street and bring it to a safe location and claim it? Not saying that should be a free process, of course you can charge the player some eddies for the process of converting ownership, but it should be far cheaper than some 24k+ for just a cheap ride.  - Why are clothing and a lot of customization locked in with the choice for color palette? Maybe I don't want my character to look like a mishmash of different colors, like someone just dropped acid.  -- The Borderlands-esque style of level -> equipment power doesn't add up. You get a pretty crazy difficulty spike after act 2 and you are definitely not geared enough for it. I mean, I think I was level 16 and had over 200-250 defense before going past the biochip heist, and I died to common Tyger Claws thugs in like 2 shots where just 30 minutes ago I ate their lunch. My guns (I had the 4 shot revolver, 4 shot sniper, and the burst fire assault rifle), especially the revolver, did like 250-300 or so damage per shot, and I have seen numbers as high as 1.6k for a headshot. The BASIC Tyger Claws took it and spat the lead back at me. I was chugging down consumables so much that I couldn't do anything other than haul ass and keep popping meds, that's a bit absurd. All in all, I really want to enjoy this game, but I cannot recommend it. There are just too many problems going on that needs to be addressed before I could say this is worth $60. From game breaking bugs still existing to the choices really not mattering, it all just gets to be a giant problem that hangs pretty high."

The story is very good, it wasn't what I expected (I'll go into this later) but it did rope me in, The acting was good and the character were interesting and I started to care about them.-Side Missions. Again like the story, the few side missions are good, because of the characters and acting and story writing.The bad:-AI. The AI is horrendous. The city feels alive because of the looks. But the city feels dead because of the NPC's. Wether it is civilian pedestrians or drivers. Or police AI that spawn out of nowhere and vanish into thin air. The AI is horrible. It takes you right out of the game when no one acts like even a little bit of a human.-Choices. The choices in this game matter little to nothing. Every dialogue option is a question which won't continue the conversation or quest. Or a few choices on how to continue which are ""Grumpy OK, happy OK or neutral OK"". You can get a few new side missions or endings through this. But nothing really changes. You are on a set path, and nothing will change that.Repeated voice lines. Some times, but often enough. Not even for minor conversations, but pretty big and emotional conversations.The options are often not even close to what V eventually says. If you want to be nice you often times can't. Even if the dialogue option looks like it. Or vice versa.-Romances. Like the choices. Almost non existent. For every gender / sexual orientation there is 1 option. Unless you are bi, then you can choose 2. But if you are gay or straight. too bad, only 1. Even though the storyline for this is pretty good. you can't do anything else with them. Outside of missions they are just drones with 3 lines.Also you can only visit 2 sexworkers, one male, one female. In the entire city, only 2. With a few scenes here and there but those are once and add nothing, and is more mission related than anything else.-Customization. Once you are out of the character creation (which is lackluster) you cannot change anything.No tattoos, no hair, no implants, no facial hair. Nothing.Except for cybernetics, which don't get a cutscene or anything, and are almost never visual. You just buy them through a inventory screen and place them.You can changes clothes which were advertised as being pretty important, but they aren't. You change clothes because of armor and perks, not because something looks cool. You can't transmog your gear or turn off hats or face gear.You can't customize your apartment. There is also only 2 ""homes"" you get, which are story based. You can't buy any new home.You can't customize your vehicles. You also need to drive to a location to buy one. You don't have a garage.- YOU ARE NOT VNo matter what you choose, what you do. You are not V. V is a character, nothing you do changes his/her personality. If V doesn't like someone, (s)he doesn't. No matter if you want to be nice or not. V decides.-Cut content / Nothing to do outside of missionsYou can't go to a bar, sit, drink, call friends, hang out, do something with your romance. NothingThere seems to be so much, but every time you think ""Can I do this?"" you can't.This doesn't feel like the immersive cyberpunk RPG sim they stated it would be.Almost nothing they advertised is in the game. Except the game world.-The bugs and glitches. Everyone knows about these. But my game just fell apart at the seams at the final mission.Crucial moments didn't trigger. Had to reload several times to get an NPC in the right place to continue.AI / pathfinding went all out the door. enemies stumbled to find a place to stand and shoot, they came out of vehicles T posed and rotating every way.Enemies ran through walls / obstacles / vehicles.Some didn't even enter the area they were supposed to be.Walls didn't want to render at all. I could see into the void.Animations didn't trigger or were completely busted. Going into idle, t-pose, walking etc.Voice lines didn't trigger at all, or played twice.Sudden insta deaths with no reason as to why (no damage taken)Lipsync got busted several times.And all these bugs were only in the final mission, and I probably forgot some.Other bugs are:Not being able to pick things up.Cars suddenly flying through the air.Clothes / hair disappearing.Trash/boxes etc just suddenly exploding because they popped into existence just a second ago.Kill boxes in areas you can double jump to.Getting stuck in random places with no way out.Jumping on fences and whatnot increasing your speed so you instantly die.All of the NPC behaviour stated above.Vehicles disappearing on the horizon. You almost always drive alone one you get onto the freeway / outside the city. Even tough in the distance it seems like the road is full of vehicles. The closer you get the more despawn."

After 150+ hours and exhausting pretty much all I could (not a trophy hound - most were popped during normal gameplay, the rest can go **** themselves) I have to say this game is tremendous. I only started playing after patch 1.2 and in all those hours I had 1 mission breaking bug early on (Jacky wouldn't sit down when told and I needed to restart..) Other than that I got a harmless graphical glitch (someone floating or drinking from an imaginary bottle) once every three hours or so - although I didn't play this like a GTA game, I behaved myself (because the character would) and I used the city for sightseeing as I went from mission to mission - other players tolerance of police and car chases may vary...  And what sights - Night City is one of the most immersive environments I have ever seen. This was one of the only games I have ever played where I didn't ever use a fast travel point. If it was daytime I'd summon Jackie's bike and at night I'd summon a car and drive first person around the city with the jazz channel on, savouring the sights and sounds with some John Coltrane. :)  One of my Steam friends wrote that he was thinking about the game and Night City when not playing and that's bang on - the desire to just dive back in and soak up the atmosphere is so strong.The missions too, especially side missions, were all engaging and different - loved diving with Judy and exploring a flooded town - will be one of those games missions I always remember, like the Bloody Baron. On the negative side, depending on your character spec, this becomes incredibly easy about a third of the way in, if you do all the side missions. I went with the hacker build and for about two thirds of the game I would pull up 50 metres from a gang and kill them all remotely with contagion, system reset and cyberpsycho - never got old though and made me feel like techno-wizardy 4rsehole, so not a problem for me but I can imagine some people upping the difficulty. Plenty of scope for replay as well - still not sure what the Cool stat is used for - mine was 5 all the way through. I also would have liked to have seen more missions set in cyberspace - there are a couple of narrative-heavy ones with little interaction but something that allowed you to navigate through cyberspace like Neuromancer or Count Zero would have been amazing. This is way too long, just play it and ignore the naysayers (on PC at least :))."

I felt that if the game turned out to be the worst game I played or didn't even run, 10 dollars I paid for The Witcher 2 and The Witcher 3 felt so much like stealing that the extra 60 would still not cover the amount I would pay for the enjoyment I got from them.After putting 160 hours on Cyberpunk 2077 I can say that it fully deserves the full price I paid for it on its own merits and after so many disappointments in the recent AAA releases that I had, this is the highest praise that I can give to this game. I'll start by saying that I love urban spaces, I love finding alleyways that I have never seen before in my real life neighbourhood, I love seeing all those lit up windows at night and I love that there are so many details and slices of life in every corner in a city. A city, to me, is the greatest work the humanity can achieve due to its intricacy, its organic nature and how it reflects the ""human condition"". Since the Liberty City of GTA IV, most games have been a disappointment in this regard, for example Skyrim's cities consisted of 20 NPC's and copy pasted guards, Los Santos of GTA V was just a sanitary (and small) theme park that just could not function as a city if it was translated into real life, and San Francisco of Watch_Dogs 2 was utterly devoid of character and charm. Previous game of CD Projekt Red, The Witcher 3 came close to what I expect from a digital urban space, Novigrad (and to some extent Toussaint) were brimming with life and had all the details that a real urban space might have but failed in size.The real protagonist of the marketing campaign for this game was the city itself, especially in Night City Wire episodes, V and his or her story was in the background and rightly so because this game, even with its minor issues has been the greatest city that has ever been built in a game. Every district, even every alleyway has so many details that I was amazed that my GTX 1070 could even run it (at a stable FPS rate too by the way!). There is a never seen before verticality in Night City. When GTA IV came out, I was impressed how many buildings there were that you could enter but most of them were just copy paste jobs with no real character to them. In 12 years that passed since its release I had expected that this would be polished and taken further but this did not happen until now. Night City on the other hand, does not only offer tons of well-designed buildings that you can enter, but completely opens up a new appreciation for the city once you get the leg cyberware that allows you to double or power jump (you probably should get one of those early). You can probably spend hours parkouring around buildings while focusing on every little detail that has been lovingly crafted and placed. Even some streets have multiple levels and while this is a common occurrence in real cities, I never noticed their absence in digital urban spaces until I visited Night City. Not only verticality distinguishes Night City from others, at 160 hours I know that there are probably hundreds of alleyways and tens of shops/bars/buildings that I never visited and even though I have completed the game at this point, I look forward to going back to the game and dissect every little detail in those and the small stories they tell. Especially whoever designed the graffiti around the city deserves a raise as I often found myself looking at those admiringly, wishing that the city I live in had some of those.Gameplay wise, I was not expecting much, just a Witcher in 2077 and this would have satisfied me but the game we got is a beautiful lovechild of The Witcher and Deus Ex. Every minor quest offers multiple paths you can take (if you have the necessary skill level on body or technical ability) and I had fun exploring every one of them that I could have found but I cannot deny that this level of freedom sometimes makes the game too easy and if you cannot go through some path you can always find alternatives that allows you to skip most of the level and reach the objective quickly.Game's difficulty level (I played on hard) is not helped by the fact that there are so many perks you can obtain to transform yourself into a demigod that one shots the opponent most of the time (I was doing 400k damage with my sniper rifle at the end of the game) but enemies can often one shot you as well if you are playing on hard or very hard. If you are an experienced player, I absolutely recommend picking one of those two difficulty levels. There is a good amount of weapon variety and unique reload and equip animations, and they make you feel like the most badass merc in the city. You can also use different hacks to keep your hands relatively clean, but I won't spoil this part as I loved seeing how those most of those hacks worked for the first time.Story and the characters are amazing. I did not think that I would enjoy this game as much as I did enjoy The Witcher games, as I am annoyed by the rampant individualism of the modern world and most of the themes of the Cyberpunk genre hit too close to home, but they found a good balance between the dissolving sense of community and aforementioned rampant individualism. I did not expect that the so many of the character side quests would dabble on the same issue that has been driving me mad and this theme was executed perfectly without stepping on too many tropes of the modern storywriting. For these side quests, I feel that the only thing is missing is a proper closure or change that impact the world, but it is also possible to consider this as a deliberate choice as V is just a passing merc and not the main character. One of the most groundbreaking parts of Cyberpunk 2077 is that, usually you feel like a companion in other people's main quests and this is extremely refreshing to see a game where the world does not revolve around player character. I feel like this should have been fleshed out more with a Stalker like system where every gang/community has its explicit objectives, and the player can see and impact this dynamic struggle for power or survival but maybe this is expecting too much from a game that already achieves so much.The main story is more related to traditional Cyberpunk genre themes, especially transhumanism, libertarian erosion of the state (or in better terms absolute corporate dictatorship) and artificial intelligence, but how they are presented elevates Cyberpunk 2077 from another example of the genre to a unique experience. Compared to newer Deus Ex games, where these themes are so on the nose that these issues become a mundane, everyday thing, Cyberpunk 2077, with the inclusion of Johnny Silverhand, approaches these themes with so much clarity and simplicity that you never feel the necessity to take a breather to adjust your suspension of disbelief. You may feel like the main story should have been longer and I thought of the same from time to time but at least there is a cohesive story that will force an expulsion of feelings, a catharsis, at numerous points of the story. First person point of view and a plethora of facial expressions that the characters employ greatly contributes to this as V has been much more of a relatable character than the most due to POV.Another innovation that I believe will pass under the radar is how I never felt the obligation to be Mr. Goody Two Shoes during the game and could usually transfer my personal beliefs and judgement into the story, without being punished by it which is so rare. In most games, you will often be punished by locking you out of content or forcing you to get a worse ending if you are not some form of a stoic angel, but Cyberpunk 2077 does not have this problem.Please see comments for the rest of my review as I have exhausted the space given to me by Steam. Sounds, bugs and final conclusion are in the comments."

At least to me.According to the early trailers and promises, Cyberpunk 2077 was supposed to be a game coming from a distant future through a worm-hole and made by some aliens with a technology that we couldn't even dare to imagine. The hype was insane, the true next-gen was coming. Obviously it was too good to be true.In the end, we have got a game from our time, with the mandatory bugs, AI issues and head-scratching moments. People were outraged : “so many lies”, “my pre-purchase money was stolen”, “worst game ever”. Anger can make people say many things.Lesson learnt for some : pre-purchases can be a bad idea (sometimes), and the video game industry shareholders should talk less and give more time to the developers to avoid some backlashes and stock value drops.A few months after this drama, is Cyberpunk 2077 worth it ? My answer is yes. Yes it is.First of all, the game is not a mess. It’s perfectly playable and the bugs I had were minor : some junk I couldn’t pick for strange reasons, a few times I saw random NPCs going through a wall, and the car summoning may end with a good laugh. That’s basically all I saw. The AI is… alright. No better or worse than the other games. Enemies will look for you when they are aware of you, sometimes they can be clever and surround you, often they will hide and stay there shooting you at sight. Using your stealth abilities, the game will be easy as the enemies can be blind sometimes. Though the 1.3 update fixed a bit that issue in the hardest difficulty. The game runs very well and smoothly. I had one single crash in 186 hours, the loading is extremely fast and I had no fps issue. Frankly, I'm very impressed.The balance is somewhat unpolished. You can have a very easy or hard time following the weapons and build you use. Tech perks with a tech sniper with the ability to shoot through walls ? You are a god, one bullet, one kill. Basic assault rifle ? You might run out of bullets very fast. But it’s still playable and you can progress with whatever stats, build and equipment you use. About these stats and perks, the game is a RPG, not a FPS. You have lots of ways to go through this game. A sniper ? I was that. A ninja with a katana ? You can be that. A hacker who turns off the cameras but also the brains ? Go for it. You prefer to throw some grenades then go to melee with a baseball bat ? It’s a way of life in this city. These stats can also be useful in dialogues or to open some doors or computers. It’s pretty well done and adds a decent replay-value.But what I liked the most in this game is its immersion. From the main quest to the most hidden side quest, from Johnny Silverhand to Maman Brigitte, from the codex data to the e-mails in a hacked computer, from the trash bags in the city center to the rocks in the desert, everything felt polished, well-written and meticulously put in this huge city. I cared about Night City, I cared about every single quest, I cared about every single e-mail I read. And for this point only, the game is worth it, by a lot, and erase the few reproaches I have.  For sure this game is not perfect, and for certain it’s not the game we thought it would be, but I enjoyed a lot my almost 200 hours in a single playthrough that I spent in Night City during the last three months. I’ll remember this game for long. Thank you for all of your work, CD Projekt RED."

The story's kind of engaging, combat soundtrack is decent but will probably get repetitive, radio stations are eh, they have their good tunes. The driving feels really bad in this game and the physics don't help with that. Gunplay's alright, no complaints there. The skill trees have no real depth to them, just 3% more damage here, 5% more crit chance there, etc. None of these are why I'm giving this a negative review, however. It's the bugs. There's way too many of them, more than what should be even remotely considered acceptable in a video game.  of them aren't game-breaking, sure, but they are definitely immersion-breaking. Performance is also an issue for most people it seems, you need your hardware to be the best of the best if you want acceptable FPS (for reference, I was using the 3080 and pushing all settings to the max which got me to 40 fps in some spots, 60 in others). Another issue I have is that your lifepath matters ♥♥♥♥ all past the first 10 minutes. All you get is a choice for a different voiceline on occasion that doesn't add anything. That also ties into my issue with the dialogue options. They consist of this: move conversation forward OR ask a question related to convo. That's it. Sure, you'll get the occasional important choices later on in the game, but it feels like 90% of my dialogue choices so far have no meaning - mostly cause there are no real choices.After writing this review, I realized that the bugs ended up being a distraction that overshadows the actual problems with the game.The open world aspect of the game is weak. In fact, I recently found out that there isn't even driving AI in this game - they only follow preset paths and that's it. That's why you will never get a car chase in free roam - there is no AI that would make one work. You could get a wanted level maxed and you'd still not get any car chases, instead just lose the cops in 5-15 seconds. I'm disappointed that they advertised this game as open world - while technically true, yes, there isn't actually anything to do in it. Only complete quests, side quests and side quests masked as random events (gang attacks and the like). The world is completely hollow. ""Over 1000 NPCs with different behaviors"" might  be true, but it's misleading as ♥♥♥♥. They just have different preset paths which, when they reach the end of the path, they just circle around and follow the same path but backwards.Don't buy this game until CDPR fixes all the issues. This is an early access game disguised as a full release."

The game has far more issues than graphics and was blatantly not ready for release, so here we go. -This review will NOT contain major spoilers.1: There are several pretty big side quest lines that end up going absolutely nowhere, they hint at a much greater story but just end up dropping off on a cliff hanger like they were left unfinished. 2: About 1/3'rd of the map is actually utilized. The entire east section outside of the city is barely used, even if you choose the path that involves it those most. As well as other sections of the city such as Pacifica. 3: You simply don't spend enough time with a lot of the main and side characters to know enough about them besides the ones that have specific questline's tailored towards them. Such as the gang leaders, you barely interact with them or learn anything about them, most of it is stored away in the data shards you have to read. 4: The crafting system is just bad, there's really no excusing this one. If i want to craft ammunition for instance, it does not tell me how much i will craft, how much I have, how much i can store, I cannot choose how much i craft and i have to wait to craft each individual thing of ammo. On top of all that what is the point of crafting guns in the first place? They are so prohibitively expensive to craft and the parts are so rare, whats the point? The gun will be out dated in a couple levels anyway. I could upgrade it sure but that's limited and usually not worth it as I'll typically have a gun that I picked up that's better anyway.5: The game is poorly paced and/or too short. I was genuinely confused when I hit the ""Point of no return"". I felt like I was just about to hit the climax of the game when it was just about over. There was so much build up for a pretty disappointing ending that lacked a lot of context. Much of the story just felt incomplete and rushed, like they were trying to get me to move on to the next attraction so I don't stop and see the flaws or think about all the plot holes and lack of general context. 6: My computer is the ""recommended specs"" to a T and the game could barely run at low settings at 1080p. Its not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ user. For the love of god stop blaming people who complain about the game running poorly because they just have ""a ♥♥♥♥ PC"". No, CD Projekt Red has ♥♥♥♥ optimization and ♥♥♥♥ recommended specs, stop with the cope. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BUY A 2K COMPUTER JUST TO PLAY THE GAME I PREORDERED. 7: Many of the weapons and cyberware were just outright gimmicky and not fully flushed out. For example, the ricochet power, there was no point in the game i ever found it useful, the AI would always just rush me and never take cover long enough for it to be useful and it was also very difficult to get a proper hit when they were in cover. This goes for the smart weapons as well, what is the point of me being able to shoot around cover for less damage if the AI is too stupid to take proper cover in the first place and the smart shot gun was laughably worthless to use. In addition the only arm cyberware i used was the rocket one and I always seemed to kill myself more than the enemy even with a perk preventing explosive damage from myself. This leads into the problem with cyberware in general and that is the lack of it. The only truly useful ones you can't afford or don't even appear until the end of the game since you're not high enough level. So that cool new cyberware you saved up so much to get you barely use before the games over. 8: Atmosphere. I found very little to do in night city besides the main story and side objectives. No mini games, no interesting shops, no cool non story locations. There's this big open city to explore and ♥♥♥♥ all to do. This one could absolutely be just me admittedly but I just don't see a reason to return to the game and mess around as there's nothing to do once the story stuff is completed. In conclusion the game is not a terrible game but just a woefully rushed one. I know I spent the review talking about all the negative points but if you wish to know the positives there are plenty of other reviews that do it better than I would. I don't hate the game or think it was the worst game of the year. However considering how much time, money, advertisement and hype has gone into this game the state that it was in at release and its current state are completely unacceptable. Especially coming from a company with such a good reputation. There is plenty more I could drone on about like poor AI, the police being a complete non factor but I think ill leave it there as I felt like I hit the main points i wanted. No it's not ""Just the graphics"" and thank you for reading."

It's still buggy as hell but let's put those aside for a moment.|Open World| 5/10The ""open world"" feels dead. Pedestrians just aimlessly walk around the block doing nothing. 99.9% of buildings are locked. There are barely any cars on the street. No random events on the street apart from some police shootings. The only couple places that felt alive were the mega-building where V lives and Voodoo boys place. ALL npc including those that suppose to be tough - cower in fear if a bird farts nearby, feel like a herd of sheep rather than ""people"". Oh you want to dive into role play and submerge into the futuristic cyberpunk city? Forget about it, just look at those flashy buildings eh? The city is very detailed and filigree crafted I give them that. But as someone once said: ""the city is like a museum"". It's cool to look at but don't touch it.|RPG| 3/10It is barely an rpg. Sure you can follow one path or another during some of the missions of the main quest and it changes the ending but that's as much as you get.There are love interests for main character that depending on your gender (or genitals I guess) in this game. In my case that was Panam Palmer. I can basically c*ckblock her every time she advances, ghost her and basically tell her to ♥♥♥♥ off and she still gonna call me near the end and tell me she misses me.I can go around the city and shoot gangs left and right and minute later their boss gonna call me and offer me a job. Speaking of calls. Somebody is gonna call you EVERY 5 F*CKING MINUTES.98% of dialogues are useless fillers. At one point of the game some dude asked me to join his gang and my options were ""No"" and ""No<Attack>"". Speaking of gangs. Who are they again? Is somebody even cares about them? They were hyped up like this rival gangs who are trying to take over the city, but you don't get to see rivalry, you can't side with any of those. And the only interaction with the gangs is when their boss gives you a mission. And those side missions feels like they're from mediocre MMORPG. ""Go kill couple of dudes"", ""Go clean that place from dudes"", ""Go steal something from those dudes"", ""Go follow this person or steal this car"".As for those notorious ""origin stories"". Yeah it's a filler to pad the runtime until the game starts. It's a ""choose your tutorial"", where you just walk around and talk to those forgettable npcs until the game throws you in the game as a street kid anyway. Yeah there are dialogue options that depends on your origin story but those do f*cking nothing. Just a different phrase that unravels the quest all the same.|FPS| 6/10Combat mechanics in this game are good. Shooting or punching someone actually feels like you're inflicting damage. Lot's of perks that allows you to enhance you combat in a meaningful way. For example you can jump from heights on someone with mantis blades and insta kill a goon in a cinematic fashion. Now to the bad side of the fps. The are like 20 weapon models. Just different color, rarity and stats. Still feels good to experiment with them with all the attachments and mods. Quickhacking is stupid. Basically you hack in the enemies chip briefly stagger them or deal minor damage. Unless you max out on hacking it's basically useless. |Character building| 8/10Your stats matter. I like the way they affect your gameplay. If you a strong guy you can open this door with force to reach location you otherwise miss. You maxes intelligence, you can hack in to the system and turn off all CCTV cameras to make your stealth even stealthier.Crafting is also good. The game doesn't throw a million different resources that are required for crafting like most games do. You have common/uncommon/rare/epic/legendary parts that you can use to craft or upgrade weapon or a piece of armor.Perks. There are good perks but there are sooooo many of those that they don't feel like they're affecting your gameplay. |Story| 9/10Ending on a good note.If you drop the fact that main character is Mary Sue. The story here is fantastic. Most of the time I find myself so invested in the story that I couldn't care about all the flaws of this game. I didn't watch any trailers or pre-sale marketing events of this game and I was straight up shocked by some turns of events of this game. I was so attached to Jackie that when he died I immediately went googling whether or not you can save him.Overall - 6.2/10 if you don't take into account the vast abundance of bugs. The game as it is now 4/10."

My review isn't perfect cause I just blasted through 10 hours of this ♥♥♥♥, and am a bit fried.Say what you will about it's story but I quite enjoyed the first act, and was touched at the characters interaction, despite having very little set up. The story so far has been suspenseful, and fairly immersive, something that was, of course, expected. but the side quests, they're god awful. Most of them are just little radiant fetch/ kill missions and the story accompanying them is terrible/nonexistent. Some of these radiant quests can't even be bothered to have recycled voice lines (unless that's another bug, which there's plenty of) and are just a fleshy mob of unremarkable enemies to sink lead into.The melee combat is absolutely pathetic, you just meekly slap people with whatever weapon you happen to have, and while it does good damage, you really just spam left click, there's no skill or anything creative involved in it, animations are boring, and never even interact with your target, ie a sword bounces off somebody, doesn't actually cut/stab them, even for a final swing.All in all, I would not recommend this game, it's buggy as hell, the combat (a primary function of the game) is rather boring at times, consisting mainly of bullet sponges and endless shootouts. The story is enjoyable but judging by other reviews that's clearly up for debate, and half of the side quests are absolutely boring as hell.It really just feels like a modified, slightly more serious and much for sexual saints row, and you can buy that for like 3 dollars."

Literally every 60 seconds I encounter another bug. Whether it's a pedestrian floating and walking through the sky, a garbage can exploding near me, NPC mouths not moving when they talk to you, a guitarist playing an invisible guitar, a story NPC walking through walls, or many items that I simply cannot pick up; it wears you down after a few hours.Cars and pedestrians also just disappear right in front of you a lot. When I look into mirrors, my female character is bald, even though they have hair and a hat. Your body casts a shadow on the world, but most of the time it has no head, or no hair. When I reload one of the assault rifles, the magazine doesn't get pulled out when the character grabs it. The list of glitches is endless. I've been documenting a lot of the problems and made a video here: Gameplay is similarly disappointing. The combat feels worse than Fallout 4, and enemies are complete bullet-sponges. Even on Easy mode, you need to unload 2-3 magazines to take down some of the basic human enemies. I started on Normal, and after the first few missions I had to turn it down because it got boring shooting every enemy hundreds of times.One of the first missions features enemies that can 'hack' you and make you burst into flames. They do this through walls on the other side of the building and there's nothing you can do to stop it. I just kept burning over and over until I progressed through the level enough to find and kill them.A lot of the time, your footsteps and movement make no sound. It's really weird when you're jumping and climbing over rooftops and obstacles and it's completely silent.Some of the controls cannot be rebinded. I usually play with the right side of the keyboard, but here I can't. You can't remap the interaction key from 'F', can't remap the movement to arrow keys, etc. The only way to fix this is to dig into the game's configuration files and alter some text lines. Even then, some keys like 'Inventory' and 'Map' are completely hardcoded and cannot be changed.Vehicles keep turning after you let go of the direction key, so I nearly crash on every corner.Performance on a 2080 Super (i7 6700K, 32GB RAM, 850 EVO SSD - latest Nvidia drivers) is less than ideal. Even with ray tracing disabled, I NEED DLSS enabled just to hit 40-60fps. And that makes it look blurry and aliased, especially at 1440p. There's also a weird bug where if I change a graphics setting and then return to gameplay, my FPS drops to a 5fps slideshow for a minute or so. It's like it needs to reload every shader in the game or something.I will continue to play for the amazing world design, and update the review as necessary, but it's definitely a disappointment so far. It feels like it needed another year in the oven."

I've followed every piece of media or news surrounding it. I even did something I normally never do - pre-ordering. Unfortunately, at this current state, I would not recommend purchasing this game at full price.I'll start off with the good parts about this game. Mainly the storyline and overall gameplay. Combat does leave some to be desired, but it's still engaging and really fun. The main campaign and side quests are really good, with plenty of emotional and thought-provoking moments. Choice and agency  there in some form, but I feel there's not as much as I would like. But that may be cause I hadn't adjusted my expectations properly, so take that with a grain of salt. Night City is also quite possibly the most beautiful game world I've seen to date. The music and sound design is top notch and it just adds to the beauty of Night City. Only issue I've had in this regard are the short lifepath prologues. I wouldn't mind them to be a bit longer.Now for the not so fun bits.The bugs are there. They're glaring and they impede on the immersion, which is what sold this game for me in the first place. Floating objects, t-posing NPCs, poor rendering of characters and cars, NPCs just magically appearing out of nowhere. Your vehicle vanishing into thin air upon reloading a save. Braindead AI and probably the worst cops in any open world game. NPCs simultaneously talking to and over V, failing lip-syncs and pieces of clothing turning invisible.Normally, I would overlook most of these bugs. But because they're so pervasive and happen literally every single time, it becomes really hard to not notice them. I've had the fortune to play this on a relatively high-end PC, but I've also heard that the game is practically unplayable on consoles. This is unacceptable for a game that's been in development for eight years,  crunch time. CDPR tampered with reviews, withheld information about the final product, and straight-up lied to its costumers. For a company that boasts about being consumer-friendly, this sets an extremely poor precedent which unfortunately is all too common among the gaming industry.Until this game gets the bugfixes it needs, I see no reason to purchase it.: Fun game with engaging storyline. Bugs make it a continuing hindrance on overall enjoyment. Will not recommend at full price in its current state."

For instance, you usually have to spawn your car multiple times, until you get lucky and your car doesn’t spawn inside other cars or props and gets ripped apart immediately. The city looks great at first glance, but the moment you start exploring, especially climbing, this all falls apart and you will notice how empty and soulless everything is. The entire city is built with a relatively small set of assets. These assets are lazily copy-pasted into each other and if you look closer, you will find many obvious holes in the geometry. Interesting to note, the area around your Apartment looks noticeably less generic and much more polished than the rest of the map.I’m not even going to talk about the non-existing NPC AI or the broken mechanics, according to tests on Reddit, even after Patch 1.1, there are still 35 Perks, that simply not work. It seems like this game was released in an early beta stage. Even though I enjoyed it overall, I feel very cheated as a customer. The release of Patch 1.1, that was hyped as a big update, but was a very small set of bugfixes in reality, is a good indicator, that CDPR continues to disappoint and lie to their customer base."

And if you don't have the best of the best computer, it looks like dog crap, maybe something out of unity with unfinished lighting and 30fps. If you can't run ray-tracing, don't even bother buying the game. The glitches are constant, and even *with* a good graphics card, it does not look remotely like how it was advertised to look. This game is not optimized at all. I can run red-dead redemption 2 on ultra graphics, but not cyberpunk? Ridiculous! Your character customization is based on preset button choices. Do you want ugly jaw type 1? Or awkward broken nose type 2?. You dont have the option to change your bodytype/shape at all. No muscle mass options, no nothing. Saints Row 4 came out in 2013 and has both better voice acting, more choices of voice actors, a slider to pitch the voice, sliders to customize with in general, better dialog, and doesn't make you feel second hand embarrassment when you hear your own character speak. There's only two voice actors. ""I'm clearly a middle-aged man"" and ""I might be a girl with bronchitis in my teens"" and it's edgy to the level of cringe.You can change genitalia, and for some reason they decided to put in *realistic peepee physics* instead of giving you the option to remove breasts from a woman because you maybe don't want to look like a walking slab of meat. But hey, you can make a futa, right? The NPCs glitch out, the game is full of bugs, and it feels like a rushed product for a mobile RPG game. This in no way feels finished at all, and for a game that's all about customization and including every type of person; for a game that's set in the future so you can modify your body however you want if you can pay for it, you have zero control over what your character looks like. If you want to even consider buying this game, you need to wait. You need to wait until they start optimizing it, wait till they change the loading screen because for anyone with epilepsy; it has a *significant* risk of giving you a seizure. You need to wait until they give you proper customization options, better choices, and definitely definitely wait until they lower the price. It might be a good game over all, but if I can run red-dead on it's highest settings without my rig catching fire and i can't even play cyberpunk without the lighting erasing the inside of my character's eyeballs and making it look like they're a ghoul from fallout?

For PC I think the bugs will get ironed out in due time and that would be the only gripe with the game currently, as the sum of it all has the potential to be one of the best role playing games: -the storytelling is gripping-the environment is rich and immersive-the graphics and sound aspect are top notch-the game play is fun and rewarding while movement, gunplay and driving behave pretty good - as much as you'd expect from a role playing game and these do get better with time.All these pros are currently muddled by the bugs still present on PC (other platforms are not subject of this review) rarely game breaking, yet annoying when they happen, since the immersion is so strong for me in this game and bugs can ruin it completely.That being said this is an awesome first person experience; I enjoy just walking about and seeing how the game looks, I enjoy the lore pieces and references scattered throughout the city. The music fits very well. The gunplay feels particularly rewarding. There could be some combat balance issues to fix further down the line. The inventory/UI could use another pass for clarity and convenience. The game looks very good on high and fine on medium preset. The REDengine 4 does a very good job and the game is playable on 40 fps unless you're in a fast paced shooting scenario with multiple enemies. That being said, performance overall is acceptable on PC as the requirements were pretty high from the start and if you want a full RT experience (DLSS required) on above 1080p you will need 6800 XT/3080 or above with a strong CPU.I believe CDPR will do a good job here as it did with improving Witcher3 and once the bugs are patched, Cyberpunk 2077 will be remembered as one of the greatest role playing experiences or at least one of the most immersive cyberpunk games up to date."

I absolutely love this game. Yes, it is glitchy and buggy and yes, the developers should have gotten more time to actually finish it. But as long as the bugs are only visible and will be fixed later on, I don't think it's a problem. Night City is so nice to look at, I find myself getting distracted from my quests, just to look at everything in the city. The NPCs wantering around feel a bit creepy though. The just wander aimlessly, and if you interupt them, they just go the other way, or even disappear.I get a bit bored during the long sit-down-and-talk sessions and often miss what the quest was about, but that's more a personal problem I guess. And the game leads you through what to do very well when the mission starts. Mini map works like a charm.Overall, I have had so much fun in this game and I am so grateful I get to play it.

That said, it sat in my library and I did not actually download it until Feb 3rd as I waited for some patches.I have played far worse games and far buggier games. This is well done imo and I have not ran into any real glitches and maybe 2 or 3 very minor ones in over 100 hours of play.I have a decent rig but not a NASA level pc, i7-8700 and an RTX2070 but I'm sure this game runs less favorably with a lesser rig as it is a 2021 game with some decent technology.Reviews in general don't always tell the story. I do read them and write a few on products in general including games but I find some people complain regardless. I would have missed out on some good products over the years if I strictly went by reviews. Tastes are different and so are mindsets and temperaments.That said I noticed a campaign of sorts by those who hate this game to actually bring the overall rating of this game down. Yes some in the forums have been pushing for bad reviews. Enjoy the game and if it's not for you move on, or vent and move on. But don't bust on other people who like the game just because you don't like the game. When you do that I can't take your original opinion with any degree of seriousness.Edit: 1 more thing. The are countless ""Let's Play"" videos or quest walkthroughs and how to videos on the web. You'll see that the game runs just fine. And I am enjoying this game. Btw, it is an action Adventure with some RPG elements.2nd update: So 190 hrs in and I have to say this game is fun and has been running very well for me. No freezes, no crashes, no issues completing missing, no issues with achievements (if that's your thing) although I'm not really an achievement hunter. The game looks amazing.The game might not be equal to all the hype but not many if any could hurdle the bar that was set for this game. Make no mistake it's a good game if Action Adventure games with some RPG elements are your thing. I give it a 7 1/2 out of 10 on PC but on console forget it from what I've seen and heard. More patches coming for both. Enjoy, I know I am.3rd Update. Finished the game on two different endings and I have to say there is much I really like about this game. Really took my time exploring this game plus I focused heavy on crafting and that can be time consuming if you let it be which I did. Fortunately when you get to the point of no return the game auto pauses and let's you know while also autosaving at that point then will throw you back there after you beat the game if you say yes to that option which I did. I love the Crafting, the weapons, the gameplay fighting mechanics, and of course the story. You can really get attached to some of the characters.As far as glitches go nothing really stopped me from completing the game and although I am not an Achievement hunter I don't feel like I was glitched out of any except maybe one but I can't say for sure as in the beginning before I really had a grasp for the game I messed up a side job and that job cost me 1 achievement.This game is worth buying, but if you have a potato for a computer I would hold off until more patches come out and then make sure you meet the min requirements of course. Oh, I am also now modding a second character (playthru) with Nexus mods and they have many many mods already including a couple of game fix mods but I did not use mods on my first playthru.I'm revising my overall score on this game of which I am so glad I played to an 8 although I'm tempted to go 8 1/2. I'll be playing more characters as time goes on."

Not from actual gameplay, but from a bug where the game doesn't fully close and runs up the time on Steam. Just another bug, which I guess is CDPR trying to run up the hours of playtime on the game for metrics since most players dropped it a week after it came out. But uhhhhh, yeah, the game is alright. So many moments where it's clear that had they actually put more work into the game it would've been awesome but so many corners cut. Beautiful looking city that is completely devoid of life. Some great missions but a truncated and somewhat linear story mode. Performance issues out the wazoo. Just a whole mix of good and not so good, but it's occasionally fun to play."

Few tips for newer players: -Play on Hard mode, it'll be more rewarding and challenging. -Scan everything all the time. -Save (F5) all the time...ALL THE TIME. -Buy skills based on your style and it's okay to banks points until you're sure what you want to spend them on. -Do side missions as you see fit, they'll stack up, but don't worry. -Have fun out there chumps!"

Besides the glaring performance, visual and gameplay issues (which are severely consistent across the whole game), Cyberpunk 2077 has an even worse problem under the covers.The thing is, Cyberpunk can hardly be considered an RPG by this point. There is almost no player agency, as the story always plays out the same way, with the only meaningful choice being the epilogue of the game and the final mission. Not only that, but player customization is pretty lacking, with only 5 stats and several skills with a bare-bones talent tree. It seems that CDPR mainly focused on its script and the action elements (which are acceptable as best) instead a providing an outstanding role-playing experience, which seems extremely weird when we consider that this game was developed by the same company that published the Witcher 2, one of the best RPGs of all time. It seems that AAA RPGs will keep taking this route in the near future (see Fallout 4, Outer Worlds), so I would advise you guys to consider games such as Disco Elysium if you really want to experience a deep and complex RPG game. Going back to Cyberpunk, I hope that future patches will fix the most notable bugs but, deep down, I believe several core aspects of the game will stay the same, leaving us with a husk or a 'what-could-have-been'."

I watched the 48 minute ""gameplay"" demo (which was revealed to be fake post-launch) almost every day to hype myself up for this game. I wasn't expecting a godly game, I really wasn't. But I was expecting what was shown leading up to launch to be what we got. I'm not even too angry about the bugs. Sure, they're immersion breaking, and are just dumb overall, but I can live with them. No, what I'm upset about is all the features that were shown which were all but existent in the final release. So many features were removed an entire essay's worth of text was written just showing what wasn't in the final game. (By the way, if you wish to see that post, you can do so here - - ->  <- -) Point is, what you see in the images, and footage from CDPR isn't what you get. The footage is almost all taken from a montage, or the intro to the game, with all the shown off features outright missing from the game. AI is brain dead and will leave fights underwhelming, the dialogue system, and your choices don't seem to impact anything, the weapons, while fun to use, are victim to that ""ditch it as soon as you find another with +1 Damage"" system, and the city generally just feels dead. Sure there's people walking around, but they don't do anything, other than show off how buggy the game is. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game because of how badly we were lied to. The features shown off are almost all gone, leaving a hollow husk of a game. It's truly sad to me, as I would've loved a single player game to dive into a genre like this and generally popularize it. Unfortunately, it seems the term ""Cyberpunk"" will be associated with this game for years to come. One thing I feel I need to specify: I'm not entirely blaming the Developers of Cyberpunk 2077 for how it turned out. I blame the greedy execs who wanted to rush this game out the door for a quick buck, as this is what happens when they do. I am hoping that, by some miracle, the developers are going to somehow add in all the previous features shown off, and give us the game we were promised, but I highly doubt that would happen."

I played as a mantis blade-totting male V with the Nomad lifepath and got the good/best ending with primary attributes being Body/Reflexes/Tech. To say the experience was underwhelming would be the understatement of the century.Let's get the good things out of the way first:> Interesting plot: V, a mercenary in the game's dystopian setting of Night City finds themselves chasing a once-in-a-lifetime job- retrieving a biochip (allegedly granting immortality) from the biggest corporation in the city, Arasaka.> Fantastic visuals: On a technical level, this is one of the best looking games out there, capable of some good looking shots even at lower settings. Amazing lighting and character detail.> Solid soundtrack: Developer CDPR has always excelled at this so no surprise there.> Great lore: as Cyberpunk 2020 is an already established franchise, (going back to the late 80s) there's a ton of material for the devs to work with and they definitely seem to have done a decent job in translating the tabletop material to a mainstream RPG format with the world, design, terminology, signature characters, etc... all the while encapsulating it with their own spin on the lore.> Good characters: the major cast is well realized like Jackie, Rogue, Panam, and Johnny Silverhand himself. Voice delivery and animation work is good for the most part.> Promotes a variety of playstyles - tanky solo (using the Berserk deck), sneaky netrunner (with a Cyberdeck), hybrid, etc> The Cyberdeck Quickhack system: Its cool and frankly overpowered, letting you deal with enemies without even entering combat.> Encourages exploration: with some neat rewards and non-plot related world building for those who take their time to explore.Mixed on:> Character customization: feels a tad limited/basic> Gameplay: In essence it has Fallout like interaction and attribute system + Deus Ex like exploration + Borderlands like combat and skill system - all of it is servicable. Melee is ok, not bad but not good either. The hand-to-hand fight quests were garbage in Witcher 3 and they're even worse here. Combine all the problems the game has, both technical and fundamental, and combat becomes stale very quick.> V's disconnect from the player and world: due to being strictly first person, the cinematography feels very unimpactful during major moments.> Lots of augs and skills - but most are extra stat boosts/tweaks (like regain health when reaching certain lower threshold) or borderline pointless stuff (like 2% chance to shock enemies); only augs that were actually gameplay changing were the Double Jump for the legs and Kereznikov/Sandevistan (slows time for a few seconds)> Side quests: Some of the story side content is quite good (like The Hunt and Sinnerman) but most are forgettable. Though none of them are as complexly designed as the first major side quest about retrieving the spybot from Maelstorm.> Wonky car handling: its either too heavy or too slippery but some vehicles handle better than others - you get used to it eventually.> Gear system: Since different gear have different values, your character will end up looking like a complete buffoon if you want to equip the highest armor accessories. Something like Nioh's refashion system would've been great.Unfortunately the game just drops the ball with regards to everything else:> Basic open world: Night City is beautiful but shallow - huge and vertical with nothing to do besides run, sneak, interact, jump, attack, drive and pick up scattered loot. Most open world activities (including Gigs) are picked from Ubisoft's book: go here kill this person, clear this hideout, upload this malware, steal this item etc.> Action and choice: The world does not react or change based on your choices or actions and majority of the decisions you make outside the main plot don't really make a difference to anything.> Lacking basic enemy variety: thugs/enforcers, netrunners, robots/drones and the occasional cyberpsycho - that's literally it.> Horrible AI: The worst AI I have seen in a modern video game yet and makes the meh combat a dull endeavor. NPCs have limited behaviours and no basic pathing or collision detection either.> Tedious crafting system and inventory management - seriously who designed this? Upgrading/crafting gear is very expensive due to needing a ridiculous number of components (often in the higher double digits or hundreds) - even after investing in relevant skills. Disassembling items is a slow process and crafting said components is hair-pulling levels of frustrating; the game really expects me to keep clicking the CRAFT button 500 times to get the 100 components I want?> Buggy/broken: It's no secret this game is a mess thanks to being in development hell AND being rushed by the upper management. That means this is one of the buggiest games I have played yet, with immersion breaking glitches at every turn - from as harmless as not being able to pick up smaller loot to major, like one of the minibosses being unable to move due to getting stuck in a chair. If I had to describe the situation in one sentence, it'd be ""barely hanging together with duct tape and spit"".> Misleading marketing: As much as I sympathize with the devs, Cyberpunk 2077 is unfortunately the best example of ""overpromise and underdeliver"" - promised features cut throughout development (like vehicle/apartment customization, non-combat uses for weapons), numerous missing features (no law enforcement tier system, no environmental hazards, no complex AI routines, etc), mechanics that don't work as intended (cops spawn out of thin air instead of in vehicles) and watered down systems (missing lifepath content and toned down verticality). Oh and lying about the state of the game mere weeks before launch.> Bad optimization: I've seen people across various platforms (and different PC configs) reporting different problems even after patches - for me the game slows to a crawl whenever I look in a mirror (despite rendering mirror res being low and pixelated) or even freezes for a while when taking a picture using the photo mode. Although some of the more pressing issues have been reduced/tweaked (like slightly better overall performance and asset streaming post-patches).Verdict:5.5/10. I agree with my V on this one: while I enjoyed my stay in Night City, I don't see myself returning to it anytime soon. The game peaks during the first 6-7 hours which got the most development polish out of the several dozen hours the journey lasts. Not worth buying till it's fixed and when it is, wait for a discount. The pros can't save this one from being painfully mediocre, even though it manages to be engrossing at times. Oh well, hope they finally realize their vision with a sequel."

This game would easily deserve 10 if not for the bugs, which were easily foreseeable given the rush to release. Because the game is victim to review it will be a 10 trolls, I'm giving it a 10.

Vehicles feel alright, the FPS game play could be better, as it feels pretty clunky. If I could add something to the game, it would be more varied options in clothing. Everything feels like it's some slight variation of other items, and most of the time during the game you're gonna be looking like you just ran through the clothing section at a Walmart. Give me some Cyberpunk helmets or somethin. I'm glad I can actually enjoy it now in some form, because I'm never gonna forget how much of a disaster this was at launch.And if you already own it, chances are you're re-downloading this because of Edgerunners."

The only thing that can be done is to improve the STATS, and in a few variety of weapons, the colors change, and nothing more.The cars were a mess handling, you can buy cars, but they can't be modified as promised.There are parts of the map that were never finished, not to mention the metro system that was promised, it shows that something happened in the development of the game, a pity.Theme of secondary missions are entertaining more than the main story.Very repetitive activities.They honestly promised something they didn't deliver.

Darnos la opción de ser malos e intervenir en las decisiones del a historia.  Ni hablar de  todo el contenido que cortaron y las promesas que nunca cumplieron .El problema no son los bugs , sino lo  anteriormente redactado .Los gráficos y la parte artística son un espectáculo , pero se nota que en cada parche o update se centran mas en el Ray Tracing y en el DLSS,  se nota que les interesa mas vender mas Nvidia RTX que mejorar el juego. Tema armas muy pocas,  no hay opción de personalización como prometieron , muy nulo , solo miras  y algun silenciador.No se puede modificar los cargadores para ampliar la capacidad de munición , no se puede modificar los cañones de las armas par mejorar el alcance o daño , no se puede modificar culatas ni nada,   mue hubiera gustado un sistema similar al del Pay Day 2.  Lo único que se puede hacer es mejorar las STATS,  y en variedad de armas pocas, cambian los colores, y alguna variación nada mas .El sonido excelente , como la ambientación , sonido de armas etc. Los autos el manejo un desastre ,  podes comprar autos , pero no se pueden modificar como prometieron .Hay partes del mapa que nunca se terminaron , ni hablar el sistema de metro que prometieron , se nota que en el desarrollo del juego paso algo , una lastima .Tema de misiones secundarias son entretenidas mas que la historia principal.Las actividades muy repetitivas.

It's really enjoyable, has a great story line and the graphics are top notch.  I am playing on an AMD 5950x and EVGA 3090 FTW3 Ultra, so I can play with all the settings maxed out, however, I don't hit 60FPS(I'm at roughly 40-45 FPS but to me that's playable and I'm happy to play as such).  While everyone might not have the hardware to play at the highest settings just remember to update your graphic cards as Nvidia and AMD both released brand new drivers right before release, and it substantially helps performance for many.  With that said the game needs optimization focus updates to help make sure those without beefy hardware can enjoy the game on higher settings.The game play very much like a Elder Scrolls/Fallout Game.  The way the first person mode is, the combat, the upgrade system and weapon customization system all feel alike.  To me I like this as it helps with familiarity, but I can understand where this may turn away games.  There's unlimited combinations on what you can upgrade.  Weapons, clothing, armor, ammo, just about everything serves a purpose in this game which is great!A downfall is I wish the game offered a better tutorial system and that was interactive and part of the game progression instead of what we get now which is going to a certain area and click to participate in the tutorial.  Now this should be optional for those who are going through multiple play through's so you don't have to go through the motions each time you play.  When I say interactive, I would like the game to teach you fighting while you fight actual enemies, sneaking and killing/disabling enemies as part of the story line and the rest of the options that come with the tutorial.  This is would help new players a better feel for the game, and it would offer veterans to pass through the game without going through it multiple times.I'll add more to review as I go along so this will be a work in progress.l  This definitely a great game and I do recommend getting it.  Just be prepared for hardware issues, because it's definitely an outstanding game."

The problem is, CDPR marketed it as the second coming and while on a point by point basis it looks like it's there, most of it feels incredibly bland and like it was put there just to fill out a marketing point. If it was just some game I was playing I'd give it a recc because it's not unenjoyable, but since I feel the need to judge it over what people expected and what they see then I have to caution that it's one of those game's that when you list out the features and look at the screenshots you'll probably be misled.This isn't a comment on the unacceptable amount of bugs or the honestly disgusting release of the console ports. I also didn't go in with sky high expectations or follow it religiously like some people. I like the Witcher series a lot, and while I think CDPR as a company is extremely scummy I don't consider myself a hater on their games or anything, likewise I'm not a fanboy. This is fitting, because CP2077 is one of the most whelming games I've played in a long time.Hacking is incredibly bland and barebones, the skilltree does almost nothing besides give equally bland and incremental stat boosts, and the conversation system is the same exact 'press X to end at point Z, press Y to end at point Z but snarkier,  press the other buttons to get a line of useless dialogue before pressing X or Y' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that masquerades as conversation options elsewhere. This isn't necessarily a deal breaker, but when the game was marketed as a huge branching narrative filled with unknowns and a story you craft yourself, it's insanity that somehow  gave deeper dialogue options.The prologues were nonsense, marketed as these huge world shaking stories that completely changed your character and added a ton of replayability when in actuality they're just five minute setpieces before you're dropped in the same place as the others and given a dialogue option once an hour that serves no real purpose besides bypassing a skill check you could probably pass anyway. While marketed as being on the level of those seen in Dragon Age: Origins, they're not. It's also painfully obvious that the Streets origin was given so much more detail so that when reviewers were forced to only play that one, it'd make it look far more important than it is. Corp and Nomad origins are so underbaked it's actually insulting.Night City itself is big and pretty and expansive, and remains interesting for several minutes before you start seeing the glaring flaws and the glaring hole where the living breathing world that CDPR assured everyone would be there should be. NPCs are the same budget 'spew random dialogue when clicked on then replay animation' stock you see in literally every somewhat open world video game. They don't have any sort of life cycle, they will sit there and play the same animation and say the same line literally every time you walk past forever. This would just be one more mark of 'meh' to the game, if it wasn't for the fact that, yet again, CDPR constantly marketed this. And I know this all just sounds like pedantry, but my point is that were promised stars and the moon with the game and it's just not that. It's an action shooter with some dialogue. The dialogue isn't bad, when the cutscenes actually work they're enjoyable, I like some of the characters. Like I said, I'm not particularly underwhelmed, I'm just whelmed. There's no huge massive glaring problems (besides the bugs and how misleading CDPR were), the game just is. It's what you expect from a huge multi-billion dollar company's multi-million dollar project that was made by committee. Ironically, it, the marketing campaign, and how CDPR runs itself all feels like more of a satire of the game's soulless and scummy mega corporations than the game's own half-assed attempts at conveying a message. Which I could start a whole other diatribe on (how little attempt the game actually makes to say anything about its world or raise any interesting questions) but won't to scavenge some form of brevity from this.To cap it off, CDPR made a game. It's not a bad game, it's just a game. It probably won't blow your mind, and if you have seen any of the marketing material for it then yes it was probably built in a way to intentionally mislead you on what that game will be. Features aren't there, those that are feel like they were put there just to check boxes, characters sold to you for dozens of videos and prerelease stuff will die within thirty minutes of meeting them, those that stick around will do nothing besides shoot out five seconds of dialogue before sending you on yet another 'kill people in area' mission. It's a game.I have to assume, just from the dev time of the project, the result, and how absolutely scuffed it is, that CDPR has serious management issues. The whole project reeks of either having been restarted multiple times or having constantly changed directions and had features torn out or tossed in with no real direction. I don't think the people at CDPR are bad or that they're bad at their jobs, I just think as a company they might be in some form ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ incompetent. And I say ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the least malice and anger possible, because anger would imply CB2077 makes me feel anything, and despite CDPR telling us:""Do you want a game that's an eight or nine... or a ten?""""I suspect the story will leave you an emotional wreck""""Okay, we get it, Witcher was good, but boy, when Cyberpunk drops, these top RPGs lists will be shuffled...""It's just another game.But hey, can't wait for multiplayer and the cosmetic microtransactions!!!--Right my opinion largely hasn't changed. Just about to finish the story, have done most of the sidequests. People will say if I threw so much time and effort into it then it must have been worth the cost, but honestly I was bored and I didn't want to critique the game without having actually seen what it all had to offer. Also really  to enjoy it because it is almost my type of game, but it's just not really happening.For my own sanity, I decided to list out everything that comes to mind that eats at my brain because there's a ♥♥♥♥ ton of things that bother me that's not often talked about (yet).

No one pulls out a gun and no one runs away. Moreover, they all walk in pre-determined paths. If you try to block their path, they turn 180 degree and walk to the other direction along the same path, instead of moving around the obstacle. NPCs are mindless puppets that don't react to you stealing their stuff. Even if you steal a non-aggrod enemy's fancy car in front of them, they would be cool with it. Weak AI affects other aspects of the game as well. Player gets reported for crimes that have no witnesses, and police spawns out of nowhere behind you. Running away from them is easy, just sprint 200 meters in one direction and they're gone. Easier done with a car, as there are no police chases in this game. At this point I wish CDPR prevented killing NPCs and cancelled the whole police bounty system. You can get insane damage numbers if you know where to spend your points in the tree and what weapon to use."

Its not bad, but its also not good. And thats what makes this so difficult. I love Cyberpunk, the story, the characters, the aesthetics, the music, the overall feel night city gives you, and yet all these good aspects about the game get overshadowed by all its flaws. Cars that dont render, enemies and AI that simply dont work, constant crashes. And its such a crying shame really. And yet, if we ignore all of these obvious flaws the game comes with, whats left really is such a beautiful piece of art. Im being completely honest when i say that no other game ive ever played in my long gaming career has left me feeling the way this game did. I chose to start the game as a nomad, an outsider, someone with big dreams, but little knowledge of reality. The same way a player starts a game, as a newbie really. And from the moment you set foot in the city, you see all it in all its lights. A beautiful city, with so many colorfull different people, opportunities and cultures. But behind it all hides a dark reality that isnt too much different from our world, or a world we might sooner or later live in. Now im not going to go deeper into each character, mission or overall storyline of the game. But if you are able to look beyond all the bugs and issues the game has, you will be left with something truly beautiful. You get sucked into this world, and i feel like you can never truly leave it again. Judy, River, Johnny, Panam, and at the end even you, V, a character that starts out as a clean canvas, that slowly but steadily becomes a version of you, but in the game. Sure not all choices you make have as much an impact, but they are still there. You still said all these things to the characters, and even if they might not have any immediate consequenzes, u still get the feeling inside you that they have an impact. A character might forget that you yelled at them because it fits the story, but you wont forget it. If you truly immerse yourself into the world, become V, you really can form  bonds with some of the characters. And to this day, long after finishing the game a second time already, i still look back at it, and feel the need to do it all over again, to go into Night City, say hi to all the people u left behind, see what they are up to, even just taking some car, turning on your fav radio station, and going for a ride becomes more than you could have propably imagined before starting the game. As a side note i want to add just how beautiful the ingame soundtracks are. Not the radio, but the background music you get during cut scenes, or certain conversations/missions. It really makes everything a million times more beautiful and emotional. Even now i often find myself listening to hour long versions of some of the soundtracks ingame when im feeling emotional or having a bad day.I know im not good at writing reviews, and this really isnt much a review, rather me rambling on about how i feel about this game, that has taken a very special spot in my heart. If you feel similar about some things, feel free to write a comment or add me, so we can talk about it :) If not, feel free to tell me how none of this made any sense, and how bad my english is, because for some reason many people like to do that on here.Cyberpunk really isnt just a game, its an experience, like a movie, that you are part of. It shows just how small and insignificant we really are in the grand scheme of things and yet are still able to find happiness in life, if we allow it to enter. Not in things like money, cars or sex (okay maybe a little sex lol xD) but in other things, friends, family. Because at the end, thats the only thing V has left, all the fame will dissapear, the money too, but the friends made along the way are what stays, and they give you a reason to keep fighting, even when all your other dreams and goals are shattered.As Johnny would say: ""Never stop fighting V"""

I wanted it to be fair, to not nag on the bugs and the constant issues that seem to plague the game – they can be fixed. The Witcher III is proof that a buggy, mess of a game can be made great. People forget that game was Skyrim levels of bad. I mean, it was probably worse than Fallout 76.However, I soon realised that finishing the game would not change my review. The story, whether it remains as great as it is or nosedives, would not change my recommendation at all. Heck, I would not even blink.Believe it or not, my issue is the core design of the game. The fact that CD PROJEKT RED sit there and actually call this game an RPG is a slap in the face. It is an action-adventure game with elements of an RPG. It has a small crafting system, a limiting clothing system, and a deprecated and defunct weight system that has no place in a single-player videogame. I guess the developers realised this as they no longer call the game an RPG. Seriously. There are very few games that make me think, ‘Yeah, this is an RPG’ while playing. Really, it has pretty much the same system as The Division and no one clamoured over that – bullet sponges included.I want to mull some things over and debate their usefulness in the game.1) Genital Customisation – what was the point? Seriously?Speaking for men here. You see the wang in character creation, you see it in the menu when you remove the clothes (speaking of which, remember when the developers said there would be a wardrobe and not a menu inventory?) and that. Is. All. It is pointless. Like, I did not play this game to stare and drool over pixel penises, nor did I buy it and expect a substitute for pornography. However, they made a system, spent time actually implementing it, used it as some kind of pitch, and then created it. And for what? It appears nowhere, it has no impact on dialogue or the story, no one comments on it. No banter or shaming because you chose ‘small’. No awed noises when people see the ‘big’ option. No one cares whether you are cut or uncut. You take off all your clothes in the world, the game gives you bland underwear. In cutscenes, when V is showering, you are in clothes or in underwear. Was the penis added solely as a selling factor, another Rust or Conan Exiles? The wang is rare in media and people seem to find it memey when one is visible. My plan of a nudist V that wields nothing but a katana and has insane hacking skill is out the window. What is the point in slicing people up with a katana if my girthy meat is not flapping around?2) Character CustomisationPointless. You do not go for style like what was said. It does not matter at all. You will wear the booty shorts with a fedora because it has 2 armour more than the military trousers. You will wear heels over basic runners because, as above, they have better defence. My V looks atrocious because I am playing on the hardest difficulty and one small armour point is the difference between dying and coming out on top. The funny thing is, I would not care about this if there was a glamour system in-game. So I can keep the outfit I like but use the stats of other gear. Likewise, the ripperdocs change some aspects of your body, but what if I wanted my V to lose an arm and have to use a fake arm, like what a lot of people have? Where is the ‘cool’ factor? Glowing eyes, golden skin, chrome? It is all missing. The worst offender is you cannot change your hair once you start. Like, once your character gets better, you still look like you did at the start. I started as a scruffy nomad, but now my V is rich. Still have a wack beard and wild hair.3) DialoguePointless. It changes very little, it feels so very slanted, and anything in blue is a waste of time. A character will go from a passionate speech, full of anger, to a soft, “Yeah, we should do that. You are right” within the span of one second. Everyone is so hot and cold due to the weird dialogue. It feels like an intern delivering coffee wrote half of it and a professional screenwriter wrote the other half.-Onto some pluses, so I can actually not feel like I am crapping on a game that deserves some praise.When the writing is good, it is good. Some of the best writing of the decade. The quests are fun, immersive, and forge a connection to characters (when the writing of them is good). The game plays great and has better hacking than Watch Dogs. Characters feel realistic and have motives that are not screamed at you. There are emotional moments that will make you want to listen. This game will be great when the DLC is rolled out. I can assure that due to the loving care the developers show. As a baseline, it is the same spot as Witcher III when it released – if you have forgotten, go look at launch reviews and Reddit. It was a straight massacre. Everyone was livid."

I pre ordered this game and played it on launch and did like it but the list of problems was huge. Tons pf bugs, horrible fps problems, enemy ai issues, economy and skill tree issues, etc. I personally dealt with very large fps drops running on a 2080 super, npcs walking through walls, and some type of bug or bad visual glitch about every 30 minutes.I knew this game was going to be great eventually and I can finally say that is the case. Going back and playing it now after all the fixes they implemented is a totally knew experience. I played through the whole game and in 50 more hours of play I only counted one bug that took me out of the experience. They fixed the skill tree and made the in game economy much better. The game still doesnt run the best fps but it sits probably 20 frames higher than before and is much more stable. They pretty much did everything that should have been done at release plus more, and I think if you like this kind of game its a very good buy now even at full price."

If there is a phrase I could use to summarize the game it would probably be .Cyberpunk 2077 was originally announced 8 years ago and the hype around the game was through the roof. Everyone couldn't wait to see the next big game CDPR was going to create after the overwhelming success of The Witcher 3, and it would be this same success which would ultimately lead to their biggest disappointment.Every bit of news that revealed anything about the game was like bits of crack for the general public to get high on. We had reveals of a large open world rpg set in the futuristic city, Night City, bustling with 1000's of unique AI, a ""wanted"" system with corrupt police officers that could be bribed, an immersive combat system with multiple methods of taking down your foes, a unique hacking system that gave you access to various intel on the world around you, a litany of quests that had a meaningful impact on your playthrough depending on the choices you made, an extensive character customization unlike anything we've seen before, and at the heart of it all is you, the player character, ""V"".You are supposed to play as ""V"", who is an everyday bloke that has dreams of making it big one day and to strive towards their goal, they take on jobs from ""fixers"" that have them doing all sorts of tasks and activities.  The more jobs you complete the well known you become on the streets and at some point big corporations would take notice. Whether they were beneficial to you or not was dependent on your choices in the game and your unique playstyle. After 8 years of development with multiple delays to the release I can tell you the only thing that is remotely close to what was promised is the fact that the map is called Night City. The game feels like a hollow shell of what was advertised and makes you wonder what was being done during development. The AI feels like something from a game 2 decades ago. The world is depressingly empty to the point its like playing in the same universe as Will Smith's ""I am Legend"". The AI that inhabit the world are all cookie cutter walking/talking npc's with no interactions whatsoever. The wanted system is essentially non-existent and the police AI literally teleports behind you in droves until you are either dead or managed to run across the block to drop your wanted status. The combat system is generic as shooters go, you shoot/pummel/slice someone to death and you rinse and repeat, the only difference is how the bullets come out of your gun. The hacking system is disappointingly shallow, where all you need to do is point and click to ""hack"" something for a miniscule advantage. The choices you make in quests have no impact whatsoever to the world around you and you are essentially given the illusion of free will. And the character customization is probably the most pointless thing in the game since the game is played in ""first person"" and you don't even see yourself in cutscenes. This is just a small snippet of things that were changed or is outright missing from the initial reveal to it's eventual release. I haven't even mentioned the vast amount of bugs in the game and unpolished feel the game has. If you have a beefy PC then you can count yourself ""lucky"" to be able to ""play"" the game. If you are playing this on a next gen console then the game is somewhat playable and if you are the unlucky few playing on base current gen consoles, then I am truly sorry for your experience. The huge amount of issues the game has at its current state and the vast of fundamental changes or cut to content makes you feel like what was advertised and what was delivered are two completely different products, and this is what is truly sad. The game's story is actually very nice and makes you want to keep playing just to know what happens next, and the side quests given to you by some of the unique npc's are pretty deep and you can tell that CDPR put time into the development of said quests. Outside of the few positive things about the game, you can't just help it but think about  for Cyberpunk 2077.The success of TW3 gave CDPR huge renown which led to expectations for this game to reach astronomical levels, and just like Icarus, CDPR flew too close to the sun. Hopefully over the course of the next year CDPR fixes the core issues with the game and implements some of the main missing features, but as it stands even though I am enjoying my experience with game, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. If you want to play an immersive open world game, go play Red Dead Redemption 2.If you want to play a futuristic, sci-fi, cyberpunk game, go play Deus Ex Human Revolution/Mankind Divided.If you want to play a game with tons of character customization and sex-capades, go play Saints Row the Third."

From the first anounced trailer the wait was so long and real. This is like waiting for Saint to come from heaven and save us all but for what cost. I wish I could shout I wish I could say to every gamer go try this masterpiece. So beautiful and yet so broken, so promissing an yet so shallow in some ways. There is no silver lining. You need to dig up so much dirt to find this diamond. If you stick up there are things to see stories to live and lore to hug. Cyberpunk 2077 is futuristic amazing bladerunner world in many ways. Night city looks beautiful and dense. Every corner every street looks different and interesting in many ways. You will meet some of the most interesting and charming characters here. From best friend Jakie to lovely tech genius Judy. Only shame they introduce some of them here and immediately get rid of them really quickly. Wasted opportunity. Main story feels different from other sci fy games and never stops to suprise you. There are no other games that let you play as John Wick in its fullest glory. Sadly this is not another Witcher 3 situation. I felt like I didnt have meaninful impact in story choices. You think you chosing different path but game is fooling you to think that. There is no other choice there is only one choice no matter what you say mostly. At the end you will have this option but only by chosing your ending. Which is really sad. I miss that greatly like was in witcher 3. The lore of cyberpunk keeps givining and giving. So many stuff to read and see. Cyberengineering and revolutionizing your body modifications feels like real stuff. You can modiffy many parts or just stay as far as possible from becoming robot freak. Developers gave you so much options to play this game. You can go full silent with mantus blades, or you can go full blazing with guns and katanas. They made me feel like real cyborg ninja and it was most amazing thing. Sadly the gameplay experience was ruined by bad npc AI and removed some of the features like Wanted system and corrupt police. The scrapped a lot of vision from this title. Some of the enemies gliched out and some of the boss battles were corrupted by bugs. Not all of them but had some good fights to. At the end of a day I had tons of fun. But we will remember this game as a bad launch sadly. This shows only one thing that corpo suits ruing gaming world. The most ironic thing that you playing as V who go against those corpo suits and want to take them down. Time will pass and devs will fix these things im sure of it. But good will was destroyed and I hope CD Project Red will rise again like fenix. Wait one year for them to fix this game."

Cyb77 had 6 dimensions I have never seen before within the same game;1- Insiduous; Due multiple development issues, they had to chop the whole idea into short linear scripts. It has transformed the dream and the promisses of choices and consequences into a ride-the-train and shut up condition.2- Abominable; The A.I. and police behavior were unnaceptable, unused maps area, lifeless outside scripts, too many bugs blurred the technical debts even worse than bugs, etc. etc.3- Awful; Medium important things, such as lack of more random events and lack of open-world features. 4- Reasonable; Things that were just badly done, but they helped immersion anyway. Such as bugged TV channels that never cycles right or just a single mini-game. 5- Good things; Music both collection radios and general, guns got good design and creativity, art-design isn't always original but still is very pretty, city modelling is just right, RPG book adaptation has also good fidelity.6- Fantastical; Story made me speechless first time I played and still impresses me today, dialog was written by people who knows how life works, art direction is state-of-the-art, characters psychology has unique sophistication, immersion is near-perfection.If you do not face the reality of these 6 dimensions, you're not being realistic. You may be suffering the fanboy condition or the hater condition. Find a cure for either of these 2 spectrum, so Cyb77 phenomena never happens again. If you accept it all, you'll doom future unfinished games that expects your easy acceptance. But if you hate it mindlessly, you'll help corporations to keep inducing our community. The only way is to be smart, pay attention, face the reality as it is. It is time to move on, but I'm not going to forget it. I will always ask for accountability where it is due and you should do too.To be honest, the game is better only if you compare to the release disgrace, but far away from any promises they made that will never be implemented. Sadly for me, I can't unsee all that. But in regards to bugs, it is way better.But bugs aren't just the problem, there is the terrible technical debts.Technical debts in programming is when you don't finish lots of things and they feel loose, some looks like an illusion, like building a staircase that leads to nowhere, but you leave a sign ""up"" anyway just to pretend it goes to the second floor. Sadly this game is plagued by debts, it is pretty much in everything, everywhere. I deleted my first review that was overly positive, it granted me some points from players that I don't think I deserve and now I feel horrible. I deleted it to make it more mature, tell the truth of why I loved the game. I had to delete it AGAIN for the second time and write this one, more in pair with reality. I was blind due my first impression on the story. I will disappoint a lot of friends. So I'm sorry, didn't want to get in the hate train but that's how this works. They screw us, sometimes we take some time to see it, but then there is the consequence.This patch made me angry because it helped me see what I couldn't see December 2020. I will only accept Cyberpunk to its full extent after the full extention of CDPR own words. As for now I'm done with it and I feel ridiculous, it toke me 3 months to see this thing is broken and I was lied to accept a rushed pile of bad programming.When I played TES IV: Oblivion ages ago, I never had the feeling I needed any mod to play it.Only after finishing it and having one of the greatest gaming experience of my life, I saw some mods in sites like the Nexus and I loved them - it was optional, non-essential, done for the pleasure of it. That's what mods should be for and their ultimate goal. But when Skyrim came out it was a totally different thing. Game felt empty in many aspects, lacking many things I deem essential - like a game set in a snowy mountain without footsteps sprites, and no decent coats or robes. Ugly looking armor, even the graphics were unpleasant. I had to overly mod Skyrim to the extreme, to fill the many thousands of lacunes left by Bethesda.I believe we did more harm than anything, developers gets used to it. Deliver poorly executed games with great advertising, then let the fans do the rest. That's not how this works dude. I paid for your promisses, then deliver it.

Meanwhile, us fans have waited nearly a decade for this, only to be given a mess of a game years off being ready and devoid of nearly all public promises made.CDPR are liars and have zero credibility or good graces after this monumental and historical disaster that will have implications in the gaming industry for years to come.

What is lacking from this game after the end is that there is nothing more to do in the game, then after finishing we return to the main job ""NOCTURNE OP55N1"". I understand the purpose of returning to the main job ""NOCTURNE OP55N1"" is to get an alternative ending to this game, but in my opinion it is better to give the ""New Game +"" feature because we can play this game again from the start but we still have skills, money, inventory, and fast travel that we got from the previous game play. ""New Game +"" is still better than going back to main jobs ""NOCTURNE OP55N1"" because it can correct our mistakes when choosing decisions on main jobs and side jobs conversations. For example: I made the wrong choice at the beginning of the game so I couldn't get Jackie Welles' weapon. And I also made the wrong choice while running Judy Alvarez's side jobs so I didn't get a romantic scene with Judy T_T. I want to restart this game but if I have to repeat from 0 it will waste a lot of my time, that's why I wish there was a ""New Game +"" in this game. ""New Game +"" can also increase the play time in this game. Please add the buy property feature so we can buy a new house / apartment. And also add the custom vehicle (car and motorcycle) feature because when I saw the trailer for this game for the first time, I thought we could modify our vehicle.

Many people were overly excited even though there was no gameplay footage or enough info at the time other than the Teaser Trailer, with comments from people who said that this would be the game of the year or the best game ever created in the game industry. Well! The game is finally here, & let me tell you that this has been more than engaging. It's been amazing! Since I played, I can't seem to put that game down. The main story just keeps on giving! It's like watching a really good movie, & I had a lot of fun playing it. The main story has been really gripping.For starters, I'm sure that most of you have heard about a large number of bugs in this game by now. I heard that The Witcher 3 was just as buggy at launch. However, I never played it. From my own gaming experience, I didn't encounter too many bugs, so I guess I'm one of the few lucky people. It seems that CDPR is quick on fixing bugs & listening to people.You start by choosing your life path & create your character with a poor choice of tattoos & color for the eyes & hair. Shush! I'm picky with that sort of thing. The character's face can't be seen outside of the inventory menu, in mirrors, in photo mode & at the end of the game. But to some people, including myself, it's better than no options at all. (We were told & shown that we could see our character in cutscenes, but there's been none in the game so far, minus the endings. Maybe in future updates!) Also, there's no turning back for you, which means that makeup on your character's face will be permanent in 2077! You should keep an eye open for those friends of yours who might want to prank you in your sleep...After about 30 minutes into the game, you turn out to be a mercenary who does various jobs for Fixers & activities for friends like races, shooting targets contest & help-out the NCPD clear out the streets from various crimes & from cyberpsychos. Sometimes you will also be asked to escort someone, deliver a package, or retrieve some item or evidence.There's also a small collectible activity available, which requires you to tag or scan 20 Tarot Card graffiti scattered all over Night City. There's also a dozen pre-added crime scenes & story-teller scenes for legendary or iconic weapons & items, free vehicles & data shards (notes) for the player to pick up that shares a few interesting Easter eggs related to some well known movies & other video games, which is a nice touch.The combat feels good, especially when filled with over 50 weapon types & dozens of Iconic weapons available in the game. Some are more loved than others, & even more when they also have weapon attachments available like different muzzles, suppressors, better sights & long scopes. Many weapons & attachments are available in various colors & paint jobs that might not be for everyone's cup of tea. But if you want to rock with a bright-pink futuristic AK-47 that carries a baby blue suppressor & a lime green scope for your flashy cyborg-killer, then that's a thing. Or if you prefer to shoot your enemies with your shiny-gold-looking shotgun & sniper rifle, that's also possible! Unfortunately, changing the color/skin of your weapon at will is not possible. No menu or NPC can do that for you, which is a shame.There's a vast selection of clothes & head accessories for you to choose from, allowing you to dress your character how you want it & without gender restriction neither. Earrings aren't an option, since it's part of the character creation. Most jewelry like necklaces, bracelets is either tied to innerwear, outerwear, or a one-piece outfit. The next thing I'm not too fond of is the color options. Luck & patience is needed to find the right color, not to mention the armor's stats that go with it.Fortunately! There's a crafting option allowing you to turn an uncommon or a rare item into a legendary item if you have the perks & attributes for it, & also to increase the DPS of pretty much all weapons & armor stats to match your character level. So you can stick with the same pistol you're carrying around since level 2 & still kick some butts with it!There's something that could confuse some people at first since this game has 3 different level systems. First is your character's level, which will allow you to use stronger weapons & armors but also match enemies to your current level. The second is street cred, which is your reputation. A higher cred will give you access to better weapons, armors, cyberwear, vehicles & other items like mods & so forth. The third is the skill progression, which will increase based on actions you keep doing through the game. Like, performing multiple stealth takedowns will increase its progression & allow you to get some skill rewards like increase evasion by 3%, or give +1 perk point & decrease visibility to enemies by 10%, etc.Vehicles play a significant role in this game. Despite the world map looking pretty small, it feels big even while driving 200 MPH down the road. Car handling varies from hypercars to sports cars & muscle cars. Muscle cars & sports cars drive & handle the best. As for motorcycles, I could only appreciate 2 types of motorcycles as the rest didn't feel that great. As of right now, there's no taxi/cabs you can take & that fancy train from the trailer is (at the moment) just for show. As for the AVs (flying cars), they aren't something you can drive. They only appear during missions.A few side quests are tied to the main story, which could change the course of action & even the faith of the story. The same goes for the life path you start with, making life easier or more challenging for you if you were a Corpo, a Street Kid or a Nomad. Some dialogue options can be available to you based on your life path. The same goes for your attributes. High enough points in Cool can give you the option to suggest a better plan to take on an enemy territory.The immersion & amount of details in this game always impresses me, like the News on TV & radio that shares details on what's been happening as you progress through the story. Or NPC near mission areas that talk about recent events the player might have caused. Or just the visual is sometimes shocking, making me wonder why the developers went that far just for that amount of detail, like the components under the cars.This game has some ups & downs. Let's go back to the voice acting for a moment. It's more of a personal opinion than a fact. I did create both character genders, & I might be crazy, but I have the feeling that the protagonist was meant to be a female character in the producer's mind from the very beginning. Either that or the woman who voiced V was much more experienced than the man who did it. Sometimes, the result from the male version of V was underwhelming to me. The ""expression"" in the voice for a lot of dialogues was missing. Like during an intense mission from Act 1, I could detect the sadness & disturbance in the female voice. Early on into the game, a quick example with female V as a Corpo who will whisper to Frank sharing info about her boss who is in a tough spot. You can see Frank's facial animation & body language, which tries to listen carefully to V's whispering. But male V never whispered while sharing the same dialogue & Frank did the same animations for that whispering sequence. That didn't hit me the same way. But again, it might just be me.Outside of the mission areas (free roam), the AI is terrible. Don't expect that to be like GTA or RDR2, as the developers seem to have put more effort into quest areas than anywhere else on the map. Certain action buttons like flipping a switch or sitting on a stool could use a larger hitbox. I often find myself having to wiggle my character or crosshair around.Well, I believe that's pretty much it for now. I hope that my review was helpful to you! ♥"

When you are lucky and the game runs smooth on your build you get a really decent looking world.I just started back at release for some minutes to check if the game works and then I waited till now to play it (after the first bigger bugfixes and updates came). With my GTX1080 the graphics look really good and sharp. The only thing I have is some fps dropping (from 60 to 20) in downtown. 60fps for a single player game are okay for me (think that on consoles it was capped anyway + I get a much better graphic with this then on a console).I really liked the story. Do you remember in The Witcher 3, the decissions, that you hated, because there was no clear good or bad outcome, so you had to choose what you thought would be the lesser evil? Well, in Cyperpunk you have this all the time. It can be frustrating, but it also makes you reflect a lot. So a kind of hate love for this.BUT, as many others already stated: Most decisions don´t have any impact and most of it takes places at the end.I found the main story a little short to be honest, also with all the involved sidequests. Most hours I spend was doing GIGs and Street Crime stuff. You have much do to, but it is also a little bit too much. Some funny and nice sidequest aside, most are really repetitive. To enjoy the main story more I wanted to do all side stuff that was at ""moderate"" or ""low"" level before proceeding..well: I needed 2 full days to do so. The main con with all this side fill is: you forget about the story and you get dragged out of it completely.Many people criticised the armor/clothing system, but I like it. Ofc, if you only wear each clothing piece with best armor stats you look a little goofy, but I didn´t experienced any downside in wearing a shirt that had 10 armor points less than another. So I change from time to time. And because there is SO MANY clothing options I can choose from I always experience what looks good for me. Also some kind of ""game in a game"". BUT: why can´t we have a prelook in stores on how a certain item looks on ourselves?The part of the game that I most liked is, that you can choose your playstyle. I love playing sneeky and even in games that are not made for this I always try to do it that way. Here I am totally free to do so. First playthrough I played ninja. My second one with my nomad V I was more like a gunblazing berzerk. <3I must admit: I had a lot of fun with this game and still have, BUT while going through this world I always see how great it would have been if they would have implemented what they promised. I was not part of the hypetrain. I just heard that the guys from TW3 made a new game with cyperpunk setting and I was like: count me in. I even never watched a trailer or demo before release. So it is just my ""feeling"". I know you can´t compare Cyberpunk to some GTA, but I can compare a AAA Game from 2020 to games from 2014 regarding NPC/AI behaviour and environment, etc. And it is sad that in this parts even GTA IV beats Cyberpunk. After that I saw the videos of what Cyberpunk promised back then and I see how it is now. That doesn´t make me angry. It just feels sad, because I think the only thing that this game lacks is some time to go from a great game to an astonishing game. And I feel sad for the developers, because I know they wanted that too. In so many sidestorys or events in the world you can see it, with little references and easter eggs."

The environment and technology is buggy, barely functional. Everything seems to have been hidden under a figurative rug when it comes to player interactivity. And sometimes, even the facade is nonfunctional and ugly to look at.The gamplay is flawed and extraordinarily boring. The focus on first-person allows for neat gunplay or combat as well as movement and other engagement aspects, but the game sorely lacks anything innovative or unique - as it claimed. All upgrades offer no dynamic change to the way the game is played - which is to engage interactive objects only at specific times and places. Combat offers nothing unique, and is overall weak and nonimpactful, while its upgrades offer only static numbers and modifiers to improve upon. It really just becomes a game of collecting loot and weapons and upping numbers while remaining the same.While it promised so much, it delivered so little. This product is just an ironic testament to the greed and the short nearsightedness of corporations - and what they will do to fantastic and rich ideas in order to commodify it for a community that is undeserving of its introduction. If you want to enjoy the cyberpunk genre, stick to literary circles because this media is a gross misrepresentation and a failure of a game. Extremely disappointing."

Will definitely go down as one of the most disappointing games of all time, and that is not an exaggeration. Of course there are people who say they had no problem with the story/gameplay/bugs/glitches/etc and that is fine, but it is important to point out the problems that alot of people have with this game. CD Project Red lied when marketing this game, it is a bare bones experience 99% of the time. There is 0 sense of choice or care to missions, compared to Witcher 3 where even the standard kill monster quests had some semblance of story and choices. The combat is boring, not that CD Project Red is known for great combat mechanics, but when every other part of the game is also mediocre then it stands out even more. The story is lackluster where it just becomes about Keannu after the 1st main arc, and the initial life path choice has no affect except for a few useless alternative dialogue options.  Character customization, which is meant to be a core feature of the Cyberpunk genre, is completely wasted here with no 3rd person or out of body cutscenes. After almost an entire year after launch, this game is still riddled with issues and no amount of bug fixes will remedy the core issues that this game has with story/choice/combat/progression/etc."
614,62,insait,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChangeYourVoltage/,54,2,0,115.7,"Posted: January 8, 2021",266,4,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/5ea452d8e7a808fa3f82562eb03ad5eab8b1b03b.jpg,"TL;DR: Don't buy. It's unfinished and simply not what was promised. I personally enjoyed it tho.Also, Review is based on my experience with the game in 2020/early 2021.First off, I enjoyed my 50 hours with Cyberpunk so far.I encountered a small amount of bugs, which were mostly funny or dumb in nature, or a minor annoyance at most.Still, under no circumstances do I wanna overlook the horrendous state the game was/still is in on other platforms/hardware.In my opinion, the game should have never been announced for last-gen consoles.Also, the implementation of RTX appears to have made a huge impact on development. The game is poorly optimized, no doubt.Let's dig a bit deeper.I run a 3070 and a Ryzen 5600X at the moment. Decent hardware, one could say. Still, on Ultra Settings, 1080p, I get a measly 70fps average. City center dips to the 50fps range occasionally. Not bad, but still disappointing.The game changer here really is DLSS. Turn this setting to Quality or Performance, no further. (Everything beyond ""Performance"" is gonna look like cereal.) DLSS boosts my FPS by about 40% on average, which is impressive.Rendering and Texture Streaming seem to have been heavily gutted to make the game run on the old console generation, which is sad to see. I often encountered missing textures, or textures that were low quality popping in, suddenly becoming ""HD"".And these are just a few of the visual bugs I encountered.Now, I can look past that. Mostly. But it still leaves that feeling of ""Oh god, I wasted money on this?""On the other hand, the game is simply stunning. Visuals and Textures are solid across the board. Lighting, even without RTX On is really nice. The game creates a lot of atmosphere just with the visuals alone.There is so much attention to detail in everything. The cars, the different city districts, the houses, the advertisements, etc. etc. etc.Character models are beautifully done. Don't get me started. I think Panam, Rogue, Judy, Kerry etc. are some of the most convincing and beautiful character models I've ever seen.The main characters are a total feast for the eyes. They are truly a sight to behold and make playing the side-quests so much more worth it.I had some big issues with the audio.The biggest problem is that some parts of environmental audio just keep cutting in and out randomly.There are cutscenes in which you only hear your character grunting, despite being in a fight, while beating someone to the ground. It gets extremely awkward at times.Also, people will deliver some sentences with completely different cadence, with a completely different voice filter/setup, as if re-recorded.And those moments aren't far and in-between. It happens all the time.Voice acting is well done for the most part.Even pedestrian one-liners sound believable.Especially for the main characters, their voices carry a lot of - well - character. Hah.Except for the two most important characters.HOW COULD THEY ♥♥♥♥ THIS UP????First off, V.I've only played female V so far, but it's been really disappointing and even cringe at some points.V just sounds so disinterested. At best, V manages to sound cynical and edgy, maybe sarcastic. The rest is some mix of neutral and tired. It's really weird. The female voice actor sounds like purposefully lowering their tone to sound tough.I hate it.Secondly, Johnny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Silverhand.It's less bad than on V. I like Keanu Reeves as an actor, and I adore a lot of the roles he played.I think Johnny's voice acting is.... okay-ish for the most part. But there's little character in it. There are situations in which Johnny just sounds so out-of place.Have a listen to some of Johnny's voicelines during tense moments, and you'll agree with me.It feels like the actors for V, Johnny and some others (very occasionally) haven't been properly introduced to the scene they're playing.This only gets amplified by the audio bugs I mentioned above.It really hurts.The music in-game is some of the best and most emotionally impactful I've heard in any game.It is simply amazing. Give a listen to ""Bells of Laguna Bend"" or ""Outsider No More"".The score beautifully underlines the important story moments and perfectly builds tension where it is needed.Radio Music and Fighting Ambience are okay, but become stale quickly. Nothing special here.Gameplay is... I dunno. Alright.Most side quests are the usual ""fetch/kill/bring and deliver"". Add all the other stuff one would expect from an open-world RPG/Adventure.Story- and Side-Quests are done nicely, I enjoyed all of the ""meaningful quests"" thouroughly.Gunplay feels nice, the melee weapons are okay but kinda obsolete.Perks do basically next to nothing for you. For being advertised as an RPG, the skill trees feature next to no new ""abilities"". Only percentual bonuses to stats you or your weapons might have.Apart from quickhacking and stealth, the perks have little impact on how you play.The most impactful upgrades are the cybernetics.The whole skill system feels like a rushed afterthought.Bugs here are limited to certain quest triggers not happening, forcing you to reload a save file.Not too bad. I haven't had any quests hard-lock my game. (yet?)NPCs are laughable. Apart from the usual shopkeepers and vendors, or quest-related NPCs, the pedestrians are totally replaceable.All they can do is walk around, cower in fear, run away, or drive straight. It's honestly impressive how much CDPR was able to contradict their own promises.I mean, the NPCs literally disappear when you walk a block. ""Daily routine"" my ass.I would've loved more clothing and weapon variety. There are probably only 15 weapons in the game, varying in stats and paint finish, if at all. Clothing is a bit better, but it still sucked to walk into a store, look at the sleek designs on the wall-adverts and not being able to buy ANYTHING shown in the adverts.The story is nicely done, in my opinion.It's nothing praiseworthy. no intense heart-wrenching drama, no gigantic plot-twists...But the story and dilemma of V creates lots of stuff to think and talk about.The notion of self gets questioned, family, death, afterlife and personal growth play big roles. There's criticism on basically any modern way of living everywhere, but CDPR managed to not over-do it to the point of SJW-ism.I won't go into much detail here, but I enjoyed the story, extended through sidequests, a lot.Cyberpunk 2077 is.. a guilty pleasure?Maybe I am easy to impress, but if I can find one or two things that make a game interesting for me, it's worth playing and liking to me. The characters, story and love to detail really saved this game in my eyes.There are glaring issues that will definitely ruin the experience for many players.But to face the facts, this game isn't recommendable.At this point (January 2021) it doesn't come close to a AAA experience.CDPR ""promised"" to re-do big parts of the game until June '21, so maybe get the game then."

Clearly a rushed decision to release early. Definitely needs more work. Good story and heavy on narration but the gameplay sucks. NPC AI is buggy / nonexistent and for it being such an intense world and it feels rather lifeless. At the time of my review I'd played this game for 90 minutes. My review 90mins in; - They couldn't even release it on time (Even at 00:00 it wasn't playable until 00:20+)- They delayed multiple times (Partially thanks to the pandemic)- Even after release the game still feels unpolished and is really buggy- The start of the game is very boring and gives you little to no feel for how the actual game will be- Feels like it was made by Bethesda instead of CDPR- Chrome and Gold reflective textures dont do this games graphics justice- Character customisation is 'complex' but also limited? It gives you many options, but the options don't have many options. Lip stick colour for example is very limited. (Apparently more options will come in the future?)- Texture work even on things that should be obvious (The ground for example) are terrible. Max settings looks similar to GTA 5. (Texture streaming bugs apparently, even though I play on a Samsung 970 Plus NVMe SSD)- Doesn't do a great job of letting you know you've just taken a bullet, I didn't notice how low my health was until I bothered to look at my health bar. No hit indicator, no jam, no feedback (Is a bug, requires reloading the game save)- NPC likes to stand directly in front of you so you can't shoot (Generally buggy / lackluster AI awareness)- You cannot change Anti-Aliasing technique and the one it uses makes things blurry / soft and I hate it. MFAA I believe. Give me FXAA OR NOTHING! (TAA is forced and cannot be disabled. However Nvidia overlay works to sharpen things up)- Graphics options don't have much effect on performance. DLSS does though.- You cannot rebind things that should be able to be rebound. For example, the F key (interact). Apparently this will be fixed in the future.Positives;- The world is open, really cool and lots to do. However it all seems a little boring and lifeless. Hopefully this will be better when they improve the NPC AI.- Feels like Division 2 in terms of how spongy the enemies are (Depends on difficulty I guess, I played on Very Hard but switched to Hard, seems better now)- The sound stage is excellent. Audio is very crisp and directional audio is great as well.Overall so far? 5.4/10. Just about passable only because I know CDPR will work out the bugs in the future but for now, avoid this title.I'll update if I change my mind but so far this game needs work. This is either Cyberpunk 2077 but it's just not finished. This does not feel like a game of the same quality that Witcher 3 managed to achieve. I hope the story is good but I'm yet to complete the game and do anything rememberable.Edit: To respond to those people berating me because of my playtime or choice of FXAA - FXAA still shows jagged edges and has the least smearing out of all of the AA options (if there were any lol) and I understand 1.4 hours probably isn't enough to review the actual game story itself which is why I didn't say much for it. This review is mostly for the state of the game NOT a review for the story. However to counter that, 90 minutes into the game I found myself quite bored. This feels a rushed release. The fact you cannot change some of the keybindings or anti-aliasing options makes me believe so. It is missing options every PC game should have.Edit 2: Tried to play the game again today and the REDlauncher crashed as I was signing up for extra in-game loot... Off to a great start. (probably due to millions playing the game)Edit 3: To clarify, all my drivers are the latest they can be. I'm running the game on an Intel Core i9 9900K, 32GB RAM and a RTX 2080 Ti. SSD is a 1TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus NVMe. I've played on RT Ultra with DLSS on (60fps) and off (25fps) but I seem to have found ""High"" to be a decent mix of performance and visuals. Ray Tracing doesn't seem to work on all textures like the glass in your apartment does not reflect your character like it does in Watch Dogs Legions for example.Edit 4: Last update to my review, 5 hours in and I'm still bored. Think I'm going to wait a while for updates to be released... the NPC AI is killing the fun for me because it's so ""Ubisoft"", in that I mean the NPC are lifeless and lack any kind of awareness. For example a dancing NPC will say ""I don't have time for this"" in an angry tone but yet their character is dancing in a club...????"

First, let's go over the pros:-Story is fantastic. I really do care about the characters and the world they created really does feel real-Gunplay is decent-Gives a good variety of side missions and different gigs that fixers give you-Voice acting is great..And that's it!Before even listing everything that is atrocious about this game, let me say this: The obvious thing that many have heard are the optimization and bugs, which are EVERYWHERE.  This no longer is an issue for me as I've upgraded, but the game still shouldn't run horribly with specs that are near/better than recommended. This game is also plagued with visual and audio bugs. The first 5 hours of the game, the audio was crackling. Sounded like firecrackers during music or dialogue. It literally hurt my ears and I had to hunt for a fix. NPCs will T-Pose, hold the same pose for minutes, and bodies will black in-and-out. And while we're on the topic of NPCs, lets talk about the absolute worst part of the game: the NPC AI. The NPCs in this game are a joke. Sure, there is a good variety of them, but they don't do ANYTHING. Have the same generic one line they say, all have the SAME animations (walking, running, crouching, etc.), and are terrible drivers. Park your car in the middle of the street, and when you come back there will be a line of cars behind it like at Disneyland. Driving NPCs cannot turn, swivel away, drive around it, literally ANYTHING. They don't react to you pulling out your gun or shooting their car other then running out of their car. The cars also handle absolutely horribly. Turning is slippery as ♥♥♥♥, drifting is nonexistent, and why in God's name is there not a CAR DEALERSHIP? The only way to obtain new cars and call them to your location is buying them from fixers. You can't even steal a car from the streets and save it. Not to mention no car customization whatsoever.Another thing, customization. For a game that was so heavily marketed to create the character of your dreams and roam the great streets of Night City, customization is a complete joke. You can customize the appearance from the beginning of the game (face, body, tattoos, even genitals), but after that if you wanna change it, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck. Can't change your haircut, can't add tattoos, not even edit the CYBERWARE on your face. No plastic surgery, so if you're not satisfied with your ugly face, better start a new save file, or endure that for 20+ hours. While there are a lot of different clothes you can choose from and wear, some genius at CDPR thought to give them armor values. So it's either look like a clown and have high armor, or be stylish but potentially sacrifice armor. A torn up T-shirt should have armor, and not the CYBERNETICS ON YOUR BODY! Night City looks very pretty and well-made, but the streets are essentially empty. Can't go into most shops, clubs don't offer anything outside of missions, no mini-games, NOTHING. Night City ends up feeling so lifeless and is barebone when it comes to an open-world game. I could go on and on about the frustrations I've had with this game and how much of a let down this was, but the most frustrating thing is this: The high praise this game is receiving. It drives me absolutely ballistic that this game has a 90 on metacritic, 9/10 from IGN, and high scores from countless other outlets. Did they play the same trash that I played? This game is at best a 5/10.After finishing the game and having a few days to think about it, I would say I genuinely enjoyed my time playing this game, but I still wouldn't recommend it because of the state it's in. Even after CDPR's updates and half-assed apology, this game is still going to be unfinished for the next 2-3 years. It really is sad the state this game came out in, because this is one of the better stories I've played in a video game (even if your choices don't mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)."

Filled with bugs, annoying combat, and terribly optimized, even with newest drivers and well above recommended specs.BUGS-------------This game is immensely unplayable in its current state. I'm astonished it even got past QA testing. There are so many bugs in this game that make it downright unplayable. It has been a long time since I have played a game with such an immense amount of bugs. Not since Half-Life: Source. And even Half-Life: Source seems bug free compared to this ♥♥♥♥. For a quick rundown of some of the ♥♥♥♥ I've experienced:-Multiple instances of characters clipping through each other, NPCs disappearing, and weapons turning invisible-Keybind for switching weapons stays at L. Alt even though I CLEARLY set it to not be-Falling through the floor-Physics engine giving up on life-Visual bugs that render some parts of the map as an invisible void-Characters talking over each other and calling during scenes which shouldn't be possible, temporarily breaking the conversation with a mission character-Missions getting really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ confused on where I should be-V being very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ confused on what animation I should be playing-And endless more that I have forgotten by now because they were overshadowed by above bugsCOMBAT/GAMEPLAY-------------The enemies you fight feel like bullet sponges, and you'll need to spend at least two magazines trying to kill them. There's also a thing where a camera can overheat you, which is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying when it happens in a room that the camera isn't even in.This game also has a lot of something that I have come to hate a lot: cutscenes.Since Half-Life's debut in 1998, it has been painfully obvious to every single game developer on the planet that there is absolutely no need at all to have a single moment where the player is not in control of their character, except when it is . And there are a lot of moments where the character is needlessly not in control by the player, even when it isn't integral to the plot of the game. And even though they have implemented a feature that allows you to skip some dialogue, it's very finicky about what counts as a moment that can be skipped, and it doesn't work half the time. Probably the most fun I've had in this game is when the story is happening while I am in control of the player, and when I explore the vast beauty of Night City and mess around with it.OPTIMIZATION (TL;DR THIS GAME RUNS LIKE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)-------------And the optimization. Hoo boy, the optimization.I am well beyond the recommended specs for this game (not even minimum) and at high settings, I'm getting 10-20 fps in most scenes. In low settings, it's around 40 fps. It's only when I turn down the resolution scale to 75% that I get playable performance at Low settings.According to what everyone else has to say, it's a mixed bag what experience you get. Some people claim they have flawless performance with similar or worse specs to mine. Some claim that their computer is practically catching fire even with specs like a 3090 and an i9-10900k. Some are console players and are complaining about how the game runs terribly on their 1st gen PS4 or Xbox One (boo hoo).When you develop a game, you want performance to be consistent across all devices, and not an issue for people with the right specs. This is not the case for Cyberpunk. If you are in a situation like mine, this is most likely the dealbreaker for you.CONCLUSION-------------Most issues were discussed above, so let's make it short and simple here. No. No. Yes, if you are willing to deal with these issues. If you play this game for more than ten minutes, you will realize that it is not a finished product. Not even close. This needed at least four more delays before it could even qualify as a finished game."

But after the initial honeymoon fades, and you realize how hollow the world really is outside of the main storyline, you can't help but start feeling really bitter.I'll get right to my biggest gripe of all, which for me is gameplay - Combat, driving, even minigames all seem to be a bit... dull? And also WAY too easy? Ultimately, the majority of the gameplay feels more like an afterthought that is more meant to supplement the storytelling, and that is NOT what one would expect from CDPR. But to add insult to injury, they also completely fell short on the only other thing that could've made this game more exciting and that's actual customization.COMBAT:Enemy AI is kind of mediocre - I wouldn't say it's BAD, but it's highly predictable and unvaried. What's frustrating is that the combat difficulty goes down dramatically around mid-game once you start getting better weapons and whatnot. But it just gets to a point where combat is not even fun, just tedious / annoying. Especially police interactions where cops just.... spawn out of thin air a few feet away from you? The implementation of this is atrocious. The guns are great, and they feel good to shoot, but the melee combat is honestly garbage - very disappointed with it. It feels clunky, awkward, uncoordinated... Nothing at all like the buttery smooth, almost orchestral sword dancing you'd get in the Witcher. I get that 1st person melee combat is totally different, but there are ways to do it right! This is not it. Also the fist-fighting is utter crap and so buggy, it takes A LOT of luck to finish those damn boxing missions.DRIVING:Personally, I don't mind the mechanics - reminds me of the old Driver games as far as the cars handle, just takes some getting used to. There's definitely room for improvement. Some vehicles feel great, while others are almost undrivable (Quadro Turbo R, looking at you). What really needs improvement here is vehicle MASS, which you can really feel during collisions. Crashing into another car feels so so so fake and unrealistic - it's like both cars are made out of cardboard. And some cars will literally just... drive right under other cars at high speeds? The worst part of all this though is the laughable racing missions - the opponent vehicles don't even actually race you, but just spawn alongside you if you get too far ahead / too far behind, and they can't actually blow up your car when they shoot at you (or vice versa). What in the world were the developers thinking here, I have no idea - these races COULD be SO MUCH FUN if they made them actual races, with intelligent driving AI and realistic vehicle mass and damage. Instead, once I realized I'm not racing at all, these missions were so dumb - no challenge at all. And they are the only racing offered in the whole game, so clearly they didn't intend to flesh out the racing idea, which is really frustrating. Why even bother teasing us with the idea? Why pour so much attention and energy into the vehicles in this game, and not even have more missions that revolve around driving / racing?CUSTOMIZATION:This is where the game gets a major ""Huh?"" They give you the option to create your own character in the beginning from scratch, going so far as to change your ♥♥♥♥ size. You get setup thinking, wow, I'll be able to do so much customizing in this game...! But nope. For one, no personalizing your character after creation - not even haircuts or color, or tattoos - nothing. Guns??? You can add a few mods (that aren't visual), switch out a couple of scopes, and choose between a couple of silencers. That's it. And vehicles? Nothing. You can't even pick the color of your car. Clothes? You can add stat-changing mods, but that's it - no customizing, or color changing, or even a way to neatly organize them. God forbid you want to put together a cohesive closet for V - good luck finding the exact shade of that particular jacket you're looking for. Big thumbs down here for an RPG game that heavily flaunts customization and screenshot photography tools that implies it cares about aesthetics.All in all, to say I'm disappointed is an understatement. Even if this game ever fully address its myriad of issues and adds more content and customization features, at the point things are at now and from what I've heard regarding the devs prioritizing shareholders interests over team concerns really just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I just have no interest in replaying this. Wasted potential."

Nothing in Cyberpunk 2077 stands up to anything but the most cursory scrutiny. You wind your way through lively city streets packed with vendors, but the one ramen shop that is functional sells you the same equivalent of Capri-Sun and Hot Pockets that you can get from vending machines. Night City has no taxis, mass transit, or public transportation of any kind available to the player, despite a mission (and an  annoying side job) prominently featuring the most luxurious taxi service Eurodollars can buy.At best, there's a conspicious hole where any player would expect a function or feature. At worst, it becomes unclear why some systems were implemented at all. The only mystery is whether it was poorly conceived or poorly implemented -- whether the feature was too ambitious to include from the start, or whether out of sunk-cost fallacy it was abandoned instead of removed altogether as it should have been, and these strangenesses blend into oneanother.For instance, every single  can be turned into crafting components, but not any , and to do so means selecting each functionally identical soda and recycling them; a harrowing idea when you first open the easily-ignored Backpack icon tucked away in the corner of the inventory screen and realize you're carrying varying amounts of sixty different beverages with no way to do this in bulk. The game does offer you the ability to sell all your junk items en masse, but  the ability to mark anything  junk -- a feature that's been offered in every other game to come before it where a stream of slightly higher numbers cycles its way through your equipment. Furthermore, an early perk automatically disassembles any junk items you pick up, permanently obselescing the ""sell all junk"" feature anyway. Is this two half-baked ideas, or one attempt at user-friendliness rendered inconsequential by a hasty later addition? Which one is which?The game and setting are highly concerned with appearances, but yours isn't customizable in the least outside of character creation. Not hair, not makeup, and certainly not clothing. Clothing is the entirety of V's protection, and comprised almost entirely of what you gather from the corpses of the gang members that the police pay you to summarily execute -- an act that gives you street cred, somehow? -- which understandably vary wildly in quality and character. If you find a particular article of clothing that you really like the look of then you can upgrade it with components, but at higher and higher amounts that quickly outstrip the cost of buying better equipment altogether. It's hard to find what Armor does or tell a meaningful difference, so maybe the point is moot anyhow. The key for ""Reload"" and ""Pick up the weapon I'm looking at it"" are the same, meaning no less than once every other fight does my mercenary decide in the middle of combat to trade their favorite shotgun for a revolver lying on the ground that he has absolutely no perks for. Annoying for sure, but insufferable when I have to go to my inventory and re-equip that shotgun every time. It could be worse; they could have had V drop it instead, a dangerous proposition when a gun can be plainly visible but unable to be picked up except from a specific position or angle, or until giving up on what amounts to just one more assault rifle to sell to the nearest food stand that also buys secondhand firearms.As for the story, Cyberpunk 2077's narrative has a inconsistency of tone only exacerbated by its structure. Depending on which jobs you take and in what order you complete them, events pivot at a moment's notice between comedy and tragedy, invoking unremarkable primetime TV action (which unresponsive naked woman will V carry today, the murder victim or the rape victim?), surface-level vignettes about life in Night City, and the rare glimpse of a science-fiction story that might live up to the genre invoked in Cyberpunk 2077's title if only it was explored. Every opportunity for a truly compelling interrogation of alienation, or identity, or the power of that odious machine that is not stopped but only further lubricated by the application of bodies to its gears and wheels, ends neither with a satisfying conclusion or introspection but an abrupt ""pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up, huh?"" before V recieves another phone call.You can't steer the course of any of these various stories short of simply not doing them, and characters that openly hate and distrust V in one segment will share a friendly beer or offer romance two jobs later, even if the player has made every attempt to make it clear they'd rather this person ♥♥♥♥ off. Story outcomes result in a single line of dialogue, or a slightly more annoyed text message. The most signficiant change I've experienced is that if V murders a character's friend, that character  ♥♥♥♥ V. Be warned!Johnny Silverhand, flatly, sucks. I'm sure Keanu Reeves is trying, and some of the more somber moments do allow him to pack some performance into a one-sentence rejoinder. However, Johnny's not an extremist, he's a contrarian, and the script certainly doesn't help. When V is serious, Johnny is irreverent. When Johnny tries to get real, it's V who cracks wise. Johnny's attempts to ""get along"" with V amount to blackmail, ultimatums, and repeated attempts to violate V's bodily autonomy. Early on, you're given medication to suppress Johnny and to . In 40 hours of play, I was only given the option to take these pills once, despite Johnny's unbearable presence and V's worsening condition. If I could have, V would have been popping them like candy.It's the kind of thing where you try to put yourself in the head of Cyberpunk 2077's decision-makers. There are cars in the game, but they're not customizable because that would mean more development. There's no store to buy these cars from, so they're sold to you via text message by your many fixers, presumably because they couldn't get the voice actors back into the booth last-minute. There are races in the game, for no better reason than that there are cars, with the races arranged by a bartender for some reason, but you'll never be outraced in the story no matter how slow your truck is. You can steal cars if you're strong enough to rip out the driver, but your car is summonable and fast-travel points are plentiful, so why? Because the game has crime and cars? Would it have been a disservice for V to have his or her one car? How many man-hours could have been saved, how much better of an experience would have been delivered in the end if only a few of these seemingly automatic inclusions and the ever-expanding checklist of ultimately needless features had been pruned? As the player you can barely control the pants V puts on in the morning or get V a haircut despite being able to buy new arms or a second heart, so an inability to choose between a compact or a van a seems inconsequential in comparison to that kind of rigidity.Johnny and V's situation is presented early on as a crossroads. Will Johnny change V, or will V change Johnny? The reality is that the latter never happens, and the former is presented as something that you the player should encourage and pursue. You'd think that an anti-establishment figure like Johnny would understand more than anyone that compromising your identity is just death of another kind.Cyberpunk 2077, with all its attempts to be anything but a game of its own -- it has shooting, it has RPG elements, it has open-world, it has wanted levels and hacking minigames and skill trees and origins and street races and item qualities and everything else you could ever want from a AAA game! -- should have learned that lesson, because the only thing Cyberpunk 2077  have is a good reason to play it."

NOW, you have to hit tab and go into batman vision mode. now, you highlight enemies and mark them (with a different key, of course). why are you doing this? why aren't you just going in and sneaking?because there's no. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. . in a game. with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. stealth.why is leaning important? because it allows you to take cover behind objects and peek to see where hostiles are and what they're doing. what's the alternative? you literally have no idea what direction someone's facing so you just bumble out from behind cover and get immediately spotted. therefore, your  solution is to have to highlight enemies so that doesn't happen. but then, this means you're having to spend the damn game constantly with these glow-in-the-dark villains, something that's a powerup or unlockable in games like dishonored or, again, deus ex. anyway, i'm getting off track, let's continue with the stealth process.so now you've successfully highlighted them, and now you're ready to hunt. you sneak up from behind someone and press F. now you have them in a vague chokehold? it doesn't really... look right. anyway, now you have to decide if you want to kill them or knock them out, so you press F again or whatever the key is. a weird animation plays where your character looks like he's grasping at air, and then, congrats, he's on the ground. NOW, you have to look at the body and hold R to carry it. okay, now we've got to bring it somewhere. you go to a hiding spot and you press--what? what do you press? oh. oh you know. E. and congrats, you've finally achieved your first stealth takedown. now, just to sum it up, let's go through all the steps one more time.you hit control, then you hit tab, then you hit your second mouse button, then you unhit tab, then you walk forward, then you press f, then you press f again, then you hold r, then you walk, then you press e.i want you to imagine an exasperated AVGN face right now because i keep bringing up deus ex but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, in that game you just hold q, they're automatically being dragged, and then you let go and continue on. no need to highlight enemies either because the game goes in third person when you take cover. or hell, if you don't want that, dishonored lets you, in first person, you guessed it: LEAN. YOU CAN LEAN. i don't really know where the story goes from here, and i don't know how the other backgrounds start, and i don't know how much more fun it is to play the game like an action hero--but i don't care. this was enough. now, i'll probably be back after a year or two of patches and updates, but for sixty dollars? you could do a lot, lot,  better.[EDIT: apparently you can lean! you have to specifically have a weapon out and then attempt to aim it while at a corner. seeing as i was playing as a stealth pacifist, i saw no reason to have a gun out at all. that's a good thing! there is definitely still way too many buttons for what should be a simple action. but this definitely makes this more playable, now. i'll update these first impressions with a fuller look if i continue on][EDIT 2: yeah it still sucks. play deus ex]"

Its a mess. The AI is non existent. TONS of visual bugs. Driving is a mess. NPCs ignoring obstacles and just walk through stuff, including walls. Joke level stealth system. Random conversation with NPCs make no sense. Teleporting cops. Inventory management and the items are a mess. The conversation options do not matter. The shooting part is a hit and miss, depends on you if you like sponge shooters or not. The melee system is a joke.To say some good:The game, when works, looks fantastic, assuming you want to overlook the 40-50 FPS on max graphix in 1440p on a 3 grand euro PC. The story is good. Some elements like the diving of recorded memories is nice, definitely an upgrade from its predecessor in Remember Me. The voice acting of the main cast averaged from mediocre to really good. The characters are also distinct enough in personality that i do not forget who is who. V's voice changing based on what is happening was a pleasant surprise, when his life is threatened, you can hear it in his voice (only played male, dont know about female V).If you want to buy the game only for the story, go for it. However, if you are looking for its open world aspect, dont. Its an empty world that requires like a year more of fixes and additions. If you want a cyberpunk game that doesnt want to be everything at the same time and failing badly at it, go for DeusEx Human Revolution or Remember Me."

One might ask why would I complain if I sank 72.7 hours into this, and why would it not worth the full price? Answer is simple: I do not weight my enjoyment based on Hours played. I mean I can happily waste my time on youtube/facebook etc for hours, so playtime is not a good argument for the price of the game, sorry. 10€ for a movie in the cinema might be worth it, while a game I've paid 1€ per hour is not. Overall enjoyment is individual.The bottom line is that CDPR should have waited for another year at least to release this, but they were greedy, so shame on them big time !! They also shouldn't have created such high expectations with over promising on features. It is good that they were ambitious, but should have done reality checks waaaay more often, and sync with / slap their PR/marketing folks. Especially the ""Gameplay trailers"" and ""footages"" where you see 80% of things you can't do ingame. The big customization for your character? yea you got 3 types of genitals - Penis 1, penis 2 and Vagina 1. I've seen better Customization in way older games.The signs are everywhere: some elements of the game are brilliant, and finished, like car interiors, most details in the buildings of Night City.Most are half-baked, like the combat mechanics (all combat, but brawling is the worst), weapon usage and stats, merchants and stores (very simple), hacking, even the character creation at the start.. It is not an RPG, no consequences, no intricate changes to the story based on character decisions, nothing.Some are downright a disgrace: the economy and trading in the game, including ripperdocs, the crafting system, police AI and AI in general for that matter. Many praise the graphics, but if you look in the details, there are issues there too: just check the shadow of your player character: shoulders are detached (wtf?), cars in the distance are a joke (just jpgs moving on a canvas), and were put there in the last moment to save on computer resources apparently. Don't get me started on the bugs which are totally immersion breaking - and there are a lot, I mean a lot.. trees are glitching, characters / cars respawn from mid-air and break/blow up (wtf?), V dies while walking, characters/weapons are sunk into the ground frequently, many times you cannot even pick them up, and the list just goes on and on..No, this game was far from ready to be released. None of the versions, including the PC, which CDPR is ""proud of"": they shouldn't be in this state. They should be ashamed that they gave in, and released it like this. I don't think they comprehend and anticipate how much they lost on the long term. And for what? They should have invested more on investor relations and manage the expectations there, rather than pouring millions to promoting the game.This game could have been a brilliant masterpiece, but would have needed years more of development. If they promised less features, they would have been able to deliver a relatively polished version in 2021. But of course they should have fired everyone who did the PR and marketing for them first: those guys are completely detached from reality in terms of what is possible in 2020 in game design and creation.Cut Content & 2018 Demo comparison. Several elements that were promised in pre-production were cut in the final release. Things like 3rd person cut scenes, metro rides, wall climbing, corrupt cops. I also think the 2018 demo version looked much better, not as overly bright, HUD of cars, character models in general. The downgrading of the graphics is not on an epic (negative) scale as in WITCHER 3, but still noticeable. Several storylines feel cut as well. It seems the entire wanted system was implemented 5 minutes before the game was rushed out the door and it is very apparent that they thought ""well, it's better than nothing?!""Finally, while we are on the ""waste of space"" topic... I don't get how the game critics gave 100% and 10/10 for this - the game review industry is clearly broken, and shouldn't be trusted."

That's plenty of reason for some players to be cautious, but the game is still 100% worth playing - at least, the PC version is.Is a great game with huge focus on story, characters and world building. I dont remember last time when the rpg story absorbed me so much, besides, ofcourse, The Witcher 3. Yes there are few bugs here are there, but nothing gamebreaking. Usually minor visual glitches. If you like story RPGs this is simply a perfect game for you.

Maybe in the next few months when we see performance improvements, and maybe in the next year or so if we get more implementations of features, then I'll change my mind about it.

I initially had a joke review in the review section for this game (which I am replacing with this one) because at the time of posting that review,  had become one giant meme - not a place I would have expected one of the most hotly anticipated and most talked about games in generations to land. I know CDPR has been tolling away hard at work trying to deliver on the game they promised but the reality is that  destroyed a lot of trust and goodwill the company had built up over the years with its followers and fellow gamer's and I for one will forever look at them with the eyes of a sceptic. A lot of 's problems stem from its core.  is technically not much of an RPG at all (which is disappointing given the table top source material), but more of an action FPS with light RPG elements. Many of its interconnected systems either fail to make an impression or simply don't work (point in case I couldn't use a single replenishable item in my inventory for my entire playthrough which begged the question why was I even bothering collecting all that sh*t).At least on the PC it ran pretty well and while not quite as cutting edge as many believed it would look in the graphics department, if taken as a whole it could look impressive at times. I did find the main story line gripping and most of the side quests were pretty enjoyable to complete when I had convinced myself I was playing an action FPS and not an RPG at all. I did feel like the end of the game was incredibly rushed, as this was where I acutely felt that the team had simply run out of time and couldn't deliver on the ending they had originally planned, especially after the boilerplate missions that ratchet up the tension before entering into the final mission. The end felt almost anti-climatic because it was over in such a jiffy.  The final boss felt like a joke, given that we had been built up to fear him and he ended up being a complete pushover.At the time of play I did initially find all the various graphical glitches quite hilarious but in the end it did start to subtract from my experience. I can't speak for the game now (October 2021), as it would require a replay, but hopefully most of those have been sorted out by now. Whoever decided that crouch and skip scene should be mapped to the same button really didn't play test the game properly because they would have immediately seen how annoying this is when you accidentally press the ""B""  button on the controller thinking you are gonna stand up and then end up skipping a cut scene. The traffic system and A.I (Police, NPC, Enemy ) needed some serious attention, hopefully that has also been addressed now. Also  open world didn't quite revolutionise the genre in the same way  had done prior. That was disappointing.If you temper your expectations,  can be an awesome thrill and there are genuine moments where you can see the brilliant game waiting to be unearthed lying underneath its mess of systems and visual bugs and glitches. The sad thing is with probably another two years development, CDPR would have had the classic game everyone and his dog thought they were delivering because the puzzle pieces are all there, they just needed to be joined correctly. I do believe it could have been that genre defining game that all other games aspire to be like had it been given more time in development so it was sad to see how it got kicked out the door in such a poor state. Most people would have been fine with further delays (well at least the adults among us who I like to think outweigh the emotionally stunted death threat script kiddies living in Mom's basement),  because we have jobs, families, other hobbies that also keep us busy we don't have time to tweet sh*t. I get that there are investors, and that they want results and they want to see their investment materialise, but the 8 million pre-orders should have been enough of a sign that demand was incredibly high for this title. Sure some might have cancelled their pre-orders off another possible longer delay but excellent reviews across all platforms would have driven them all back. One has to ask, was this all really worth it? As Miyamoto put it ""a rushed game is forever bad, a delayed one is eventually good"". Those should be words you live by in this industry. In the end, while I thoroughly enjoyed my time with , the fact of the matter is given the hype and the marketing campaign I fully well expected  to come in as my favourite game of 2021 but sadly that has not been the case. In fact, come year end,  it might not feature in my top 10 games played for 2021 at all.  I can't help feeling a pang of disappointment about this, especially given that  ended at #1 back in 2015."

It's a really mediocre game, with a generally interesting main story and some of the side missions are okay, but none of the hundreds of mini-distractions really have any meaning or impact in the lifeless city. The shooting is crap, the melee is much worse than Skyrim, and the arbitrary stealth system isn't satisfying either, especially when entering sudden hostile areas with no warning whatsoever. It'd be nice to highlight these areas on the minimap or something.Driving is absolutely joyless, and it takes forever to get anywhere - even at an indicated 150mph, the metres on the HUD creep by with depressing lethargy.There are lots of immersion-breaking glitches, and the ending of the main story makes no sense whatsoever - it feels like there is so much left unexplained.It's hard to care for any of the characters, as most of the time I have no idea who on earth they are. They are catapulted into the story with little or no introduction, and then disappear equally quickly. The supposed nemesis Adam Smasher is an absolute bit part at best, and yet we're supposed to have some kind of internal monologue to decide his fate... I couldn't care less!I wouldn't recommend this game I'm afraid - it could have been really good, but it's bland and fairly soulless. The mechanics are most to blame for this, but the character exposition is also pretty naff."

Some random guy told me about The Witcher and i tried it. I loved the game even with poor and strange combat system. Usually i try to play games with original voices/language, because translations are often inaccurate, voices are too artificial and you'll miss some jokes. CDPR games on the other hand are good with full translation and i personally enjoy them that way.Since then i became kind of fan of CDPR games and was waiting for Witcher 2. I loved new models, improved combat and few more features, but the game was too linear in terms of map. Optimization wasn't good, as far as i remember. Then came waiting times for Witcher 3.Witcher 3 trailers were interesting. Final product wasn't disappointing. Open world for the first time. Horse. Good amount of main story time and decent side quests. I can tell much, but in short, it was a good game. DLC introduced few hour content and second DLC was one big expansion. You know, old classic expansion with many missions, weapons, etc. It had a new map! After waiting for Cyberpunk for years, after watching more trailers and getting more ""hype"" and after many delayed release dates, we finally received the game...It wasn't the company i loved anymore. I heard few things since then. It looks like some developers left the company and it was a case of negative experience not just for players, but for employees too. It was the start of the fall. I bought the game and played for the first time recently. December of 2021. Winter sale. By now the game should have been patched, fixed, improved and so on. If this is the case, the may the tech gods have mercy on CDPR souls. I completed the game, finished most (probably all) side story quest, had tons of Legendary stuff etc. Story side was good enough. Character models are good too. You may ask, what was so bad about it? What makes me not recommend the game to people? I will tell you, boy. After years of mentioned delayed release dates, the game not only was released in a terrible state (beta-like), but it's an average game in some aspects and horrible in others. I will tell you more.Game has poor optimization. I'm not talking about just performance (which according to some players with better PC/GPU than mine is still problematic. I do have good PC, other than GPU and have good performance in most games). Audio volume is sometimes low and sometimes high. I almost can't hear the radio songs, but i hear the damn engine. Your audio software settings/presets don't matter here. I have gaming mobo and use slightly modified gaming audio prest in SS3. It works in all other games, so it's a game related audio problem. There are more reasons to have negative opinion of the game. NPC/transport appear and disappear  out of nowhere sometimes. I had to waste a lot of time near city dump, because my car stuck and all the cars on the road disappeared, and there was no fast travel thing nearby.Poor world load after you return to the game from menus. A lot of objects can get stuck in other objects. You can't pick some loot at all!Driving physics is terrible. I played many racing games and this is terrible even for non-racing game standard. GTA 5, game from 2013 with very ""Arcadey"" physics feels amazing after Cyberpunk. Here it feels as if indie developer tested physics. Don't get me wrong, CP physics is not just ""meh"". It's really, really bad. Speaking of physics. Other physics related things are bad too. There is a funny comparison video on Youtube, where author compared Cyberpunk with other games. CP looked like an cheap indie game made in garage. Shooting at water takes me back to PS2 times.You can't customize protagonist after start. For Arasaka's sake, why the cyberhell you can't change even the simplest things like hair? Eyes in this game are impants, so why not change them too? Tattoos, cyber stuff, piercing... I mean, even in modern times we can change faces. In Cyberpunk we should be able to change almost everything. Arm implants look generic. Thanks to modder, this can be improved a bit. Where is other models? Where is visible leg implants model?Armor choice in this game is poor. You can look like Sci-fi clown with good stats or have poor stats and look better. Too many Iconic weapons. Most skill categories are poorly balanced. Stealth is good even without proper skills. Some other categories can be also ignored. Some impants require high levels in mentioned skill categories. You have to waste points on poor skills to buy some decent implants.Some implants require high Street Cred levels. Legendary arms, for example. Other than that Street Cred thing was useless for me. I had to grind just to buy the damn arms.Too many consumable items and no proper way to use them. It becomes a hassle.You can't continue playing after game ending. Load save before final mission or return to menu. Witcher 3 changed this. Why return to the old formula? AI is dumb. Police appears out of nowhere and won't chase you at all. NPC reaction on danger is very poorly executed in the game.Upgrade option for some of my weapons just disappeared at one point, for no reason. I was left with cool but weak gun. It's a bug!I hope that i haven't forgot anything.Can't pick loot Empty road/cars disappearedBike acted weird (jumped in air) and got stuckObject (loot) stuck in another object Lightning bugIf CDPR won't fix the damn bugs, improve optimization i mentioned above and at least change few things, like allow us to change character appearance and free roam after ending, then i have no more hope for this company. Expansion, for potentially fixed game, can be a good sign too. Fixes first, of course. If you want to play for CDPR style story, then buy with the biggest discount you can and be prepared for bugs.: I mentioned few other problems, updated text and added some screenshots."

When player character “V” is hired to steal some tech from the world’s largest corporation, they find themselves in an unusual life threatening situation, while also being drawn into a wider conspiracy.When Cyberpunk originally released in December 2020, it was a buggy, broken mess which disappointed many players who were expecting another masterpiece from CD Projekt (Witcher 3 is still my favourite game of all time).20 months and several patches later, I’m pleased to say that, while the game still has some rough edges, the small bugs that remain didn’t interfere too much with my enjoyment of the story and gameplay.•	Character creator has lots of options to customise the appearance of your version of “V”.•	Main story is good, although it feels a bit short. While it took me 53 hours to complete, I think the majority of that time was spent on side quests.•	There are several interesting NPCs. Obviously the highlight is Johnny Silverhand, played by Keanu Reeves, but there are a few other characters who have lengthy quest chains that I really liked too.•	Voice acting is excellent from the whole cast, and especially Keanu who brings his typical effortless cool style to the role.•	Most side quests have unique and well written short stories, such as investigating the death of the mayor, and helping a cop with a missing persons case. There’s not many examples of the copy and pasted filler content that you find in a lot of open world games.•	First Person Shooter combat is good. You can use a variety of pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, assault rifles and SMGs, and most feel fun to use. In particular, I really enjoyed the shotguns, which literally knock enemies off their feet and leave them vulnerable to being shot a few more times while laid on the ground.•	If you wanted to try a melee build there are weapons such as katanas and baseball bats.•	Using your cybernetic implants to hack enemies provides more options during combat. In addition to just doing extra damage, you can disable enemy weapons, disable their cyberware (essential against some enemies who can do a speed dodge move which makes them very hard to hit), and take control of sentry turrets.•	You can use stealth to sneak up behind enemies, perform melee takedowns, and hide bodies in containers, Hitman style. Hacking is also useful during the stealth approach as you can disable security cameras and then blind enemies (by hacking their eye implants) or wipe their memory causing them to ignore you.•	Biggest weakness of combat is a lack of enemy variety, as the vast majority are just dudes with guns or melee weapons. Occasionally you’ll encounter enemy netrunners who will hack you (although they seem to only deal damage, they don’t mess with your gear), and there are a small number of drones / robot enemies.•	I didn’t encounter any crashes or framerate issues.•	While I haven’t seen any massively gamebreaking bugs, there are still quite a few minor annoyances. Sometimes snipers would shoot me through walls. They’d be hiding behind cover and I could see their laser sight aiming at me through the cover. Occasionally NPCs were missing frames of animation and they’d kind of glitch into position for the next stage of the quest. I’ve seen an NPC walking around pretending to hold an invisible gun. I had to reload my last autosave when an elevator button wasn’t interactable. During one short quest, an NPC’s dialogue didn’t have any audio (thankfully I had subtitles on). While driving around Night City I prefer to use the third person camera angle, but a couple of times I was locked in first person.If you can accept some occasional small bugs, there’s actually a lot to like about Cyberpunk 2077, which has a well written story, interesting characters, and good FPS combat. However you should definitely wait for a sale."

I like this game! I enjoy playing for many hours, but I got a problem with this game. The bug is everywhere. My car disappears and got flip out and glitch out for no reason. Too many bugs and glitches. I can't even complete a job. It's stuck forever because of glitches. Cops spawn nowhere, and I died quickly. I like this game, and it was my favorite, but you guys need to fix some bugs and many issues. Also, I want you guys to make some great physics like other open-world games.

The hacking is really fun and satisfying, and there are some really great moments in between where you feel like a detective. The gun play itself is fine, but I wish that there was more of an obvious notification of taking damage. One thing that has stood out to me most is the fact that I have been able to complete side quests and then use that information as leeway for parts of the main quest. I've never seen any game do that before, so seeing something like that is truly breathtaking. I'm really liking the characters and the story so far! The game is a bit overwhelming with how much information is thrown at you at once, and yet there are many moments where I had to just figure out how something worked without the game giving me a tutorial. Other than those few things, I've had minimal bugs which have been just comical, and the game itself has been great! Definitely worth the wait for a sale, and even more so after the patches and updates!"

I knew little to nothing about Cyberpunk or the hype that it has created prior to its release, so when I bought the game on their platform, wishful to experience something good, new and fresh, I really went in without any 'grand' expectations.Well, a month later and I had 130 hours in the game, and although there were bugs, stutters, lags and what else playing on my entry level rig, I still was enjoying the game, the world, the gameplay, the story, but most importantly the vibe.I will never forget early in the game, getting in the car with Jackie after the Sandra gig and chilling in the passenger seat as Jackie drove you back home while...... would play in the background (if you know you know 😌).That while you'd marvel at the futuristic setting of Night City from the 'comfort' of your car, witnessing the good and bad of a world gone hell-bent on consumerism, brutalism, capitalism, and expansionism, disregarding public safety and exploiting whatever member of society it could, a glimpse of a possible reality awaiting us in the future if we're willing to let it go there.Still, halfway through the game some story related bugs got to me, so eventually I've put the game down and decided to await the fixes and improvements promised by the dev.About a year or so later I grabbed Cyberpunk on Steam with a neat 50% discount to finally complete the game this time and get all of its achievements.After sinking in another 100+ hours here, completing the entirety of this game and seeing all the endings, all I can say is that I only ended up appreciating the game more, and the near dystopian world CD Projekt was able to present us with.There are quests and questlines that arise some truly interesting questions, and with the rise of AI in our own world, these questions only gain more validity and will once become essential to consider and properly answer.And while the endings are all good in their own right, one or two of them really makes you think about what it means to be human, to be conscious, to know something, to be unsure if something's a distant memory or still a brain worm, to deal with an internal conflict you feel no resolve can be found for.All in all, a great game, the closest you can get in terms of cyberpunk Skyrim with a deeper story. Sadly my score won't be higher since the over promises and buggy launch are aspects that cannot be so simply excused."

You have people out there who have never experienced a single bug and their game runs perfectly, and then you have others who come across a game-breaking glitch or bug every few minutes. How does this happen?Bugs and oddities aside, I got this game when it came out because my friends said it would be sick, I don't know what the developers promised or said would be in-game so everything I'm about to say is coming from what I liked and disliked about the game. I started playing 6 months after releaseThis game is incredibly short for my tastes, there's only 3 acts and if you only do the main missions you have about 10-ish hours of content. There is alot of side quests, but the vast majority of them are going to a location and either killing/stealing/rescuing some people or an item or car (stealth is optional). Long story short they get repetitive QUICK. When I reached the final mission I was incredibly disappointed and stopped playing for a bit due to how short the actual game is.You have no interaction with the people who give you these side quests, you go near a side quest on the map, they pop up on your screen and say ""yo these guys are giving me trouble detes attached"". You complete it, they say ""thanks v you're cool"" and you get a bit of money. There are only a few people that you develop any sort of relationship with and they are so heavily underutilized it hurts. You have this honourable warrior who saved you and wants you to help him in exposing the truth but because the game is so short you have about 4-5 missions with him until the ending comes. You're expected to care about your best friend Jackie because the game tells you to. You meet Jackie when you start up the story, you do your first mission with him and boom the game gives you a short montage of 6 months passing by and now apparently I'm supposed to care about him. Act 1 SHOULD have been those 6 months.I'll stop with the hating and tell you the really good parts. Act 2 is the best part of the game and where I truly had fun, combat is enjoyable for the most part, I used a katana the entire time and despite how many bugs I had using it I still had a great time with it. The few times I used guns were pretty good too. The cybernetics are great, ranging from your generic ""increases armour by 20"" to giving you double-jump or letting you becoming literally Quicksilver for 8 seconds. It's fantastic. Many ways of going through an objective too, you can hack, stealth, fight with LMG's, sniper rifles, assault rifles, gorilla fists etc. There's a ton of replayability here if the game was much better in everything else.There is a chance this game might get the No Man Sky treatment and get free content updates alongside patches, and if it does, if this game somehow gets a complete overhaul of the story and fixes all its glaring issues, it could easily become one of the best RPG games out there, and I hope to God that happens.There's alot of stuff I didn't include otherwise this review would be insanely long, but TL;DR: This game is great if you like combat with a bit of a decent-enough story. Expect to get more and more disappointed if you think this is a triple-A game."

What you get is still fun, you'll enjoy it.Bro, I'll be honest right. I get that a lot of people were sucked into this for a very long while, people went crazy over the promises and went nuts over what was on paper. And better yet it was a well known developer that could have pulled it off, due their reputation. And I completely understand how people feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for believing it. However even with that said, I cannot possibly give this game a bad review.If you're still on the fence of where you should buy the game, then listen here.I don't think the stuff that was promised will be all implemented. Maybe some good stuff will eventually with their DLC plans and whatnot, but right now, what you pay for, is still a great game. Call me whatever you want, but I didn't get hyped for this game, I thought it was a good idea when I heard about it ,but I didn't lose my ♥♥♥♥, I tempered my expectations. Perhaps you could say that the fact that I tempered my expectations alone is a bad sign to show where the gaming industry is, where the moment you see a game that seems promise so much, you already know that a lot of the stuff being promised won't be in the final product. But in the end that's how it is, and unfortunately it's not the first time it's happened. Do I think that's bad? Yes. Do I think the work people have put into this should be disregarded and that what's on offer already isn't worth the price of admission? No, and here's why.This game's content, story, visuals, and themes are all, without a doubt, great. I have played many games, and many RPG's, and this is one of the games that I can see myself coming back to to experience it. The city's design alone is fantastic, these guys nailed the cyberpunk aesthetic to a tee and that is worth a lot. The story is also the essence of what being a punk is, wether you accept it or not, and while a lot of people dislike the ending, I for one think it's only fitting for it to end on a note like that. The only problem that I genuinely have with the story, is the pacing device used. The fact that the game constantly reminds you that you have to work as fast as you can to save yourself damages the ability for someone to justify to themselves going out looking for side quests (Which are quite good) on their first run of the game. It constantly left me with a guilty feeling that I should be constantly on the move to find a way to fix the problem. However, it's just an illusion. A very well built illusion, but nothing more than that.Now, let's talk about the bugs! Oh the horror! I know you've seen all these terrible, horrendous bugs and glitches everywhere! Model LOD's not loading in properly! Cars jettisoning into space at mach 20 speeds! Oh my lord however could we recover!Honestly, during my 65 hours of game i've had so far, i've never encountered any of these game breaking bugs. And odds are you won't find them just regularly playing it. What I've found were simple bugs that I'd expect from any new release of an open world game nowadays, small stuff that doesn't impede your progress, or will ruin your game. I have a feeling some of these bugs are being blown out of proportion. Not because they don't happen, they very well could, there's videos for that after all! However when you go online and all you see are these videos showing off all the bugs and problems people find, it's not going to give you an honest representation of the game.Now, before you go and call me a CDPR shill, this is the only game i've ever played from CDPR. And I do have my own problems with the game, but I don't fill they are enough to not warrant a recommendation. Weapon variety is small, you'll find the same model of the same few weapons with a different paint job that somehow shoot harder. Am I saying every gun in game should have their own model? No, I just would have liked to see more weapon designs. Some side quests aren't super interesting, and some side characters seem to be uniquely designed, yet get only used once. And of course, some of the bugs drag down and can break the immersion some times, but like I said, they're nothing you haven't seen before.All in all the game isn't bad. It's quite good actually with all things considered. It'll give you plenty of enjoyment and with the new planned content, yeah, I can see this becoming more fun. The game was rushed to release due to stupid corporate reasoning and that's well documented, but that isn't an excuse to not review something honestly and give it it's due. While the PC version is fine, ps4 still got shafted hard with it's terrible performance. and last gen consoles aren't doing so good with the game in general, but that's neither here nor there, given we're talking about the PC version of the game.My final words: It's a good game, it's not an amazing, revolutionary game, but it's a good game, it has it's problems, but every game does. If you look past that, you'll enjoy the experience, and it'll be worth your time and money."

In ranged combat they will oftentimes not do anything at all if you just keep on your feet, it seems like they put all their cards on people shooting from cover because that is the only time you see enemies actually acting.The crowd AI is hilarious, walk into someone like 2-3 times and everyone in the vicinity panics, turn around and suddenly half the crowd is gone, turn back and the rest disappeared. There have been plenty of open world games now with crowds and it seems they took no lessons at all from any of them so expect 1st gen crowd AI with all its hilarity.Balance is nowhere to be seen, from level 1 you get a wallhack and you will be using it alot because xp from completing a mission is to low so most of the time you will go on a murder spree and make sure to go look at all the bodies because if they are still moving enjoy executing defenseless people because that earns you even more xp. Stealth becomes a joke with the included wallhack but that really doesn't matter either because AI is too poor to actually do anything while you indiscriminately kill everyone. If you like gunplay enjoy bumrushing everything because they AI counts on you being a cover shooter and if you just bumrush them it usually fails to do much at all. If you grace a bystander police will teleport right behind you almost instantly and they will keep teleporting until you find a ""safe place"" to hide which can be hard to find because sometimes they teleport right behind you inside closed rooms so I have no idea where to hide and usually just load a save.They wasted their 18 rating and could have just left the sex out, they plaster all the in game ads with sex and talk about all about the twisted night city but nothing is really ever shown, oh but you get to customize your junk which will never be in any scene and the only place you ever get to see it is if you accidentally sell your pants and check your inventory/mirror.The only reason right now to buy this is if you were waiting for the story or the lore because everything else is either cut out, barely working, unbalanced or broken sadly."

You start either as a Nomad, Street kid or Corpo. The lifepath will give you unique options later in the game when you talk with NPC'sSPOILER  The Story starts slow and generic but becomes a insane ride with crazy outcomes and twists you didn't see coming! The characters are great designed and have a personality!______________________________________________________________ Sandbox/Open World with a Cyberpunk theme in a detroit like city. Night City is big enough to get lost in it for hours! ______________________________________________________________ Is based of the Cyberpunk Pen and Paper game. The game is full of Quests, E-Books/Emails and NPC conversations that build up the universe. Even the ""bad guys"" have an intersting lore that makes them human kinda. ______________________________________________________________ Has some minor bugs (Glitching items, NPC's in T-Pose etc.) but nothing that could destroy your savefiles. Gameplay is a mix of Deus Ex, Fallout 4 and GTA V. There is a huge skill tree with a level up system and a crafting mechanic for items (weapons,armor, healthpacks etc.)There are so many ways to play this game and you should really try out everything if you play it the first time!______________________________________________________________ Synthwave, Punk, Rock and more! I really like the soundtrack of the game! Everthing totally fits the cyberpunk theme but also of the world before that. There is als a DMCA free music mode for Streamers and Youtubers.______________________________________________________________This game should be played on PC on max settings! Don't play it on a last gen console for your own sake. The world is absolut beautiful (even more in the night!) I recommend to turn off some settings like ""film grain"".(Trust me it looks better without it)______________________________________________________________To end my review i can clearly recommend the game. It's not the best game of the world and i know it came a bit too early but it's a must have for every Cyberpunk fan! But please lower your expectations it's just a ""good"" game and not the holy grail."

There is nothing game changing about this game at all. Completely middle of the road and as ride as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. New Vegas is still my favourite RPG, Deus Ex is still the king of Cyberpunk media, and Witcher 3 is still the best CDPR game.I definitely cannot recommend this game to anyone has under a 20-Series card or similar, the performance on even my 3070 is pretty weak at times and my 1070 would flat out not run it ~30fps at all, and 30 series cards might as well be vaporware at this point. Playing it on low is also not really worth it, the gameplay itself is just very... basic and the story while pretty good I don't feel myself engaged much, the companion quests were way more interesting than the main quest, but the main quest was pretty fine from what I played, I know I'm at the final quest currently I just haven't actually started it. I've been telling myself I'm going to but I want to wait for the free content they're adding at some point, as I don't really see myself returning to the game after I beat it between lack of interest and just too much to go back and replay if I were going to, and from what I've gathered choosing your different paths in the intro doesnt really change much between playthroughs apart from some supplemental dialogue here and there and nothing game changing.I also can't stand the way this game handles its RPG mechanics, in your skill points give you very minor increases most of the time with stipulations to even using that increase and it turns itself into a looter shooter unless you are constantly upgrading your guns. Personally, I cannot STAND this way of handling weapons in games and would rather weapons with static stats more dependant on your skills than the Borderlands style of two visually similar guns where one just happens to have better stats for whatever reason.Like I said though, the game is gorgeous and the combat can be satisfying, especially playing it like a Street Samurai. If you do choose to pick it up, just don't expect anything deep or game changing. S'alright.EDIT: I finally did beat the game, and while it is satisfying the ending I chose (Don't Fear The Reaper, Johnny Version), I still don't think I can recommend CP2077. I do plan on doing more playthroughs now, though. I'm interested in what the Free DLC & Paid DLC will offer in the future."

This game feels like you're playing someone else's roleplaying campaign, full of well fleshed out characters, but you're along for the ride as you provide a vehicle for repeating the old campaign. Except of course, you weren't there for it first time around, so you're the fifth wheel.There's simply not enough room to develop your own character. I felt I was playing a tool for someone else's story. This is a fundamental problem for me.Setting: Amazing, seriously well-realised worldframe. Night City and its environs are outstanding. It's faithful to the original material, but also fleshed out remarkably well.Controls: The control layout is awkward, and accessing some of your cyberware comes at the cost of other functions. Eventually it grows on you, but it still isn't naturalSound: The voice acting is superb, with very few lines awkwardly delivered. I've only played through using the female voice in English, and there was little problem there. Needless to say, Keanu Reeves absolutely nails Johnny Silverhand perfectly. Graphics: There were some early glitches and T poses, which did not make for a good first impression, but generally the graphics ran well on a mid range machine.Overall: Unless you're intimately familiar with the original source material, you'll feel left out. If you ARE familiar with the material, you'll feel like you're just rehashing it all over. I'm glad I played it, but there were quite a few times I really just wanted to walk away from the game. Being forced to play another character for long periods at a time really broke the game for me."

I look forward to playing it everyday, thinking about what I'm going to do and what missions i'm gonna complete. My two main complaints are these.- I feel like Jackie's story line is shockingly little, after I found out that the cut montage you get around the first 30 minutes of the game or so are all missions that were cut by CDP. That really disappointed me as his death felt way too early and almost made him look like a side character with no story, even though he's literally your best friend that your character constantly mourns every now and then. Maybe a DLC in the future that focuses on your friendship and fills the rest of the missions that never made the cut, for some reason.- The next complaint is the romance characters and how they just feel like another mission story. Although that's what they were, I wish after you romanced them that you could do more with them. For example, call them and be able to have them join you on missions, maybe more montages of you guys doing things, similar to the Jackie montage we get in the beginning of the game. Overall though, these characters are all really cool and enjoyable to play with.Overall, this game is amazing and is a 99% recommend. Can't wait for the DLC to drop."

The ambience, soundtrack, and storylines were amazing along with the side quests and that's where your main focus should be, as an action, plot oriented shooter.I even had fun experimenting with the various play styles, cyberpunk will not disappoint you when it comes to choosing your own way to get to the objective. I certainly hope CDPR fixes its issues and kinks but overall it hasn't let me down."

I was hopeful for a while that CDPR would turn it around - yet here we are, 8+ months post-launch, and they're still doing damage control from the dumpster fire of a launch that was Cyberpunk 2077. I was hopeful for some ray of light, or some sort of DLC that'd bring me back into the game, as it has so much potential. Unfortunately CDPR just can't seem to get out of their own way when it comes to this game."

Now nearly two years after it came out I've finished up with it and... it was worth it. Similarly to CDPR's last major game Witcher 3, this is easily one of the best open world RPG's i've played. The main story is plenty interesting enough, but all the side content - even tiny quick missions that in most games only fill the space - really help flesh out the world. The consensus? Night City is f*cked up and a pretty ugly place to live... but a great setting for a game. I did still have a few crashes, but my PC by now is seriously aging so maybe you won't have the same problems... maybe. At least the game autosaves often enough that the crashes didn't affect things much. Compared to how broken people made this game out to be at launch? It was perfectly acceptable.Anyway... I'm keeping this review short because I don't wish to spoil anything. This is the sort of game you really ought to experience for yourself. It is worth it. :D"

It's not accurate. For some reason I would accrue hours while the game was shut down. Go figure. First off, I never , ever pre-order anything. It's just asking for problems. This was no exception. Yup, it had it's bugs. By the time I purchased it most of them had appeared to be fixed. The biggest glitch I experienced were the ""ghost trees"" which I fixed by messing with my graphics settings. I also had to re-load an earlier save game once. Once.... in 2 play throughs. And yes the driving can feel awkward as heck.So with the bad out of the way, what's good about this game.  The story, the lore, the environments, the freakin' soundtrack. This game is immersive in all the right ways. Yes it has fast travel points but when an environment is so beautiful and the music so awesome, I found  climbing on my bike just to drive and listen to the radio to get to quest markers much more enticing than just hopping from point a to b. I will say I enjoyed the male voice actor more than the female actor but hey, maybe that's just me. Overall I think this game is really worth playing."

Meele combat was lacking and doesn't feel good (compared it to fallout)Normal difficulty is too easy, games shoves resources in your face, this actually diminishes a lot of interaction you have in the world (further in the game you probably don't need to go to vendors, interact with people for goods, etc.) Hard feels a bit to hard. Bugs - yes there still lots of them I am sure, game will be fixed.Performance is one of the biggest thing people complain about.

Cd Project Red has done it again folks, Hear me out completely, Cyberpunk 2077 is as good if not better than the Witcher 3. There's nothing more to say, The story telling, the writing, the little details it's genuinely breathtaking (as Keanu might have said haha). I'm looking forward to see this game as a benchmark for any open world rpg`s now just like the Witcher 3 left the same remarkable impression on me."

Luckily (I’m convinced at least) I didn’t look forward to the game much at all and the only real appeal I saw was the collaboration with one of my current favorite musicians, Grimes, who produced a song for the in-game radio and voiced one of the sidequest characters. Other than that - I really couldn’t care less about this game... But bought into the hype a week or so prior to its release and partially transferred my wealth anyway. And here we are.Without any further ado, I’m just going to say that few games ever made me so invested in them. To make it a little more bearable to read through I’ll divide my thoughts into three different paragraphs.THE GOOD: 	1.	The designs. They are absolutely stunning here; from main characters, to someone you’ll only hear a few lines from throughout the game. From dangerous and scary (Adam Smasher) to soothing and routine (Judy). Applies to the in-game street ads, everything ever so slightly related to the Samurai band (later about that) and clothing for the most part. Stellar.	2.	The graphics. Alright, I’m guilty, this very game kinda made me upgrade my GPU sooner than I wanted to naturally do so. It’s mind boggling with RTX on: I’ve never seen any other game look prettier. The sights you see while driving through the city at night are worth a lot by itself.	3.	The characters. Each and every from the main character cast is very memorable and well written. Whenever Johnny (and yes, the trope with the iconic character that only the protagonist can see, due to said characters being inside their head, is as old as the world, examples: “Arkham Knight”, “Tales From the Borderlands”) appears and starts talking about his terrorist past or just says something disturbing in general, you can’t help yourself but feel like he’s all for real - he’s just that much of an idealist. And you grow to love him for that. At least that’s the case with me: you either love Johnny to bits or hate his guts - no inbetween from what I’ve heard. But even the secondary characters like Takemura and Rogue are to be remembered and have countless things and unique character features to cherish them for.	4.	Side missions. Just as rich, if not even richer, as the main story campaign. While some of them are lackluster and unapologetically short, quest lines such as “Dream On” and the story of a convicted murderer wanting to make a difference through his newly acquired faith are going to stay with you for a long long time. All of the secondary quests related to “Samurai” and Silverhand’s past are also a win. The bickering between the former band members feels like those are the conflicts that could’ve easily happened between any of the “days of glory longtime passed” rock bands, be it, say, Metallica or Deep Purple. Really authentic! 	5.	The story. Yes, as simple as that, I really liked the main story of the game and the way it was flowing. Full of memorable encounters and events, it’s the meat of the game and keeps you invested throughout. Written beautifully! 	6.	The symbolism. If you, as silly as it sounds, question yourself what makes a human different from god, wonder about afterlife and are curious about when does one’s life truly end - that’s the right game to feast on. The themes of faith (yes, faith, not religion, please never ever mix them together) are touched very authentically in one of the sidequests, too.	7.	Audio and music. The original soundtrack is a perfect fit for this world, from the menacing and grim “V” and “Consumer Cathedral” to the banging midtempo roller of “The Rebel Path”. Radio music is also great, curated by the likes of Run the Jewels, Nina Kraviz and Grimes. The latter contributed an absolutely stunning “Delicate Weapon” exclusively for the game, too, easily my favorite from all of the originals from “Cyberpunk 2077”. THE MEH:	1.	Gameplay. Yes, as sad as it is, the game gets a little boring to play after a while which is a cardinal sin for a game like this. Vehicles feel just okay, the gunplay is borderline alright and the quickhack system is fun for a while, until you realize it was done better even in the first “Watch_Dogs” game. Only the story and the characters kept me interested in immersing myself in more of the repetitiveness. 	2.	Customization. Yes, sure, you can customize your character to oblivion but that’s about it. You can’t even change their haircut later on, the clothing system is revolving purely around the stats and will force you to wear things you dislike for that sweet-sweet combat advantage. Cars can’t be customized whatsoever, but luckily I never really cared about them in the first place. But I have to admit that the game really allowed me to shape and make my character exactly the way I want them to be. Even though if you can’t be nonbinary in 2077, which I assume you can’t, since everyone keeps referring to you as to a “he” or a “she” exclusively, and the game doesn’t really give you a third option, CDPR are completely missing some really important attributes of the cyberpunk genre as a whole. 	3.	Cyberware. Oh they advertised it as the pinnacle of videogame customization, but more often than not it’s just another way to improve your stats with no visible changes. Only a few of the implants actually change you in a drastic way. But what about cyberpsychosis, you might ask. Obviously you can’t go insane because of all of the chrome in your body like you can in the pen’n’paper rpg, that’d be way too deep for a triple A 2020 game, right?	4.	Consequences of your actions. They are kinda there? Some of the things you do early on really affect the story and the flow of the later side missions but is it really game changing? Not in a slightest. Another overly advertised and underdelivered feature. THE BAD: 	1.	Technical issues. RTX 3060 ti with an i5-8400 are giving me ~55-60 FPS on high-ultra with medium RTX and DLSS on, what? Talk about optimization. The amount of bugs and glitches is legendary, not even worth mentioning at this point.	2.	Expectations. CDPR had it coming, really. Never seen a game advertised like that before, could even order a collaborative pizza from a local pizzeria chain packaged in a Cyberpunk themed box. The media, the trailers, the demos for the streamers; it’s very sad you can’t really see all this greatness in the game itself. The expectations were set too high and we received an undercooked product, as simple as that. And it’s no one’s fault but CDPR’s. Conclusion: So is the game really worth playing? Yes, but not now. I’ve had a lot of fun diving deep into the game’s world and I have to give all of my praise to the designers, writers and musicians that made it all possible for me. It’s one of my new favorite universes and I would love to play the tabletop rpg now. But the amount of technical issues and broken promises is really off-putting. Just give the developers sometime to actually fix the game, might take a year or even more, and, if you don’t mind the gameplay being a little underwhelming but care about the world and the characters of the game - absolutely go for it. Now is not the time, however, yet I’m still glad I enjoyed the game seemingly a lot more than some of the people I know. Don’t have your expectation high and you will never be disappointed."

Half way through the series I checked the price on CP: 2077 which was 50% off.  F*cking nova!!20 hours in and absolutely loving this game.  One thing that has made this such a memorable and unique experience is coming from the show straight to the game.  I have a hard time paying attention and remembering lore, characters, factions, and world building in larger games.  Reading random things I find, listening to audio recordings, and hearing dialog that is stilted and boring just isn't enough to make real connections between everything so I can immerse myself in this world and its characters to the point where I believe its an actual place.Enter: Edgerunners.  This show is so freaking good at everything it is doing.  Night City feels like a real place and the vendors, bars, ripperdocs, corporations and people all feel very connected even when ultra violence can happen anytime.   All the characters seem important and interesting.  The protaganoists, antagonists, rippers, runners, psychos, and even the randomly killed characters with 2 seconds of screen time.I could go on, but this isn't a review for the show  :)So basically I feel more connected with this game going in and I understand more about what is happening in each mission and around the city which makes me feel like my time is more important.  In short, this is one of the few RPGs I've played where I can actually believe this could be a place and these could be real characters worthy of my empathy, sympathy, and time.  If you really love the Netflix Anime, and you haven't given Cyberpunk: 2077 a shot, this is the time to do it.  $29.99 is a great price.  Plus the studio is planning even more updates and FREE DLC in the future.

I didn't watch any of the preview trailers. I didn't know what was going on with Cyberpunk. I had assumed CDPR dumpstered it. When I heard it dropped,my curiousity got the best of me. THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING TO AVOID ANY SPOILERS.It's been a year,a few patches later,and 2.5 playthroughs.  And I can review it.No,I don't reccomend it. Why don't I reccomend it? There's so many reasons why I don't.  But lets start off the good stuff.The City looks great. The music is killer. The concept is cool. The characters you interact with are generally interesting in some way(fixers aside).  And that's about where my praise stops. You'll see praise about the graphics and story,you'll see people sing praise about how CDPR fixed problems and will keep fixing problems,about how we got some DLCs.And none of that matters. Not one bit of it.  The core problems of the game are not fixed. There's issues with the game that go down to the foundation. And spit polishing the rest of the decrepit structure doesn't solve the foundations collapse. Lets start off with the story. Life paths generally mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. It changes your first hour or so,and it changes how you can interact with certain characters,but beyond that,it matters not.  Life paths werent expanded on by CDPR so I won't go further into them.The story pacing is all kinds of just..bad. The life path is 15m to an hour depending on if you actually want it to drag on longer. Then begins Act 1. Act 1 is just terribly paced.  The montage is gameplay we should've gotten,to build up with Jackie. The game wants us to care about Jackie,and tries,but it falls flat on it's face.  During Act 1 you meet a lot of interesting characters,talk a lot,and plan the biggest heist in the city. It's all cool and Payday like in some ways.  But there's cracks,small ones,that start to show here. You get introduced to all these people,and are given so little reason to care about them or their problems. Act 2 suffers more of the same,but we get Johnny. Johnny's actually a pretty cool guy in my opinion. I was always mostly entertained by his appearences,and quips in conversations or hearing is input on what's going on.  Sure he's a disembodied voice in my head,but at least he's funny at times.  Act 2 picks up where act 1 ends,you have a hole in the head,and you're dying because Johnny's eating your brain meat. There's high points in Act 2. The VA's did great work here trying to convey emotion and the troubling times. Vik,V,and other characters do amazing work here. Act 3 is figuring out what to do,and exploring Johnny and the End game. And the 3 paths you have laid out in front of you help with that final choice. Seeing Johnny change from a hardcore anti corpo jerkoff to becoming more mellow after he sees the damage he's done to V,and others around them,along with how the world didn't change,wakes him up. It's an interesting change of character and shows that johnny could grow. It's a shame that V didn't really grow as much as I hoped he would. The endings are all well done,and all interesting in their own ways depending on what you choose to do. I won't spoil them,but I did quite like them. But the stories alright,it's got pacing issues for the first half of the game. The side gigs are where the good writing really shows through. There's a lot of very good ones,and a lot of very enjoyable ones that I quite enjoyed.  Beyond the pacing problems I didn't have an issue with the story for the most part(I just wish that the writers took more into account of if V was his own character or the player. It feels like at times they forgot.)So the storie's passable. The Voice Acting is very well done,so why am I thumbing it down?Mechanically,the game isn't fun.  That's my biggest problem with the game. Mechanically,it's not fun at all. it's a boring slog. While yes,you can do crazy builds,those crazy builds don't mean a whole lot when you realize that the perks are all almost all passive bonuses like added damage or higher crit chance. The game uses a terrible looter shooter system,and there's just not enough gear to justify it. Some weapons have plenty of time in the limelight,others not so much.   The armor system is cancer and you look like you went dumpster diving in the trash wall outside the city.  Most of the gear you find will be broken down into parts to upgrade the gear you actually like. Most of the gear won't ever be touched because it conflicts too much with your build. The builds just aren't fun nor are they intuitive. Most of the perks are passive perks that increase critical damage or critcal change,or outright damage. Most of the perks you want for a build will end up conflicting with other things you want in a build.  But once you realize that all builds pale in comparison to the sneaky hackerman revovler build that clears entire compounds in seconds with spreading quickhacks,you learn that most build crafting is utterly pointless. You don't even have to spec into hacking to get the most benefits from a solid cyberdeck.Cyberware feels largely bad. Once you learn that the technomancer hackerbuild is the best build in the game,and you grind to get yourself to that point,the game is boring. The rocket arm is more likely to kill you than the enemy,the monowire uses almost all the same perks that Gorilla arms wants,and Mantis blades has so few animations that it gets boring to use very quickly. Once you get the hover jump cyberware your mobility needs are met and you only need to spec the rest to your build. But like perks,so much of it's passive perks that you forget you have them(more ram,more damage to bots and mechs,etc)You also cant sell certain cyberwares so it's pointless to buy a lower grade try it out then trade it in later.The economy is so out of wack for E$. Everything you make and sell,is worthless,everything you buy is tens of thousands of eddies.(yes i'm aware you can get a perk that increases the value of an item that you craft) but tell me,if I make a legendary weapon,and sell it,why is it 2900,but to buy it I have to tack on another 40k? Cars are largely pointless. You get so many vehicles for free,you only need to buy at minimum one,and even then that's debatable.  Get a bike if you really have eddies to burn.  You get the fasest car for free,a very good bike for free,and a free truck,so why waste eddies on any other cars or bikes?It's mediocre.  It's not very good. And it's a shame,because there's elements of a good game under here. I want to like it,but the first act is so boring that I hate doing it again."

Night City feels like a city full of nothing, and AI not having a routine plays a big part here, alongside the lack of AI's reaction towards your actions. Besides that, there is so much missed potential with how this city was handled.b) As i said above, the AI is extremely poorly coded. In fact, GTA 3 had better AI coding and that was 20 years ago.c) The ""wanted"" system has no depth and the police just spawns behind you whenever you commit a crime.d) Immersion is totally ruined by the insane amount of bugs that will inevitably distract you at some point in the game.e) Customization doesnt exist. Besides the beginning character customization that is really lacking, you cant change anything later on. Vehicle customization was cut from the game, yet they said nothing about that after they advertised it.f) There isnt even a weather system implemented, as the rain that you get to see in some missions is just a simple filter applied to your view.g) Shooting is alright, definitely nothing spectacular.

I also got it for 50% off in a Steam sale, so I won't make any comment of ""value"" here either. What I do want to talk about is, despite all the controversy and the bugs, this is a genuinely entertaining game. From the weapons, to the characters, to the story... This world feels vibrant and immersive. I spent a lot of time just driving around with the radio on enjoying the views and the absolutely awesome soundtrack. Genuinely, the OST is just perfection - whether it's just the radio tracks, or the atmospheric bits that kick in at certain story moments.... sheeeeesh. Combat is FUN. I don't play a lot of FPS/shooty games but god it feels great wielding any weapon in this game. At times, you do feel a little too OP, especially once you get further in the game - a certain ending boss was wayyy easier than I imagined, which kind of sucked because he was hyped up as this near-invincible guy :/ But tbh I play Warframe so feeling OP isn't unfamiliar to me. But that's also the problem with this game. You start to fall in love with the characters, how they've been written and voice-acted, and then once you've completed their side quest, it's over. Both the main storyline and the sidequests/gigs are over too soon. They throw all these wonderful characters and locations in and use them all so briefly, it's such a shame. Once you've 100%'d it, there's not much else to do other than doing another run or modding the heck out of it for Photo Mode. So, do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. Especially when on sale. I've been thinking how best to explain how much I love this game and the only thing I can think of to sum up CP2077 is ""neon joyride"" - enjoy it while it lasts, then hop on again for round 2."

This is essentially a crap version of GTA. Everything just feels so superficial. Can't sit on seats or order a drink or engage in any activities outside of quests. No car customisation or apartment customisation options. The only way to interact with the game is through the superficial quests. As a result the game lacks depth, crap customisation options and poor immersion. I don't know if they can fix all this in the dlc's. I'll check back on the game in like 2 years or so ... maybe that's enough time but not getting my hopes up again."

You meet someone, then someone else calling you, then u meet another person, everyone keep talking at you stuff you don't even understand. You need to do this and then you need to do that and it feels like it's not even connected or giving any sense. Maybe it's because i played only for 2 hours, but still. I just simply missing the ""wow"" moment.Enough chit chat, here are my reasons!- Gunplay is hard and not fun because the game is not smooth (feels like 0.2 second delay on mouse input)- My pc is not that trashy but sometimes it drops almost below 60 fps- Feels like you don't have much options > just go how the game wants you to go (but yeah, 2 hours)- Problems that people have in this world feels so edgy and childish (you got problem? let's kill each other)- I was yawning, not wowing- I don't like reading books but this game thinks that i do- Where is the freedom and options? Do i need to play like 5 hours to finally enjoy the game?Oh man, it seems that i am kinda mad... I am not, i am just feeling sorry for myself that i ate the hype again...My opinion, if you are enjoying the game, don't even think of giving a single f*ck about this review."

Overhyped games tend to kill my vibe (TLOU2 for example and I waited for that for 8 years, the same amount of time people have been waiting for this) but that's besides the point. Time to edit the review since I ended up finishing the game and pouring 60+ hours of gametime into it. Let me just be clear and say the overhype that this game received was 100% not worth it at all. It's a really good game, yes but was it worth it to send death threats to the developers due to it being delayed 3 times? Most definitely not. The story, the graphics, the way the characters were written and the photo mode are the highlights of the game for me. The city itself looks beautiful that's for sure and it's pleasant for the eyes (especially when you have a high end PC and running everything on RT Ultra) but the things that of course let me down were the bugs and the glitches. Not to mention on top of that, the lies and misleading promises from CDPR about the content which was initially going to be in the game pretty much not ending up in there at all. The customisation is bland. You can only use the character customisation ONCE throughout your ENTIRE playthrough and that's right at the very beginning when you choose your life path, that's it. What happened to the wall-running that was being spoken about and the way you could alter the way your character looks throughout the game and not to forget the vehicle customisation which was teased when spoken about? None of this was added in the game at all. I wanted to see plastic surgeons, barber shops and even tattoo parlours so I can change how my character looks yet I wasn't able to apart from changing clothes from my inventory. The combat is okay, not the best I've seen and not the worst. It's alright for me but the thing that bugs me the most is how I can't use guns when in cars or riding bikes. I can't even use gun poses when I'm on a bike during photo mode, in fact, I can't even use ANY poses when I'm on a bike AT ALL during photo mode. I'm kinda glad I didn't buy into all the hype and insanity people across the globe put into the game because if I did I would have been left with a sour taste in my mouth but negatives to the side my overall experience with the game was a good one, not the best. This isn't GOTY material and it certainly isn't a gods creation as how many hardcore fans perceived the game to be. It was a fun, enjoyable game but with bugs and glitches which definitely need patching. I simply cannot recommend the game to anyone yet until it's in a decent, playable state. Once everything is patched I'll end up changing my review to a positive one since Steam doesn't have a ''Neutral'' button."

As well as the Steam reviews of people with a handful of hours praising it to be one of the best games of all time.Suffers with massive performance issues. Graphics were clearly downgraded and are on par with the console versions, even at ultra. Yet you will struggle to maintain 40FPS on medium, even with higher end cards.Vegetation is terribly done. Grass and small plants are static. Small trees and bushes are made entirely of light, and pass through Geralt with ease.Game has many bugs and AI issues too.It's clear not much effort was put into the game performance and visual-wise. Lack of optimisation makes the game far from worth the $60 asking price.Developers lied about exploration too. Remember when they said ""If you see it, you can go there""? Well... You can't. ""No invisible walls"" ring a bell? False too. Whilst they're not invisible walls, if you stray too far from the enclosed map, you get a warning that you've ""reach the world's end"" and must ""turn back"". If you fail to turn back, the map opens up and you must fast travel somewhere.Do not trust CDPR. People always went on about Valve being for the gamer, and yet they aren't. The case is the same with CDPR.Finally, to put things into perspective:My rig:r5 3600GTX 1080ti 16 gigs of RAM, and all the rest.I get 40 FPS at most with plenty of drops running on medium at 1440p. The game looks like something from 2013.Disgusting."

I did a fair amount of side quests before progressing to the main story and I finished the game at 60 hour mark. I still have tons of side quests remaining, if I did them all then the game is probably 100-150 hours long, but the main story itself can be ""rushed"" in about 15-20 hours. Doing it in 60 hours didn't feel like a grind and it was pretty intertwined - doing side quests opens up opportunities for completely different endings and I'm not talking about Witcher 3 levels where you simply get more help in your final battle doing side quests, but I'm talking completely different scenarios playing out depending on which side quests you have completed. I think it is worth mentioning that according to Steam stats, 70% players never even found Ciri in Witcher 3, so 70% of the players never finished the main story. I think the number for that will be much higher for Cyberpunk.• Gameplay+I'm really loving the gameplay, it's probably my favourite part of the game. All different guns feel unique, weapon animations are done extremely well and cyberwares add another layer to the gameplay. I definitely prefer guns + Projectile Launcher cyberware combo but I also have fun running around and chopping up enemies with Mantis Blades too. Gun mods exist and they're pretty fun to play around with too. Whether it is to add different scopes or adding a silencer in a gun to increase its headshot damage from stealth, it's fun to mod guns differently according to different play style.• Driving-I find driving in the game very annoying, specially with cars. If you're driving freely out in badlands, I believe there are no issues, but when you're driving in the city or following the map GPS, that's when issues start to pop up. This makes me believe it's not the actual driving that's the culprit here but something else - one specific thing I could note was that the minimap is too zoomed in so if you're following the GPS, you're not able to slow down or plan a turn before it's too late which leads you to either crash or take a very sharp turn using handbrakes. Sadly due to this reason I almost never drive cars in the game, I only use the Yaiba Kusanagi bike which can get through traffic really easily and also turns sharp corners very quickly causing me very few troubles.-The first person camera in car is absolutely horrid. I can't see a damn thing and am pretty much forced to use 3rd person which sucks because I would love to look at the cool interiors of the car while driving.+Bikes drive very differently from cars and are much better. You're pretty much forced to use bikes if you wanna avoid headache that comes with cars.• Open-world-Believe it or not, in terms of open world design Cyberpunk is a step back from The Witcher 3. I'm not talking about the design of Night City but rather how quests, stories and activities are laid out in Night City. In The Witcher 3, you could at times even complete quests before ever accepting them from the quest giver. If you decided you just wanna explore, you could find certain characters who you're supposed to find in particular quests. Later when you talk to the quest giver, they respond accordingly and thank you for finding or helping the characters earlier. This is amazing, this type of open world design is unbeatable. In comparison, Cyberpunk features rather linear quests in it's open-world, in a way similar to Rockstar does with it's games. Cyberpunk and games from Rockstar follow the same pattern: Quest giver -> Task -> Task CompleteWhile in Witcher 3 you can go from:Task -> Task Complete -> Quest giveror even:Task -> Task failed -> Quest giver -> Different outcome• Open-world map+Now, lets talk about Night City itself. Right off the bat I'll say that the design of Night City itself is the most impressive game world map you'll ever see. Nothing else comes even close to what CDPR has done with Night City. The layers of exploration in buildings is insane to the point you'll probably have to rely on your memory rather than the map while exploring buildings. My friend has 50 hours in the game and he was surprised when I showed him a portion of V's building he hadn't seen before. This is the very building at the start of the game and 50 hours in he still missed a good chunk of its backside.-The game offers very few incentives to actually go through this type of exploration. As I said earlier, the quests in the game are quite linear so while exploring is fun by itself, the rewards for doing it are very few.-Though Night City itself is impressive and unmatched, it kinda falls flat on street level due to very basic AI of NPCs and the minimum attention to detail that is given to these NPCs. They say a very generic answer if you try to them, don't respond naturally, do weird things at times and just feel out of place. They're background noise during your gameplay which makes Night City on street level feel very dead.• Character+A huge plus for the game is the cast of its characters. They feel authentic and respond in a very human level. Some characters like Judy show very human emotions and it's a treat to watch. These are the types of character whose quests you would wanna do before progressing the main story. And after you've done their quests, you'll miss these characters and their stories. That's a testament to how well written these characters are.• ReplayabilityGame definitely has some level of replayability. I can already see certain scenes going differently depending on my lifepath but apart from that there's also different choices and consequences. How deep these go remains to be seen, I'll probably need to spend another 100 hours in the game before I can answer that truthfully.• Performancei7 4770, 8GB ddr3 RAM. GTX 1070Running the game at medium-high, 1080p at 50-60 fps.It's not terrible but could be better with optimizations• Bugs and glitchesThroughout my 70+ hour playthrough my game didn't crash to desktop even once. The glitches experienced during gameplay were funny rather than being annoying. Maybe I've just been lucky, but personally I didn't face any bugs or glitches which ruined my gaming experience. At most I just laughed looking at a glitch and moved on with my game the very next second.• ConclusionSpending 70+ hours with this game only made me feel hungry for more. Game needs fixes like the dumb AI and what not, but I find myself wanting to spend more and more time in Night City."

I only found this game during the 2021 Fall Sale, so my expectations weren't set all that high. I watched several YT Vids, and looked at a few reviews that didn't sound like some self-entitled individual.I looked at the forum, and found many of those self-entitled there too, wrecking any positive feedback from those that just simply enjoy the game. So I took my leave from that toxic place, and read some more objective reviews However, watching the YT Vids was really the clincher for me. I saw this lady that showed off each starting scenario up to, and including the Training Tutorial. I was sold on the game right there.So I bought it, and did those early game missions as she did to see just how everything worked. I was not disappointed. Remembering some quick key commands to do this or that, was my only challenge. Driving was a challenge too, but that can be fixed by one of 3 Mods I saw on the Nexus that doesn't make driving so sensitive, as if you were driving on ice.. I think the hardest decision in this game is figuring out where you want to start. A Nomad, a Street Kid, or a Corpo. Then what path you want to follow. A Stealthy Hacker or Assassin. A Mercenary, with guns blazing, or a Tank, to bulldoze your way around. Maybe a little bit of everything?The Graphics, Soundtracks & Sound Effects, are far better than I expected. Character Creation, is extremely diverse, and Voice-overs are spot on. Plenty of missions, and story to follow. It's been a while since I found a game that gripped me like this. Mass Effect 1, 2 & 3 were the last games that had this kind of effect on me.As for us shutterbugs... I think the Photo Mode the game offers will give NVidia's ANSEL, a run for the money. There's countless expressions, poses, and views to make you just snap that shutter everywhere., Give it a try for a couple of hours, and see if you like it. If not, well you know what to do.𝓐𝓼 𝓐𝓵𝔀𝓪𝔂𝓼,𝓚𝓮𝓮𝓹 𝓞𝓷 𝓖𝓪𝓶𝓲𝓷𝓰! 🐱👍"

Reason why it took me long was because I was doing side quests and I listened through all the dialogue of the main storyline. By last night at approximately 3:30 am, I finished the game with 117.7 hours. I kind of finished all the gigs and side quests, but some were still left out. I finished Judy's, Panam's, and River's storyline as well. I only did one quest for Kerry's storyline, but will go back to finish it today. I would say that a person can finish the main storyline without any sidequests, gigs, and romance's storyline(s) in about 45-50 hours. I still enjoyed this game a lot even with the few minor bugs that I encountered. I played this game on high settings with the average 60-69 fps. The graphics were beautiful. The storyline was intriguing and having Keanu Reeves butt in to comment stupid ♥♥♥♥ sometimes has made my experience in the game more enjoyable. For combat play, I love the aspect of quickhacking. I didn't have the full build for quickhacking yet, but it was still fun to kill enemies from afar with the Short Circuit and Synapse Burnout ability. I heard that the Ninja (melee) build is quite fun too so I will do that in my next playthrough. I focused more on handguns and assault rifles throughout the entire game and it's quite satisfying to get headshots on the enemies with almost one hit. If there was anything I would change in this game, it would be to pick the personality of my V. I feel that this game would be more complex and people would enjoy to make certain decisions if their character's head wasn't coming out of their ass at times or just plain sympathetic or nice. The hype for this game was real and it was very unfortunate that it was delayed because of the pandemic. Besides this point, this game has lived up to it's expectations. I recommend this game and I applaud CD Projekt Red for a job well done. 10/10"

At the current state it is disappointing to see a company like CDPR falling short in so many things not just the game.  It was never going to meet the lofty standards and hype people put on it but still it is sad to see it be riddled with bugs and glitches and an overall incomplete state.  I wait for the time when it shapes up to be the game the Devs wanted it to be.Is it fun? Absolutely. Even with the problems and glitches it was incredibly fun. Whether it is bashing enemies' heads open with a Dildo or making them fight each other while they cough to death or just good old fashioned shooting , there are a lot of ways to rain misery upon your enemies and a skill tree for refining each style . There are tons of tiny little things to find across the world that made me smile throughout the journey and made me realise how much love went into these little things. Small stories ,texts , props, enemies trying to patch things up with their girlfriends, the list goes on.STORY was the thing that I loved the most. It was short,sweet and impactful . I wish it was a bit longer giving and bit more flushed out background and important role to things like Militech (They freaking defeated Arasaka in one of the Corpo-wars and now they account to so little to the things happening to our story)  It felt like lot things were scrapped out of the game to fit within the schedule.Graphics and Soundtrack are incredible , The Night City is beautiful and when you take the time to pause and look and listen around the neon lit city, there is so much to love and take in. RPG, while it isn't anything groundbreaking, it  is something that was fun until I realised that there is a bug that can corrupt my saves if it goes over 8mb (My saves are still at around 5.9mb with everything completed) ,that is a shame as I was collecting every single thing I found around and scrapped stuff to craft new weapons or just for the heck of it . This needs to be fixed, there is no excuse for it to be a thing , this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RPG (This has been fixed as of update 1.06)If you were overhyped by all the media articles, trailers you may get disappointed at what you get but if you are like me and tempered your expectations there is a fantastic game underneath the glitches and bugs, And while bashing CDPR is the cool new thing to do for some , I definitely have faith in their ability to come back from this make this the game that was promised."

Also ray tracing enabled has a heavy toll on performance even with high end PC, so it needs a bit of tweaking stillSo in my book i would give it 8/10  Pros. : Story is amazing you will feel attached to the characters very wellYou won't feel you are wasting your time doing side activities or exploring in general as it doesn't has that repetitive feel at all.Free to do any part of the game your way your play style so it is near the definition of true sand box.Cons. : Not able to switch between First person to Third person view (I want to see how my character looks like after i got him new outfit).Controls Needs to be more customizable.Ray Tracing needs tweaking (not sure if its nVidia or CDPR fault on this.)"

Fails to deliver.After several delays it still is released with a plethora of bugs that even the day 0 patch did not address.Poorly optimized and just overall poor performance with huge demands for what it delivers in terms of graphics. Sound gets cut out. Dialogues overlap.  Falling under the map bugs. Getting launched in the sky bugs that lead to your death and potential progress loss/mission failure. Skipping lines leads to weapons disappearing from your hands, items held being doubled (chopsticks for example), lines being skipped or just terminated early.The world (NPCs) is dull, similar to a ghost town. Outside of missions/gigs you have nothing to do really. You cannot interact with pedestrians, scare them off, piss them off to start a brawl fight, recruit them, flirt with them - you can't do anything really. They are just there to populate the word, to occupy the space and to give you an impression of a bustling city life.Poor customization. There was absolutely no need for the genitalia customization while you only have a couple of hair styles to choose from, eye color, facial structure. Fallout 4 has a way better character customization option in comparison.Graphical glitches, artifacts, low textures, bad meshes, etc. - very noticeable throughout the game. Outside of the main questline the game is pretty boring, forgettable.I like Keanu as a person. Do not like him a lot as an actor. Definitely do not want well known actors in my games and strongly disliked seeing how big a role he has in this one.Would have liked to see more settings too: Ability to disable the loot display on the HUD that takes minutes to clear up after looting a bigger area. Cannot remap the M key for the map. Cannot sell multiple items fast. Cannot lock items to not mistakenly sell them. Can't mark as junk to then sell all junk at a shop or dismantle. Car control is way too sensitive. (depends a bit on the car you're driving)Not a lot of variation in cyberware you can buy. 2-3 options on average for each part and that's it. Not that many different approaches. And your origin hardly makes a difference. Sure it grants some different dialogue options that are pretty much not important. You either go guns blazing or try the stealth approach - that's it. Sometimes you get to decide if someone lives or dies.Comparing this to the witcher 3 is honestly insulting the witcher 3. Way better in all regards.The only really nice thing I liked so far in Cyberpunk is the"

First I was angry about the publisher. Changing the release time again and again. Then I thought why not, that only will make the game better. So I kept the Pro Order and hoped for the best.And then on the first day I started to play. And it was great. I was lucky, I did not encounter all the bugs many had. Also, I was lucky to play it on PC and not on the Consoles. But then later I had a bug after bug and only by exchanging save games I could finish all achievements. But here already stopped the negative part about this amazing game. This game is the first game I just enjoyed driving to the next Quest, the next location. I never even sipped the automatic drives. The music is amazing, the characters are great and even playing parts (especially the endings) again and again was ok.  I like to collect all and it never went boring. Every small side quest was special and interesting.I have nothing more to play for the moment, but if the deals will be as good as the game so far I will for sure will play all of them, even that I normally hate to come back after half a year. But this time I am sure I will come back and try to finish all 100% again. So I can only say, get the game, try it out, do not look too much on some bugs and enjoy this totally different world. Just drive threw the desert and enjoy the lights during the night."

Even though I purchased at launch and started playing in December but like many others hit a myriad of issues I decided to unhappily wait until I thought it would be more ready. That time was recently and I am again just massively disappointed. Disappointed in the lack of open world things to do, it's complete lack of RPG elements, the bugs are still very apparent so god only knows how bad it was at launch. The weapons are all pretty basic and boring, it's far too easy a game with everything dropping for you as you make your way through the story. I can't seem to hold a steady 60fps in 4k with Raytracing and DLSS on Auto with my 3080, the police are hilarious, the npc's have no AI what so ever, the driving is terrible, the list goes on and on. The game is so far from what was promised I feel completely let down for my money. I won't be making the same mistake again with CDPR. I do not recommend. (unfortunately)"

Granted I only have 10 hours of playtime so far, but I still definitely feel like that's been enough time to gather some criticism. I have already been drawn into this beautiful world. If you haven't got it yet however, just wait a while until/if they release the full game because let's be honest here, the game is not done. The art is gorgeous, the music is amazing, I am somewhat attached to my V and the world is incredibly beautiful. It has many small little details that are fun to explore. The character creation was lackluster, and once you've made it you won't be able to change it later. Unless they patch that in at a later date. At the moment it feels like a mix between GTA and Mass Effect with some Witcher dialogue, and all of those games are better at what they do.The AI is a joke to be completely honest. Kill someone with no witness in an apartment two storeys up, and have cops spawn right outside. Walk next to a cop, minding your own business, and start a fight with 'em. Save some NPC in a quest, there is NO reaction from said NPC whatsoever except it just keeps cowering on the ground. The game feels alive in the way that it feels like it will keep going despite you. But it also feels quite stale. The NPCs were said to have their own routines and if that means they spawn out of nowhere, and tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off if you speak to them, then yeah sure they have their own routines and dialogue.Who thought it was a good idea to make you a loot machine? Wherever you go you're gonna be looking at the ground for the million pieces of junk you have to get to craft, to get a gun that is ever so slightly better than the last. If you like that sorta gameplay then you'll have a blast with Cyberpunk 2077.Maybe I'm playing the game wrong but it feels like the enemies are bullet sponges, fun combat does not equal wasting all of your bullets on one big enemy. In general it's fun to play at this point, but it really does feel lackluster in many ways. It's clear they have many things they decided to cut only to bring back later in a ""free DLC"". You'll probably get the best experience by having patience and waiting a couple months. The game has so much potential to be absolutely amazing, like CDPR's previous franchise."

I have finished the game, tried 5 endings and I cried in 4 of them, I pretty much only liked one (), but I still want to play more and more and wish to see DLCs that continue the story.I gotta say, this game was terrific, amazing, stunning, from the beginning till the end. I barely ran into any major issues (got only a major bug but whatever). The soundtrack, the characters, the main and side quests, the story, the world-building, everything is stunning.A lot of characters won my heart: JUDY, Brendan, Evelynn, Jackie, Misty, Panam, Cassidy (he's a cool man), Rogue, Johnny (yeah, he's a jackass but in the end, he's a good guy), my list could go on - each character was iconic on their own. Judy has a special place, I kinda made her my comfort character for several reasons (being lesbian and having a crush on a girl when she was younger was two of them).I gotta advise, all choices in the game matter, and they affect both big and small details in the story.The soundtrack? Gods, the soundtrack was amazing, doesn't matter the music gender, I felt engaged with most of them.Thank you CDPR, for this fantastic masterpiece.I haven't felt this way in years. I have no regrets about pre-ordering it as soon as it was available to do so."

I truly feel bad for all of the employees there that had to go through the crunch death march to release a game that they knew wasn't ready.Maybe eventually this becomes an unconditionally great game if they continue to improve it, but we'll just have to wait and see.

I'll start with the positives:- A fairly varied skill tree, a lot of it is just some modifiers or numbers going up but it offers various ways to play the game such as melee focused, hacking, shooting focused, stealth etc.- A very beautiful looking city in many areas (If you're lucky enough to run this game on a stable frame rate). Areas of the city have different styles to them and are nice to drive around and look at. - Quest design offers a few ways to resolve quests and offers a fair degree of player choice compared to other RPGS, however it seems lax when compared to Witcher 3 or Fallout New Vegas- The Main story and Voice acting is pretty good so far and is keeping me fairly immersed. (This is subjective but I may as well mention it) - A really good Soundtrack with various genres of music.- A good enough character creator which offers a fair few options to customise your character. Could use a bit more options in some places but its good enough for a game that primarily has the player in first person.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Very Buggy, and I mean  buggy. It's hard to play for more than five minutes without seeing some kind of visual, audio or physics bug. I've only had two game breaking bugs where I was forced to restart the entire game but I feel like I've been lucky in not getting the worst of it.- Poor optimisation, I have a RTX 2080 TI, 16gb of Ram and a fairly good CPU and I manage to have 55-60 FPS with RTX off and settings on max (This is with DLSS on quality setting) but I feel like it stutters where it shouldn't and there is still massive amounts of texture pop in on vehicles and some NPCs. Apparently other players who meet or exceed the recommended specs can barely manage a stable 30+ on Medium which doesn't seem acceptable at all.- Awful AI, and this is a very distracting issue for me. The AI in this game is something you'd see from 2001 or even earlier, NPCs on the street barely react to anything around them and seem to just idly walk down the street or pound on a vending machine. You can punch people in the face and they'll stand there and let you punch them or if you're lucky they'll actually try and run away. I've also noticed as soon as an ""aggro'd"" civilian NPC leaves your vision they'll immediately despawn, meaning whole streets will disappear if you fire your gun and turn your back.NPCs driving cars follow a strict rule of simply driving forward on their preset path, if you park your car in the middle of the road cars will just stop behind it honk their horn once and wait there forever, they'll never try and drive around any obstacle. The fact this AI is so minimal and shallow means the city feels dead and hollow as its essentially a bunch of poorly scripted AIs with absolutely no impact to the environment around them. It seems odd that a high budget game in 2020 has worse AI than GTA San Andreas, I don't know if it'll be expanded upon in patches or expansions but I sincerely hope it is.- The NCPD. This ties into AI but I feel like it needs its own point. The police in this game are a complete joke, either being a non threat or completely over powered. If you commit a crime you'll gain a wanted star and within about 2-5 seconds a NCPD Officer will be spawned behind you and I mean literally about 2 meters behind you, doesn't matter where you are if there's a space for them they'll spawn there.At first I thought it was it a bug as it was so jarring I couldn't accept that it was intended, but after playing for 20+ hours I can see it was fully intended. This is because there are no car chases in this game, absolute none outside of the scripted story ones. There is no AI that chases you in a vehicle, it just straight up isn't there. If you manage to just drive for about 10 seconds away from where you gained the wanted star it'll just disappear because you managed to escape the cops they spawned in behind you and there's no AI capable of giving chase, meaning they HAVE to be spawned behind you.On the Flip side if you don't manage to escape there'll most likely be about 5-10 augmented cops spawned behind you who'll quickly overwhelm you, if you're very unlucky you'll commit a crime beside a NCPD rocket turret which will very quickly instantly kill you, especially if you're in a vehicle.- Stilted Combat, this is kind of a ""meh"" point for me but it definitely needs some improvement. The gun play and melee feel more like you're shooting or hitting brick houses rather than people. There's not much reaction from the NPCs you shoot or hit, I know most are augmented super humans but at the minute its very unsatisfying to fight people and I sincerely hope its improved in the future. (Another subjective point but I feel like it needs mentioned)There's also close to no feedback you're getting hurt, eventually you'll be on 20 HP and your screen goes red but there seems to be no feedback or sound design of your character getting shot, meaning you'll quickly get shot to death if you're not closely watching your health.- Beautiful city unfortunately lacking depth. So I previously mentioned that I enjoy the styling of many areas of the city and a lot of it looks beautiful, but that's unfortunately where it ends. Aside from driving around doing some random missions or finding a set gang shootout the city feels like it lacks depth. There's barely any interiors to buildings and not a lot to actually do in Night City which is very unfortunate. This isn't helped by the extremely basic AI I talked about above.I recall Witcher 3 didn't have reams of things to do in it's cities but Cyberpunk 2077 desperately needs something more to do in Night City. There's no patrolling gangs or cops that start fights in the streets (They only spawn in specific areas around the city),  there doesn't seem to be any random encounters that can happen to you when walking around the streets (as far as I know), and I don't even think there's any activities or things you can do on your downtime. I only found myself wanting to walk around the city to take screenshots rather than do anything worthwhile.- No level scaling, or seemingly no level scaling. Areas seem to be set to specific level ranges, meaning you might accidentally wander into an area where enemies will kill you in one shot or you'll have to fight a whole bunch of bullet sponges, which becomes fairly tiring pretty fast. This can lead to you being stuck to one area for a while grinding out levels.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was very disappointed by what I saw in Cyberpunk 2077, especially after all the crunch time the devs had to endure. There's a lot of bugs which I can tell they knew about but just had to leave in for the release to fix later and there's a lot of seeming bad management or game design choices. I have no doubt CD Projekt will patch this game to be great and more enjoyable, but until then unfortunately Cyberpunk 2077 is not worth your time or money. I look forward to giving a more positive review in the future."

Its story, Night City, and the nihilism contained within its streets are ugly beautiful. Without bugs, it would be a solid 8.5/10. With its bugs it's a 8/10 for anyone with a good rig (and likely 6 or 7 for those without). That said, I hope history is kind to this game because what it's saying is poignant as well as well-written, the concept of engrams and what it means to be alive is fascinating, and the characters of Silverhand and V are interesting juxtapositions. It has flaws, it has bugs, but it's one of the better open world games in the past decade--especially if you like world building, if you like good characters.One caveat: play the game thoroughly. Don't rush to the end, or save side quests until after the end. You can beat it fairly quick, but it won't have much meaning if you do. Much of the meaning of the game are in the side quests and even side gigs. Yeah, sure the side gigs can be a bit cut and paste (a lot of them are simply variations on fetch or escort quests), but it's so cool seeing inside these buildings and really getting to know Night City as well as its denizens.  Plus it's interesting to some degree the variation of characters; some people you save are wretched, some are opportunistic, some are tiring. Even the Cyber Psychosis quests take a long time, but their stories are sympathetic and it's interesting (I still remember the reality TV sister one). You'll feel like you really tried to make it in Night City, you'll feel like the city really chewed you up and spit you out, and you'll feel a lot more emotion during the various ending paths of the game.It's important to note that while the bad list is long, they're actually so minor compared to the benefits. Basically what it offers is stronger than the weaknesses. I just want to be thorough about how it's far from perfect."

There's a good experience buried in there somewhere, but it's hard to look past all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you have to put up with in order to get to the good stuff.First off, I've tagged it as a Yes recommendation because I still think it's worth playing even if my final opinion on it wasn't particularly good. There's so much that Cyberpunk 2077 does so damn right: the city's design and realization is absolutely spot-on, the writing is impeccable as we've come to expect from CDPR, and the score couldn't be more precisely put together. Any game which can flawlessly pull off moving between hard pumping synths, head banging punk metal, and a solo piano rendition of 'Round Midnight has done something incredible in my books.But despite the utterly phenomenal artistic accomplishments that CDPR have managed to cram into the game, I think somewhere along in development they forgot that they're a game company, not a film studio. The RPG elements seemed promising at first, but they're ultimately pretty shallow, and most unforgivably they're just overshadowed by the fact that they've made your mechanical interaction with the game that of a first person shooter. Why would I bother with any skill tree development that boosts my damage output by 6% after 5 levels when I can pump it all into headshots and get 300% damage boosts because I can actually aim? Hacking is a poorly disguised reskin of the magic systems of fantasy games, except instead of mana they call it RAM. Fistfights are an utter slog. The economy is a total joke, market manipulation through soda almost mandatory. We're not even going to discuss the bugs. To sum up, I couldn't help but be reminded that I was playing a video game at every turn.""Immersion"" is a term thrown about with reckless abandon by people nowadays, often without understanding what it really means. It's not as simple as writing good characters that the player can enjoy interacting with, or creating a gorgeous world that players love walking around in. If I can't talk to those characters in ways I consider obvious or necessary, I'm not going to feel immersed. If I can't navigate that world in an intuitive and unobtrusive fashion, I'm not going to feel immersed. At its core, immersion is about the systems through which the player engages, not the ""content"" that the player's supposed to engage with. And to hammer home my point, just look at how much engagement people can have playing stuff like Minecraft or Gmod, often in environments with next to no ""content"" ready to go! All you need are to provide tools the player can understand and utilize, and to put as few roadblocks between them and the virtual world as possible.It's a chore driving through Night City. The cars don't drive like cars, they bounce and screech around like go karts. The AI swerves through turns like they're intentionally making your journey as difficult as possible. Fast travel has made studios lazy when it comes to designing locomotion, because they now expect you to just skip through it all.It's a chore to work through the interfaces. It's like they knew they were building it for mouse and keyboard so they didn't attempt to make the fifteen thousand different contextual menus easily accessible for the player, or to implement something as simple as allowing you to craft multiples of the same item.It's a chore to talk to the NPCs. Don't get me wrong, the writing itself is usually pretty damn good, but that doesn't matter for ♥♥♥♥ when actually working through the conversation interface forces you to stop and stare at them like a lost puppy and move your hands and fingers off their usual positions to hit the other seventeen buttons that are dedicated to the conversation interface.Almost all three of these are examples of times when less is clearly more. Skyrim and Witcher don't suffer from issues with locomotion because they didn't overcomplicate their navigation methods: you're either on foot or you're on a horse and that's it. Locking you in place during conversations actually makes things significantly easier since you have less choice to overwhelm you, allowing you to focus on just enjoying the dialogue.Cyberpunk 2077 is not a good Game.But Cyberpunk 2077  a really damn good Movie.It's always easier to run your mouth about the things you didn't like about something, so my positives will be significantly shorter and sweeter, but I do want to emphasize how truly excellent these artistic aspects of the game were. It's hard to quantify the number of times I just strolled through Night City, taking in the entirety of the city, the grime, the vertical expansion, the way the skyscrapers block off sunlight from population centers like we're back in Kowloon Walled City. It's hard to describe the genuine engagement I had when the characters lament the pieces of humanity either they or the world around have lost, filtered through their own experience. (Looking at you, Kerry. I'm incensed by the Pon Pon ♥♥♥♥♥ of the real world, too.) It's hard to say just how often I'd stop to see a little piece of that virtual world unfold and say to myself, ""Yep. That's exactly right. That's the truth right there."" It's hard to really laugh at those NiCola ads with its scantily clad mascot when we're that close to having the same exact ♥♥♥♥ already.I wish the people who made games like these wouldn't make them as games. Their hearts clearly aren't in it for the ""game"" of it. But they would make fantastic, insightful films or books."

I wish steam had a third choice beside the ""yes"" or ""no"" choices. The game is actually pretty good, I just have three questions I would ask the Devs and whoever is thinking of buying this:1 - Is Quality Control (bugs, functionality) and Optimization of a game important to you? Because if you enjoy lots of minor bugs, one or two mission breaking bugs and the game chugging along with pretty bad performance, this game is ""Fantastic""! 2 - A game with such serious undertones and I still need to put 15 rounds into a guys head for him to die, who thought it was a good idea to make everyone and their Cyber Mom into a big fat bullet sponge? In terms of ""bullet spongyness"" this game makes ""The Division"" look like a Hard Core 3rd party Arma 3 Mod. No matter how good and tight the gun handling, sounds and ADS are, it is all for nothing when you feel like you are using an airsoft toy. 3 - Dialogue options are regrettably poor and most of what the character does is on the rails. Why even put these dialogues options there if you make us select each one and go through the motions regardless of choice? I was not expecting Mass Effect/Fallout/Elder Scrolls character freedom in this game, but I was surprised how shallow it was. So All in all, do you need to play this game RIGHT NOW? Because it is a fantastic game, with many awesome aspects, even with a few seriously questionable design choices, although much of that is subjective and relative to your tates. It is also a game with many technical issues that should not be there with such a long development cycle. I would wait until the technical difficulties are ironed out and hopefully some mods come out, before purchasing it. Buyer beware. P.S. *Update* -The latest Nvidia driver made DLSS make a world of difference. it is somewhat running now and GPU usage shot-up dramatically. So I guess there is hope.If you want to know more, just watch this:"

Yes there are some minor bugs but I have yet to come across anything game-breaking to the point that made me not want to play anymore. Most of the issues they are complaining about from what I've heard people are having are for consoles (which lets face it if you're reading this you are part of the PC master race and consoles will never be as good as a high end gaming pc).  The story really sucks you in and even though it can almost seem a little overwhelming  at first you never have to stop and wonder what you are going to do like in the GTA series or other open worlds. You constantly have a list of different missions you can do and work on outside of the main story. The graphics even without going 4k are absolutely amazing and realistic. Highly recommend playing it (just make sure you got your drivers up to date as some people have game issues if there graphics drivers are not up to date)"

I really enjoyed what I saw. From the beginning you start to build your own story, defining your background and making a few minor and important choices that will shape your character. Customization is also great: the game allows you to personalize even the smallest details of your body, even those ones you rarely touch in any other games (who played already this game knows what I'm talking about, hehe). Immersion in this futuristic environment is absolutely gorgeous! Everything is so well polished and alive, letting you feel a part of what the world really is in Cyberpunk 2077. A few tutorials and concentration are recommended to learn the basics, but nothing so complicated or boring. You will master all the techniques in no time.Minor bugs are still in the game, but nothing game-breaking. I don't think we still reached the best optimization this game could get. with everything enabled at max settings (RTX ON), with my specs (listed above or in my profile for full specs) I reached 30/40 fps. The most concerning thing, is when I disable the Ray Tracing, since I start to get only 70/80 FPS, and I say concerning because I was expecting something a bit better.. but I'm not complaining, since I know it could run much worse than this. However, if you play this in a ""smart way"" setting everything enabled, no ray tracing and reduced post processing stuff (which I reduce everytime because I just hate those effects), you are guaranteed to reach 100/120fps and even more in certain situations, which makes the game really smooth and that's how the game should run.If you're just scared to buy the game because it just launched and it could be broken, relax. As I said, game is totally playable and enjoyable, so go grab it, and reach Night City to start your adventure ASAP! <3"

Everything in this game is created to exist for you, but the characters and story are written well so that it feels organic. Both the main story and the side missions offer a lot of different experiences along the way to become Night City's legend. There's a heist, comradery, love interests, belonging to a clan, sympathizing with hookers and obviously seeing Johnny Silverhand party first hand. But the story doesn't stop there, it builds up this dream and illusion to crush it down, having endings and conclusions that are mature and not happily forever after fairytales.Playing the missions consists of scripted events that you go through mixed with cinematics. You are just an errand person. Combat can be approached with the classic range/melee weapons, stealth and hacking. None of them are too challenging and difficulty mainly comes from being stat checked, needing enough levels and stats to take down your enemy. The combat handling feels good enough, but you won't find the extra satisfaction you can find from playing games focused on combat and the enemies can feel like bullet sponges. Driving is the worst part as vehicles tend to lose control quite easily, especially the faster ones. The AI in general isn't very smart.It has some player customization, not on the detail level of some RPGs. You can customize your genitals that aren't shown in game and it seems like it's a feature to bring out a reaction from the player. There are 5 different attributes each with 3 or 2 perk sets and each containing around 20 perks to help you specialize your character. Weapons have special types like power, tech and smart, but they don't make a big difference to go out of your way to get them, selecting the dropped weapon with the highest DPS gets the job done. Only several cars and motorcycles are available for driving.Just like in Witcher 3, the story suffers from trying to be urgent and then leaving you in the open world where you can take months doing side content before returning to the main mission. But the conclusions of the endings have a stronger effect from the game being open world, it's definitely a strange mix.For the technical issues, I experienced some visual bugs that got fixed by updating the graphic drivers. Only one crash and one time where I had to restart the game due to scan not being available. Some silly bugs where the person you are talking to in a cinemtic slides, T-posing characters, answering the phone and V talking to 3 different people at the same time, dropping a carried body resulting in a big splash leaving a pool of blood.Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 has an engaging story that is fun to experience once, but I doubt the gameplay or open world will leave you wanting to come back for more. There are some bugs that can be fixed, but they aren't major to stop the game from running.For achievement hunters:There are some combat challenges, completing all the side content in all areas, collectibles, missables for using your attribute and perk points, choosing dialogues and the different endings can be reached by saving at the point of no return"

Visual ones could be ignored but ones that trap you inside the floor, or fail to register an NCPD incident has actually completed or not requires reloads to get past.> Tech weapons can punch through walls. Combine this with Ping and you can just scan a combat zone and pluck people off with ease, while they can't do anything back. Favouring tech weapons/hacking should modify the defences found in some missions so more enemies are hack resistant, or use tech weapons back more consistently. > Power weapons ricochet seemed far too unreliable early on to be worth using. Probably can counter that with character unlocks, but it would be better if ricochets were set to auto bounce back at a target using ""tech"" and the tech guns that punch through walls being listed as ""power"" weapons.> Some features are just entirely undocumented. Like the Caps Lock button will keep the hacking/scanning view open so you don't need to hold TAB. Was this ever mentioned in game? The few times I accidentally left it on I assumed it was a bug and reloaded a save, as it doesn't have any  onscreen mention of CAPS LOCK - TRACKING LOCK or something similar.> Driving on keyboard and mouse is a bit awful. Nothing really new there, a common issue with many games also designed for consoles.> Wildly inconsistent FPS. Could just be down to RTX, but any scene with a lot of NPCs in it, or in bars/clubs generally dropped to 10-15fps on an RTX 2070s @ 1440p with DLSS in performance mode. Otherwise it would be around 50-75fps.> Choosing your life path didn't seem to matter as much as I thought throughout the game, just  a smattering of custom responses in missions. Final notes:I very much enjoyed my time with 2077, but unless you're a massive fan, give it 6 months to iron out the bugs and performance wonkiness."

That's not a bad thing because in my playthrough at Patch 1.03 all the cyberware was such a buggy mess that it barely worked at all.The knives out of your arms do little to no damage compared to ranged weapons.The grenade launcher has the most glitched model of all time and no reload animation or cooldown. it just shoots?Tranquilizer ammo in the grenade launcher just doesnt work. it shoots and explodes just like a regular grenade. bye bye stealth abilities.the only thing that seems to work fine are the gorilla hands or arms whatever. they seems pretty cool but you either need an insane amount of armour or a lower difficulty to properly go into melee combat anyway.The cars are all horrible. They look amazing but drive worse than cars in GTA III. YOU CAN'T EVEN CHANGE THE COLOR OF CARS YOU BUY. You can farm money for like 10 hours to finally buy your favorite car and it has a fixed color and if you don't like it you better reload you savefile.Cops spawn right behind you if you do ""bad"" stuff but after running away like 50 meters or driving your car for 10 seconds they lose you immediately.Difficulty setting are weird. On the highest difficulty you can easily play ""stealth"" without spending a single skill-/perkpoint on stealth. But if you get into combat you better watch out because you are are two shot kill most of the time and sometimes a oneshot. But because the enemies ""AI"" is as smart as a toddler, you should be fine.In all Bossfights you can just walk away from them while shooting and if they get too close you just double tap either W,A,S or D to just dodge.They talked about the ""insane"" variety of characters all around night city. Well, if you go anywhere you will sure notice the pedestrians walking around from their spawnpoint to the other end of the sidewalk. They don't do anything but walk. Either they spawn in a chair and sit down forever, or they spawn walking around and then they walk around forever.By having the ability to randomly be able to give every pedestrian a different look, it is unbelieveable how you can sometimes see 3 characters with the exact same appearance (hair,face,clothes etc.) next to each other.Night City is the ""City of Dreams"" and there is absolutely nothing to do.The Game looks amazing, but for people without a 2000 or 3000 series Nvidia GPU that don't have DLSS, it's nearly impossible to get above 60FPS.Choices don't matter at all.If you watched all Night Wire Episodes on Cyberpunk's YouTube Account you will surely remember when they talked about ""Lifepaths"". They should rename it to ""Different Tutorial"", because all they do is change the first 15 Minutes of your story and give you a bunch of dialog options later in the story that like i said don't change the outcome of anything.Everything i just wrote has nothing to do with bugs and glitches. I don't care about them because they can (maybe will) be fixed in the next few weeks/months. The Game is lacking content to an extreme amount.It's emberassing that they even had the idea of releasing in april. If you look at the state of the game right now after a few hotfixes and see how bad it is, imagine the state of the game at the beginning of 2020. Who in their right mind would even think about releasing this in april.Big shoutout to the Map- and Model- designers. The Map looks amazing and the multi level town squares and markets feels like the city of the future. The Badlands are empty as they should be with a single gas station every once in a while.If you compare the 2018 gameplay trailer to the released game you will see that the look and feel of the map has improved a lot. It has become more realistic and colorful. All the grey concrete seems to have disappeared.The cars look insanely good on the in- and outside. the guns look just as amazing. characters (especially Misty) have the best models and textures i have seen in any game ever.If you want to play this game anyway and can't wait another 6 months until the bugs are gone here are some tipsJust play The Panam storyline and then just stop.Either way im super mad at CD Projekt. They always talk about how much they love games and how much they want to deliver the best experiences. This is just the exact opposite of what they always talk about.I surely will play this game again. It has a lot of potential to be amazing.But until then it gets a dislike from me.I'm outI will come back to review it againwhen the game is ready...."

It's time to write my thoughts. This game had amazing marketing tactics. Promised more, gave less. Those who are looking for true RPG game, this game is not for you. Some people are crying over it being faulty mess. I agree. It is faulty. But doesn't stop you from playing. Game doesn't crash as often as it does on consoles. In fact, it only crashed 2 times in my 40 hours of play time. I very rarely play a game this much. I have been playing 6-7 hours a day since I downloaded. Meanwhile GTA 5 crashes every 3 hours or so. Why did I mention GTA 5? Because some people think they can compare the whole game and say one is better than other overall. No, you braindead, only thing they share in common is driving vehicles and shooting and open world. One can be better than other only in open world aspects. Rest, depends on player choice. Nothing else. Core, gameplay are completely different. And there are those who compare Rockstar who has been making open world games for 20+ years to a company that recently released its 4th biggest game. You can see how stupid people can be. Ignore them. Night City is alive, full of things to do, and pulls you in more and more. Every street corner feels like perfect work done for designing the city. Gameplay, well, your choice. You are given many approaches. You can hack, stealth-kill, go berzerk (which is actually very very fun, feels like doom), or just avoid killing, sneak and pass objectives. Main storyline will not greatly satisfy you if you don't do sidejobs. And trust me, majority of these side quests have their own stories and correspond with main story. Soundtracks, sound effects of this game are very beautiful aswell. Graphics? Well you have the right for blaming CDPR for issues but if you don't have a PC that can run a 2020's AAA game on high settings (at least medium to feel the city and beautiful views), then it's also your fault. Plus one more thing, If you liked Mr. Robot TV Show, you will like this game too. Not just because of hacking and tech stuff, but also the similarity between Johnny Silverhand and Mr. Robot (P.S. not Elliot but Mr. Robot). Overall, if you weren't hyped for this game, you will love it. But if you have been dreaming about it for like a year, filling your mind with things about this game, then I can't tell the same for you, hence 7-8 billion people don't share same mind. It will get updates in upcoming months and get better than what we currently have in hand. I would recommend you to get the game when it gets fully polished. But if you are eager, you can still try. Game breaking bugs are rare. Most are minor bugs but the problem is they are too much. Anyway, forget the filthy console peasants who are crying for a bad port meanwhile PC players were recieving many unoptimized ports (later got optimized with patches) like RDR2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Dishonored 2, GTA IV. Even Witcher 3 was unoptimized at launch for every platform, but look at that game now. That's all I gotta say. Have fun. I'm sure you will :)"

From the moment the game was revealed, I decided I would go in totally blind. No trailers or teasers, no forums or comment sections. No overblown expectations of what the game will or should be. I wanted it to be my own experience, through my own eyes, not, let's say,"" polluted "" by hype. I wanted it to be pure and personal. Here's my thoughts on Cyberpunk 2077. I've always been drawn to the cyberpunk genre and the nature of it, it's such a great canvas for storytelling and reflexion. From Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, to Deus Ex and Matrix, the genre has always had something different and interesting to say about humanity, technology, the nature of power and civilisation as a whole. Often set in oppressive, gritty, violent, dystopian worlds where power is centralized and empathy, justice and freedom are just a fading memory, it's the perfect premise for a thrilling story and an even better setting for a video game. The main protagonist of the game is not you, V, the player. It's the city. Exploring every inch of it told me more about itself than language could explain, and I found it to be more interesting than almost any character in the game. From the aesthethics and sounds of night city, everything screams decay, violence, inequality, tribalism and obsession for power and control. It's the perfect representation of a society where technology has surpassed its economic system and the consequences of it, a world not so far from our own. But there's beauty to be found in all of this chaos. In terms of design and aesthethics, I dare say it's one of best cities ever made in a video game. A momumental and terribly ambitious project, probably too much for its own good, that I could only ever dream of when playing games like Deus Ex : Human Revolution and Dishonored a fews years back and imagining what these would be like if they were set in open worlds. From the highest corporate buildings to the lowest crime riddled back-alley, immersion in Cyberpunk is to be found at every corner... absolutely exquisite and found in no other forms of media on this scale and at such quality. Whether it's a new toy or a new perspective, every part of the city has its own biome and rewards the player for exploring. I treat video games in a kind of "" sacred "" way in a sense that I just like existing in this offered space for a while, just taking it all in, and cyberpunk is the perfect game for that. Despite the main story having some glorious moments, it is not where the game truly shines for me ; it's in its side missions, activities and exploration. Take the farcry formula with its outpost system and gunplay, sprinkle some deus ex/dishonored type of gameplay, freedom of approach, level design ( verticality ), put it in a open world settings and you've got a dream come true for many players, me included.This is how I've had the most fun in the game, mostly roaming. It's a unique and memorable experience, one I love to go back to once in a while, more than anything else the game has to offer."

I expect that on this PC version, those will all eventually be fixed. So I won't even take any of the technical problems with the game into account when I say: I would not recommend this game to anyone. I expected a legitimate first person open world RPG, in the vein of Fallout: New Vegas. I did not get that. Instead, I got a narrative heavy shooting game, with virtually no choices at all (even in dialogue), where the character building relates almost entirely to the damage your weapons do, and the leveling up process simply means your guns do more damage.Frankly, instead of saying ""what is wrong with this game,"" it would be easier to list off the things that were done right: -The game looks good, when it's not bugging out-A lot of people put a lot of love into building the world-The car designs are cool-The voice acting is mostly well doneBasically, everything else sucks. What stands out as particularly horrible is the storytelling.The story is convoluted and confusing, and attempting to follow what is happening is emotionally and psychologically draining. Before I even finished the prologue, I was skipping entire scenes of dialogue, because I didn't care and couldn't really follow what was happening anyway. If you were thinking, like I was, that the narrative lightens up when you get into the core game - you would be wrong. No matter how long you play, if you are doing missions, the majority of your time spent in the game will be listening to people talk. It just goes on and on and on. Astonishingly, it doesn't appear that they ever touch on any of the interesting concepts that exist in traditional cyberpunk literature, and instead just focus on endless, inane crime drama. I'm not a big FPS guy, and only bought this game because it was advertised as an RPG, but the combat is also horrible. It's unclear how much of that is due to the bugs, but the basic fact is that if you are a low level character, you are in a situation where you can hit someone in the head five times with a sniper rifle and they don't go down. They use the leveling system (which is otherwise pointless) to punish you severely for attempting to play missions in any order other than the order that they've laid out for you. This might be because all of the missions have so much narrative attached to them that if you do them out of order, the story becomes even more confusing. I don't know. Here are some other observations:-Stealth appears to be completely broken, but that might just be bugs. It's not clear. But I would advise anyone to avoid even trying to use stealth, because it does nothing but cause frustration. -You cannot shoot while driving, but other people can shoot you. Also, you often can't get out of the vehicle after combat begins, so you just have to wait until the car blows up. -If you do anything illegal at all, you get cops on you. It's not clear how these cops know that you're committing crimes. However, cops are very easy to lose. Even if you have 4 stars and an army chasing you, you can simply kill a criminal, at which point the cops will leave you alone. -This isn't really cyberpunk, in the vein of William Gibson or Ghost in the Shell and other well known representatives of the genre. It's more just ""crappy near future world."" -The art style, this retro futurism aesthetic with the 1980s references, feels kinda dated in 2020. I guess that's what happens when you spend nearly a decade making a game. The style would have been cool if it came out in 2014, but it now seems tired and played out. -The soundtrack doesn't not contain any synthwave, which is simply bizarre. CDPR said they didn't want to use that music because it would be cliche or something (meanwhile the game is filled with stupid cliches). -If you walk around the city aimlessly, you don't find interesting missions in the way you do in other open world games. You can walk around for hours and find pretty much nothing at all. I will not even say ""buy it if it is on sale"" or ""buy it if you like X."" There is no context in which I would recommend this game to anyone. This does not bode well for the future of big budge games. The good news is, there are good games coming out from smaller studios every single day, so no one has to rely on these ultra-expensive, hyped-out games."

They hyped everyone for something and delivered something else. If it was a ubisoft game, they would have been crucified. The things that are in the game are fun, but the things that are missing makes the game feel bland and incomplete from time to time, which sucks. For example, there's no NPC driving AI, if you stop in front of them or just park you car on the side of the road, they will stop and wait for ever. There's no car chase except for the ones that are pre-determined and made for missions only. If you commit a crime, the police just spawns on you. There's a lot of stuff like this that when you see it happening, makes the game feel incomplete and bland. But don't get me wrong, I still have fun playing, it's just that I often wonder what the game could've been. It's like Metal Gear Solid V all over again for me."

Luckily, the game’s low points like the horrible binary stealth system and the bugs and lack of QoL are either fixable or vastly outweighed by the good bits, and the overall tally still ends up being much higher than the average of many other games out there. That’s helped a lot by the moment-to-moment gameplay, which pays off just as much as the story beats; the movement system lets you climb almost any short object, vehicles are weighty to drive and have fantastic interior and exterior designs, and guns feel properly loud and heavy. It’s story and narrative kept me glued to the screen, and everything – from sex scenes and romance options to Keanu Reeves trying to kill you or help you throughout the game – are remarkably well done. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game crafted with love, and it shows...A remarkably well-executed open world game whose great heights exceed its profound depths."

Several elements in the game are absolutely superb, 10/10. But then there are a relentless, unavoidable stream of 1s and 2s in a rather empty universe. It's a cyber, inferior first person Mafia 3 for anyone who's played it.Ray tracing for many players means your characters donning black face paint when in cars. The driving model is utterly hideous - imagine sliding heavy magnets around a heavy metal board. GTA 3 style look away, look back and new NPCs are generated.  People have the same conversations over and over. Try looking at traffic from a distance - literally 2d sprites. Bizarrely the city itself seems almost one dimensional - for all its vastness, beauty and flashing lights, i felt i was plodding around impenetrable blocks of nothingness, not a teeming corporate metropolis. Also items just disappear from your inventory, terrible quality of life issues persist, etc etc. Choose the appearance of your genitals? Intention - mature, edgy. Outcome - pathetically childish. It's like nobody who's played games was allowed to see it before release. Completely gutted.Sadly, I think the problems are way too deep to fix and in fact, you'd need to start over completely. Yes at times it is awe-inspiring, it's certainly playable - even fun - but so relentlessly disappointing. It's a Yes/No recommend, slightly more No."

Overall it's still a fun game with an interesting storyline / humor to it. I might update my review whenever I am going to finish the main story because my preferred way of playing is to get everything done at the same time. Don't get too distracted by all the hate and criticism towards the game and the publisher tho, in my opinion it is worth the money but of course you can wait a month or two to get it a bit cheaper if you are unsure about it yet. I hope that they will polish it in the near future so that every single person will be at least a bit satisfied with the end product. Appreciate the time and effort they have put into this world they created even if it took them longer than expected, which is totally fine. Keep up the great work, defo recommended from my pov.Edit: Finished the game after approx 113~ hours with 100% completion and I gotta admit the grind has been insane and I was able to enjoy myself to the fullest extent. Still, there were many times where the game kinda bit me in the butt (aka falling from the height of a tiny rock and instantly dying) but that doesn't really make it worse for me in the long run. Had to start a second playthrough as well which I managed to finish in less than 7 hours to get the last story related achievement cuz I kinda f'ed up in one of the key missions but hey, was able to speedrun it in great fashion. I've lost the sense of time while doing all of this and oh boy.., I would do it again. 11/10."

Witcher 3 had more choice than this game has. Everything plays out the same no matter what you choose basically-Its not an immersive sim. For people who think this will give them their Deus Ex fix, just look somewhere else -The cyberware in this game is a joke and doesnt feel like you can alter your character into some ungodly cyberhero. Most is stat boosts. Every arm cyberware is just a melee weapon that scales off a certain stat, excluding the one that turns ur wrist into a rocket launcher.If you expect deus ex levels of augments/cyberware here just forget it. Its not even close to Deus Ex.-They had to completely rewrite the game two years before release to make Keanu Reeves the main character which the whole plot evolves around. Good one guys. You ruined the possibility of an amazing ""choose your own path RPG"" just to have some big actor in the game. The character Keanu plays tho is pretty enjoyable tho and probably why so many people, including me, say they like the characters.-Emotional moments feel rushed, you can't get attached to anyone besides Keanu-Shooting is worse than Fallout 4, no gun customization either besides stat boosts, silencers and a handful of scopes. No other muzzle attachments at all-Most skills in the skill tree are just stat increases which is boring af if you are used to something like modded Skyrim or certain Fallout games. Also many skills just don't work. One skill tree is completely broken and can't be leveled properly. -The driving feels horrible without a controller and even then most cars drive like they are on ice-You don't own anything in this game, one apartment which can't be customized, cars are just in a list which you can spawn. You can only display certain weapons-Crafting breaks the game and was terribly designed-Horribly unbalanced. Tech weapons can basically trivilize every combat encounter because you can shoot through seemingly unending amounts of mass between you and the target.-Some quest chains never go anywhere. They get really interesting then end on a cliffhanger or just fizzle out-Texting with other characters is broken and barely works like you want it to-You get called up by random NPCs every 2 seconds if you drive past objectives-So called ""Gigs"" are just a grindy excuse to give you money and exp and get repetitive very fast-Default keybindings are stupidly designed making you skip dialogue when you try to crouch for example-The game will die if you play too much, corrupting your save forever. -Bugs. So many bugs. Verdict: Wasted a bunch of development years to incorporate some big actor which people liked, so they had to make him the main character. This game had potential but most issues cannot be fixed and this game will never be the promised big open world game it marketed itself to be.Seriously don't buy this game full price. Don't buy it at all. Don't encourage CDPR by giving them money. I regret that I cannot refund the game. Pirate it if you wanna play the game.I will maybe update this if the game gets any interesting updates."

This is the game most of us have been waiting to play for a very long time. Got to sink a good amount of hours into this, and I am aware that I'm nowhere near finishing it soon. My completionist heart has taken over and I want to explore and do every little side activity I can find. However, I think I'm ready to express what a fantastic, breathtaking and imaginative role-playing game CDPR have managed to create. The writing and delivery is a step above anything the studio has done before, with all characters delivering stellar voice performances that are confidently grounded in Night City.I mean the world building, characters, quests, music on display are insane. It's jam packed with a cynical and philosophical view on humanity. Consumerism fuels the economy, and megacorporations taring the world apart. Literally striping humanity to the bone by the addition of cybernatic enhancements that have become the norm. This is a mean and cruel dystopian hellscape that takes hold and refuses to let go. The storytelling, in my eyes, ventures to places that challenge our views, exhibiting all the worse qualities of this battered and broken society, which is something that easily be applied to our future.There is a lot to unpack in the first hours. The path you choose will not only determine where our mercenary grew up, but also how they react to situations throughout Night City. This leads to a multitude of narratives, offers depth to your character, V, who can have different insights or knowledge about certain topics depending on their attributes. I went for more of an engineer type character for my first playthrough who is also specialized with handguns. So far, I'm having a blast!I really like the combat in the game. While it isn't unique, the RPG elements that surround the game offer a bit more diversity to how you approach each conflict. What I absolutely respect is the decision for first-person perspective at all times, because once you start playing the game you will understand the value to your immersion by having this one preset view. For me it helps to really be immersed in this universe. Now my decisions, or rather V's decisions, make for a more compelling experience. You can diplomatically defuse a situation or pull out your weapon and just blast every scum in your way, forcing you to accept whatever consequences might surface as a result.It’s unfortunate the game was launched with so many bugs, glitches and poor performance (not everyone) after a number of delays. I personally encountered very few bugs and had no performance issues, for Cyberpunk 2077 has run smooth all throughout my playthrough. As far as I'm aware, many of these issues are predominant on consoles. As I am playing this on PC, maybe I'm just lucky. Flaws aside, this is an open world, bugs and glitches are to be expected in the first couple of weeks, and I'm very sure CDPR are doing their best to bring out fixes ASAP, but I can understand people's frustration with this.Update:Months and months have passed, showing the poor state of development this game was in, as of now there are numerous issues, from performance to more glitches and bugs, some added recently from the patches, that really stains the overall quality of the game.I had fun playing and finishing Cyberpunk 2077 when it released. The few bugs encountered were just funny to me, and did not break the story at any point. Time has passed and I'm reflecting on many things I've ignored or simply left alone thinking they will be fixed soon. It is crystal clear to me now why so many people REALLY hated Cyberpunk 2077, and while I do disagree with some of them, I totally agree with the rest. There is very little excuse that this game was released to such a degree of unpolished and disregard to the fans. I can only hope and wait for CDPR to sink serious time and resources to rectify these mistakes.Overall, I will recommend the game, if you like cyberpunk themed stories and crave a good shooter, at least on sale."

I was expecting more of a bladerunner/ghost in the shell/altered carbon like gloomy environment but there sunshine parts which more like mad max setting.Overall, even being not a fan of this GTA/Watchdog like games, the cyberpunk setting mixed with RPG elements is doing fine for me.

Most of em weren't gamebreaking at all. For example, when exceeding X speed with a car or bike your character will briefly appear over the vehicle in a T pose. npcs eating invisible food, taking selfies with invisible phones, alerted pedestrians disappearing when moving the camera off them and generally acting super dumb ... that kinda stuff. those didnt bother me too much so I could go through the game without too much hassle, but I can see some people getting rightly frustrated by some of the bugs.  they can be very immersion breaking at times.another thing this game is severely lacking is world interaction. as I said the city is amazing, best open world scenario ive seen in any game, period. problem is that this amazing, colorful world is an empty shell where you can't do anything but questing. Billiards, arcade machines, npc hookers, ambulance/firefighter missions, casino, pachinkos... you can't even sit on a stool. the amount of wasted possibilities is massive. Some games like gta 3 did that 20 years ago. let that sink in.the ugly:both the bug and interactivity issues don't bother me too much because i know the former will be eventually fixed, and the latter will be adressed by cdpr via dlc/free patches.the AI of the game however may be a more difficult issue to tackle. it's bad, like very very bad. wanted sysem is the worst of all: when you commit a crime, instead of police cars and other vehicles chasing you, police npcs will start poppint 3 meters away from you. no matter where you go, they will keep popping right in front of you. if you get out with a car they won't pursue you simply because the game inst programmed to do that. all the cars are programmed to follow a straight on-rails line and won't leave it no matter what. If you block a road with your car other cars won't try to avoid it, they will just sit there honking like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. likewise, if you shoot people inside their cars, they will just leave them and crouch with the standard ""afraid"" animation and stay there forever or until killed.there are few races in the game where the cars are absolutely unable to follow you or actually drive and win the race, so the game just respawns them behind you every second. this is probably the most flagrant example of terrible npc driving ai.about performance: you will need a beefy machine. I'm getting 30-50 fps with a 3080, 3700x and 16 gb ram with everything on ultra + rtx on at 2440p. my conclusion is that the game is good, even with its flaws, and definitely worth the price if youre not too bothered by the bugs and ♥♥♥♥ performance (which will be fixed eventually, I hope)."

The only time it feels like im actually talking to a person is when interacting with Johnny, one of my fav parts of this game. Skill trees are absolutely pathetic, nearly all perks are just meager stat bonuses. Borderlands 2 did skill trees much much better  ago. Not to mention crafting is mostly locked behind one skill tree. meaning if you dont wanna spec into technical you wont be able to craft anything above uncommon items. too bad! While the gunplay is enjoyable and the same goes for melee combat, the weapon pool is so small.

So this negative review is genuinely regarding the quality of game play. Like so many other gamers, I am a sucker for a great open world experience. Since the days of Morrowind I have eagerly consumed most every AAA open world adventure/action/RPG: the GTA, RDR, Elder Scrolls, and Fall Out franchises have generally delivered fun experiences, with some being better than others; some excellent while others just slightly average.Every single Bethesda and Rockstar title in recent memory, as well as CDPR's own Witcher 3, provide exceedingly immersive, engaging and enjoyable experiences compared to Cyberpunk 2077.In fact, in my 15 some odd years of being on the Steam platform I have never felt the need to post a review until today.- character models are jittery and animations are rough, looks like a beta game or something from 5 years back- NPC collision animations only trigger a small amount of the time; sprinting through a crowd of a dozen pedestrians feels hollow, as you fly straight through them, colliding with some while passing straight through others- constant light and texture flickering and popping- terrain objects showing clearly through fog or at great distance, breaks immersion in all flying scenes- pedestrian models and vehicles constantly appearing and disappearing just 5 feet from you- a muddy, almost hazy look to the game, even at fully maxed setting at 2K resolution- small immersive things like jumping into a pool or body of water result in no water animation or noise, as if this were a title from 2007. there is in fact no animated liquid in this game...- numerous collision bugs; I've been thrust into the sky as high as a skyscraper when I brushed past a car once- AI is abysmal, they will attempt to shoot you through walls and doors never hitting you; they will find cover and just stay there waiting for you to heal and reload calmly (on Normal difficulty)- While the map seems full of activities, the world is hollow with not much to do other than visit item shops or buy hookers; NPCs quite literally have one response to any action your character takes in public: cower. I once bumped into a huge, tough looking, 300 lb, fully sleeved NPC and he simply cowered on the ground, it immediately broke immersion- there are more things to list here, but you get the gist- combat has little intensity and feedback; you cannot tell if you are taking damage unless you look at your health bar or until your vision starts flickering and becoming red- AI are akin to AI you would encounter in games from early 2000's; they either stay in place uselessly or run at you- the guns are lifeless and don't FEEL like they are packing a punch; you'll inevitably find yourself soullessly spraying magazine after magazine into an enemy- stealth boils down to: hide until the NPC starts on a route and leaves; that's it. this game has no concept of stealth- melee feels weightless with no momentum or impact; i remember a mission where i had to sneak into a guy's office after giving up my weapons at the lobby. he proceeded to pull a gun and attack me after a conversation went bad. i went on to punch this guy and heal as he shot me with a pistol for what felt like 2 minutes until he finally died, somewhere around the 100th punch.- the hacking abilities are boring and offer little to either stealth or assault tactics- the inventory and UI is a mess, you'll be spending quite some time understanding just what the hell is going on; junk items and food items everywhere- upgrades to gear, to tech and to the characters skills are real dry; rarely something that is unique or interesting, usually just increase X by 5% type stuff- driving physics feels wrong; the car grips far too much to the ground, to the extent that when you collide with other vehicles you will literally scoop underneath them. motorcyle physics are terrible, and you can run your motorcycle into a wall at 60 MPH and nothing happens.- movement and collision with the world is jumpy/jittery, and it is far too easy to accidentally trigger a dodge- again, lot's more to cover here but the combat leaves much to be desired- took about 6 hours to get past the intro act; every single moment of it felt dry and boring- i often found myself confused by the introduction of characters, not understanding how or why they were important- after the intro act, I expected things to pick up, but the story only dried up further and began to dredge along around hour 10- they seem to have added Keanu for marketing sake; his character is neither complex nor convincing- the only character with any charisma is killed within the first 10 hours of the story line- side quests are no fun; it makes me appreciate the truly unique side quests that games like RDR 2 have to offer- the story makes me want to go level another character in Classic WoW"

The soundtrack is incredible and really brings the spectacle that is Night City to life. Cyberpunk managed to strike an atmosphere with a similar level of accuracy to Half-Life, Unreal Tournament, Nier Automata and Metro, all of which I hold high regards for.I've already sunk 40+ hours into the game and I haven't even reached an ending yet.

(Not that I hyped myself for it.)I pre-ordered this game on July 2019. That was a huge mistake on my side but thanks to Cyberpunk 2077 I will not do that mistake again for any other promising game or a developer that i think i could count on.The state of this game is just ""breathtaking"". Number of bugs that I encountered with are out of imagination. And significant amount of that bugs are game breaking bugs that I need to reload my save. And there is another kind of bugs that just destroy the immersion, excludes you from atmosphere of the game. T posed NPCs hovering around in a serious cutscene, sudden changes of time just hit you with a blinding light, ghost cars that NPCs piercing through other cars or killing whatever come to their way and the last but not least of them is the crashes. It happened to me especially on my last 10 hours or so. I am playing this game on a 1060 6gb ""supposedly recommended system"" and my fps were ~45 at 1080p, low-med settings. So this game is not optimized at all.Story is intriguing, particularly if you are enjoying the genre like me. Some of the supporting characters' story lines also good. RPG element is .. nope until the end. Combat is nice even thought I didn't think it would be. Enemies are not like a bullet sponge, that's a relief. Things I like the most other than Keanu Reeves' company are little references and easter eggs that are great.In conclusion, I can't recommend Cyberpunk 2077 to anyone in this state. It needs so much polishing in every aspect."

The game is amazing, it's incredibly immersive, has a lot of very deep gameplay systems, an engaging main story, and a ton of open world side stuff to do.A lot of people are saying the game is super buggy, I've only run into one real bug in 22 hours played, and a few trivial animation errors. It's been a very smooth experience.Graphics, I'm somewhere between minimum and recommended, with a GTX 1060 3gb card holding me back, I'm able to play the game on mostly high settings at 1080 with stable 35-40 FPS in most situations. I would have guessed it was higher, but that's what the FPS counter says. It feels pretty smooth, no chop, very playable after updating to the nVidia game-ready drivers. The game looks amazing, the characters look amazing, animations are amazing, my only complaint is it seems like TAA is forced on with no way to disable it, I'm sure I could get a few more frames with that turned off and I generally don't like the the blurriness of AA or especially the slight after-images caused by TAA, but it's barely noticeable in most situations (and/or I've gotten used to it by now).Big thumbs up. I'm of the opinion a lot of people really enjoy being contrary and this game is the new big thing for them to latch onto and be vocal about. This game was at about a 70% within hours of release, which is ridiculous, but it's been climbing as the trolls are drowned out by legit players playing long enough to actually form a valid opinion. It should be a 90-95% as far as I'm concerned.Edit: I played for like 7 more hours. This not the big update to the review I was planning on doing, just more of a small edit. I ran out of steam at about the 30 hour mark, through no fault of the game, just that I can only do so much ""story"" in a game these days before needing a break. It's a long story, which is a good thing, and I wanted to push through it, but I'm less into story these days than I used to be. I don't have much else to add at this point, I still never ran into any serious issues with the game in terms of bugs. I can't say most people wont have serious problems, but I imagine that is the case, and that it's one of those games where so many people are playing that a lot of fringe cases come up that make it seem like an entirely untested and broken experience. The reality is that there is a solid stable experience in there that a lot of people have enjoyed, but there's no guarantee at this point that you will have that experience, so I guess until there are some serious updates it might be a bit of a gamble to buy, short term. Long term I have no doubt they will fix all the bugs people are having."

You play as a character named ""V"". You play in Night city, a techno-metropolis built by the mega-corporations that rule the world.Let me start out by saying, this game has gotten A LOT of critics. Mostly for the console versions, as PC is much better. But even on PC the game has quite some bugs/glitches.To me this game, in terms of the main story, did live up to the hype. Let me explain. Dialog and building bonds with characters is so well done. There’s a lot of moments in between the action you just get to talk with characters. You will end up just choosing extra dialog options just to get to know that character more or work out the relationship you have with them. You can choose and give your character the attitude you want, and even though some dialogs always end up at a certain result, sometimes the options you choose really do matter later on. The story in general is really well done and interesting and has a good length if you ask me. Not too long, not too short(Took me about 33 hours with some side missions in between). Talking about side missions, they are also really fun to do! Some of them have some great little story’s sometimes part of a bigger story that involves multiple quests. There’s just a lot of content in the general.Gameplay itself is also really fun. You level your character the way you want it. Focus on hacking, melee, gun blazing, assassin etc. You can also buy cyberware at so called ripper docs to basically modify your character's body and gain all kinds of cool extra skills and functionalities. Good to note is the category you put your skills points in also helps you in dialogue. There’s plenty of skill checks during dialogue just like in for example Fallout.So let’s talk about Night City. Night City in itself looks absolutely amazing. It looks alive, has a lot of cool places and they really nailed the feeling of a crowded bustling metropolis. There're lights and skyscrapers everywhere, and there’s some really cool areas. But… It’s missing some essential stuff. There’s just not much to do in Night City itself. I wish it would have more small things games like GTA have. For example: entertainment such as mini games, barbers to change your look, and other small activities are just missing. There’s a lot of small food places, and in most of them you can buy some food but you can’t really sit down to actually “eat food” there. Also there's just no real interaction with NPC’s that are walking around. They all give you some kind of random one liner as a response. It’s a shame because Night city has everything else. The way you navigate the city is really cool. In other open world games you just drive to a place to start a new quest. Here you actually walk through cool alleys, up some stairs past some people doing their own things etc. It really feels alive, so missing these crucial features are just a bummer.On the performance part, I got an average of 40-50fps on my GTX 1070, no crashes and some frame dips at times(Medium/High settings). Do not forget to install the NVIDIA drivers. It seemed to help a lot of people with their crashes and performance. I found some glitches and bugs, but most of them could be compared to the ones The Witcher 3 also had at launch, or games Like Fallout often have. Just visually. I had 3 breaking bugs where I needed to reload my save because it was stuck somehow. Next up, A.I. Damn it CD Projekt Red…. The A.I. of people in the open world is absolutely horrible. To not even start talking about police. There basically is none. When doing a crime, some police spawn right next to you, then you walk away 1 corner, and they just leave you be. Lastly, CD Projekt Red made quite some promises that they didn’t deliver. I personally didn’t follow the hype and promises, so I wasn’t disappointed, But it sure is a big miss to not have some of these features they promised. Hopefully they will add those later on.So to sum it up, would I recommend this game? Hell yes! It was really fun, and I’m sure with time it will even get better as they polish out bugs, and hopefully add some ofthe missing features. For me Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game! A bit disappointing on some parts but I can’t wait until some more polishments are made and we get cool new features and DLC. Knowing CD Projekt Red they will keep working on it."

I'll keep it short for those who doesn't like to read long reviews.THE GOOD-The story of cb2077 is amazing and they really put their heart on it, You can get emotional with the characters.-Night city world Cdpr really did an amazing job crafting the world, there is so much detail on the buildings, If you try just to chill and walk you can really appreciate all of it.-The music on this game is just incredible there is nothing more to say.THE BAD-There is so much missing content that it hurts, I still wondering what went wrong?-The main story is just too short this was a letdown for me when I realize I was about to finish it :(-Crafting is almost useless- You can't customize you car, you can't even change the paint.-Beware! When you create your character you can't change your style anymore because there are no barbers on night city-Police is broken(spawn behind you) If you like police chases I am sorry.-CDPR post a video about styles, Keep in mind! Styles does not matter in this game because it's armor, this sucks for players that like to look very good on their games-Your choices barely matter-Npcs does not have day-night cicles, they keep doing the same thing forever.-Lots of bugsThere is so much but those are the basics for me and unfortunately I trusted CDPR I thought they were one of the best gaming developers but they just lied a lot maybe more than HELLO GAMES with no man's sky, There is a patch releasing soon but that won't be enough to fix all the problems this game has unfortunately but who knows?.Don't forget this does not mean cp2077 is a bad game is good but with all those issues it has, It's better to wait until the game is actually READY! and have the full experience of Cyberpunk 2077."

This game is for you. Maybe wait a bit longer for more updates but certainly don't write it off for good.Full review:At nearly 40 hours in, I figured I'd give a review of my experience so far. I'd like to preface this by saying that if you try to forget everything that you thought this game would be, forget the hype, let go of your expectations of the dev, etc. Its really an impressive game, bugs and all. And yes its still pretty buggy. I have only come across minor ones mostly, although I have seen a couple of pretty jarring things(i.e. rush hour traffic in the middle of the desert) but in the end I think this really is an amazing game that's just in early access(but the devs arent calling it that).Graphics 4/5:I would be completely willing to give the graphics a 5 if anyone(literally anyone) that I knew was capable of actually playing this game at max settings to even witness how good it can be. Im playing it on med-low(mostly low) and its still great aside from glitchy things that pop up in the environment from time to time.Sound 4/5:Nothing in this game has truly captivated me sound wise but I also have very little to complain about, the radio stations are decent, score is fitting, voice acting is really on point. The only complaint is that sometimes the dialogue volume of one person in a conversation will suddenly be much louder for a sentence or two.Story*so far* 4/5:I've enjoyed the story so far, its very much witcher 3 style story progression, just different characters in a different setting.Gameplay 3/5:This really is tough to judge, sometimes i feel like the gameplay is wonderful.. sometimes its awful. This could be due to bugs that will be fixed eventually. Also, even though there is a seemingly adequate tutorial this game was incredibly overwhelming for me to actually get a grasp on what my choices for different playstyles were and what TF it was exactly that I was supposed to be doing aside from the main story. Eventually you mess around enough to get it but it was bit frustrating for a while.(tip, invest in the attributes that are higher levels, that means that you are preforming those actions more, i.e. if you notice that your assault is higher than pistols, while you may have thought you liked pistols more.. you simply arent using them as much.. invest in what you naturally play)15/20 Recommended"

It's fun, but if you stop to examine almost any individual element of this game, you'll realize fairly quickly it's either often mediocre, poorly implemented, or both. The game world is beautiful at a distance but fundamentally dead. There are simply many, many missed opportunities in this title which fundamentally prevent it from being more playable and compelling:- the starting life paths have almost no relevance after the beginning of the game- gunplay and melee feels clunky as hell- you can't hijack air ships whatsoever - cops don't even give chase in cars- the cop response mechanic overall is goofy and braindead instaspawning- there's no player choice to align oneself with the criminal demimonde or the police or corps or any group- many if not most of the buildings are inaccessible, and frankly there is little to no detailed oriented exploration in the style of GTA, RDR, or BOTW- there is little to no emergent gameplay featuring NPCs interrupting you out in the world, and so your connection to the world is largely restricted to phone calls or explicit interaction during questsI could go on, but that's enough.On top of everything, there are a ridiculous number of bugs, and let's not forget that CDPR literally lied to base console players that their product ran ""surprisingly well"" when it is in fact crippled. Speaking of which, anyone else having problems with their implants and skills? I'm trying to create a run and gun char but the health regen effects supposed to be granted by my build choices don't occur in or out of combat. The hilarious thing is that the build variety would be the one thing to keep me playing this game, yet this side of the game suffers the same fate as the rest of it - glitches, cut content, and extremely poor implementation. I mean, there's no excuse for the entire crafting skill tree to be useless. There's no excuse for an entire skill tree (techie) to be stripped without any replacement.From all appearances, the game was stuck in development hell and, at some point, there was a haphazard change of course from a more rpg experience to an action-adventure playstyle. The proof is in the muddled mess we got."

Even at launch the core gameplay was solid enough to support a well-written story with some of the best voice acting in gaming. Keanu Reeves turns in an excellent performance and both voice actors for V are terrific. If you're on the fence, I strongly recommend picking the game up on sale. It's definitely worth your time.

The main coolest thing in this game is the plot. It's attractive, catchy, and fueled with a cyberpunk spirit. Seriously, the setting, lore, and characters — I like it all extremely. Of course, there are QUESTIONS about certain aspects of worldbuilding, but in general, it's damn cool. The problem is gameplay. Every aspect of it is a bit odd and uncomfortable. In the early stages of the game, every step is painful. You move around the city trying to blend with furniture — God forbid you will catch the eye of a random bandit who will finish you off with one shot. But as soon as you upgrade at least one characteristic, the game turns into walking in the park. In the middle of the game, I got pretty bored, because by running a couple of scripts I was able to take out small gangs.The whole combat system is a mess. Especially a melee one. Yes, the game has a special subsystem with blocks/counterattacks and other things — and it's useless. The most effective way to kill an enemy is chaotic clicking until the endurance scale runs out. And this, to be honest, great illustration for the whole game. It has great ideas and concepts but half of them just don't work properly.But the worst part is that in the middle of the game, its slides into a dull grind. You carry out most of the orders purely mechanically. They assume neither plot depth nor variability: kill, steal, deliver — get a reward. That looks like MMORPG for those who have no friends.I played about 80 hours of it. Because of the great plot, I do not regret this time. But I suspect I would get much more pleasure from Cyberpunk 2077 if it was a linear mission-based game for 30 hours, and not a monstrous mega-RPG with a bloody open world."

One side is immeasurably in love with it, to the point of ignoring all the flaws and critical oversights. And the other side hates this game's guts and all those who dare play itI only found out about the game in 2020. I didn't even care to watch any trailers or announcements until my friends forced me to do it alongside them. Even my copy of the game was a gift. So if you're interested in an opinion that stems from a neutral party and a pure love for gaming - I hope you enjoy reading my reviewMy first few hours spent playing the game were really fun and enjoyable. I was satisfied with the way my character looked. I liked how the short little prologue set the stage and gave me the motivation to reach for the stars. I truly had a great time, and that first mission with Jackie was a blast. But there was this odd suppressed sensation starting to creep inAnd that would be the immersion breaking bugs, glitches and general lack of polish. How everything felt ever so janky and off. And even though the game is completely playable from start to finish there's hundreds of these smaller issues that pull you out of it. A lot of people say it's only the bugs that ruin an otherwise perfect game. But I strongly disagree, and I believe that aside from that, the game is also incomplete and often feels like a Beta versionThey advertised this game as a first person RPG. And yet they only delivered on half of that. Because simply put your choices don't matter. You can't affect the outcome of 95% of all quests. And you're stuck choosing between options like 'Yes', 'Yes but sarcastically' or 'No, but actually end up as yes'. It's all very pointless and the game only creates the illusion of choice. Instead of branching off dynamically and rewarding players with meaningful choicesNot to mention that for an ""RPG"", you have very little choice when it comes to shaping V's personality. Practically none. V is always a sarcastic, confident jerk that is occasionally a compassionate joker. But what sticks out to me the most is the complete lack of any kind of moral compass or alignment. Your play style doesn't matter. The world doesn't care if you're lethal or non-lethalAnd yet in spite of all it's bugs and flaws I still had a good time playing it. And this part of the review will focus on CP77's redeeming aspects- . Right from the start, I was thoroughly impressed by how good it looked. I was fortunate enough to be able to play the game on Ultra, with all Ray Tracing effects enabled. And I have to say that Night City is stunning, and all the districts have their own unique architecture and style. The rich, luxurious plazas as well as the dilapidated and washed down outskirts were so beautiful and enjoyable for me to traverse. Big corporate ads, neon lights everywhere, and a surprising amount of buildings you can enterAll of the primary and secondary characters were also meticulously crafted. With an incredible amount of detail and polish to them. From the way their hair moves when they turn their heads. To their jiggling clothes, earring, necklaces, all that kind of stuff. They have believable and easy to read faces, with dynamic skin folds and wrinkles, laugh lines, and so on. In fact there's so much detail put into them that you could use a x8 zoom and look carefully at their eye implants and notice the tiny text that reads KIROSHIIt's also worth talking about Ray Tracing. Because this is my first time playing a game with RT on and it is jaw droppingly beautiful. I used to think that RT is just a fancy little trick for better reflections. But it's so much more than that. The difference is substantial, and in my opinion it pushes CP77 to the very top of graphics in gaming right now- . I didn't like the story very much, but I admit that it had quite a few memorable moments. It's an interesting take on the subject mortality and transcendence. And the game tries to tackle themes such as: loss of a loved one, depression, cheating death and most importantly - acceptance. As the main character slowly goes through all 5 stages of griefIn retrospect it wasn't actually that bad, and I felt a wide array of emotions. There was just not enough.. resolution at the end. No big satisfying sigh of relief. Though there was an attempt at a beautiful done tragic epilogue, which I likedDuring the game you meet a plethora interesting and authentic characters. I bonded with many of them but also disliked several of them. And I think that's a good thing, I like clashing personalities. Unfortunately some of my favorite characters were removed from the playing field too soonI noticed the presence of a lot of powerful and determined female characters. Most, have entire quest lines dedicated to them and even optional endings. For the most part they're really well written and help improve and enhance the story. With some exceptions being the awful Panam sex scene. And the most unlikeable character ever - Judy. She looks as bad as she sounds, and she sounds like an old senile granny. Her bipolar personality and cringy crack ho attitude is my least favorite part in the entire gameJohnny Silverhand is a complicated character, but he definitely doesn't seem so at first. I think most people will actually dislike him initially. But ironically, he is the only sidekick in the game that goes through any kind of personality change and character growth. Some dialogues were really nice, just deep enough to get you thinking. But not corny enough for you to roll your eyes. You can seemingly bond with him during gigs and side missions. But there's no consistency and his replies don't really change depending on whether he likes you or not. But I ended up liking him. And of all the endings.. I think that the one with his epilogue is the most emotional one of the bunchAnd speaking of endings, there's so many of them, perhaps too many. It feels like a lot of budget was blown on these, instead of more interesting quests or deeper gameplay. It all comes down to just selecting a dialogue on the screen. None of them offered me that ease and comfort I believed I deserved. It seems like in my full 110h playthrough I've helped and supported absolutely everyone I encountered, except for myself. But it's true what they say, tragedies are always much more memorable than comedies- . I'm not entirely sure if the audio in my game was bugged or supposed to sound like it did. Many sfx are straight up missing, and that's during essential cutscenes. The sounds that do exist are pretty good and you never get tired of the ringing of your katana ripping and tearing everyone in your path. It's as if they simply ran out of time and had to release the game with a lot of missing sounds, even for the most crucial unskippable scenes- . The original score that was composed for the game is great! I like the dark, droning electronic music as it presents itself to the player. And especially the combat tracks are superb. Each gang has it's own theme that escalates and diminishes based on your play style. But the radio music is.. meh. It's a mixed bag that's usually a combination of mumble rappers as well as boorish and vulgar cringepop. There are some good tracks in there, I admit I bobbed my head a couple of times like a cavemanIn conclusion it doesn't feel at all like a game that was 8 years in development. Things are creaking at the seams and everything lacks polish. Bugs and glitches and missing features galore. But even with all that going on, I still liked it. It's fun, it's beautiful and I enjoyed my time in Night City7/10"

For fans of Deus Ex, System Shock, BioShock and Dishonored who have dreamed of combining the depth of an immersive sim with the width of an open-world action RPG, this was an interesting experiment. The game began pre-production in early 2012 and production around 2015... and, after a series of 3 delays, finally ended up shipping for PC, PS4, X1 etc. in December of 2020 - in the middle of the greatest recession and pandemic since the last century. It is also their first major non-Witcher AAA-level game in a very long time.The end result? Undeniably one of the most ambitious games ever... but beyond that, it's a solid FPSRPG with a decent narrative. The overall backstory and setting is all, of course, drawn from the original Cyberpunk RPG and is classic 80s cyberpunk - but don't expect anything more than that, the game scenario isn't in any way self-aware or delve beyond its source material into post-cyberpunk/satire, the game plays its cards straight (think ""GTA3 written by Gibson and Sterling in the late 80s"").We've got one of the biggest (circa 55 square km) and most meticulous dystopian cyberpunk game-worlds in the history of the medium. Night City is an amazingly detailed city with a great degree of thought put into authenticity, diversity (3-4 distinct architectural epochs were conceived and implemented) and believability, for a city that's 57 years into the future. I've been playing open world games for almost 20 years and I've seen some ♥♥♥♥ (anyone else remember Scrapland?) but this is one of the best I've ever seen.The player character also gets to know a huge number of characters in the world from many different milieus. Unfortunately, there's not a lot to do with them. GTA was arguably a major comparison point here and GTA4 nailed persistent in-game relationships in 2008 - ironically, unlike San Andreas, GTA4 isn't even much of an RPG at all. What I'm talking about is the fact that you can never go cyber-bowling with Jackie, or ask Panam on a date etc. There's some bars in the game-world, but they are basically just themed rooms which you only meaningfully interact with during quests. This isn't the only thing that's missing from the world - others have even drawn direct comparisons to Saints Row which suggest that Cyberpunk's open-world ambitions prove lackluster. But the game's 8-year development was clearly troubled and as far as I know much was cut as CD Projekt Red's management tried to aggressively ship the game as quickly as possible. For me playing it today, it's an excellent but flawed FPSRPG, a gorgeous game with one of the best RTX implementations I have  seen, and a game which truly shines on Hard difficulty... , as well as sub-optimal technical performance. I'm used to East European bug-ridden janky gaming so it only makes me laugh out loud, and I'm used to playing at 25-30 FPS (but if one has RTX and DLSS enabled, they get astounding improvements to picture quality for free), but I can see why other people might not like that. The game doesn't present any problems with save corruption, which would have been my only dealbreaker, but I should say I've experienced a few softlocks. From me, it's ultimately still a recommendation and I think it's one of my favorite games ever. But there are major caveats - RTX is highly recommended at least for now and be warned that until a complete patch ships later on, there are major bugs and performance issues."

I am not talking about the bugs. The game is stupidly filled with bugs but I wish that wasn't the case so the focus could be on why it is just a bad game. In summary, from the AI to the story, to dialogue choices, to gameplay mechanics, this game lacks so much. It's like CD Projekt Red just cut down on so much of the actual content that could've made this game what they promised it to be. Nothing you do matters. The only choices you make that truly ""matter"" are in the last mission. The AI is so bad in every aspect of the game that talking about it makes me wonder if they really put 80% of their budget into marketing and Keanu Reeves. I love Keanu Reeves, but I wish they spent more time and money on other characters like Jackie. The intro cutscene after your unimportant lifepath choice just shows how much they cut out from this game. Instead of spending time with Jackie and doing missions with him, you are given this lazy video about how you guys are best friends and did a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ together. I have a feeling they originally planned for you to actually do those missions and bond with Jackie more, but they ended up cutting it up into a short intro video. I am by no means saying the developers did not work hard enough. I know the team there was incredibly passionate about this game during development. But from a consumer standpoint, they should have delayed the game indefinitely. ""Coming when it's ready"" my ass. One of my friends said they would get Watch Dogs Legion instead of 2077. I thought they were crazy. When I imagined how Legion would turn out to be, I thought it would be another copy and paste Ubisoft game that had a map filled with a checklist of things to do, broken mechanics and AI, and a bland experience. Turns out I was describing Cyberpunk.Now, throughout my playthrough, I still enjoyed the game to a certain extent. I was completely immersed in my first 2-3 hours of gameplay. The first mission was amazing. Experiencing Night City during the drive with Jackie as the rain fell on your windshield was awesome. Seeing the neon soaked streets and advertisements got me so excited. But it seems like things only went downhill from there... The graphics and style is beautiful. It is actually pretty well optimized on PC, considering how large and beautiful the game is. There is so much detail and beauty in Night City. Too bad it's literally filled with only sex shops that you can't even interact with, and AI shopkeepers that don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about you throwing a grenade at their face. This game was hyped to stupid levels and it was 70% because of CD Projekt Red's promises and vision for the game, and 30% because of the fan base (which is to be expected from this kind of large project). I LOVE the Witcher 3, where your dialogue choices actually affect the story, the story wasn't rushed and the characters feel meaningful. I wonder how CD Projekt Red can fix this game. Will they completely rework the AI and add the features they promised? Or are they just going to add an online mode and some story DLC? This game had so much potential, and maybe it still does post release, but only time can tell.One more positive note. The language support in this game is phenomenal. I played the game in English and Chinese and the voice acting is incredible and the facial animations are brilliant and actually match what the characters say."

And look elsewhere. This game was promised to be an Incredible story with branching paths, and choices that matter. (SPOILER: IT DOESN'T) Outside of a single early story mission, (which they had on their youtube channel promoting this game) your choices do not matter in the slightest. Your characters background doesn't do anything outside of a small intro sequence at the beginning, and then as soon as you are done playing the intro, you're put into THE SAME cutscene and prologue that ALL players have. Regardless of what you chose for your own character. You're not given any agency in how to play the game either. Sure, the current mission objective might have an open floor plan for the current dungeon. But you're not rewarded for trying out new strategies or playing differently. Because there's no need to try out new things. All the areas are all the same copypaste enemies you'll see everwhere. There's no difference from the different gang NPC's you fight. They all have the same basic AI (That doesn't function properly half the time) and they all fight the exact same way. The enemy has a small caliber gun? they use close range shooting. Almost no cover except for reloading. They've got long range? They always hide in cover and take potshots from Obscene distances. They've got a melee weapon? OH BOY. Strap in buckaroo, cuz this game is about to rip your pucker a new one! The melee combat in this game is incredibly basic. And yet, somehow, they managed to make it feel clunky, yet fast. The hits and the animations from your melee attacks feel nice and smooth. But the hitboxes are stupid and hard to hit in fast paced combat. Meanwhile, when you're up against any enemies that like to fight you in melee range themselves, if you've got any of them that have the ability to dash using their cybernetics, you better believe that they'll be able to close distance faster than you EVER could with the same enhancements. And you better believe that those same NPC's are able to land hits on you, even when you're MILES away. All thanks to how their clunky hitboxes work.Combat is fun, and fast paced. But very repetitive. This is one of the few things that the game has going for itself. If you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about anything except gameplay, then you might actually enjoy this game quite a lot. Especially once you get access to a decent weapon or two. But the combat pacing is somewhat inconsistent at times. Where you'll be kicking ass one minute, and then all of a sudden get your ass kicked yourself. And there is no inbetween. Balancing is a big issue with combat. But other than that, if you're able to turn your brain off and just go shooting. It's quite fun!The story is very, VERY, linear. And you have almost no agency in how you interact with the story. You're able to have small side options for dialogue with the NPC's when they're telling you their life's story. But these function similar to how you had alternate options in Mass Effect dialogue for any of you who might have played that series previously. But unlike Mass Effect, these dialogue options don't do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for your own story, or your character. They're just little nuggets of lore for those who like to listen to that sort of thing. There's no different choices for story, based on what kind of character you built up over the course of playing. And while you DO get access to special dialogue options based on your character's background, they don't do anything either. You're simply given an option to pick that special dialogue option because you picked that character background, and the NPC's simply smile and nod, and keep going on their set script. There's no differences in dialogue based on who you are. And no differring outcomes in quests because you have a different background from another player. You'll all be playing the same game to everyone else. The only difference you get in choices from all other players is how the game ends. That is it. This isn't an RPG. This an Action Adventure game. With a side of story. You can't roleplay. You can't live life as your character, because there's no way to interact with the ingame world. No ways to interact with NPC's outside of your quest marker. And there's no freedom to play the game the way YOU want to play. Maybe one day this game will actually meet the promises the developers made to us. But as it stands today, That is NOT  the case. This game is good for you if you're able to get this on sale for at least 50% but don't pay full price for this.And if you're expecting a story-rich, open-world, character driven RPG? Go play Fallout New Vegas instead for like 10 bucks. You'll get more replayability and story engagement from that game, than this one. But if you want a bland, uninspiring story, looter shooter/beat'em'up then this is your game. (At least for right now)"

Its brought to us by the same developers of the Witcher games which, is probably what made this game as hyped as it was. With all this hype this game was destined to be a failure for some, for me however it was probably the best gaming experience I have had all year. Despite the amazing writing it is just average in some of its ""RPG"" parts, this did not hinder my enjoyment much, but it might lower yours significantly.The Characters are the heart of the game. The story is great and raises interesting points regarding AI, our possible future and body modification, but the characters in this grim world are what makes the ending so emotional especially with what happens while the credits roll.However, V, is the in my opinion worst written one. The 3 live paths did introduce you to him but never really gave huge insights to any bits of his past. Every other character is believable, and you get to know them greatly, from goals, past to personal struggles you get to know everything about the people living in and around Night City.The Characters of Cyberpunk 2077 are more than you might expect at first glance, the most prominent example here is clearly the man, the myth, the legend Johnny Silverhand. He is also the character most prominent throughout the story and the one that undergoes the most surprising but amazing development. The others are not much different though, they all are so well fleshed out and developed that once that ending hits, it really it's hard. CDPR's worlds were always about stories and not about you interacting a lot with it. What you experience in this game you experience in the quests, not in any side activities. There is not much interaction with the world. Its mostly a stage for the characters to play on. You have an apartment, but it does not feel like ""home"" because you just can't do anything with it. Just don't go in it expecting it to be a Rockstar game, because it is not. However, the atmosphere in Night City is amazing, driving through the rain as never been better in any game i have ever played. Its also very detailed, you know by looking around in which district you are, what people live here and how they live."

I am lucky to have a gotten my hands on a 3070 so graphics have not been a real issue for me like others. I think the gameplay is good, some have been misled by the marketing which makes the game look like a super intense fps. Although that is not the case it was not an issue for me since since I was expecting an rpg and definitely got one. The shooting itself is not that bad, no on par with actual fps' in terms of feeling impact, hit reg, etc. But it does remind me of looter shooters like early Borderlands or Destiny. Mostly in the sense of enemies being a bit spongy and always wanting to go for crits. Hacking to me is pretty fun, thinking of ways to distract one enemy while I blind another and kill the other is satisfying. Sneak is pretty simple but goes well with hacking. The skill trees are pretty vast and give you a good amount of options.I was very very disappointed by the driving early on, it felt very heavy kind of like GTA IV in that respect. However it did feel significantly better once I acquired better cars. Movement feels pretty smooth, you don't move like you're covered in grease. Which is what I felt playing the Witcher 3.The story to me is on the surface a little generic, heist goes wrong now go fix the wrong. But the manner in which it all pans out is what makes it so interesting for me. There are hints of foreshadowing, both subtle and very heavy-handed. The pace to me was well done. I heard people calling it a slow burn but things keep happening in at a consistent pace. It takes it's time introducing you new faces and giving you a perspective on how it is to live in this city. And that to me is the best part of the game, the atmosphere. Everything feels like it could be a real place or thing. Markets feel alive crowded, characters seem like real people (the doc is my favorite so far and Johnny being a mixed bag) and all the tech seems like something people would actually invent and use.The worst part is the bugs. Holy moly. I get that this game is big but I have had to reset the game about 5 times since I was essentially soft-locked. I have had a few quests either halted or go a different way than I wanted due to bugs. Very touching scenes were ruined due to visual bugs. Beautiful scenery has been tainted by various bugs. The ui has tanked due to some. These bugs are everywhere. However it does not ruin it for me, the times I reset sure were annoying but the autosaves never sent me back more than a few minutes.Overall if you are a fan of rpgs and can tolerate a mediocre shooting system then definitely... wait for them to patch it a bit more before buying. If you are expecting high flying action at every corner and are not one to sit through dialog then this isn't for you."

It's a crazy amount of things to render, this game is next gen but sadly most people won't have cards capable of running. Let's wait for the 4080 and 4080 ti to come out then revisit this game with everything cranked to the max :)3-bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ there's a fair few so far :( these range from random objects popping in, being unable to progress quests which forces me to replay from the last checkpoint and hope that it works next time around. So far CDPR have begun to fix these problems so there's at least hope on the way.4-this game should have never released on ps4/xbox, I'm sure you've all seen how bad it is...I've seen it person and yeah it's just terrible. What's even more terrible was people thinking this gigantic graphically intense game would run on a 7 year old console. The time, energy and money wasted releasing it on old consoles was all time that could have went into improving the pc version of the game. However because it was marketed so much for ps4/xbox there may be legal requirements they had to release it on those platforms.5-so lots of people will disagree or laugh at me for saying this...but I feel like there is just way too much going on the screen, my brain is struggling to absorb it all. There's a lot of systems to learn and I would have preferred if they dumbed it down a tad. but that's a personal problem on my part.If I think of more I'll update it but so far these are some of my gripes-so bottom line, should you buy the game at the moment? Yes but only if you have a rig capable of running it, if you would like to see how the game performs and some benchmarks check out this great teardown from Hardware Unboxed"

Let me start by saying that I was and kind of still am pretty biased regarding CDPR and their games, and that's why it's painful to admit and accept the fact that in it's current state CP 2077 is very dissapointing by CDPR standards and in general as well.I'm a huge fantasy and RPG fan, and with the Witcher trilogy CDPR created one of my favorite gaming franchises. I loved all 3 Witcher games, Thronebreaker, played Gwent on GOG for dozens of hours and all of them are entertaining, quality, content rich titles. So my personal experiences with their previous products, the countless hours I invested in them, and the enjoyment I got out of them pretty much made CDPR my favorite developer studio, and they even topped it with their attitude towards their community and the continous support they provide to their games (patches and fixes years after release, free DLCs, paid expansions with incredible amount of content).As a lot of other gamers I highly anticipated CP 2077, I had a pretty solid idea what to expect, I was familiar with previous CDPR titles, and I knew it will be a heavily text and dialogue based RPG and did not expect a fast-paced futuristic FPS GTA or whatever, so I'm not one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who compare it to GTA V screen by screen, neither I complain about the amount of dialogues or the slow-burning story.Furthermore I consciously didn't sit on the hype-train like a lot of dumbasses, I didn't expect this game to be some kind of miracle that would bring ground-breaking, never-before-seen innovations in it's every aspect, and would revolutionize the gaming industry forever. I remembered the buggy state in which the Witcher 3 was released so I expected to encounter bugs as well. My point is that I had pretty high, but not unrealistic hopes and expectations for Cyberpunk 2077.I knew it wouldn't be able to live to the unbelievable hype that was generated around it, but CDPR can only be partly blamed for that. The unrealistic hype was mostly generated by ""gaming portals and journalists"" (I do not wish to go into detail about the state of today's gaming journalism and the quality it represents because it's ridiculous and pathetic beyond measure) and the highly toxic gaming community itself (I'd love to address this as well, and share my opinion but I could rant on and on about this for hours, but let's just say that it's just sad that in 2020 it's common that developers receive death-threaths over the delay of a videogame by some basement-dweller, pathetic nerd... get a life dude.)So let's talk about the gameSo far I have played for around 60 hours and I still haven't finished the story but I usually take my time in RPGs and complete every side-quest, explore everything that I can etc so that's normal. I guess it's true that you can rush through the story under 15-20 hours but who in their right minds would do that in any RPG? :)Initially I didn't encounter that many bugs, only a few barely noticable graphical glitches but nothing game-breaking (the game only crashed once over the span of 60 hours) and I had a pretty stable performance and smooth experience with my RTX 2080 Ti, but bugs became more frequent and severe as I played more. Besides the mentioned graphical glitches I've seen wierd animations, missing textures, cars disappearing and popping out of nowhere, cars falling from the sky, quests that cannot be finished, unlootable items and so on.The hotfixes didn't bring that much improvement at least regarding those bugs that I experienced, but based on the state the Witcher 3 was released and the one it is in now I'm sure all of these will be resolved with the upcoming patches in the next months.The graphics are pretty solid with max settings, the city looks great, the characters sometimes are less so, but it's appealing to look at. It's nothing jaw-dropping and that's totally fine by me, it's very sad when someone thinks that good graphics = a good game. I definitely love the atmosphere of the game, the high-tech / low-life futuristic cyberpunk setting is great, you can feel the strong Bladerunner influence, and the great music and soundtrack complements the atmosphere very well.Moving on to the story - as I said I haven't finished it yet, so I can't form an opinion about it in it's entirety but's it's kind of a letdown so far. It's not the worst, I wouldn't even say it's bad, sadly it's just not that interesting to make me want to get to the end of it and it doesn't help that that the first 10-15 main quests and the story they cover have been spoiled by the trailers before release. Some of the side-quests are more interesting than the main story but the other gigs and jobs become just dull and repetitive quickly.My main problem is that Cyberpunk 2077 lacks a lot of mechanics that in my opinion would be a must in such a world/setting. Character customization is not that bad as some say, there are plenty of options, but I have to agree that I have seen far more detailed customization possibilites in other games. Ok, you can choose the color of your teeth, the size and shape of your ♥♥♥♥, but what's the purpose? You can't even see your character outside of the inventory screen, not even during sex sequences.In a world where body modification is not just possible, but pretty much a common thing with cyberware, implants etc and where looks in general are above all else, the fact that you can't alter your appearance later on during the game is just pathetic. You can't even get a haircut which is pretty much inexcusable nowadays, especially that even the Witcher 3 offered such possibilites.Since Cyberpunk 2077 is an RPG, your clothes and equipment obv. provide stat boosts. If you want to use items that provide better stats you constantly have to change them and because of that most of the time your appearance is ridiculous, and you look like a homeless who dresses from a lost and found bin. Why isn't there an option to change the looks of your clothes while keeping the new stats? A lot of other games utilize such functionality (transmogrification) and even tough this is not a fantasy RPG, changing the appearance of clothes can be easily explained in a sci-fi setting as well, for example with some kind of holographic technology or whatever).Another big problem is that sadly there is not much to do in Night City, there are plenty of side-quests which are fine, you have tons of gigs and other side-jobs but these jobs are almost identical (apprehend or kill a cyberpsycho, kill some gang members here and there, retrieve some intel from somewhere etc) and they become repetitive very quickly and besides this there is nothing. There are a few collectibles, you can buy cars and motorcycles, there a few races and underground fighting pits or something like that and with that we are at the end of the list.Once again I'd like to mention that I know this is not a sandbox action game, it's an open-world RPG. I don't want to play pool, or bowling, or things like that like some peep mentioned comparing it to GTA V, but in 2020 I expected more. It was emphasized that sex and sexual themes are very important, well besides some romance options during side-quests there is 1 female and 1 male prostitue in Night City on the same street. You can bang them and that's it, you can't even go to strip clubs or anything like that.Just to mention the driving, I don't think it's as bad as some say, I didn't really have any problems with the controls or mechanics (besides that the first person view is useless :D) but then again I'm not really into driving games and driving mechanics are just do not matter to me in general.I expected a solid RPG but at the moment CP2077 feels unfinished, rushed, buggy and just very average which is nowhere near the usual CDPR quality and sadly I can't recommend it. You should wait at least a 1 year or a half and check back then."

Some choices you make are smaller than others but it does all add up in the end. I'm yet to finish Cyberpunk, even though I'm not in any rush to do so, 60 hours into it and I still have way too much left to do before end game.

After that there is literally nothing to do except just drive around and shoot people. Tried to play through a second time a month ago and it's rough knowing that your choices in the game don't mean jack. A lot of people are glorifying it 24 hours after getting it on sale saying that they have fixed the main glaring bugs, but that's not the issue. The issue is that this was supposed to be an RPG full of new innovative gameplay when in reality its just a linear action-adventure storyline. For a game of the future that is based around cybernetic augments it has pretty much no customization for your character other than your first time creating your character. The issue has never been the performance and bugs. The issue has always been the completely missing systems that were advertised prior to release. The negative reviews at launch were 100% warranted, but this game is average at best. The bugs weren't the issue for me, it was the emptiness in the world that ruined it for me."

The character creator is boring and under-equipped considering that customizability is meant to be the point of the transhuman future, and frankly is one of the things I find most disappointing. Your options are limited, you can't control your body shape, the tattoo selection is boring, you have no ability to choose cyber limbs, or any of the other cool features that you see on NPCs, like exposed mechanical elbows or glossy skin tones. Also, the fact you can't change your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character design once you get out of the creator ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sucks. They could have just paid a dozen furries for a couple of months and they would have built something 10 million times better.The majority of the skill tree is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ +x% to stuff; the combat feels (to me personally) as uncanny valley - not as loose and terrible as Fallout, but certainly not smooth and precise (although, to be fair, i just could be not good at it). The item system is grindy and the customizations are fine, i guess, but could be better.Hacking is fun, I did actually enjoy that part.As for the campaign, there's a pretty bug 2-hour long quest with a bunch of cutscenes and stuff you *have* to do to get out of the starting area into the rest of the game. This is the biggest thing hindering my replays - I do not give a ♥♥♥♥ about redoing Konpeki plaza. Once I did it once, every new iteration was boring. Having do redo the braindance ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ again, and then Konpeki is just tedious.The politics are also tedious. Obviously, people have a variety of opinions within the game, but they're just so shallow. All of johnny's impotent rage feels hollow, and since no-one else in the game really expouses any criticism of the world they live in, despite the obvious flaws. Not does the world feel politically well developed - it doesn't do a good job of showing abject poverty, or corporations trying to extract every single credit or dollar or whatever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ currency the game uses, or really communicating the collapsing nature of the planet they live on, or the ways in which technology enables people to oppress people. Dan Olson's breakdown of privacy with crypto is a really good example of what they could have explored, for example. I overheard two cops in game talking about how they're rolling out mind-scanning tech and the other officer saying 'well i have nothing to hide' and it never came up again. Cyberpsychosis is also a poor way to model the impact of cybernetics disconnecting people from everyone else; but that's hardly CD Projekt's fault, so much as an issue with the original setting. I don't know how much the writers researched beyond the source material, but there is so much more depth and complexity that could have been explored within the game. Finally, the world - I feel like this world could really, really benefit from layered environments. Trying to get to the Arasaka float is actually a good example of how this was done right, in specific places. But this game really deserves the level of detail in vertical mobility that dishonoured or assassin's creed have,  especially once you get the double-jump legs. There is a considerable lack of environmental hazards which would really do a good job of selling the posioned nature of this city, and just a lack of crowding - if they had of crowded the city more with buildings then maybe they wouldn't run into issues with rendering NPCs, while really being able to sell the overpopulated nature of the city.Overall, CD Projekt tried - they really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tried. But they ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crashed and burned so hard, like a studio-sized icarus. They bit off more than can chew, even for a studio that really has successfully made some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ huge games before. I really hope they manage to fix some of these problems, or, if that's not possible due to the monumental cluster♥♥♥♥ they find themselves in, release a decent suite of mod tools. You know, the old Bethesda route - if you can't make a decent game, rely on the players to fix it for you. Fundamentally, a game like this thrives on customizeabilty, and they just failed to do that.If you have the cash and like triple-A games, try it out; otherwise don't bother. Your time is better spent."

Also, unlike in any other great RPG, there is zero sense of natural progression in this game.The game fast-forwards through the most meaningful parts of an RPG and let's you have almost anything you want without having to earn it through gameplay and character development.The open world of this game is beautiful but it's very superficial. To me it feels like a glorified loading screen for quests. It lacks a lot of basic features that other great open world games (not necessarily RPGs) have had for 15+ years. It's ridiculous. I can't believe it.Even if they manage to make this game playable by fixing most of the bugs it currently has, for me it will still be a mediocre game at best. It doesn't feel good to play, and the story is not engaging me too much or making me want to play it anyway just to see how it continues.I just can't believe that the NPCs and the vehicles have literally no AI. Police can't even drive cars and they spawn on foot right in front of your face. The wanted system is useless. All the vehicle rides are scripted. In the racing side quests the other cars literally teleport behind you if you leave them too far behind. And they slow down A LOT if you're losing.Every enemy is a bullet sponge and shooting at them feels like ♥♥♥♥. Why do developers keep making enemies like this!? It's not fun at all! Keep weapons powerful so that they feel good to shoot. I understand this is an RPG but they could have just made the weapons hard to use (like for example adding movement to the camera, so it's hard to aim), and then remove those effects via character development and progression.There's tons of more stuff I don't like about this game that I could talk about all day, but I'm tired of it. And sadly I don't think any of that stuff will change in the future. It would be too much work and the game was simply designed this way.A big disappointment."

This reason is obviously the anticipation created in the pre-game audience. The expectation was so high before the game was released that Cyberpunk 2077 managed to turn the eyes until December 10, the release date of the game. Thus, this PR before the game led to positive and negative situations. We can say that the record number of pre-orders given by the audience before the game was released was actually an indication that the PR was very effective. This created expectation and the attraction of the trailers from afar were the most important reasons for the success of the game. But as I mentioned, on the other hand, we can say that CD PROJEKT RED, the producer company, was a kind of ""hoist with one's own petard"". Because a certain audience, who had great expectations, did not find the game as good as they expected, and this naturally caused disappointment.In this article, I will try to explain my own experiences and the positive and negative aspects of the game in my opinion, from an objective point of view.The game takes place in a fictional city called ""Night City"", which we can say is above today's standards, beyond our time (2077). According to the game story, the original name of the city is Coronado City; However, after the death of businessman Richard Alix Night, known as the founder of the city, the city began to be called Night City.There are 7 districts in the game named Westbrook, Badlands, Heywood, Pacifica, Santo Domingo, City Center and Watson.You start the game by choosing any of the profiles of nomads, street children, or companies. No matter what resume you start your character with, your character's name is ""V"" and other people call you by that name. Our character is a mercenary. You complete the given tasks with expertise and gradually increase your reputation in Night City. Personally, I would love to be able to make more choices about our own character's past, but the options are very limited and it is not possible to manage this scenario according to our own taste. However, depending on which of these 3 options you choose, you make a different start with a story. It's not just the stories that have changed. At the same time, the attitudes of other characters, maybe even NPCs, are linked to your character's background. For example, a nomad may be seen as oppressed and despised by the public when he is outside his camp; The street kid profile leads to more intimate conversations and recognition by people in the area where you grew up, and some of the dialogues really make the player feel like they grew up there and are one of those people.Although we will not be able to make detailed touches on our character's background, at the beginning of the game, it offers us a detailed selection page to create our character's appearance. Thus, we can design the appearance of our character according to our own tastes. I can say that I never got bored while playing the main story of the game. While playing the main quests, new calls for side quests are constantly coming, so you are never idle. It is possible to find really enjoyable side quests, they do not change the course of the main story, but the characters that are included in the main story but are no longer your business can ask you for help. Of course, it is up to you to ignore or help. Apart from these enjoyable side missions I mentioned, it is possible to find side missions that I can't really enjoy, that have no purpose and logic, and sometimes repeat each other. Since I didn't complete all of the side missions, I don't know how many hours it will take as a result of playing the game to the last level. However, as a result of completing the main story completely and doing some side quests, my story took about 25 hours in total. I think it will take 60-70 hours maximum if you do all the side missions. As I said, I was very satisfied with the story. But I wish the main story was a little longer.Another issue that disappointed me is that the choices presented to us are not very effective in terms of influencing the story. Our game is called an RPG (role-playing game), but whether it is really a role-playing game is open to discussion. As there are choices that affect the main story; Unfortunately, there are options that we cannot intervene in the event, no matter how hard we try, and are presented to us as decorations. However, some of the choices you make towards the end of the game can directly change the ending of the game. The roleplay part of the job comes into play more here. It is among the most talked about that the game has an optimization problem in general. If you are not playing on a powerful enough system, it is possible that the details of the characters do not load for a while and they are seen as inanimate beings made of cardboard, the appearance of some objects is really seedy and you may encounter some similar situations. I hope it is something that can be fixed in the future. Because it is a fact that there is a difference between low graphics and high graphics options. Especially this difference can sometimes make the image of the same character in different graphic options unrecognizable.If we leave the optimization problem aside, the atmosphere in the game, Night City, fascinates people. Cyberpunk 2077 has a really thoughtful and beautifully detailed open world. Apart from the missions, you can freely roam the city. You can shop for weapons and ammo, and buy new clothes. However, the fact that we could not shape the vehicle we have according to our own tastes was one of the situations that disappointed me. I do not know whether this detail will be added in the future, but if it does, I can say that it will be good news for many players, including me.While walking around Night City, you are likely to encounter gangs and even groups that clash with the police. If you want, you can fight with the gangs and defeat them and confiscate their belongings and if you find them, their eurodollars (the currency in the game). When other members of the same gang see you at another time, they may recognize you again and try to attack you. You can also help the police by attacking groups that clash with the police. Of course, it is up to you to ignore and continue on your way. Speaking of conflict, you can gain new abilities with certain points that our character has in the game. This will improve your hacking skills. If you do not want to use technical skills such as hacking, you can advance your skill development in a different direction and upgrade your weapon skills. I really enjoyed the combat parts. As someone who likes FPS (First Person Shooter) games, the feeling of hitting was enjoyable enough to satisfy me.CLOSING:This is my general criticism. There will be those who participate or those who do not. However, if we come to the issue of whether the game is as legendary as it is praised, or as disappointed as it is criticized; I liked the game. I don't think it deserves to be slandered so much. But it still had to go a long way to become a legend. There are a lot of bugs that need to be fixed and there is a clear optimization problem in the game, it's a fact. The story overall is enjoyable, but short. For a game released under the label of ""Role Playing Game"", we have very little authority to direct the course of the story. Side quests get very repetitive after a while, and after a while, it starts to become unsatisfying. Also, what happened with the PS4 version is really sad and a big mistake that needs to be corrected. For this reason, I believe that Cyberpunk 2077 is an unfinished game yet. I can definitely say that it is a promising game if the calls of the players are heeded and the game is enriched with more details."

To be completely clear, I cannot get the game to stutter or lag, its just running smooth through all the alt+tabbing, steam overlay spam and whatever ... +230 hours without a single crash... I can just do whatever I want with my PC in the middle of playing the game... With that, it goes without saying I can only call this top notch quality, despite the globally terrible launch, which is kinda surreal to me... the few bugs i have encountered are all minor. Game boots up superfast and loads savegames in just a few seconds. So far,  I just simply cannot join the mob that is currently ""bashing"" the studio  (...and perhaps rightfully so, given the issues some claim to be experiencing). Everything is 100% over here on the tech side, I hadn't expected it myself. About the game itself: Its just pure freakin incredible. The world is ridiculously beautiful, very well designed and hits the cyberpunk theme just as it should. Pondsmith is a creative genius and the mastercraftsmanship on CPDR's side is once again just flat out unbelievable. Translating intellectual property, vision, concepts and ideas from authors and creators over to video game code at this caliber, CDPR remains the monster it has proven itself to be with The Wild Hunt at minimum. This game is definitely carved out of the same material as W3, and with time, we will probably be getting some nice addtional content at the same level we could expect from the studio's former flagship title. I'm quite excited to see what the future brings our way in form of additional stuff / ironing out a few ""rather unripe"" mechanics/systems...I also absolutely have to add, that this game already has the best easter eggs I have encountered in any game/movie/series. They implemented a wide variety of those and they nailed them...They seriously are a lot of fun! My favorites have to be the 3 seashells from Demo Man, the AI from Portal and of course Grove Street. There are just so many Easter Eggs to be made for this game and I could imagine a few that I have in my mind could really actually be ingame. :DSo there you have it, if you grew up during the emergence of the cyberpunk theme, love it, and always thought the world just needs more of this theme, there is zero chance you will be disappointed by this title. I'm still looking for the sockets in my head or neck because the immersion this game slams on you is UNREAL. Thats me at least :P If you cannot respect the level of detail and the level of ""GO IN HARD"" which CDPR WENT IN HARD with, on the theme, design, atmosphere & setting, than color me baffled but thats one brain dance i am not gonna take.

The price tag.3. The amount of bugs currently.2. The amount of times they pushed the release date.Unique settingInteresting storyGreat voice actingNot afraid to show gore and nudityGraphics, somewhatChoices seem to matter and have impactLackluster stealthLackluster hackingLackluster driving Lackluster parkourLackluster meleeLackluster gunplayLackluster customization (clothing)Lackluster looting, yes, looting.Now to go into depth on the above.The game is set in a world unique to me, I havn't seen a game quite like it, it really reminds me of Altered Carbon (a series) which I enjoyed watching so the world instantly dragged me in, along with the story which is also one of the main reasons I will be finishing the game despite the flaws. The voice acting is superb, the only one I don't really like is V's (male) but it's not too bad. The game isn't afraid of a little nudity and gore which is refreshing, gives it a little more realism when it isn't trying to blatantly hide or ignore those things.The graphics looked nice, not the best but passable at the very least. The first game I played with RTX on and it runs smooth enough, only time I experienced a drop in frames was when I died and respawned, dropped to 15-30 fps for a couple seconds until it went up again.I liked the dialogue options that gave different solutions and playouts of events and conversations, and required you to level up certain skill trees, not unique but it seemt more impactful here than in other games.The stealth is next to impossible with enemies being spawned with their backs facing a wall/obstacle or being placed in a way that doesn't allow for a takedown without being spotted 9/10 times, not only that but it forces you to stand up when you try to stealthkill which makes you announce your position whilst you have to choose to knock them out or kill them, and then let the animation play out, which is always the same basic animation, which has made stealth for me, an otherwise 100% stealth guy, resort to the guns blazing option.Hacking was also a chore, it's really just a time-consumption, there's no point. It takes too long, and it barely does anything for you except when you want to open a door or get some points, theres no point distracting enemies or blinding them, takes way too long to get any use out of it.Driving in the game is horrible, I don't understand why every game gets this wrong but alas, another game that makes your vechicle drive with soap for wheels.The parkour is uninspired, rushed and if you want to go dying light style and climb up buildings and jump across apartments then expect to fall through the map alot.Melee was a dissapointment, you'd expect a game where your arms are literal metal to have really cool melee combat but no, 3 stock punching animations and a couple melee weapons, yes weapons. Metal arm doesn't do the job. And for some reason if you pull out your fists you do tons of damage but hitting the quick melee button with your gun out is the equivalent of poking the enemy.The gunplay is servicable at best, enemies are bullet sponges, none of the things in the game that does damage actually feel like they do damage, except melee, but good luck not getting tired of that.Clothing. Maybe the simplest part of the game, has no purpose being there. What you wear is dictated by the stats it has, unless you want to purposely handicap yourself. There isn't an option to just pick a style or cover up what you're actually wearing with something else that looks nice. You're forced to look like you just put your clothes on blindly, thank god you aren't in third person or appear in the cutscenes.Looting is infuriating. Either you will be spamming Tab to get a hint at where items are for about 2 seconds, and then repeat that whilst spamming F, or you'll be rubbing your character up every square inch of the map whilst pressing F.And when you finish doing that you can have some fun time in your confusing inventory trying to find what you just picked up for 10 minutes.I also want to sneak this in here, when you alert the police 2-4 will spawn right next to you and gun you down. This happened to me three times and now I've just decided to completely avoid the police. And I'm not sure if this is unlocked later or not but you can't stealth kill the police either so you're forced to alert them if you want to free a citizen, which then spawns extra police next to you instantly.Also sound, sound is inconsistent and all over the place. Voices from people far away are played as if they were next to you, this goes for pretty much any sounds, not just voices. Sometimes sounds won't play at all.All in all my thoughts are that the game is too ambiguous, too many features crammed into it that barely function, shame.I won't bother mentioning the bugs since they'll be fixed within a week but just know there's alot, and you shouldn't be buying this game yet anyway, even if there were no bugs.With the release date pushed so far and so many times it is unaccetable that this is the state of the game, therefore ultimately; Get the game on sale."
873,88,Jon Umber,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jon-umber/,126,5,1,494.3,"Posted: December 17, 2020",409,0,1,https://avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/8d4c0351c5242b262abcf596342390264f5786b5.jpg,"The amount of ridiculous, false criticism I've heard regarding Cyberpunk 2077 so far is astonishing and depressing. It most definitely is. There's ample roleplaying to be had here, and not limited to just whether you want to play stealthily or in open-combat.They most definitely do. I've replayed several story missions and been surprised by how much they change in general, but also by how the game recognizes small things such as reading a single e-mail which grants you a dialogue option with a character who's hiding something later, or asking a minor question which ends up raising suspicion of a snuff film compound you are later tasked with infiltrating, causing them to add more guards patrolling the perimeter.Stealth is good. So is shooting. Driving is fine. All three are far better than I anticipated for a game developer making their first game ever to utilize those features.NPC AI complaints aside, this is the best open world I've ever seen in a game, especially from an art direction and level design standpoint. It looks gorgeous, feels real, and features an endless number of carefully crafted nooks for the player to explore.I grew up just outside of New York City, and I've spent a lot of time there throughout my life. I know what a big city looks and sounds like, and Cyberpunk's Night City is the first video game city that truly feels like a real city does. The most minute of back alleys feel lived-in. Different cultures melt together, creating unique architecture, shops, NPC chatter, foreign language ads. There's detritus scattered about, clutter on fire escapes, empty bottles on back-alley porches. Nooks and crannies fold into each other, overlapping and intersecting. It bleeds realism, but at the same time, doesn't; the first time you see glowing, neon advertisements which stretch upwards into the sky, or see airborne vehicles zipping through the air, you'll know you're in a science fiction setting. It's just the right balance of realism and fiction; enough to feel familiar, but at other times, utterly foreign. It's a joy to exist in such a surreal place. Despite this complexity it never manages to feel overwhelming or too difficult to navigate.The detail in these areas is top tier. The environmental artists and level designers have created extraordinary spaces which satisfy both your brain and your heart; they appear to be real, logically, while also satisfying your heart's desire for an aesthetically pleasing place. I can't say enough about it. Walking through the city and taking in these spaces and grasping the stories these level designers are telling you just with a few pieces of clutter never gets old, and it subconsciously heightens every other experience I've had with the game. I may be deep into a story mission, focused on what's happening with the characters and how to stealthily clear this next room, but I'm also subconsciously noting what this person's living space is telling me about them—what kind of food they eat, the clutter indicating that they might be depressed, old framed army photos of them and their friends long passed. If you enjoy games for these sorts of carefully crafted spaces—the Bioshocks, and the Dishonoreds, for example—then you're going to adore it in Cyberpunk.Nearly all of the Main Jobs, Side Jobs, and a significant portion of the Gigs are high-effort, compellingly written stories, including some of the best characters written into a video game in years. Their production values are extraordinary; the standards in acting and animation in this game are higher than any video game has ever accomplished before. No exaggeration. They bring these characters to life, and although the city and the narrative is at times horrendously dark, these characters regularly bring light and joy to it. The missions themselves constantly put the player in interesting circumstances and always ask questions of them: How do you judge this person's crimes? What does identity mean? It gives you the means to affect not the world, but the characters you spend time with. You cannot save this world—it's already doomed. But you can save some of the people in it.Attributes, Skills, and Perks. Guns, Gear, Cyberware. Cyberdecks, Daemons, Quickhacks. The amount of systems in place, and the layers involved in each system allow for absurd amounts of depth and customization in the way you play the game. There's lots of synergy and how you spec your character is often mentioned in dialogue.I expected CD Projekt Red's first go at first-person shooting to be a sub par affair, but shooting feels surprisingly great. The unique reload animations which begin to proc as your skill with a weapon type increases always does a lot to heighten the experience. Once you begin receiving iconic weapons and skilling up a bit, everything hits an entirely new level. It feels fantastic and guns' sound design is amazing.Gushing aside, there are several things Cyberpunk 2077 does really excruciatingly poorly.Crafting is nearly completely broken economically. It's far too expensive to upgrade the gear you currently have. I was often forced by necessity to chuck aesthetically pleasing gear for a clownish, neon green, plastic monstrosities. The player ends up endlessly swapping out their old gear for new gear in this fashion because of how broken the crafting economy is. It also has the ill effect of making their character appear to be a complete clown with ridiculous, mismatched clothes when they might rather appear to be street-savvy, or a professional operator. The opportunity for roleplaying with clothing is thus completely lost due to this system's failure.The UI is also a mess. The way shards are sorted is particularly awful. I've currently got nearly 100 in two separate categories both titled 'Other'. It's impossible to locate shards by name because they aren't sortable, nor do they default to sorting alphabetically. If a shard pops up on screen, you'd better press 'Z' immediately, because once you have to search for it by navigating the menus it's pretty much gone for good. Even more severe is the fact that the quest log features utterly unhelpful blurbs, sometimes just one sentence which tells you nothing. If you set a quest down to do later, you'll often be completely lost as to where you left off. The only bugs I encountered through my 100+ hours thus far are minor graphical glitches, such as a character's cigarette getting stuck in the air, or my player character occasionally T-posing out of the car when I drive fast. I recently played Assassin's Creed Valhalla and that game was far buggier than Cyberpunk 2077. I haven't experienced a single crash or soft lock with Cyberpunk 2077, yet I experienced numerous such issues with Valhalla.So, yes. Cyberpunk 2077 is a flawed game. There are some systems and design choices here which either simply do not work as intended, or are broken in some fashion. But don't believe all the hate on twitter and /r/cyberpunkgame. This is an absolutely incredible experience and a top notch RPG. If you're a fan of games such as Deus Ex or Fallout New Vegas, chances are you'll really like Cyberpunk 2077. But if you have any doubts whatsoever, just wishlist it and wait for the devs to add more to the game, to patch it up, and for modders to have time to release mods.This game feels like the launch of Fallout New Vegas felt in 2010; a fantastic, ambitious game marred by its broken launch on consoles, and its rough edges and bugs on PC. And, like New Vegas, in time I'm confident general consensus will view this game as one of the best ever made. For me, it's already firmly in that pantheon.Feel free to follow  if you like my reviews."

I LOVE it for sure. The many stories in the game is well written with many interesting characters to meet, and Night City is amazingly built with so much details and cool designs. Very fun to explore the different districts in the big city. The graphics is stunning but it demands a good machine to run in higher settings. I play most in medium and low graphics setting but it looks great even so. (Spec: i7 6700k, GTX 1070, 32 GB DDR4, SSD installation, @ 1080p)It feels like you are living in the future when riding around in Night City. Great sci-fi atmosphere. The sound is also really good in CyberPunk 2077 with matching cool music. You can go in stealth or full guns blazing in the missions. The gunplay feels good and you can upgrade weapons, clothes and even your body with cyber implants to get an advantage out in the dangerous world. The bad things i can say about this hyped game is the bugs of course. The game has crashed several times for me also but then i installed the newest Nvidia Drivers and now it runs better but i still experiencing freezes and crashes. The other bad thing about CyberPunk is the driving mechanics which truely suck's donkey balls ((:::EDiT 1::: Not ""DK Balls"" but not that good feeling. I got used to the cars a little. Bikes is really bad though)) ((:::EDiT 2::: Actually there are several cars that has much better driving mechanics. The car you start out with is terrible and also every bike but many other cars is fun to drive.))I wish CD Project Red would have made the driving feeling like the one R* made for Grand Theft Auto 4 from 2008 which i love. Even GTA 5 from 2013 has better driving than CyberPunk has. At least the cars. The motorbikes is horrible in GTA 5 even. Maybe the traffic system in Night City could be better also. The other cars don't behave correct and they often drive when there's a red light.Anyhow, i really recommend this sci-fi action RPG made by the Polish studio CD Project Red. Now is the time to smash the bugs and optimize the game as fast as they can.///Score: 9.5 of 10"

Lackluster ""RPG"" elements. A very visually beautiful world filled with good gun play and in my opinion very good main and side stories. Other than that this game blows for $60. Some of the jarring cons that personally stood out to me and what I can think of at the moment:-Lifeless NPCs with nonexistent AI. -You'll see 3 of the same NPC model within literally 5 feet of each other and all NPCs saying the same 5-10 voice lines. -Vehicles have a pre-set path so if you blocked them or try to shoot the drivers, they just stay there or the driver gets out of his car and runs. They don't even bother to drive away. -Police can't drive cars. They infinitely spawn right next to you no matter where you are. Wanted level doesn't event matter-Half of the keybinds in game can't be changed. Why would you put dodge on double tap and not be able to change it? THERE'S ALSO NO UNARM BUTTON UNLESS YOU DOUBLE TAP THE ALT KEY AND CHOOSE IT FROM A WHEEL.-The sensitivity setting sucks-Minimap is too zoomed in when driving. The amount of times I missed a turn because of it is insane.UPDATE (still one of the MANY things that I have experienced):-Can't customize character AFTER character creation. There are no barbers or any way to change your hair.-Can't customize car and there's no garage.And this is all hidden by the fact that for some people, the game is actually unplayable. Many game breaking bugs and glitches. I'm one of the lucky few that have experienced no crashes and only 2 instances where I had to reload a save to fix the game. All the other bugs were merely visual. This game is also very unoptimized. The fact that I have an i7 4790k, 32 gb ram, and a 2070s and it still runs, to me, overall ♥♥♥♥ is crazy. Changing to low setting nets me like 3-5 fps which doesn't help at all with all the stutters I get, especially when driving around Night City."

I am a sucky driver in anyone's book, but I'm getting the hang of hacking and getting better at the combat.  The story is spectacular!

Some encounters I sink several clips into enemies and can sponge a lot and in others I basically get one-shotted. Its not always clear why and it doesnt always feel natural. to be fair witcher 3 was sometimes like this also-  Tie quest giving calls more to progression, and perhaps let you grab them earlier if you go talk directly to fixers. I got absolutely bombarded with new quests in the first 30% of the game to a degree that it was also immersion breaking- the clothing system works badly and you always end up looking like a total clown. It needs dyes or something at least to let you create a decent and coherent appearance (since its 1st person tho I understand why this got less prio). - link crafting upgrades somehow from inventory screen. It took me too long to get into crafting upgrades and it would be easier to spot if it was indicated there when things could get improved- Give Squama more screen time!"

Developed by CD Projekt Red, the game is set in a dark, dystopian future where players take on the role of a cyberpunk mercenary who is trying to survive in a world of corruption, violence, and advanced technology.One of the standout features of Cyberpunk 2077 is the ability to create your own character, customising their appearance, abilities, and playstyle. You can equip your character with cybernetic enhancements that allow you to do things like slow down time, hack into computer systems, and enhance your physical capabilities. The game also offers a wide range of upgrades and enhancements that allow you to further customise your character to your liking.As you explore the sprawling, neon-lit city of Night City, you'll encounter a wide range of characters, each with their own unique personalities, motivations, and stories. The relationships you forge and the choices you make will shape the story and the world around you, with multiple branching paths and endings to discover.In terms of gameplay, Cyberpunk 2077 offers a mix of first-person shooting, driving, and hacking, with a heavy emphasis on player choice and freedom. You can approach missions in a variety of ways, using stealth, combat, or hacking to achieve your objectives. The game also features a robust economy and crafting system, allowing you to earn money, buy and sell goods, and upgrade your equipment.Since its initial release, Cyberpunk 2077 has received a number of improvements and updates aimed at addressing some of the game's technical issues and improving the overall experience. These updates have included improvements to gameplay mechanics, bug fixes, and visual enhancements, among other things. The game also includes a variety of free additional content, such as new weapons, customisation options, and more.Cyberpunk 2077 has undergone numerous patches to fix bugs and performance issues, starting with emergency fixes in Patch 1.1. Patch 1.2 was a massive patch that introduced in-game changes, while Patch 1.3 added more fan-requested changes. Patch 1.31 was a minor patch that brought visual improvements, while Patch 1.5 was a massive patch for the launch of the game on next-gen consoles. It reworked many aspects of the perk tree, combat AI, driving, economy, and added new features like changing appearance, buying apartments, and fleshing out love interests. Patch 1.6 was the last patch for last-gen consoles and introduced new weapons, Gigs, appearance customisation, and cross-progression. It also launched REDmod for managing mods on PC.Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 is an ambitious and immersive game that offers a deep and complex world to explore, with a compelling story and memorable characters. While the game's initial release was plagued by technical issues, the updates and improvements have helped to address many of these problems, making the game a more enjoyable and polished experience. If you're a fan of open-world RPGs or cyberpunk fiction, this is a game that's definitely worth checking out."

To be honest, I really didn't cared about it much, I wanted to see how the game is now... and I have to tell you, that I'm flattered.First of all, the game has issues, like when the script sometimes doesn't go forward in certain situations, or the physics is weird most of the times, NPCs and vehicles doing silly things and appearing from thin air, a few times interacting is pain and of course, the driving is abysmal in the game, however you can get through all of them, find some kind of easy fix and you can also get use to the driving, too. It's not perfect indeed, but on the other side it has a great story, lot of interesting side missions and gigs, game mechanics which makes the gameplay more complex, the graphics looks amazing even in lower quality, and the soundtrack is fantastic. It's worth to explore Night City and not just focus on the main story missions, because you can miss a lot. Maybe the game deserved those criticism back then, I don't know really and don't care either, but playing it now is really great and I can't wait to see Edgerunners, because of it. There is no question that you should buy this one, even for the full price."

The open world mechanics are top notch and there is almost always something to do on the map. Furthermore, we have a large number of different game paths to choose from, all of which give you a very own experience of the story. Combined with the hundreds of weapons, augmentations, upgrades and side missions, there is plenty of material that will last over a long period of time. Cyberpunk 2077 will definitely be remembered as one of the most significant titles in the history of gaming media."

A big disappointment if you expect a next-gen, futuristic GTA 5 clone with this game. It wasn't, and not Jesus second coming after all the hype. Aside from the dumb NPCs AI & glitches in the game, I see why many people are perceiving this as a complete s**t and garbage, starts comparing it with GTA and other games - if it wasn't because of the delay, the marketing behind the mega-hype as a game of the century, it would be just another fallout 76 or no man's sky at most.  The main quest, the storyline & the detailed open-world city are the only things the game shines right now - which I enjoyed so far, but everything else is in limbo and need to be fixed. In fact, that's the reason why I didn't give it a thumbs down; because being someone who enjoys good narrative-driven RPG games; it deserves a spot for the amazing storyline they put in the game; a Bladerunner type in a dystopian world with remarkable detail. With all the hype it's not perfect but I think it is not that bad either. I have enjoyed the quests without getting bored easily - even the side quests are unique and brilliantly crafted into the game. Voice acting is good but not a masterpiece, but really interesting characters that are suited for the main & side quests. Braindance is another great game feature that adds a whole new depth playing the main storyline. Inventory management, customization & crafting feels a lot similar to Outer Worlds. You can sell junks, disassemble parts and craft them to make a new item or upgrade other items in your inventory.  An array of weapons to customize & upgrade and the weapon's animation was smooth and has great attention to detail. Again the level of detail in the game's open-world city is something I have never seen in a long time - a dystopian sci-fi, mega-city genre. That's the only good thing that makes up the absurd amount of bugs/glitches it's throwing right now. It seems that the dev didn't have the time to make it a complete game like what it suppose to be, so yeah those thinking that this is a next-gen GTA clone, in a sci-fi open-world sandbox game will feel ripped-off paying full price, otherwise just enjoy the shallow but immersive open-world city without much interaction to do. However, if you like narrative-driven RPG games and the rest comes second, you surely gonna enjoy the hell out of it. Unless you had enough playing games like Deus-Ex many times maybe it won't entice you that much, but the detailed dystopian mega-city is a complete exception when comparing it in the same genre.Is it worth the price now? No. Maybe wait for the sale or best to get it in a few months when it is patched with all those issues completely addressed.7/10"

For example i had a non lethal build, killed nobody and limit myself to the base implant to stay human as much as possible but it doesn't change anything at the end of the game so why bother, just be a killing machine it's more fun... Chosing a path was a really good idea but beside giving you some dialog options it did not much, it's sad. The game is really beautiful and immersive and the build possibilities are great. The map is not as big as it seems even with verticality lots of buildings are not open, obviously it's not a problem, the world has a lot to offer but it's always frustating to see a closed door that leads nowere. The main quest is too short imo, side quests are awesome so don't pass on they're adding a lot to the game story.Bugs wise, yes it's very buggy but it's not unplayable, it's just immersion breaking.AI is very basic and broken, it's very hard to do something realistic in term of ai behavior but i'm sure that can and should be heavily improved in it's current state. Overall the game is very good and will get better and better with future patches / extension but disapointing on some aspects that were advertised. It was a very nice journey but short and with a bitter sweet after taste of ""it wasn't ready yet"". I still recommand it, i don't regret my purchase and will wait for improvements."

So I can highly recommend the purchase.The atmosphere, characters, the plot, the Night City itself (especially at a night time (how surprising, huh?)), everything is beautiful. Decent amount of builds to play around - you can be a hacker, a stealth player, shoot everyone around, slice everything that's moving with you katana, etc.As some people have already mentioned - your choises do not have any consequences except your endings, but there're some important side storylines that you'll like for sure, I promise.People say this game is a buggy mess, but on release there were few hundreds of thousand players and atm the game has steam online around 20k players.P.S.

The graphical settings are mostly related to Volumetric fog and shadows. Even on the lowest settings possible I barely get 30~40 fps. I have a GTX 1060 6 GB which comes under recommended spec for the game, but they don't mean anything nowadays. Surprisingly it never crashed and despite the low fps, it doesn't have any micro stutters.These are all the problems that I could find in my hour and a half of gametime, there could be more that I'm not aware of.Deus Ex fans such as myself can enjoy playing this game instead of waiting for the final part of Adam's trilogy as I can already see some similarities such as mail interfaces, stealth, etc. in CPI'm sure CDPR will fix these issues in the coming days but until then, If I were you I would avoid the game because it ruins the experience.

That game was a purely fake demo created solely for hype. This game is an incredibly bad attempt to imitate that game made in a short amount of time by a small team of inexperienced devs (many of the best devs at CDPR already having quit before getting a chance to work on any game other than  which was OBVIOUSLY not made by the same people who made this garbage-fire of a product.)This isn't ; this is  which is to say, a low-effort, second-rate knock-off rushed out to cash in on hype for something else (which in this case was a fake demo for a game which didn't actually exist.) This is literally the most disappointing game I have ever bought... and I wasn't even expecting it to be good. As you can see from this group I created before release, I thought that this would be a mediocre AAA game that wouldn't even measure up to Far Cry.... and I was still incredibly disappointed.(BTW, if you bought the game hoping for adult content, you are REALLY going to be disappointed. In my time in the game, the closest I came to a love scene was being able to see these fully-clothed middle-aged housewives dancing in the window of a locked building I couldn't even enter.)This doesn't even measure up to the worst of what you would expect in a AAA game. This is basically a terrible indie game that isn't even as good as a number of indie games like  and  which I literally purchased for less than $1.I actually made a list of good indie games, most of them dirt cheap, and Cyberpunk wouldn't make the list even if CDPR were a plucky indie dev because it would be an insult to compare anything that is actually good to this low-effort abomination.At this point I am going to cut to a video which does an exceptionally good job of explaining why you will probably have more fun installing the game than playing it. I have played open-world games since Morrowind and GTA 3 and this is the most barren, lifeless world I have ever encountered. A cramped spaceship full of zombies like in Dead Effect feels more interesting than a city of drab, minimalist buildings that you can't enter and are thus effectively just an ugly map painting while procedurally generated NPCs literally pop into view with AI so bad that they actually make the city feel LESS alive. To be frank, you shouldn't have traffic in a game in which you can't be bothered to give the cars the ability to change lanes or back up. You shouldn't put NPCs that move into your game if they just walk back and forth aimlessly with terrible animations in a way which emphasizes the fact that they are NOT people or indeed, even smart enough to survive as earthworms.You should NOT put a wanted system in your game if your police AI is literally too stupid to follow the player (something that better games managed on the PS2) and NO you cannot work around that by making the police magically appear behind the player and shoot him in the back of the head while at the same time, every door and elevator in the city stops working to prevent the player from taking cover inside.This was obviously NOT made by the same people who made The Witcher 3 (many of those people joined to work on this game, found that CDPR wasn't actually making it, made the Witcher 3 instead and then quit in disgust at how badly CDPR's game development was being managed.)The quests in this game aren't good enough for a modern MMO much less a single-player RPG. That isn't hyperbole. The last quest I did in  (Mistress of the Lake) was more open-ended (allowing the player to choose a side leading to one of two very different follow-up quests) more interesting, and felt more meaningful than ANYTHING I encountered in my more than 12 hours with CDPR 2076.In CDPR 2076, the game starts out with dialogue and choices so pointless that I found that not only did my ""choices"" not make a real difference; they literally didn't even affect what people said to me in some cases. The only good memory I have from this game is being able to pet an ugly cat in an alley... and the game took even that away from me by making that cat disappear after the boring mission was over.If CDPR didn't finish the game, why should I? I HAVE finished plenty of other games including multiple entries in  all but the most recent expansions in  etc. I did NOT finish  and that game is FAR better than this one.This game is so bad that I can spend literally hundreds of hours in other games but can't force myself to endure more than 12 hours of this blatant rip-off.If you are thinking of buying this game, try  (with the latest mods it actually looks and sounds better than  or any one of the other literally hundreds of readily available games that are better than this one. This isn't even the best RPG on GoG. In fact, having this game on GoG is an insult to most of the other games that are sold there.There's only one good thing to do with this game..."

It also doesn't do anything new. Once I finished the main story and a few side quests I had absolutely no desire to play any further, or explore any further - and I am someone who loves seeking out every inch of a game world, collecting every collectable, and completing every side quest. Valhalla is holding my attention significantly more than this game did.Gameplay was ok. Shooting was ok. Most of it was just ok. Nothing stood out. Melee was incredibly shallow. I spent most of the time playing with the mantis blades and there's a massive collection of ONE single execution animation and it throws a cog into the flow of combat, which became annoying very quickly.Animations are terrible, especially when a character dies. They seem to like to stick a leg up in the air for some reason, and turn incredibly stiff.There's a video on YouTube I watched today that inspired me to write this. It's basically a comparison between Red Dead 2 and Cyberpunk which highlights an array of differences and how each game displays/performs each feature. It truly highlighted how mediocre this game is.Better luck next time CDPR, hope the next Witcher game is a significant step up from this."

While it's not perfect, it's well done. Unfortunately, this is only the case if the game is working. I ran into an issue today where I could not load my save files, or my screen would just go black and never load the game. I waited over 30 mins just to be sure it wasn't loading incredibly slowly. I took to the internet to figure out what my issue was and noticed tons of people were having the same issue. After trying all the various things people suggested, it still didn't work. Eventually, I just tried loading older saves until a save like 7 saves back finally worked and I lost over an hour and a half of progress. Not only that, but I've had MULTIPLE missions completely bug out on me making them in-completable, leading me to have to restart them. That's not even mentioning the dozens if not hundreds of graphical glitches that constantly occur giving me a new crazy thing to laugh at every couple of minutes. In a full price $60 game, this is un-acceptable and I can not in good faith recommend this game. Wait 6 months to a year at least for this game to come out of beta. This game has huge potential and I will update my review when/if the game ever gets to a stable state and when/if I beat the game to give my thoughts in more detail.The game when everything is working- 8/10Game in current state- 4/10"

From certain  point of view I liked it a bit more than The Witcher 3 - map is not as big, which is a huge plus for me, and it is a lot more colorful: neon signs, ads, NPCs with all sorts of clother and chrome, gangs, markets... Main story, however, is a lot shorter! At least it felt that way for me, but hey, that's just me - I would love to be in that town a lot longer. But don't get sad just yet! The hours lost on the ""short"" story have been compensated with map exploration and character side quests, which are a MUST since they are well written and interesting.  soundtrack is a blast too! I still can't believe they hired Refused band to make few original (and epic) songs. You can lose hours just listening to radio in your vehicle.What surpised me the most, however, was the fact of how smoothly the game ran for me, on semi old PC. All I had to do was drop my resolution to 1920x1080 and I could use mostly high settings! So you could say I was one of the lucky ones.I really hope they will add more content, and not just DLC story - I'd love to see customization packs (full on chrome body, lets go!), more vehicles, additional map content (like bounty hunting). And I hope to see the day of Multiplayer!Overall, the game itself could use more POLISHing (ding) and I don't see what would stop them - The Witcher 3 had similar issues at start, but they worked hard on it. Hope they will make an optimization gem out of this one too.If your PC can run it, you should definitely play it. So plug in your cyberware, put on your leather jackets, we got a city to burn!PS. , thanks for this game, I had the best week of none stop, sleepless fun!"

You can do a lot of missions without touching your guns, perfect for a scaredy-cat like me. You can also approach a mission in many ways, open the door by force or using technology skill, going from the front door or climbing on top of the roof,...

This game is absolutely amazing in every single way. Visuals are breathtaking, story seems amazing, soundtrack is JAW DROPPING, combat is really good, stealth works well, rpg elements are intense and in depth. so far, best game ive played  for around 6 years. no doubt. buy it and realise.Edit: After playing for 40 more hours after my initial review, i can safely say this game lands in that ""special"" category. It just has that something special. Walking around the city with the sound cranked up and graphics tuned up, absolutely breathtaking experience. its NOT without its issues, but most people are acting like the game is just straight up bad because of issues a lot of other less impressive games get away with ALL of the time. Yes it has some problems, but im certainly not  going to be able to say they even remotely ruined my experience because thats just shallow and pathetic at best and straight up trolling at worst. Glitches and dull NPC AI does not make this game even close to being bad. Because if we were judging every game off its launch state and bad AI, almost every game to release ever would be ""terrible"" as some people so happily and readily say about this game, with 0.5Hrs play time logged on their account. All i'll finish with saying is, do NOT allow any of the negativity deter you from buying this game because i guarantee you, if your PC can handle it at settings YOU can personally accept and enjoy, and you like RPGs with immersive settings, then there is absolutely NO WAY you wont have a good time with this game. Anyone telling you otherwise is speaking out of the dark place between their lower cheeks. People giving it negative reviews after playing 30 mins are the same people that expect the game to run well on xbox one hardware lmao.  GET A BETTER PC MY FRIENDS. it's extremely demanding. Dont try to run it at settings that make it a bad experience and maybe you wont have a bad experience.EDIT NUMBER 2: After having played MANY MANY more hours of this game, reaching 100 percent completion of the content, i have slightly changed my opinion on how glowing a review i would give it. My goal was always to hit 100 percent, did it on each Witcher game. This game, unlike the Witcher games, fought against me EVERY step of the way. Countless crashes, completely broken quests, losing hours of progress multiple times, glitches that slow progress to a halt and many, many headaches. I finally achieved my goal, with sheer perseverance and many work-arounds, i finally got there. Instantly uninstalling the game after doing this felt like a weight off my shoulders, which is a very bad thing. I do also have that usual feeling of accomplishment when completing a behemoth task such as this, akin to Witcher 3. However i am also left with a dirty taste in my mouth, which is a shame. I won't edit my initial reviews and edit, because i want people to know the ride they're in for if they plan on investing a considerable amount of time into the game. It starts out like ana amazing honey moon period, deteriorates into something akin to a 20 something years old marriage, warts and all. Would i still recommend this game? Absolutely. If nothing else, for the AMAZING story alone. And i do mean amazing. However, if you're like me, enjoy getting sucked into a universe, bleeding it dry for content, maybe that recommendation would change. Just consider whether or not you want to sacrifice your initial enjoyment of the game for the achievement of saying you've beaten all it has to offer. Wish i had, but hindsight is 20-20 as they say. How were we to know the game would be this broken. We only had the Witcher series to go off in terms of expectations, and well, this game is a far cry from the quality of those in terms off polish and performance. Story: 10/10   Graphics: 9/10   Sound: 9.5/10  Gameplay (bugs considered): 7/10  Gameplay (at face value):  8.5/10   Performance and overall polish:  4/10."

I must admit I enjoyed this game more than I expected it. Pros :+ Various playstyle options. You can play this game as a netrunner (hacker) or a ninja or a madman with a gun. The game offers you to use your own preferred play style and they're all fun. Consumers love more options.+ Great story. One of the strongest selling points from this game. I am not going to elaborate here, but I love the narrative.  + Great characters. IMO this is what I like the most, the main characters are well written. There are some characters that always gets me excited when they're on screen. + Great voice acting. IMO female V sounds amazing and her voice fits to the narrative. Also, don't forget we have Keanu Reeves and he did an amazing job as Johnny Silverhand.+ Interesting side quests. Even though some of them are disturbing. + A lot of weapons available in the game. What I really like about weapons in this game is that they don't feel copy and paste unlike other shooter games.+ Ray Tracing and DLSS support. Great for RTX graphics card users.Cons :- Bugs still exist. T-pose and characters passing through walls. - Somewhat short main story line. You could complete the main story line only within 1-2 days. But that would be much less enjoyable unless you hate the game. IMO you need to play all of the side quests in Cyberpunk 2077 at least once. - Meh physics for a triple A title.- Night City feels not so lively. The NPCs don't really feel ""alive"" unlike for example Red Dead Redemption 2. - Game performance is not something to be proud of. It is cpu and gpu demanding. Conclusion : Even with the lackluster physics and existing bugs, it is very much possible to enjoy this game. It is a great game and I really enjoyed it but I wouldn't call this a flawless masterpiece (only in some part but not overall)."

It's a mix of sadness and anger and regret The games writing deserves the award it gets and i hope the DLC will continue V's story. Night city takes everything from you and you definitely feel it, The tragic story of V should be experienced and played. The endings of this game did not pull any punches. This was a human story with true-to-life conclusions. The end credit tunes punctuated that perfectly - beautiful and harrowing.No matter what ending you get, even the one where you leave Night City with a slim chance of hope, the consequences follow you - and may still consume you yet.Night City always wins.The customisation is very good. Making your own character is lots of fan and you can truly embrace the cyberpunk look. This game has changed in a very good way and CDPR have kept their promise to improve it. I truly hope we get more of V as its a heavily complex character.Critics can say what they want. This was a phenomenal game and a great effort by CDPR. The scope of it is huge and the side quests are nothing like Ubisoft open worlds. They all involve doing something different. If only Ubisoft spent this much time on their AC series instead of cobbling together the familiar revenge plot main story with totally irrelevant and repetitive side quests to pad out the play time their games would rate much higher. I really hope CDPR bring out the extra time they said they cut as DLCs. Seriously. Go listen to the soundtrack of this game and truthfully tell me it doesn't feel like someones taken everything from you. The music while talking to Johnny, The credits theme and then going onto Never fade away. On top of that What AAA Game touches suicide? This game touches on suicide and the consequences of choosing that. What happens to the people around them? What happens to your friends after you've gone. How will it make people feel. CDPR have huge balls to cover that very sensitive topic and it's not shallow in anyway. You feel the weight of a characters suicide and the characters feel the weight of- if you choose it; your own suicide. What a masterpiece. I could go on for hours about this game but i'll leave it there.10/10Goodbye and never stop fighting, I'll be waiting for you, V."

Completed my 1st playthrough and just the main storyline after so many people were trying to spoil the end. This game is not disappointing at all. Every game has it's bugs and glitches, so besides that, this game is truly amazing in all the aspects. Story is good, Graphics are good, Music/soundtracks are good, Voice acting is good, Has many memorable characters, the game is packed with so many little things to do and hardly saw 2 same npc in a frame. The details are eye catching, Don't know about RTX but even without RTX I loved the lighting and shadows and reflections.On the serious note, this game is far away from a perfect game. Story is good but really doesn't feel great. Open world is filled with so many details and npcs but they all are just there as eyecandy. The AI is terrible and gameplay is super easy that even a 7 years old kid can play it. The story feels rushed and could've made better with character building and something worth fighting for. The awesome characters and voice actors did their job so great that you almost don't pay attention to other things. As a fan of Single player game, this game surly does feel good to play for fun.Even after so many years of development there are many noticeable bugs are present in game, Which I am sure in next few updates will be fixed. This game is worth the wait and price IMO. 7.5/10 for me. Will give 9 if they fix the bugs.Specs - i7 6700k @ 4.5GHz  , GTX 1070  , 16GB ramSettings - High/Medium @ 1080p........... 45-55 FPS avg.UPDATE - After the Reddit user's performance fix, I got 20-30% boost in overall performance on High settings. Smooth gameplay, fast loading and no crashes."

I wanted to be a believer. I wanted to be part of the hype crew. I wanted to hang out with Keanu and do some Cyberpunk ♥♥♥♥. I wanted this game to be the end all salvation for all of gamekind. I wanted this game to be the *one* and we can retire from our lives during COVID. I joined all of you at the end of the hype train. My only hope is that Internet Historian will review this game for what it is... But enough of me... This is about *you* right? That's why you're here. You're wondering why you pre-ordered this game. You're wondering why the world around you doesn't make sense? It's okay friend. MacDaddy is here for you.I won't spend too much time on bugs because the meme material on YouTube makes Fallout 76 look like the most successful launch game of it's time. They exist. If people tell you they only exist on consoles they're lying. Granted the PS4 console gamers have already committed Seppuku (Peace be upon them) and the PC version is not as buggy that doesn't matter. The bugs are game & immersive breaking. Let's talk about the game itself. Let's pretend the bugs never existed because that's all that people talk about is bugs bugs bugs. If I could summarize this game in the least exhaustive way possible... this would be it: The game consists of you doing nothing but grinding from one side mission to another. You will have MORE than your fill in side missions, bounties, and police situations. That's your immersion. That's all you're going to get. You could easily clock 70 hours of grinding these boring side missions. This is how this translates to me... the developers had to ask themselves how do we immerse the players into our Cyberpunk environment? How do we get them *involved* in the world and to bear the consequences of those decisions? SIDE MISSIONS! They developed this elaborate, beautifully crafted city and the only thing worth doing are these boring side missions. This is their way of pulling you into the world. If you get the itch to stop, and decide you want to shoot a few pedestrians with that newly modified gun of yours... better think again... get prepared to have an army of cops spawn LITERALLY on top of you. Every time I wanted to break the linear boundaries of the game (side missions / main story line) I was severely punished for it. The game was telling me this is not Cyberpunk is meant to be played. Why even make an open world game at all? You will not experience GTA like chases from the cops. You will not experience a gradual wanted system that pulls you deeper into the world of the game. You will have an army of cops spawn right on your head and end all the fun for you.Why even have a WANTED system at all if we can never engage with it? The WANTED system means instant death... yeah sure you could bug out the cops and drive around the block and *poof* they're all gone... you could walk into a building, and walk out and *poof* they disappeared!  What is the point of that? I want the cops to chase me, I want a fighting chance, I want to be a Cyberpunk in Cyberpunk. But it's not just the wanted system... comparable to GTA this game lacks every successful immersive element Rockstar has going for their games. Why is this important? Because Cyberpunk had the opportunity to not only build upon those elements, but deliver something far more fresh and advanced. You won't own properties in Cyberpunk. You won't be able to store vehicles and customize them. Even driving vehicles in the city is janky and unrealistic. You won't be able to customize your character's look outside the introduction menu. GTA is a perfect control in our thought experiment here regarding the immersive elements (or really lack of) that Cyberpunk offers. There is nothing that PULLS you into your character and game apart from these missions. I can't even believe they're entertaining multiplayer without addressing the lack of immersive features. Besides the mentioned features... what about the NPCs? The NPCs that exist in Cyberpunk are nothing more than filler people. They are an illusion made for you to believe you are playing in an environment filled with life and activity. I was convinced of this when I first started playing. As soon as you begin to interact with the NPCs all that immersion falls apart so what do you do to stay immersed? Don't interact with the NPCs at all! There is a great YouTube video showing the comparison between Cyberpunk NPCs and GTA found on 'Bearing Game Asia' YouTube channel and I highly recommend you watch it. To summarize my thoughts here... the game is OK as linear questing experience. Side missions will sort-of keep you occupied, and having fun (kind of). It's just a shame you are doing these side missions in an empty world. The main story line is fun and engaging. The cut scenes are great. The game is visually pleasing all around. Otherwise... as an immersive open world experience? This game fails completely. So when you factor that all you have left to do is drive from A to B in an empty bug filled world that leaves you with a very mediocre experience. You'll snab a few 'wow' moments where the city visually encapsulates you but you won't enjoy that experience once you interact with it. 'Look but don't touch' should be the gameplay motto. Here is my advice to those of you on the fence... Wait. Sure they'll clean up the bugs eventually, but that won't be enough. Wait for the modding community to get involved and invested. If an open world world experience isn't important to you than go right ahead and purchase Cyberpunk. Otherwise think of all the amazing ways the modding community expanded the immersiveness found in Skyrim, Fallout, and GTA. My hope is that the community will revitalize this game as it was meant to be played: an open world role-playing environment."

While Cyberpunk 2077 is a very good game, you must have a high end PC as of 2020 (for me, an i9-9900k, a fast NVMe SSD, and a 3080) to be able to appreciate the visuals with good performance.Of course, there's also lots of visual bugs, but as of the time of this review I have not experienced a single gameplay affecting bug nor have I experienced any crash. I've seen probably a half dozen T-poses, and a fair number of flickering objects or things that pop out of view when they shouldn't. But nothing that has hampered any element of gameplay.The world is beautifully realized, delivering fully on a full 3D explorable world of the likes of Blade Runner, Back to the Future 2's future Hill Valley, and other 80's visions of the near future. The design is nearly impeccable. No name NPCs occasionally look far better than main characters of other contemporary games. It looks that amazing. It also poses absolutely cutting edge technology with raytraced reflections, shadows, and global illumination simultaneously.However, the depth of the world experience isn't equal to other, smaller-scoped games. You won't find a lot of interesting, worthwhile secrets. You won't find mini games. The arcade units sitting around aren't playable. You can't strike up a conversation with a random, awesome looking NPC. When you're not on a mission there isn't a lot to do.The missions are mostly excellently designed, each offering moderately sized Deus Ex-like microcosms. Most have multiple different physical, dialog, and tactical routes. This is where the meat of the fun from the gameplay comes from. The polish on the missions varies, ranging from reasonable to some of the most polished experiences in a video game to date. That said, the polish is indeed spotty, some missions leaving you disappointed and others enthralled.Mechanically, most of the systems are engaging and interesting, except firearms can sometimes be very dull. The firearms experience being the weakest mechanics of the title, there are ways to make it more fun. However, the driving, melee, inventory, crafting, equipment, leveling, dialog, and other systems are all more engaging and add more to the experience.Cyberpunk 2077 isn't my favorite game of 2020, it's not profound like Disco Elysium, it's not up to par with the original Deus Ex. That said, provided you have a great PC, it's one of the best games of 2020, and the most vivid video game realization of a cyberpunk world yet."

It certainly does however that depends on your expectations. In my opinion it is the most promising open world RPG up to date bringing a lot of attention to detail for the world and its design which I have not experienced in previous triple A titles of this scale. Your eyes will be delighted upon your first visual contact with Night City; neon lights lining every street block making you relive classics such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell at least that's how my first impression was. It truly looks next gen if you have a powerful enough rig to max it out as ray tracing here is more than a gimmick, first implementation to impress me and many others. The art direction isn't fully photorealistic but that's for the better as it would never fit Cyberpunk's world, instead the mesh of colors establish the futuristic immersion. Intro is determined by your chosen life path with diverse characters for each choice adding a lot of different dialogue options throughout your journey in Night City enhancing the RPG experience. First contact with Keanu Reeves aka Johnny Silverhand seemingly the story's main attraction will be when finally your character's shackles are severed and you can reign free & forge your ultimate legend reputation in the merc world instigating fear towards biggest corpos. Love him or hate him, the charisma he brings is what causes the character to feel relatable and realistic from the beginning up until the end. As per usual CDPR delivers colossal amount of top notch side quests with varying degree of difficulty, ways of approaching & morale impairing compromises that are never easy to conclude. Monotony is wholly absent when you let yourself be absorbed and  along the waves of rich entertainment present as unwrapped packages.My first thoughts when seeing the skill trees were how much of a Deus Ex Human Revolution experience I can transcend - indeed you can very much mimic its authenticity through stealth and violent fighting alike. Combat as of now I would categorize it most polished, it feels very solid whether you're going classic guns blazing or a more closer approach razor neck massage to anyone standing in your way. By the time you advance end goal you are going to be fully kitted with your choice of build, enjoying the impressive and dynamic arsenal of an elite cybernetic soldier. I personally went on do or die mantis blade route hack 'n' slash away every single thing that moved within my  which at times felt troublesome to execute on hardest difficulty but the gratification was very much so worth it. Replay value exists strongly thanks to all the crazy customization of wealthy skill tree so don't hesitate to experiment on your first playthrough you will find your niche regardless. V's lack of customization diversity is probably my biggest dislike since I love to glamour my RPG characters most uniquely, standing out from the NPC crowd and whatnot. Music from the radio while driving can definitely be memey although they're all selective and varied to please everyone's tastes; OST & sound design don't need be mentioned they've spared no change on its quality, precisely atmospheric fitting all locations and situations. All characters in main storyline are depicted with exclusive traits, diverging backstories and emotionally linked to ideals shaped by their traumatic struggles since childhood, conflicts within your perspective of Night City shall clash continuously like a raging hellfire. And by far I enjoyed female V's voice acting the most through all the interactions she gives off incredibly deep & raw emotional attachment to the people she enjoys company of and not only, romance option you've made shines like sun rays because of how much you feel immersed into it. Overall it does have its negatives but they're contained by the positives so don't lose focus and enjoy the exceptional attention to detail brought by devs in this universe, which in my opinion isn't anymore present than few titles I could count on fingers in recent past. It could have been so much more, I'm sure in due time it'll achieve its initial promised prestige up to a 9.5 or even 10 score, however for now it can't pass beyond an 8 out of 10.[]- graphics & retro futuristic art style- solid gameplay & build paths- sound design & OST- top notch voice acting- very high replay value[]- performance & bugs- missing & broken features"

For the first time in the company's history, the developers dared to play a game that was not set in the Witcher universe. Instead, Cyberpunk 2077 goes in a completely different direction. A futuristic setting that emerged as a sub-genre of science fiction in the 80s. For example, many people are familiar with the film Blade Runner. During this time, the pen & paper role-playing game ""Cyberpunk"" was created, which, especially in its version entitled Cyberpunk 2020, served as a template for the game.So you can say that cyberpunk is a dystopian vision of the future of humanity, in which huge corporations rule the world, the transplantation of technical components into the human body is the order of the day and the gap between rich and poor has reached enormous proportions. In this brutal world, you slip into the role of V, a mercenary who tries to make a name for himself in the metropolis of Night City. It is up to you who exactly V is. Before creating your character, you choose one of three life paths. These determine the background story and origin of your character. For each path there is an individual introduction to the game, similar to the Origin stories in Dragon Age: Origins, which with around 30 minutes of play time are by no means as extensive. The origin plays a role again and again in the rest of the game, affects dialogues and V's behavior.The introduction to the world of Cyberpunk 2077 is quickly told and I try to keep it short: First of all, repaired the car, lubricated a border post, eliminated strange pursuers - and somehow I'm involved in something in Night City that I don't quite understand yet. Even my own character, a nomad in search of happiness, is still a little strange to me. The biography is so far vague, the game world exotic, but I'm already smuggling very dangerous things for shady guys. So after four hours I feel like I'm in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up neon fair with bizarre characters. I haven't really arrived yet, everything is just building up. The background story? Somebody probably made a biochip that promises eternal life…So you suspect that very powerful people will show a lot of interest. But in my role as a mercenary, I'm first of all a greenhorn who moves into his place. The fascinating potential already flashed, even in small scenes: If you e.g. Open the blinds in his apartment and look at this colorful hustle and bustle of Night City. When you then go downstairs and disappear into the crowd between all the individually designed women, men and children. Or when you gossip with your buddy over noodle snack, rotate the camera freely in ego view and soak up this coolly designed city with its neon advertising and freaks strutting by.But the best moments are provided by the dialogues with the important characters: Apart from the fact that they are well animated, so that a lively, almost intimate atmosphere is created, there is situational tension at the highest level: You are currently talking about an aggressive customer the payment, while you look around freely and see danger lurking everywhere. In the background you can see a figure who is more and more interested in the conversation. At first it comes slowly, then quickly, and suddenly the situation escalates...With your answers you influence the following dispute, sometimes with the clock ticking. You can either kill yourself, convince your counterpart, depending on the talents you have developed (grayed out, you can see unavailable options due to values ​​that are too low) or master a direct kill. If the big guy named Royce survives, however, there will be a boss fight later. This openness and these dialogue scenes, which are also available on a smaller scale, will be the salt in the roleplay soup in addition to the intrigues and factions in the background. And right here, in the staging of the conversations, CD Projekt RED shows clear progress over The Witcher 3.+ Greetings from John Wick and Blade Runner+ Keanu Reeves+ gripping / dark story+ good scope+ beautiful night city+ terrific art design+ matching soundtrack+ fantastic dialogue system+ Decisions that have an impact+ many weapons and upgrade options+ Achievements and Trading Cards- many bugs still floating aroundCyberpunk 2077 is a delightful mix of Grand Theft Auto, Deus Ex and a breeze of vampires: the masquerade has become. In summary: A role-playing game that you will never forget and who knows the Witcher series already knows what I mean. Clear buy recommendation. Cyberpunk 2077 ist ein First-Person-Action-Rollenspiel, welches von den Machern um CD Projekt RED (The Witcher) entwickelt wurde. Man kann also sagen, Cyberpunk ist eine dystopische Vision der Zukunft der Menschheit, in der gewaltige Konzerne die Welt beherrschen, die Verpflanzung von technischen Bauteilen in den menschlichen Körper an der Tagesordnung ist und die Kluft zwischen Arm und Reich enorme Ausmaße angenommen hat. In dieser brutalen Welt schlüpft ihr in die Rolle von V, einem Söldner, der versucht sich in der Metropole von Night City einen Namen zu machen. Wer genau V ist, liegt dabei in eurer Hand. Noch vor der Charaktererstellung wählt ihr einen von drei Lebenspfaden aus. Diese bestimmen die Hintergrundgeschichte und Herkunft eures Charakters. Für jeden Pfad gibt es einen individuellen Spieleinstieg, ähnlich der Origin-Stories in Dragon Age: Origins, die mit rund 30 Minuten Spielzeit aber längst nicht so umfangreich ausfallen. Dafür spielt die Herkunft auch im restlichen Spiel immer wieder eine Rolle, wirkt sich auf Dialoge und das Verhalten von V aus. Der Einstieg in die Welt von  Cyberpunk 2077 schnell erzählt und ich versuche mich kurz zuhalten: Erstmal die Karre repariert, einen Grenzposten geschmiert, seltsame Verfolger eliminert - und irgendwie bin ich in Night City in etwas verwickelt, das ich noch nicht so ganz verstehe. Auch mein eigener Charakter, ein Nomade auf der Suche nach dem Glück, ist mir noch ein wenig fremd. Man ahnt also, dass sehr mächtige Leute sehr viel Interesse zeigen werden. Aber in meiner Rolle als Söldner bin ich erstmal ein Greenhorn, das in seine Bude einzieht. Das faszinierende Potenzial blitzte schon auf, auch in kleinen Szenen: Wenn man z.B. in seinem Apartment die Jalousien öffnet und auf dieses bunte Gewusel von Night City schaut. Aber die besten Momente liefern die Dialoge mit den wichtigen Charakteren: Mal abgesehen davon, dass sie klasse animiert sind, so dass eine lebendige, fast schon intime Atmosphäre entsteht, gibt es hier situative Spannung auf höchstem Niveau: Gerade spricht man mit einem aggressiven Kunden über die Bezahlung, während man sich frei umschaut, überall Gefahr in Blicken lauern sieht. Im Hintergrund erkennt man eine Gestalt, die sich immer mehr für das Gespräch interessiert. Erst kommt sie langsam, dann schnell näher und plötzlich eskaliert die Situation... + John Wick und Blade Runner lässt grüßen+ Keanu Reeves + fesselnder/düstere Geschichte+ guter Umfang+ wunderschönes Night City+ grandiosen Artdesign+ passender Soundtrack+ fantastisches Dialogsystem+ Entscheidungen die Auswirkungen haben+ viele Waffen und Upgrade Optionen+ Errungenschaften und Sammelkarten- viele Bugs noch im UmlaufCyberpunk 2077 ist ein reizvoller Mix  Grand Theft Auto, Deus Ex und eine Brise von Vampire: Die Maskerade geworden. Ich sag nur, dass Spiel hat Hitpotenzial und wer die Witcher Reihe kennt, der weiß schon was ich meine."

What happened to calling it an RPG and now suddenly changing it to an Action-Adventure?AND WTF WAS THE POINT OF GENITALIA CUSTOMIZATION IF IT SERVES ZERO PURPOSE IN THE GAME??????This game is such a dumpster fire..."

While it may have had a rough start for some, I feel I had a relatively smooth entry to the game, small glitches here and there however nothing to the point of ""game breaking"" or frustration inducing that I feel they ruined it for me at all. At Ultra settings the game is beautiful, the city feels alive with all the people, cars and noise and I enjoyed quite often just running/walking down the streets of Night City checking out every nook and cranny to see what amusing things I could find. The story in my opinion was fantastic and I give a lot of kudos to the voice acting in the game because it was really great (Male/Female V's voice acting was my fave). After all that I can't wait until the game is patched to the point that everyone can enjoy it to the highest degree, can't wait to see what the future holds for Cyberpunk 2077 and it's DLC :)"

I think I can write this now:SHORT: The game is not without faults, but it is an amazing achievementLONG: The world and lore that they created is amazing. Yes it is a little rough around the edges, and yes there are some bugs that will cause some aggravation, but overall my experience has been fantastic. 160 hrs in three weeks means that they did something right.The true areas of genius are the open world, the side quests, and the graphics. There are so many different ways to approach the different challenges that there is some decent replay value. The challenges are the bugs, the lack of some open world staples from GTAV and others, and the disastrous previous-gen console release. The bugs I can understand. It happens with a game this ambitious and they are quickly patching the worst. The lack of some expected features I can live with because of the large expansions and patches they have already announced for the coming months. It is obvious they are devoted to fixing and expanding the game. The real failure was in the console release. Someone high up decided for the cash grab and released the game on the previous gen consoles, and that should have NEVER happened. The game looks and plays awful. There is no excuse for that. I understand why they did it, and I understand that it had already been delayed several times and their hand was forced a bit.....but it just should not have happened. Absent that, I believe 70% of the bad press would have evaporated. But here we are. All that aside, the game is a blast. It needs some balancing and rework of some of the perks. It needs some polish to the NPC spawn-in. It needs more depth to the characters and world. It needs the sync between the voice files and animations improved. It needs more content and lots more customization options for clothing, housing, and vehicles. And yet I put 160 hours into the game in three weeks. I recommend it. Play the game. Immerse yourself in the world. Do the side quests. Develop your character fully. Enjoy Night City and all that it has to offer. And above all wait and hope as CDPR continues to improve and develop the game."

It is currently not optimized very well, but playing on a very high end PC makes it playable. This review is based on playing the game on a high-end PC, if don't have one I wouldn't recommend playing the game until it is patched up a lot.Without those issues, the game is very, very good in my opinion. I loved the main story, the bigger side quests and the important NPCs. Those feel very much alive and are one of the best I've seen in any game yet. The perk progression system is also quite good and fun, but not very in depth with very much game changing perks. The ""gigs"" are also just kinda there, they're not boring if you customized a fun playstyle, but they aren't really shining in particular either. It's mostly about the first three points I mentioned: main story, side quests and NPCs. Here's where the game really take it's shine, and you see the love and detail CD Projekt Red also put in Witcher 3. I find it really amazing and that what makes this game really a must play for big RPG fans. Driving works okay, gunplay is okay, hacking is okay, but nothing groundbreaking. What I would love to see is more customization. For example: customize your houses and vehicles, more in depth perks, a transmog system, deeper romance system. Also, the game isn't short, but I would've loved to see more in depth side quests, because they were that good. This game could really benefit for expansions on scale of Witcher 3. I also hope that they also include these feedback points in them. So all in all, if they improve this game more (definitely for consoles), I really recommend it if you love RPGs. The game does really great things in some aspects, and some that are just okay. If they also include the performance issues and the feedback points in the future, it becomes a must have. Definitely a fun game and can't wait what they will do with it in the future. For now, if you currently don't have a very high end PC build, I recommend waiting a bit until most performance issues and bugs are fixed."

I really really like Johhny (the character played by Keanu Reeves). These dialogues between Johhny and the player are just awesome. Also I found . Note on current state of game: I've had a few graphical glitches, like someones mouth not moving when talking, or an NPC just suddenly pop into existence. I've experienced nothing major like crashes or game breaking bugs as some unfortunate souls are describing. For me its all very very playable, though it could definitely use some polishing here and there.Absolutely recommend this game, it's a gem. Finished the game on 1.3; there still were some graphical glitches here and there. But no major problems. Enjoyed game very much. Will replay the campaign again with a different starting story!"

First of all, it looks absolutely fantastic, and I don't even play with ray tracing on with my 2060! Sure, my friends who play on there 30 series cards get a much better visual experience than I do, but I have genuinely never seen such a beautiful game before. The indoor and outdoor lighting is absolutely fantastic and it adds so much to the overall quality and immersion of the game.   The map itself, while not being the biggest, is certainly one of my favourite when you contrast the packed high-rise city centre to the sparse badlands. I can see why people are disappointed with their hopes of a vertical city which there admittedly isn't too much of and, even when it is accessible, it isn't made very obvious.   The story line has got to be one of the most engaging I have played through and it took me around 55 hours while focusing on side quest story lines too. The endings depend heavily on your completion of many side quests and can vary pretty heavily based on this. The game manages to create characters that you become somewhat emotionally attached with, especially Panam and River in my play through. It's so well written that everyone is exactly how they should be. Rouge is the character that doesn't seem to care too much, Panam isn't quite sure what to do with herself and River is the honest cop who's willing to take a risk to do right by his family.   But you can't talk about Cyberpunk without mentioning the bugs. Sure, I've came across a few visual and lighting glitches and T-posing characters, with a few friends falling through the map, but nothing really game breaking. Sure this will vary for everyone playing the game, but I just can't justify all the hate this game gets, unless of course you're a PS 4/Xbox One player.   Overall, I'd easily say this is now my favourite game and I can't see that changing for some time. Hopefully we'll get some more optimisation and bug fixes in the near future, but I'm loving it even without them. If I were to rate this from 1-10 I'd happily give it an 8."

This part is for you. Cyberpunk 2077 is an Open World, Action-Adventure game with . It is a victim of an unstable and indecisive marketing campaign (to extents of palpably lying) and it is a disastrous atrocity for the people who plays this game on their consoles. However asides from consoles the game is also not working perfectly well on the computers too. So, with all of these things out of the way, for the actual game I’d say, it is an okay game with many great ideas and creative work behind it mostly in art and narrative design, but it also has equal amount of flaws too particularly in level design, avoiding dominant strategies and AI (we all saw the memes.) I’d suggest waiting for the upcoming updates and maybe a possible DLC before purchasing the game. I think it should get around 75-80/100 considering all of the controversies it caused and for being a technical mess. That was all for this short part but please stay with me because I have lots of more things to say.Okay so, first of all, ♥♥♥♥ being objective, ♥♥♥♥ all the marketing campaigns, ♥♥♥♥ all the hype it caused for all this time and lastly ♥♥♥♥ the awful console version release.

Expectations were high, but this game is quite a disappointment and not because of the hype, but because of all the lies and deceit by CDPR over the years, not to mention the content that was removed or never existed and yet they advertised it through their gameplay demos. I played through the entirety of this game, maybe missed a few secrets, but that really doesn't change much. It's super obvious there was so much content cut and not because gamers complained that Witcher 3 was too long, but because they were trying to hit their deadline, so they cobbled something together as fast as possible and here we are.Before I even get into the issues that this game has I have to say that the game is not as good as CDPR's previous game The Witcher 3, which was way more immersive, tells a better story, has far better endings, has actual choices throughout the game that matter and was way more consistent as an experience overall. On the other hand Cyberpunk 2077 has a lot of design flaws, it's extremely unstable and buggy at the moment and the whole experience is flawed, but the city does look great, gameplay is fun, story and characters are well done. Keanu Reeves was used well and did a decent enough job.I am aware that even W3 had bugs at launch but the problems with this game go far beyond just bugs, it's the design decisions they've made, they're questionable, so many aspects of this game don't function properly or are just leftovers of the content they cut. It gives me the feeling like there was a reset during development and this was put together in the last two to four years. It feels like Anthem did back when it was released, even though this game is far superior to Anthem and a lot of love was put into it, it's extremely sad that this is what CDPR released to the public. I also hope they cancel the multiplayer version and redeem themselves and focus on expanding the game so it can become a more complete experience as it was promised/advertised, I do doubt that will happen though.Now let's talk about what kind of game did we actually get. We got a game that has a huge identity crisis, it doesn't know if it wants to be an open world game such as ""Grand Theft Auto"" or more like a role-playing game such as ""Deus Ex: HR"" and it doesn't do either as good as the games mentioned. Let me give you an example, they crafted this huge beautiful city and the only thing you can do in this city is NCPD copy and paste missions, where you basically just go and kill a few enemies, loot a box and leave. There are gigs where you have to save someone or upload a virus on a server, but that's not a lot of variety and that's what you will be doing over and over. If you were expecting shops like in Grand Theft Auto where you can preview clothes before you buy them or car dealerships you will be very disappointed, not to mention ripperdocs which install cybernetic implants into your body have only one animation when you first meet them, then you just buy the implants through a very lackluster shop UI. Cars are bought by receiving a quest over your phone, you walk up to a car and press a button to buy it, which is just strange. Not even a person standing there to sell you the car and to talk to you a bit about it, it's just sitting on the parking lot and you press a button on it.I also have to mention that they also removed the 3rd person camera angles when you talk to people, their reasoning was because of immersion, well let me tell you, this basically invalidates any cosmetic gear you are wearing, you will never see your gear except in the inventory, mirror or motorcycle, and it wasn't cut for immersion but to save time for sure. This is yet another flawed system, this game was advertised to be all about style yet every single piece of clothing has stats tied to it. So on a higher difficulty you want to get the gear with the best stats, so you will equip the most powerful gear but look like a clown. On the topic of immersion, when you think of W3, you go to a quest board, you pick up the quests, find the farmer/person that posted that quest, you talk to them, and then you solve their problem. In Cyberpunk 2077 the immersion is quite weak, you are spammed by people on your phone every time you make a turn, everyone just magically knows where you are, and most of them all immediately know when you are finished with the quest to call you again, so you don't have to go and talk to anyone face to face, a few quests actually require you to go talk to the people that hired you, these are usually the side quests, which in a lot of cases surpass the main story in quality. In my opinion, meeting face to face is the smart thing to do, considering how information control is a problem and how everything digital is unsafe in the cyberpunk universe.The advertisements were also about how Cyberpunk 2077 is a mature game, but you won't see much of anything when it comes to nudity, this whole aspect was a marketing scheme, you can select your genitalia, but it plays no role in the game at all. When you compare it to the entire game it's really out of place, it's also very jarring when you open your inventory and your character's junk renders first and then the clothes pop in afterwards. I've also had random characters show up, fully clothed on a stage dancing like strippers which was hilarious.I have been able to hunt down all achievements and see all endings and I have to say the ending variety is also quite poor, there are seven endings that you choose from and when it comes to choices, this is probably the most impactful choice in the game, almost every other choice is an illusion of choice. What I will never forgive is how CDPR lied about origin stories, how you can pick one of three origins for your character. Remember the trailer when you see your character dancing with your friend Jackie in a club or how you go buy guns with your buddy, yeah guess what, that is a video montage that also plays in the game. Yes you read this correctly, you watch a montage of fun stuff you do with Jackie within the game as a trailer, the origin stories take about ten to fifteen minutes before they play this trailer within the game. You are watching what you were expecting you were going to play, that was super discouraging and depressing.As the last part of this review let's talk a bit about AI, difficulty and economy. The AI in this game is completely broken. If you attack civilians police just spawns on top of you, they also cannot drive cars at all, so you walk down the street and you are fine, the car chases are all scripted and they happen two or three times in the entire game, yet another thing that was cut. The difficulty curve doesn't exist, you will have a super hard time early game, the moment you get a few upgrades you become a god. The economy is also broken, easy to duplicate money which makes the game way too easy.                 Did I have fun playing this game? Yeah I did.Was my experience hindered by the terrible bugs, AI and design decisions? Yes it was.I lost a lot of respect for CDPR but I still recommend the game, as long as you have a strong PC, don't mind the bugs and you want to experience a cool story, gameplay, world. Just don't expect optional mini games, side activities and/or in-depth mechanics and you will have some fun."

There are multiple references and easter eggs, and most side-quests are unique, though not as well written as the ones in other titles like Witcher 3 or RDR2. Although fairly short, the main quest line is really well written. In terms of graphical fidelity, the game looks really good especially with everything on ultra including ray tracing, and DLSS (if you have an RTX card) is a plus.The game at launch however, is plagued by a multitude of issues which could've been resolved had it been delayed for another year or so. It's really hard to get yourself immersed in its world when bug after bug comes looking for you, instead of you having to intentionally look for them, many of which could've been fixed had CDPR simply even play tested the game. Exploding debris, poor NPC & police AI, duplicate NPCs with repetitive one-liners, T-poses, broken status effects, texture glitches, poor vehicle destruction, non-existent vehicle AI, floating objects, quests breaking, you name it.There's also a lot of performance issues with the game at launch as well as cut features such as character customisation which was heavily marketed prior to launch. (You can't even get a haircut in the game and your choice of hairstyle is permanent after character creation, lol)Don't get me wrong, the game's good, and I'm sure it would be fixed down the line, similar to how Witcher 3 was at launch. Currently though, the game's an 'eh' from me, and I'd skip purchasing it until a year or so later. Will update my review then."

Keep that in mind when looking at the ratio.Anyways, the biggest problem with the game are the bugs and the performance. This is probably one of the most demanding games ever made. If you don't have a card capable of DLSS (20/30 series) you wont be able to play at a decent framerate at anything above 1080p. Even with DLSS and everything on medium/low the game absolutely tanks the moment a handful of NPCs appear on the screen. The game doesn't even look that good, it's just horrendously optimized.Second, the bugs. Nothing too game breaking, but it adds up. The audio issues are the worst. I've had music and NPC dialogue just refuse to play. This game needed another 1-3 months worth of work, but obviously they couldn't delay it again so here we are. idk how they managed to release the game in this state after all those delays but hopefully they iron it out within the next few months."

But that's one pathetic excuse to cut corners on some of the fundamentals aspects of what constitutes ""A Next Gen Graphics"". Take textures for a good example. They look like absolute blurry S*** in 4K except for character models cuz they are in between high poly to low poly. Since most of the time u cant even see urself, so texture quality actually matters a lot. If ur on 1080p, this probably wouldn't matter to you at all but hey, they promised.:A very interesting matter to discuss since I would classify it as both immersive and skeletal. As u might have noticed while doing the quest ""Automatic Love"", the extensive conversations available between V and the Doll really bring it to an unprecedented level. As words cannot begin to describe the insights of desperation, hope, love and fear which coexists on ur abruptly introduced protagonist. It's awesome, it's bloody brilliant, It's tens of thousands times better than TLOS 2.  HOWEVER, with a mere 26+6 main quests, introduces many noticeable and very disturbing inconsistencies and a extremely restrictive field of options and playability. Lets be honest here those 6 endings are more or less the same and they feel rushed, not exploring the plot completely, it's already lacking plot. (they dont explore or expand on the plot in anyway tbh). That's....a shame.In conclusion, I personally wouldnt call this game mediocre. But it surely didn't live up to CDPR's promises either. Its a fine game with a ""cardiac-arrest-inducing-ly"" thick layer of candy coating."

I have some hard feelings for this game for someone who waited like 2 years for this game, can't imagine the ones who waited 8 years. Soo, what should I start with? Right... I'm just disappointed... This game was in development for 7 years. The game got a release date on 16th of April, then got delayed almost 1 year just for us to pay 60$ for the pre-order and then be the beta testers for this buggy mess of a game. I can tell you how many times I fallen through the map with or without a car, how many missions (side quests) I couldn't finished because I wasn't able to interact with what was I supposed to get or do, how many visuals bugs and a few other things more. And on top of that, the game isn't really that optimised either, I can barely play it on low (1440p) with a RX 590, which I usually play almost all games on ultra. And this is on PC, the last gen console guys have it even worse, also playing at 25 fps or below with spikes and crashes on graphics lower then low.  Putting the technical issues aside, this game feels pretty dead really. Yes there are lots of NPC's walking around but that's it, just a pile of NPC's, the AI is ♥♥♥♥. You shoot a bullet and everyone gets to the ground or starts running and begging for their life's, seems like a normal reaction, right? Not really, here we talk about Night City, where almost everyone carries a gun with 'em, so you would've expected more reactions. I'm not even gonna talk about the traffic since is kinda the same thing. And ahh... The police... Besides the police just spawning on you no matter where you are, but to escape them it's even more pathetic, you just gotta drive in a straight line for 100m and ""Ohh, he got kinda far, guess he's not a criminal anymore"". Another thing that kinda pisses me off about this game is the lack of features. Not that there aren't many enough, just that we got led to expect more form ""The future game"", ya' know? Not even be able to change your haircut? Add some tattoos? Upgradeability to the car? Customise the apartment or get a better one? And others features too. I don't even know how they didn't thought of some this, since most of this features are in The Witcher 3, one of the best if not the best RPG game ever made, and it was made by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU! Is just disappointing... Now don't get me wrong, the game is pretty much a let down for quite a lot of people including me, but that doesn't mean it is a bad game, in contrary, this game it's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good if you ignore the bugs. Like, the story is amazing, hands down. It's an absolute blast to drive through NC, mostly if you have the horse power to run this puppy on ultra, I barely even used the fast travels points because of it, plus that if you used them you can lose some phone calls as well. The combat is pretty divers, and I actually found it pretty fun. The skill tree is also pretty well made. And there is a lot of attention put into the details of NC and the scenery, too bad the same attention to the details wasn't put on the other stuff... And there are some other cool features also, but that's it.The game isn't bad, just the marketing over-hyped. For some people this is enough and they enjoy this game a lot, and I can't blame or tell anyone not to enjoy the game, cas I enjoy this game too, is just that I had high hopes as a lot of us had but just got disappointed in the end. But hey, let's just hope this is a No Man's Sky situation and it will get better."

The problem is that the main quest is mediocre (not to mention abruptly short), and so are the open world aspects. The open world activities are entirely cookie-cutter, and sidequests are generally short, disparate affairs that lend little to the tapestry of the game.On a big sale, I might recommend this just purely for the technical aspects. It's a shame that the game itself is so mediocre and soulless."

I am aware there are some limitations but it's all because they used the old engine on this game, the same engine they made Witcher 3 with, so it's CDPR's fault that made fans have very high expectations! I'm not saying this game is bad I actually enjoyed playing it but everyone is angry for the missed content that we were supposed to have. One of the positive things in this game was the soundtrack, Marcin Przybylowicz the same artist who did The Witcher 3 soundtrack worked on this game and it was literally AWESOME! it gives you some good moment like DOOMs soundtracks that made you happy, the second thing is the characters, they all have a good background and they are all interesting, you kinda feel them but on the other hand some character who had the potential was cut out of the game for the lack of time in developing but the remaining ones were good,"
