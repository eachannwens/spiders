Malicious player can obtain a lot of sensitive personal information by use of common mod-menus for GTA Online. Currently Rockstar Games has not acknowledged or addressed this matter via any of their social media platforms, direct email or via a PR spokesperson. Worst thing is that you can fall victim of this without even knowing it. all a malicious modder need to know is your Social Club ID or In-Game Nickname.Rockstar has the means to combat this, but has failed to do so for many years. I will leave a youtube video about this topic here:  and in the comment below this review from GTA V Speedrunner and rockstar fan 'DarkViperAU'. who has spoken with people who have access to these mod-menus/tools and brought it under attention to his following.Personal accounts with this issue:I myself have also fallen victim to this issue. This happend a couple weeks ago as per writing of this review. I was streaming GTA Online gameplay on twitch and via the stream a malicious person saw my socialclub name in the stream and started targeting me, joining my FRIENDS ONLY session whilest not being part of my friends list. masking his name by replacing it with racial profanity and harrasing me with gameplay exploits and other nasties. blowing me up, hunting me down in godmode and finally crashing my game. after that I switched my stream over to a single player game because I already have put one and two together. Thanks for reading. Any questions I will try to anwser. I love Rockstar Games and there games but this is bad beyond believes.EDIT: Here is a link to a guide I have writen a while ago on how to get a 'public solo session' to avoid modders and griefers messing with you. this is the best way to protect yourself currently within GTAO if you enjoy the game like I do and wish to remain playing it.Q: Why do you keep playing a game you dislike?A: I do not dislike GTAV or GTAO, I want it to better.Q: Why do you keep playing a game you see as a security risk?A: I know how to weapon myself against the risk and I still enjoy playing GTAO so I do not quit.Q: Do you have more sources or proof besides the DarkViperAU youtube video?A: Yes, I will update this guide when I get more content on this topic, preferably from different sources. Including:Q: Who cares? Online gaming will always be like this.A: I strongly disagree. while yes, a 100% cheater free online experience doesn't exist I know GTA Online could and should be better. Just look at what the FiveM Community has done, It runs on dedicated servers, has no widespread cheating issues and doesn't save any user data.Q: What am I supposed to do with the information you have given me?A: Whatever you want with it. I want to mainly inform you. the games networking is Peer2Peer and has next to no anti-cheat, creating a unfair and toxic online environment for normal players. with privacy risk, banning issues and so much more. I hope it help you to make an informed decision Edit: Edit 2: Edit 3:"

You'll get your turn.I do not recommend this game until R* gets their act together.Edit: I'd like to add that buying the game for single player is absolutely worth it, but online is simply a mess. It's been 3 weeks now and R* refuses to acknowledge their error, so I stopped playing and caring. There's no point in playing online if R* can steal your legitimate money away at any time. And the irony is that legitimate players are getting hurt while cheaters are unaffected.I will never buy another R* game again and I doubt I am the only one. The way they treat their players is ghastly. Their support desk is insulting. It's all about the money, now more than ever."

( GTA ONLINE )I played it so hard on ""GTA Online"" mode with my dad, where I spent around 300 hours of playtime in less than 2 months, maybe even a month.In time I said above, my character was 107 level, had all guns fully upgraded, had some bussiness, nice cars... etcGuess what ?I got banned for 30 days, because they said that I cheat...!I NEVER used any kind of cheats in any game I or my family paid with REAL MONEY, especially if it is a GIFT!My father spent around 25 Euros for this game in a way to suprise me + 25 Euros to be able to play with me on GTA ONLINE MODE!I was totally dissapointed, I wrote a ticket, and they responded me with their 'robot' message saying me that I used cheats and telling me that I have to wait for 30 days to be able to play again... but from ZERO!BUT HEY! ... I managed to 'survive' without playing GTA V for ENTiRE a MONTH!Then I finally started again, playing only Races in 'GTA Online' mode for couple of hours then quits.Next day, when I turned again 'GTA Online' mode I got a nice BLACK SCREEN with BIG WHITE TEXT saying that my account is BANNED PERMANENTLY from GTA Online!I WAS SHOCKED, again I wrote a ticked and explained the problem,  but they just used their useless 'robot' by saying me that this is their final decision...So from that day, I SWORE TO MYSELF that I would NEVER buy any kind of ANYTHING from Rockstar Games ,and this will remain FOREVER.  I know that you don't give a sh*t about me, which you already proved me with this useless 'robot' Rockstar Support,but with this 'approach' you are losing many your fellow fans and customers.NOW LETS TALK ABOUT A GAME ITSELF :'Single Player' is simply fantastic and there is not anything more to say about it.'GTA Online' mode was simply something best what GTA Series ever had until the end of 2016 year.After 2016, Rockstar became hungry for money by adding so many things which regulary doesn't belong to GTA Series anymore... like flying bikes, WW3 tanks, futuristic guns and other sh*t.This resulted in making this game DISAPPOINTEMENT, by losing all recognizable good sides of GTA Series ( where the cops and criminals was main thing in the game. )By summarizing impressions... I MUST GIVE YOU A NEGATIVE REVIEW, because 2 reasons I said above. ( 1) Your approach to your fans and customers is dumb and useless, 2) You ruined this game with 'updates' from 2017 to this date. )Customers, thanks for reading and have a nice day!"

You're getting what you pay for there.If on the other hand you're looking to play GTA Online I cannot recommend the game anymore. It's fun in theory but the way Rockstar handles stuff is just awful. Not only are they completely helpless with the cheater situation in the game but their attempts to stop them actually hit legit players as well. I've earned quite a good amount of in game cash during one of their double money weeks shortly before the last major DLC hit and Rockstar in an attempt to remove cheated/modded money removed 7 million (thats the equivalent of about 80 real life bucks) from my account. In-game money I had earned through their event. I've contacted the support multiple times only to receive responses that either claimed the money was cheated or threatened to ban me.After about 5 support tickets I gave up. Rockstar Games is scamming their own customers, and that's why I can't recommend being a customer of Rockstar Games anymore. If you already have the game and still play GTA Online I'd recommend doing the following: Go online and search for a cheater willing to give you modded money, proceed to get as much modded money as possible and spend as much of it as you can. Never even think about playing the game legitimately to earn money and for god's sake don't buy shark cards.Cheers."
38,Skrutky,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Qwerthas/,"2,083",226,0,812.9,December,"12,",122,257,1,"Singleplayer is amazing. The story, characters, map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story. - this is the reason why I don't recommend the game, because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong; I used to love it, played over 400 hours of pure online, everything was awesome, I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game, they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff - which has become the problem. A year and a half ago, everything was more or less balanced, the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me: Then Gunrunning. Again, my overall feelings:How I felt about Smuggler's Run:The prices of the content added were skyrocketing, if you wanted to truly enjoy the game, you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack, which is by the way, another big problem with this game, or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long, I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards, so I stopped playing. Since then, I've been ignoring the game, not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes, when I notice that there's an update, I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update, you might think this:The reality, however, looks like this: And as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore, I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers. I finally am thrown into a lobby after 10 minutes of loading, I see that I am immediately teleported to an airport from my house with a couple of other people and I am stuck doing some rather strange animations. I always report the guy when I find out who it is, but it doesn't seem to help. I've heard some heartbreaking stories of people getting banned for no reason, this luckily hasn't happened to me yet."

I've been playing the game nonstop for a past week, making money for a bunker and new cars and in the middle of a game, I just got falsely banned for a month for no reason at all and my character and progress INSTANTLY reset.It's a shame because this is a blast to play with friends, but Rockstar just can't seem to manage ♥♥♥♥ with their own game. They don't try to improve the experience, pushing out a bunch of events that no one seems to care about, releasing new content that require days of grinding and instead forcing everyone to buy their absurd shark cards, which people still apparently get banned for.Another thing which I found cute is that now their support page reminds you over and over no bans, no matter what, may be appealed and are AUTOMATICALLY closed.

Modders and cheaters, the same that have been on the game ever since it first came to PC.This game will forever be garbage because of Rockstar. This review will stay if mine and countless others bans are not overturned.**EDIT 03/29/18 -  A majority of the falsely banned players, myself included, have been unbanned with all of our accounts intact.. to promptly being banned once again with the same response Rockstar had in the beginning of this mess. So good job Rockstar.**"
40,Nite242,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nite242/,"3,558",150,0,205.5,January,"24,",174,357,1,"So in early December 2016 I was grinding hard in GTAOnline during a slow week. I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month.At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final. I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up. At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed. Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it. So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why.Some links."

Came back on to have some fun with an old friend and to check out the new updates. We did some CEO missions and drove around, deciding not to bother the other players and do our own thing. I log off the game. Five minutes later i receive an email stating i have violated the EULA and my account, character, and inventory have all been reset. Years of work. Gone. I decided to give the game another chance after the same scenario had happened to my best friend before the reset was a thing, just to have it happen to me. Don't get me wrong, we had a blast driving around, grinding up enough money to finally buy the vehicles and homes we wanted, then proceed to try the new modes as they came out like the racing, CEO, adversary modes. I saw all these negative reviews on the page stating how people had been randomly banned, and when they brought this up on the forums, they were called ""liars"" and told ""Dont cheat again ♥♥♥"". I thought they were full of ♥♥♥♥ until it happened to me. I have no chance of getting all i've worked for back unless i buy their damn shark cards, and even then, whos to say they wont ban me again? I can say the uninstall button worked better than the anti-cheat, as ive seen countless modders roaming around unopposed, causing hell to other players. Im 90% sure that the majority of answers im going to get for this review are going to be the ""regulars"" who claim everyone hacks or cheats except them, and that i won't be missed. Thats fine. Just note Rockstar, if you by chance read my lovely review, you've lost another customer. I will never buy from you again. It was fun while it lasted but in the end, even i was beaten by a robot with the banhammer, with no reason, or ♥♥♥♥♥ given."

46,Big Bird,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gingersnipe1/,828,30,0,"2,112.1",September,"29,",146,38,1,"Until the last update, I would have highly recommended this game, but sadly I would advise everyone to steer away from this game and any other future Take-Two/Rockstar game. I think theifs is the best way to describe these companies. I can confirm to those of you reading these reviews saying ""surely they wouldn't be removing in game funds that people pay $80/£60+ for?"" that it is really happening. I will split this review into two parts; Single Player and Multiplayer.The story and how it plays out for single player is possibly the best out there. The story is fantasic, and there are very few missions that aren't fun to play. Also, the implementation of an in-game stock market (although not the best thing ever) is really cool to me. Pairing this with missions that allow you to manipulate this stock market, you can earn millions, even billions. But this leads to the issue of there being nothing to spend it on. Singleplayer mode for some reason does not get content from Rockstar's updates. The only way you can access them is by grinding multiplayer for days to afford the likes of one car, however we will get to that. Overall, Singleplayer is absolutely fantastic, except from the fact that after the story there is little to do unless you are interested in mods, in which case you will probably love this game for that.Oh yay, this train wreck. Okay, so I have 1,151 hours on Steam for GTA V, with around 1,000 being for multiplayer. I converted my stats from PS3 so likely have around double that. I know what I am talking about with this game. The multiplayer in this game is absolutely trash now. I was always able to look past the grind in this game, but it has gotten to the point now where money is so hard to make, and things are so expensive that it is no longer fun. At all. Rockstar and Take-Two have become money ♥♥♥♥♥♥, so much so that they are taking purchased in-funds away for NO REASON and will accuse you of hacking the game. If you refuse to purchase the in-game currency (like me), then you will have to grind. Now, at least in my ways, around 1 hour of in game grinding will bring in, at most, around $300,000, and that's if youre grinding really hard, non stop, and have the most lucrative in game businesses in the game. When starting out, you will be lucky to bring in $100,000 per hour, so as you can see, it's a pretty tough grind anyway. The last update called ""Smuggler's Run"" brought some of the most expensive content in GTA Online to date, with things costing $1,500,000 upwards. I had 2.6 million removed from an in-game challenge called Criminal Mastermind that took me months to complete, getting $10,000,000 from. This was removed because it was ""modded or cheated money"". So, 6 tickets to Rockstar later, I have quite rudely been told by a robot to go ♥♥♥♥ myself and that I'm not getting it back, and that's why I've finally decided that enough is enough with this game.Something that I have always found interesting in GTA Online is that you can buy a yacht - a real calling card, with the most expensive one sitting at $10,000,000. The highest in-game currency you can purchase is $8,000,000, sitting at $100 real money. That to me has always seemed ridiculous for what is already a fairly expensive game.Also, if you want to mod singleplayer, thats fine in their eyes (not really since they shut down OpenIV, a company they supported but hey let's let bygones be bygones), but if you DARE go near their money making method and try to make things fun, you will be banned and stripped of everything you have online.This review could go on forever, about a game/company that steals from their fans and shuts down companies who they once directed their fans to, but I think it's time to sum it up. For what was for a very long time my favourite game ever, I would highly recommend that you never go near this game, even if you recieve it for free. I will never touch another Rockstar or Take-Two game, and hope that their next game flops and they learn no treat their fans better, however, if you're not giving them money, they hope you ♥♥♥♥ yourself.Update: Went on today to see if I had been refunded yet, and guess what!! I haven't.Update 2: Left another ticket  to Rockstar asking HOW my money was illegitamate, stating several times that I know that it, according to them, is illegitimate but after my ticket making it to support stage 3 (presumably the highest? Has been in all support companies I know.), guess what happened? I got the same copied and pasted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ response AGAIN. This reponse took them over a week to type."
47,Яussian,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056835809/,"1,101",49,0,"1,070.6",March,"13,",64,63,1,"When I bought this game on Jul 6, 2015, and played it for the first time it seemed amazing. There weren't that many cheaters around, Rockstar weren't pushing their shark cards so hard yet. The amount of money needed to get something was considerate. Like top apartments were $200'000, cars cost hardly over $500'000 and you could easily get your first million simply by playing each heist just one time.Then bikers came out introducing new ways of making money with biker businesses. Which were then greately nerfed after a while. Rockstar began to push their shark cards harder and began to fight the competition they themselves made. That was the first time I noticed Rockstar being greedy and cutting players' income to make it harder for them to grind the money in game making them feel like they need to invest real $$ to get some in-game $$.After that CEO import\export with crates and stolen vehicles came out which, again, at first allowed players to earn some nice money pretty fast. And guess what happened next? Rockstar nerfed the income yet again making it hardly profitable for the players. And at the same time the prices kept growing wild. Like some cars costing over $2'000'000, apartments costing over 1 milion providing no extra features. Hardly useful mobile operation centers costing 1.5-2 million. And shark cards popping up everywhere like a real annoying advertisement in real life.Then in June 2017 Gunrunning came out which was a blast in moneymaking compared to any previous activities and remained the best way to make money in GTA Online for a while. At last I was able to keep up with crazy prices on cars, bikes, guns, and all sorts of customization in game (still taking up insane amount of time to grind though, but at least ""the price was right"")That remained the case up untill late february \ early march of 2018, when I noticed my sales shrank in half. And this time, since it happened recently, I am able to state some real numbers:For a year I was able to pay $75'000 to get a full stock of supplies for my bunker. Which then produced me an amout of guns worth of $420'000 per one sale using a single vehicle. Meaning I had a net profit of $345'000 per one single sale playing solo. And as of today the numbers shrank down to just $210'000 per sale, but I still have to pay the same $75'000 for the supplies and wait for the same amount of time for these weapons to manufacture which makes my net profit $135'000 (down from $345'000). That's $210'000 less than it used to be PER ONE SALE.The exact same thing happened to EVERY DLC activities earlier. I just can't memorize the exact diffirence in numbers for those older changes, but the effect was the same every time. I stopped doing these older missions since they became hardly profitable. And this time the gunrunning is gonna be my next abandoned facility :(Now let's move on to another huge problem of this game: CHEATERS.Rockstar made only one good attempt in fighting modders for real. JUST ONCE. When they decided to completely prohibit the use of any modification for GTA Online, which then resulted in a huge outbreak of negative reviews on Steam which spooked Rockstar to the bone. And they quickly reverted these changes completely removing such protection within a couple days. Allowing rеtаrdеd individuals to keep on griefing on other players using mods.And nothing has changed ever since.This is why I AM NOT GOING TO BUY and DO NOT RECOMEND you to buy ANY GAMES FROM ROCKSTAR in the future.Rockstar used to be a great company making masterpiece games. But they became corrupted by these filthy greedy marketologists, and began to penalize their loyal and honest players with income cuts, crazy in-game prices and long grind times while allowing cheaters and modders to thrive on, completely ruining GTA Online.ROCKSTAR, STOP BEING GREEDY AND MAKE YOUR GAME GREAT AGAIN!"

Grinding the game is an NDA away from being a full time job, Rockstar expects you to spend 60hrs a week on this game. Not to mention the community, the GTA Online community is by far the saddest, most pathetic, cringeworthy, group of degenerates you can find on the internet. The cheating is also a big problem, Rockstar will ban you, but only if you illegitimately acquire money. They'll only punish what threatens their Shark Card sales. The cheaters, or ""modders"" as they call themselves, due to Rockstar's lazy networking and lack of dedicated servers, can remind you of why you gave up on the game years ago in a instant. The game is P2P, in 2021, P2P... you can see the issue. If it were 2015, I'd say give it a try.

Even if bans are final, this information should be provided to the user so they can rectify the issue. To make it clear, my current temporary suspension is a false-positive to my knowledge. I requested further information regarding the EULA violation from their support team. They chose not to provide infomration on the EULA violation, nor did they provide evidence that my account had violated the EULA. I can not recommend this game because they do not make this information accessible.-----------------------------------------------Until this week I would have recommended GTA V as a great game. It has an enjoyable single player and while the multiplayer is a grind to say the least, Rockstar have made it possible to perform the activities / missions / events with more than four players, which is a common pitfall of most co-operative games. This has given the game replay value, which led to the large number of hours I have played it. Whenever my friends and I needed a game we all were happy to play, GTA V was commonly the choice. I will acknowledge that GTA V itself is a great game to play with friends, and alone. However, on Monday - whilst mid-mission, GTA V's anti-cheat engine handed me out a temporary suspension. Like a broken record, I will say that I do not cheat, exploit, or mod the game, nor do I have any program which is capable of tampering with the games code or memory. At the time, I summised that GTA V's cheat engine works using a heurisitc system which looks at the behaviour of programs running in the background. Most likely it looks for programs attempting to inject code, control window handles, or view memory. I am relatively sure that it was my AS Rock tuning utility - which was monitoring sensory data, that is the culprit. I deduced this only from the fact that it was the only program that I had not run while running GTA V over a long period of time. However, I can also deduce that this program would have in no way altered or hindered the GTA V executable, nor its online service. I do not simply want to serve the 30 day suspension (which I am quite happy to do - understand that an anti-cheat engine that analyzes behaviour is bound to misinterpret occasionally) and then find that I am permanently banned. The problem with this game isn't the anti-cheat engine itself. In software engineering of this nature, there is always a tradeoff between false positives and limiting the number of cheats. So many hackers were ruining the game that the developers had make the anti-cheat engine more aggressive - result: more false positives. The problem lies in their lack of support and the ignorance that they hold towards this potential tradeoff. I sent a message to support - not asking to appeal the ban (explicitly telling them that I did not wish to appeal), but rather asking for information regarding the violation so that I could determine what caused the issue. The support message was viewed three times according to their ""latest activity"" timer over two days, and then ""Charles"" provided an automated message essentially copy and pasting the same content on their website regarding the issue. This is the problem. Rockstar and Take-Two's line is that ""everyone is banned"" for a reason - and therefore bans are final. If they enforce this, then they should inform the user of the specific violation that occurred. Providing me with an automated message provides me with no information doesn't tell me what set it off your anti-cheat engine. More so, it is an insult to your player base to not provide this information.Furthermore, there is an issue regarding permanently banning accounts without providing proof of the offense. In particular, in the termination section they state that they will only terminate an accounts service if it violates the code of conduct or if the service itself is terminated by the licensor (i.e. they stop online support for the game). By permanently banning someone (i.e. terminating online services to that registered account), this directly implies that the user must have violated the code of conduct. If they don't provide proof of the infraction, then one should question whether there was even a violation of their services. The burden of proof is on Take-Two or Rockstar to prove that you violated the EULA. If they can't provide the evidence, then there is no proof of a license violation and therefore they are breaking their own EULA. Since the EULA is essentially a contract, they are legally liable in this scenario.If the game provided proof of the violation that the registered account made against the EULA, then I would recommend this game - because then the game/service/or support would explicitly state the violation to the user and give the user a chance to seek remedy in the scenario that the grounds for the violation were false. As it is, Rockstar, Take-Two, nor their support channels make no attempt to provide this information. Furthermore, the support channels they provide for EULA violations (i.e. bans) provides no further assistance in the issue - why have it at all? Just tell us that you don't answer questions on bans rather than wasting our time. So as it stands, I will not be utilising their online services until they do provide this information. Hence, I do not recommend this game because at this time, I can not fully utilise the product without risk of the Licensor (Take-Two) violating the conditions of their EULA in the termination section (i.e. permanently banning me) and with no possiblity of the Licensee (Me) seeking appeal or remedy."

If you still do not have this game, and you just want to play singleplayer, do not hesistate and go for it. Singleplayer alone is worth those money. Still after all those things , I can say that I have never seen worse support. It is like talking with robots, they are using scripted phrases, and in the end they will not help you.As a player who got banned without any reason, I was trying to get some answers. At least I wanted to know ""what have I done?"". But they will not tell you, because you do not have permission to know that. The only thing you get is their typical copy/paste answer how their anticheat is flawless, and you are the one who broke EULA rules, but which one? Who knows...Another thing is that with the ban they also delete your characters, because of that I lost my 700h+ progress. So if you are guilty, you can prepare yourself that after the ban ends, you probably get another one (permanent), because you can not prevent happening it again without knowing what it caused. And if you are really innocent, the only thing what you can do is wait..."

We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big. I'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on ""high"", except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.You can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best.If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko.GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more.I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit ""Z"" to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus.Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year."
79,Varium_Fortuna,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord_Ignika/,"1,475",96,0,"3,566.4",August,"6,",314,75,1,"I made the mistake of purchasing this game for PC. I waited, and was excited. I took the numerous delays that this port experienced with stride. Upon playing this game for an amount of time that has left me disgusted and embarrased, I can really only say one thing to summarize: the hacking is terrible, and the game grinding is worse. Every so often, I return to this game asking myself ""Why did I stop playing again?"" The answer comes in less than 10 minutes of playing in a public lobby, when a hacker will do any of the following: teleport me over the ocean, blow me up, blow my vehicle up but make it seem as though I blew it up (so you have to pay a premium to get it back), kill me from across the map, teleport me the the ceiling for a free fall with no parachute, take money from my in game account, spam blow me up in a constant cycle of death, sticking a firepit onto my character so that he will burn to death constantly (the firepit never goes away unless you restart the game itself), or simply crash my game entirely. Oh wait, my GOSH, they did address the hacking. No more OpenIV Liberty City for GTA V. Those dastardly spawns of Satan within OpenIV are surely more of a threat than actual in-game hackers that have ruined countless gaming experiences, right? Wait a minute here....something seems a little fishy...Perhaps Rockstar, or TakeTwo for that matter, likes in-game hackers more than OpenIV for one simple reason: OpenIV stands to cut into possible revenue for TakeTwo (why play Online where there is money to be made by Rockstar when I can play in a Liberty City mod for freeeee); while hackers take players' money, which opens up the potential for more time spent in-game to earn the money back, or the possible purchase of a Shark Card. Seems simple enough for me.On to the other bone I have to pick (oh Rockstar, why have you left so many for me to chew on?): in-game prices. ""Free DLC"" is a blantant lie. It's free if you have no life in order to play the game constantly for the medicore payouts that you get for completing ""high paying, high risk work"" that is required to pay for all of this ""free content"". However, if you have other priorities in life that exceed making bank as a major criminal in this world of photons and hacking, then your best bet of experiencing any kind of new content is to look up the myriad of videos that are posted by the deplorable YouTubers of the GTA community (you know the ones), and you will surely have your fill of this content. Or you can ask one of the numerous hackers in this game to simply spawn you some of the new content. Have I mentioned that there are hackers galore in this game, by the way?Honestly though, just look at the prices for Shark Cards, and then look at the prices for in game content. Your question as to why a flying bike that shoots homing missile was added, has been dutifully answered.This game has left me beyond disappointed in the end, and quite the sour taste in my mouth. My disgusting amount of hours in-game speak for themselves: I enjoyed it at one point, but the constant grinding for a game with little reward, hardly any payout for in-game work, the exorbitant prices for any new content, and the experience ruining hacking has left me with little desire to ever play the game again. And, I surely don't plan on it. You, oh reader of my woe, might be able to still save yourself."

I currently have 4,617 hours of playtime logged in this game, most of it online or in the creator.  Once this game made it out on PC, complete with a first person viewpoint, I felt as though my lifelong journey of discovering an entire world which I could live in and do whatever I desired was finally becoming a reality.I loved this game.  LOVED this game.  I've been playing since the top-down days of GTA 1, always dreaming of the time when I could experience this crazy alternate world 'from my own eyes.'However, having spent this much time in the game leaves me with one conclusion:  I simply cannot recommend this game.  Not to anyone, not for any reason.  Not ever.See, in a game which revolves around drugs, money, murder, and any manner of illegal activities, I kind of expect to be treated like a criminal inside of the game.I do not expect to be treated like a crimial outside of the game by the sorry excuse they have for tech support.On 08/29/17, well into week 3 of some amazing double payout bonuses and mere days away from the Smuggler's Run DLC, my few friends and I were spending many long hours playing away and racking up some serious money through all of our hard work.  However, Rockstar decided that it was time to run another sweep looking for people who mod, glitch, cheat, hack, or exploit their game.Apparently it found very few of these people.  Instead, it found a whole bunch of us legitimate players.  Then it decided to punish us all wholesale, never once telling us why or how it came to this conclusion.  Better still, many of these people with modded money didn't get affected at all!First we are met with a screen during the game's loading cycle stating 'we have determined that GTA$ and/or RP details on your account were adjusted by something out of your control and we have taken action to fix it.  No additional action is required from you at this time.'Now, a lot of people will try to argue that they are completely legit 'except for that one time when...'  I am not one of these people.  I know what the public sessions are like in this game.  It's because of this that I had only ever played in closed or solo sessions until very recently, with the same one or two known and trusted friends, for most of my online time.  I had never played online on a console and had never transferred an online character.  I routinely took screenshots of my online bank account just in case some modder somehow managed to get through to me and mess with my hard-earned cash.To this day I have yet to see a single glitched or modded GTA dollar go into my account.  I would know if it went there.  I do not place myself into situations where such a thing could happen and I keep a very close eye on what happens to my game.  In addition I've never modded nor glitched GTA money, myself.  I've never even duped a car.  Honestly, I don't even know how to do any of this stuff!Rockstar apparently could not care any less about this as they had decided to 'take action' and steal $28,553,333 of my legitimate, hard-earned money.  Right out of the blue, no explanation given.  'Okay,' I think, 'their anti-cheat is confused with the double payouts we've gotten over these last few weeks.  They'll figure it out, this'll get sorted out, everyone who had their legit cash removed will get it back.'  There's quite a lot of us, too.  Look around the forums and message boards.  Tons of us.  Including about ten people whom I've just stared playing with mere days ago, which happens to be most of the people that I know in this game.Sadly, this does not appear to be the case.  Rockstar's support number has a doofy automated thing saying to use their support website (which many of us have already attempted to use.)  Any attempt to mention this stolen money on said website will soon see the issue being flagged as being a 'cheat/exploit or banning issue.'  It may or may not also have an automated response from some soulless bot stating that ""Your shared bank account in GTA Online was adjusted to remove illegitimately gained in-game money.""  Then the trouble ticket will be closed.  End of story, slap across the face.  'You cheated, we corrected it, get lost.'Like Hell!  Not ONCE have I EVER done anything in this game to cheat.  I HATE cheating.  Had any modded money been dropped onto me I would have told them about it in a heartbeat.  But Rockstar simply does not care about how legitimate we are.  They are always in the right, we as players are always in the wrong.  I'll probably never see that money back but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop sending them trouble tickets about it.  I'm currently sitting at number four.  They will keep hearing from me until they either fix their error or ban me.Nowhere has there been any official word from them about this.  No 'we recognize that there was an issue' or 'we are currently looking into the matter.'  Nope, we're all dirty cheaters, go screw off somewhere else.  As if it wasn't bad enough that they find any way they can to deplete our online bank accounts through normal play, now they're outright stealing it from a lot of us!All of the other rampant bugs in this game, both new and old, I could come to overlook (and there are quite a few of them!)  The increasingly forced public session play, the psychotic AI drivers, the ridiculous AI buffs, being called a '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' by the NPC's hundreds of times during play (Rockstar must have a fascination with this word combination,) the list goes on.  I won't even get into the mess that is story mode.This matter, however...  Now that I know who I am dealing with I am done purchasing anything with Rockstar's name on it.  Take 2 is in significant danger as well since their name is now associated with this title.  This kind of treatment of their playerbase is beyond unacceptable.  I can't even fathom how much of my time had been lost due to this, though if you consider that their most expensive Shark Card weighs in at $100 USD and gives you 8 million credits then they just stole nearly $357 USD from me because of this nonsense and there isn't anything in the world I can do about it.  (Except for sending them a bunch of trouble tickets and writing a negative review on Steam.  Power to the consumer, gorramit.)I had worked my butt off in this game for every dollar which I had saved and spent.  I played it smart, made intelligent purchases, played the game the way it was meant to be played and did everything that I could do to protect myself and my belongings.  As it turns out someone did manage to mess up my account in the end, just not how I would have expected.Grand Theft Auto receives two middle fingers way, way up.  If you've managed to avoid purchasing this game so far, congratulations!  Stay far, far away from it and its rampant toxicity.  If you already have purchased this and happened to experience a similar situation then I strongly encourage you all to join me in avoiding any of their games from this point forward while continuing to contact them through any means possible until they fix their broken crap and give us back our hard-earned money.Seriously, go sit on a cactus Rockstar."

However, with the current state of the GTA Online's ""PC Experience"", I cannot in good faith recommend GTA:O, least you want to put your computer's safety at risk. I am completely outraged at how Rockstar Games have basically taken their cash cow, and destroyed it entirely, not by poor updates (as many other players would likely attest to), but rather, the lack of any updates to where it matters, server security. GTA Online has become fairly outdated, and in 2022, it is nearly unplayable. Hacking is so rampant, it makes CS:GO look like the cleanest game ever made by comparison. Every online session you join is a risk that you take that at any moment, the experience could be ruined by a hacker, either blowing you up repeatedly, teleporting you to the edge of the map, surrounding you in a unbreakable cage, making themselves invincible in PvP, spawning in tanks in non-vehicle PvP modes, and/or completely filling the public chat with racial slurs. I'm not taking from other people's experiences, all of the above has happened to me personally, and there is nothing you can do about it but accept it, which I have done for the past 8 years. I took a break from the game from 2017 to 2021, and when I came back, not only did hacking/modding get even worse, but it has expanded to new lows. Literally every single online session that I have been in has had scammers spamming the text chat with links or discord invites to blatant scams designed to scam you for real money. Recently, the text chat spam apparently wasn't working well enough, so they have expanded to sending you the same scams through the in-game phone texting system as well. Hackers have posted my own IP address multiple times, once in text chat and once through the text messaging system. And get this, players which have acquired a ""mod menu"" can literally crash your game to desktop with the press of a button. I am not exaggerating when I say that this game has worse digital security and anti-cheat than public Minecraft servers, at least there the game sometimes kicks you for flying, GTA Online can't even do that (a flying bus once picked me up and left me in the Lago Zancudo swamp once, true story). I did not think that this game could get any worse, but today, I found out that rock bottom was not nearly as far down as we could go, as the modders have decided to ""grab a pickaxe"", so to speak, and lodge it into the skull of Rockstar's servers. Recently modders have realized that they can exploit Rockstar's Social Club system to send every player in the game invites to their own modded session, where they can literally break your game. If you accept one of the constant game invites from a ""B-a-l-l-s-t-o-r-t-u-r-e"" (without the -'s placed to circumvent Steam's censorship), or if you end up in one of their sessions by chance (which is now very likely since they're also kicking players from other sessions), it will force your game into a spectator mode which you cannot leave from, or give you an error message, preventing you from playing the game outright, even if you quit and restart the game. GTA Online is now literally unplayable, and to say that this complete absence of online security from Rockstar is unacceptable would be the biggest understatement of the decade. The fact that Rockstar could allow their cash cow game to reach such a state is not only reprehensible, but outright despicable. There are no words in the English dictionary that could sufficiently describe my absolute repulsion at what could only be described as the most criminal act of negligent programming in the history of video games. The only way I can explain as to why Rockstar has let the situation grown so out of control is that they have grown so rich from shark card microtransaction money, that they have literally forgotten how to program anything more complex than a ""hello world"" program, it would certainly explain why the GTA trilogy remaster was such a disaster, and why it has taken them 9 year to even start making GTA 6. It is clear to me that Rockstar is nothing more than an example of the worst excesses of corporate greed, and while I certainly don't believe in the concept of ""voting with your wallet"", Rockstar Games will never see another cent out of me again, and I strongly urge you to stop playing GTA Online until the game has been cleaned out of hackers and modders, which considering Rockstar performance so far, will likely never happen. TL;DR - GTA Online is now literally unplayable, due to hackers and modders, and even if it becomes playable again, avoid it like the plague, unless you want your IP address sold off to the highest bidder."

Just now decided to write a review after seeing the same thing has happened to so many others. I bought GTAV on  I waited in the pre-order line at gamestop because I was so damn hyped for this game. I was only intending to play it on console until the PC version came out. At this point I had no clue that there was going to be character swaps from console to PC. I obtain level 72 on console. Loving the game, couldn't be happier (except if the radio stations were better).PC version release date is announced sometime in January 2015. I immediately pre-order it in order to get the bonus money that was available as a pre-order incentive. Upon release I transfer my character from console to PC and recieve my pre-order money. I was so thrilled to finally be playing this great game on PC. In the last year I put in 390 hours online in this game and achieved level 136 if I recall correctly. Countless hours of heist grinding, job grinding, lots of shark cards bought. Sitting at something like 11million dollars. 2 houses, 2 garages. Everything I could ever want in the game. I had things that weren't even obtainable anymore. I was thrilled with where the game was going. Then.... I get bored; So I quit playing for 2 months.A friend asks me, ""Hey come play GTA with me let's wreck some kids"". Sure why not. I get on for about an hour and we do just that, wreck some kids. I log off for the night and log in the next day to a 10 day ban. I was beyond baffled. How could I be banned when I didn't do anything? Surely rockstar support can help me. So I call in an attempt to figure out what is going on. I get fed a rehearsed line about bans being the result of online modding etc etc. I ask for a supervisor, the supervisor says the same thing. I ask for his supervisor. He says there is no one above him available and I was unable to appeal my ban. His reasons are as follows.He neglects to tell me that the system was going to take all of my money and I would have to start over. Grinding countless heists/jobs or buy a large sum shark card (which is ultimately what they wanted me to do).I come back around 12 days later and play for a few hours. Nothing out of the ordinary happens. I then got off for the night. The following day I got back on and was banned again. This time for 30 days. I think to myself ""No &*%#ing way, this isn't possible"". I call  and get the same rehearsed line  from both the first and second level of support (always ask for a supervisor). Except this time something was different. This time I was being allowed to appeal my ban. I thought for sure I would be exonerated of these allegations.  I was told that I must have been hacking if their skynet system banned me. That there is nothing they can do and that ""evidence of illicit activity"" was found on my account. So I ask them to check again and they do. Same result. At this point I start thinking ahead. ""What happens when I get back from this 30 day ban?"". ""I'm just going to be banned again for the same false reason?""They reply, ""that shouldn't happen sir"". I reply, ""Shoulda coulda woulda. It's happened twice now so what makes next time any different. No variables have changed. If I record all of my gameplay from now on will that protect me? If I am indeed banned upon return to your game can I use the footage as proof of my innocence?""""Yes"", I was told. Not maybe, not ""we're not sure"". I was told So I did just that. I recorded all of my gameplay. Unfortunately ""all"" only ended up being roughly 2 hours the night I was unbanned after the 30 day ban because I was immediately banned permanently after logging off for that night.This is starting to get a little longer than I expected so I'll cut it short. I tried to appeal the permament ban. I thought ""I have video that I didn't do anything, surely this time it will be different.... they will have to unban me"". I'll just end my review here and link my evidence. The videos of my gameplay and their final reply to me in my appeal where I linked them the videos. Edit: According to various sources (denied by Rockstar when I called them today) I was banned for MSI Afterburner/RivaTuner. This would make sense to me now that I think about it. However my review remains unchanged because they are doing absolutely nothing to fix the issue. I was told that I am not allowed to appeal my permanent ban because their system is flawless and does not falsely ban people for any reason. The support supervisor (Kyle) even acknowledged that he had heard of the MSI/Riva complaint but that it was ""false"". So yeah I'm still in the same place I started. Still will never support another Rockstar game for as long as I live."

Plenty of posts and videos have been put up on social media about people getting there accounts suspended and wiped, or banned by mistake, with zero appeal policy and no investigations or follow ups.

88,Palarax,https://steamcommunity.com/id/palanoodle/,431,28,0,"2,068.8",August,"14,",348,25,1,"I've been playing this game since it was on the 360 and have enjoyed the content for the most part, aside from the horribly toxic community killing anything that moves, modders ruining every aspect possible, trolls making missions and heists unbearable and so on. I would enjoy this game more if you could do Motor Cycle Club, CEO work, and the other money making portions in private or solo lobbies. Despite all my issues with this game, the long loading times, all of it, I did find it enjoyable with friends. And then it happened.I got hit with a random perma ban for simply playing the game. I honestly don't know what else it could have been aside from a false flag from the ban bot or users not knowing that the MK II Heavy Sniper can have explosive rounds... Maybe players should just leave players alone unless they want a fight? If you wanna fight, don't cry when you get killed, especially since I never liked the PvP in this game, I honestly avoided players at all times cause I got tired of trying to figure out which one was a modder or not. So, until my ban gets lifted and Rockstar can figure out that we should be able to fight to get to play this game, I'm leaving this as a negative review and a warning for anyone who wants to play this to play this game, do so at your own risk. Cause that damn bot will not give a ♥♥♥♥ when it bans you and Rockstar will do nothing to change it.Edit: Since this review has been gaining some traction, I feel I may want to clear some stuff up, especially now that I'm less frustrated at the joke that is Rockstar support. Honestly, I despise cheaters and modders in games where the progression is the grind cause you sell yourself short of the satisfaction of having worked up to your goal and getting the thing you wanted and worked for. Not saying that the stupid prices for stuff in this game is fair, but it does feel satisfying to finally get something... Only to turn around and ask why the hell I needed this thing in the first place. Though I get it. Some people want the instant gratification that comes with mods and modded money, but  for me, that would just help kill the game even more for cause then it begs the question, ""Why bother playing this game in the first place?"" You can get literally anything and everything you want at the push of a button and at no effort on your part other than a Google search. I don't like cheating and modding cause it feels dirty and wrong. Hell, I don't even really use mods in single player games till I've beaten the story to try and get the full experience of the game before going back and seeing what I missed, other options and choices if possible, or just seeing how badly I can break the game. But only in single player games where I'm not messing with other people's experiences, cause I'd honestly hate for someone to do the same to me in return.That's just my stance on it, I know some people are gonna laugh and scoff at it, but I just thought I'd put this out there. Thanks for talking your time to read this, or at least skim over it.TL;DR Singleplayer is fun and enjoyable as long as the next update doesn't keep resetting your progress.Online is a battlefield and everyone and their mother will try to kill you. Play at your own risk. Money is gonna be a constant grind to get cause of how overpriced the fun stuff is, but in lobbies, you're probably gonna get blown up no matter what you do. There's ways to make solo lobbies. Keep it close and ready at all times and play with groups of friends whenever possible."

When I first bought this game I didn't even care for the multiplayer. I spend over 350+ hours in the singleplayer alone and it was great. Plenty of stuff to do, plenty of fun to be had with some minor problems here and there. But nothing to be worried about.When I started the multiplayer, everything appeared to work just fine. It looks more like a loadingscreen simulator but there is still plenty of fun to be had. The sheer amount of stuff to do is amazing and with some friends you can have hundreds of hours of fun. But then everything changed when Rockstar attacked..Now I cannot find a single game without hackers, modders or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you call them. When I still had a low-level character, I met a few hackers and they were generally nice people. They played along in heists and missions and just did their own thing and had fun by themselves without bothering the other players.But now it seems they have turned extremely hostile. Blowing up your vehicles, dropping you from high altitudes, spawning a tsunami of cars on your head, putting people in lift cabins, going on a rampage while being invulnerable to attacks.. It's just ridiculous, unfair and extremely childish. Rockstar has failed miserably in removing these hackers from their game. They are banning more innocent players than hackers with their new automated system.Yesterday (7th of May, 2017), for example, out of the blue a hacker gave me 17 million dollars. You may think 'Allright! More money to spend! finally I can buy that Yacht and modified car I've been working my ass off to obtain!'But you'd be wrong. I IMMEDIATELY left that game so the amount I got wouldn't be rising even further. Why? Because Rockstar is now also punishing players who OBTAIN money from hackers, whether it was obtained voluntarily or not. Now I am terrified of Rockstar's ""Banning machine of Death"" and affraid to play the game again for fear that my level 112 character will be reset and all of my work will be gone without any hope of getting it back.Hackers, you're not trolls. You're not funny. You're not clever. Call me old-fashioned or a big soft ♥♥♥♥♥, but in my book, you're all a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whose parents did a lousy job teaching you the value of respect. Just because you're anonymous on the internet doesn't give you the right to be a ♥♥♥♥, nor does it justify your actions.And Rockstar, get your ♥♥♥♥ in order and make sure these people stop terrorizing your game.I'll change my recommendation of the multiplayer to positive when they start to put more effort into the anti-cheat.For now, buy this game if you want to play the single player. If you only want to play the multiplayer, I strongly recommend you wait until this problem has been fixed."

For example if you are sourcing crates for CEO warehouses, as soon as u pick up the first crate, the game sends out a session wide ping, and actively tells other players to come kill you and destroy your cargo for cash and rp. how much cash do u get for this, 2 grand and minimal rp, how much of the CEOs money did u just waste, 18 grand at the high end, plus 5000 for each death they suffered at your hand. this does not sound like it would be much of a problem because everyone is in cars on the road, right? WRONG!! let me introduce to you the oppressor mk2. the developers at Rockstar games decide to create the most powerful griefer tool ever created and unleash it for the low, low price of 30$ in real world currency, or 3 million dollars in game. what is the oppressor u ask? the 0ppressor is a flying hoverbike with perfect homing rockets that can not only lock onto cars, but also individual people. really rockstar? why is this a thing? oh and dont get me started on the hacking problem. modders can do whatever they want, whenever they want, to whoever they want, and they cant be stopped, even after you switch lobbies, anything they spawned or change stays with you. modders can force players out of any vehicle, force teleport players into cages, or just spawn explosions and kill everyone at once. how many people are in each lobby? 30 people per lobby is not bad when the game is server based, OH WAIT, when the game re released for next gen they made it p2p. for 30 people anywhere in the world to be allowed in one session, and rockstar thought it was a good idea to use a system designed for 10 at the hard max, and that is with good internet and good netcode, which this game does NOT have. lastly because of how competitive the game is due to the freeroam businesses, this games playerbase is among the most toxic player base i have EVER seen, players grief eachothers businesses just because they are bored. ROCKSTAR I BEG YOU, please make businesses available to work in private sessions so that solo players, and friend groups can play in peace. one last thing, shark cards are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dont give enough to be worth it, no matter what sales you have at the time.

This means other players with mod menus can set alerts to notify them whenever you go online. They can then force their way into your lobby, even if private, and troll you until they get bored. Rockstar is aware of this issue, but for some reason wont address it.DO NOT PLAY ONLINE WITHOUT A VPN.Even if you can get past all that, the state of pc online is so distraught that it makes the game unplayable. There are modders in every public lobby, so your either constantly getting spawn killed and cant get anything done, or the lobby will be so glitchy that it will eventually crash and kick you, or force close the game.The only way this game is tolerable is in a private lobby. Doing this will cut out most in game content though, as most content is only available for play if your in a public lobby. Playing in a private lobby, in my opinion, also defeats the purpose of playing an online game; unless you are only playing with a set group and you are all only on at the same time.I have close to 500 hrs in game.

GTA V's singleplayer is great for what it is but most people buying this game in 2022 will be purchasing it for the online experience.   GTA V Online has such an amazing groundwork. A beautiful map, tons of content, and a plethora of things to do.   All of the above features are thrown out the window by the amount of modders and cheaters in the game. While many people would argue that there aren't that many of them or that they don't affect the experience, both of these statements are just untrue. From my experience, almost every public lobby has at least 1-2 modders in it. These ""modders"" and the amount they can do outside the game's boundaries is absolutely unacceptable.   They can spawn unobtainable vehicles, become invincible, fly, explode the entire map, teleport, become NPCs such as animals, lock you into a cage, crash your game instantly, and many other things. If this wasn't enough, they can violate your privacy. They can force you to type things into chat and even SEE YOUR IP ADDRESS. It's questionable if having a VPN will help this, though many have said that it definitely will, and I strongly advise using one if you do happen to be playing.     Your first thought would be to report these people to Rockstar, correct? Well. Modders get alerts when you send a report through the game, which allows them to delete them before they even reach Rockstar. That's right. You can't even report these cheaters which can be an actual threat to your game experience, your Rockstar account, and your real-world well being.   On top of all this, Rockstar as a company is just completely awful. They have taken most customer support down for the game, so most email reports will not work to get any cheaters banned even with video proof. However, they do have ban waves in which they ban accounts of suspected cheaters every month or so. Hilariously, my account was falsely banned for 30 days and my entire character reset. All of the 95.4 hours you see at the time of writing this review was erased for existing in a lobby with a modder, something out of my control and completely without my consent. I had never received a warning nor committed any offense on my GTA or Social Club account before this. This game is outdated, not supported by the developers, and swarming with cheaters that can put you at risk. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR THE ONLINE."

Educate yourself, read how bad these people are know your enemy as a gamer, as a consumer, is: Single player, still good, as with most if not all GTA titles thus far, playing 3 different characters is both at times tiring and fun.  One of the 3 is the least interesting, that being Franklin, his character was the least fleshed out yet was made out to be the glue to the group.  The gameplay is mostly better and for it's time it looked great though now visually not as impressive, there are however still instances where the world lives and you just sit back and watch.  By now you already know what the story is about, you do heists, which compared to PD2, are quite well done and make you feel like you're actually getting something out of it after you've planned for several set-up missions.  Your characters level up their traits so the now bog standard RPG elements are built into the game, for better or for worse which means at times a lot of grinding in order to get better which again is forced and boring in any game.  All in all the story is worth it so long as you find the game on sale, NEVER pay full price for this title as it is simply not worth $60 for a 4 year old game, period.Now the online aspect of GTA5, where to start.... well it WAS a fair sandbox where you could enjoy getting killed by random a-holes in the server but now you can get that same feeling while you're flying, riding in a tank, anywhere you go you will be harried by other players in Freeroam.  It was a horrible design choice and I will never understand what they ultimately thought would happen.  That's just the crappy overworld, joining matches is a chore if you can even find anything then have fun with the infinite number of game modes that Rockstar keeps shoving out of the door to keep people playing because you'll never find a game mode beyond it's initial introduction.  By the way that’s if you aren’t killed by the countless modders that have been a problem since day 1 of the PC release but does Rockstar do anything?  No they go after the victims rather then the offenders.  On the subject of stability or how good of a port GTA5 is over all, it is pretty good but it also isn't, the load times are insane, even having the game on an SSD it can take at times an unlimited amount of time to load/connect to an offline lobby.  While the game runs fairly well Rockstar clearly did not make sure that stability and reliability was mirrored during loading and connecting to a lobby.  Sorry but a 4 year old game if it's well optimized should not take 5+ minutes to load on an SSD or any hard drive for that matter, period.  How they treat their paying customers and loyal player base is also shameful, their support staff, if you can call them that, do nothing but read from prefabricated responses and treats you like you caused the issue to happen.  They constantly suggest over the top things to fix completely separate issues, like uninstall our 50+ gigabyte game and reinstall it in order to fix a connection problem.  Not to mention the countless false positives for account bans and account wipes, which means that even a straight as an arrow player can and will get banned or have all of their cash wiped entirely from their character just because their “state of the art trusted anti-cheat” system flagged your account.  They constantly blame the victim rather then the cause and their support staff are instructed not to speak to anyone regarding bans or said money wipes.  They have constantly denied any and all wrong doing on every account even when given mountains of evidence they are staunch in their “belief” that you are the problem and not their system.Making money, which is the only way to really get anywhere in the game, because it's not like I want to play the game that I bought, no I want to literally work for hours at a time grinding missions, heists, game modes, etc.  Just to get anywhere in the game.  If you don't grind for cash or pay for in game money you will suffer, the poor are indeed the lesser class in GTA Online with no real way to gain serious money if they can't find the means or the tools.  You can't get the tools if you don’t have the money and if you don’t have the tools you can't make the money.  It's a horrible circle and it does not make a fun game to just enjoy, because you can't because it's work, you're quite literally working within the game universe.  If you own a business,  you're doing work, if you're trying to make money via heists (which is no longer the best way to make money these days, anymore anyway) you work and grind for DAYS on end.  With the amount of time that I spent working in GTA Online, comparing their own pricing for Shark Cards I would have spent thousands of dollars to give you some perspective and I still don't own everything, not even close.  Everything in Online is now priced so that it all but forces you to buy Shark Cards which Rockstar's fee to pay microtransactions.  The best part about them now is that they are totally worthless, with each update that Rockstar releases the items get more and more expensive to the point where even the $100 Shark Card for $8 million, won't even buy you a car or two, where as before when the game was first out you'd be hard pressed to spend all $8 million.  It is done on purpose and now that Take 2's CEO has consistently come out to the public and investor meetings and stated that he treats customers by how they spend on his games.  That should tell you what kind of horrible person and horrible company Take 2 and Rockstar have turned into. Their CEO is on record comparing paying human customers to minnows, dolphins and whales, these dehumanizing categories put gamers into their spending habits, if you spend very little and simply grind for days on end for your cash well you’re a minnow, if you buy money constantly then you’re a whale.  These are the people running Take 2 and Rockstar, these are the people saying making games is too expensive, the “people” who compare human beings to aquatic creatures based on their spending habits.Do yourself and your fellow gamers some respect and avoid this title, educate yourself on how badly Take 2 and Rockstar have been treating their own paying customers for the past 4 years and realize that it will NEVER go back to the way it was.  Take 2 and Rockstar will never be the same again, and when this microtransaction bubble bursts, because it will, Take 2 and Rockstar will be gone because they've now made sure that if their ideas fail their companies fail.  It's better to please your investors then your actual customers, the ones who make  your fame possible.  Spend your money on another more deserving company, please."

Now of course the city of Los Santos feels unique and alive. You know with people bustling around, cars, traffic. Typical open world crime game stuff they have a really nice eye for detail down to homeless people sheltering themselves in the Hollywood upper class being themselves. GTA 5 is also unique for pulling up the less populated rural areas and making them feel like people actually live there not just like a boring flat landscape with a few trailers like many other games simply do it. No no no!! ;D By sandy shores in particular. Yes it's mostly trailer parks but with convenience stores, strip malls, parking lots and abandoned buildings. it really makes you feel like a place people exist in and not just a goofy parity. GTA 4 and 5 in particular just feel like convincing real places even if the majority of your interaction with people just blowing them up. 10/10 - Multiplayer is so fun because it gives a real feel of being able to run around the city and do whatever you want. I think what makes this game work is that it has an incredible sense of immersion in city life. No other driving game or first person shooter that I know of gives you this much freedom. This game can give You a way to have fun!! ;D I like it so much. Give it a try. Who knows? You might like it too. If you do like it, then I wish you many hours of fun with it."

But first things first: The single player campaign is one of the best I ever played. The concept of playing three characters is a welcome addition to the GTA formula and absolutely pays off. As with all the previous GTA's the NPC are fantastic. I thought that Brucie from GTA IV was the craziest character ever, until Rockstar introduced Trevor in GTA V. Character and mission design are top notch. Also the level of detail of the game world is incredible. Too bad that Rockstar has never released any single player DLC.s. Now to GTA Online: The concept is amazing as well and the game is continuously updated with new content. I like the heists especially. The downside is that you definitely need other players for them and that it takes ages to find co-op partners especially for the heist set-up missions where money and reputation rewards are scarce. When you finally find enough players people often drop out in the middle of the mission which leads to an instant fail and you have to find another team. Not to mention all the player-killers in the open world and the long load times in general... However, if you happen to find decent people to play with or play with friends the game is an absolute blast. A word on the Rockstar Launcher: Sure it is completely unnecessary that there is yet another launcher to torture PC players with. After the launch in September 2019 the game crashed regularly thanks to the launcher. As of November 2019 it seems like Rockstar managed to solve these problems and the game is running stable most of the time.All in all an amazing game, but especially GTA Online could still be so much more."
115,MR.F,https://steamcommunity.com/id/file071/,636,32,0,769.2,December,"13,",94,44,1,"When it comes to the campaign you are gonna enjoy it because it is really good, but the main reason for people coming to play this game is GTA Online for sure and I can tell you that it's current state is terrible ! Why ? I have 400 hours on PC, plus another 400 on ps3 when it came out, so I'm gonna try to be as clear as possible.GTA Online is about making money by playing missions, heists, doing jobs like stealing cars and selling them, sell cocain from Cocain lab, selling weapons from bunker where they are made etc., and you can spend that money on cool cars, luxury appartements, weapons, private jets, helicopters, war vehicles etc. Sounds cool right ? Well there is a problem.At beggining when the game came out the prices for these things were reasonable, but now in the last couple of new updates and with Import/Export things, the prices are just awful. They keep getting higher and higher and it has become so much harder to buy cool things that you want and in that way, they are trying to make you buy their ""Shark Cards"" which is really not worth, even the 75$ card that gives you 8.000.000 $ is not enough, you are gonna need more than that to buy things here, because when you buy something, you still have to costumize it if you want it to look and be better which also really costs. If you wanna get the money normally, you can either repeat the heists or do the Import/Export jobs since those ways are best for making money, but they still don't give you the money that you really deserve nowadays and for Import/Export jobs, it really takes a lot of time to get the money that you need, even friends that help you can't get the deserving money. For example, I still didn't even manage to sell the weapons from the bunker cause it really takes a lot of time for them to be ready for sale and btw, the only way to get the stock ready for sale, for either weapons, drogs, weed, whatever, is to be active in session, ONLY ! The stocks can't get full while you are for example playing heists or some missions or car races with your friends. And when I want to sell a product, for example two cars with my friend, I will get 200.000$ while my friend is only gonna get 20.000$ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ! That's how Rockstar is trying to keep their players playing here, by spending thousands of hours repeating the same things that are really NOT worth and they try to make you buy their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""Shark Cards"" and even that is still not worth your money at all ! Please for the love of GOD, don't fall in to a trap thinking that buying shark cards is gonna help you. This really shows how Rockstar became greedy. You think "" Yes ! There is new content coming and like every, it's FREE ! "", but when you see how expensive the content is, you just get really disappointed. Here is the best example of it, when the first heists came out, you only had to buy an appartement which had a specific room for that and the cheapest one was about 250.000 $ which was not that hard to get and now you can play 5 heists, but with these new ones that just came out, you have to buy a facility to play the heists and the facilities cost from 1.500.000 $ ???? ♥♥♥♥ THAT ! It's faster to get bankrupt here, then to be rich, SO WHAT'S THE POINT !If you wanna play this game because of the campaign, go for it and I suggest you to get it on sale, but if you wanna enjoy GTA Online, you will maybe like it at beggining like I did when it came out, but that was when prices were reasonable and when you figure out how expensive new content has become, not to mention hackers and unfair bans, you will see how horrible GTA Online really is. Yes, you can also ♥♥♥♥ around with your friends and race, but it's really not worth your time if you are gonna be doing only that, even for that you need money, especially if you wanna have fun with cool things."
116,Raverbasher,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000857002/,261,71,1,223.7,May,"10,",255,14,1,"TL;DR Single player game isn’t as good as GTA IV. Only play online if you’re going to cheat. Read on to find out why (long read).I started playing this game in October 2017. I’d just got my sweet gaming rig after using Apple for years due to work obligations.  At the time, I read the negative reviews saying that players who didn’t cheat were getting banned for cheating and everything was being taken away. I scoffed. They must have done  wrong. That wouldn’t happen to me.As someone working full time, I spent around $150 on Shark Cards to unlock missions and the stuff I wanted to do. A sweet ride. A nice motorbike. Harrier jet. I tend to just log on now and again and drive about. Maybe do some Hangar missions. My guy is at level 20. I only have driving and flying skills maxed out. All the other skills aren’t even at level 3. $3 million in the bank. Not really the account of a hacker.Fast forward to May 8th and my account has been banned. It’s a temp ban, but my character is reset and everything I have bought will be taken away from me when the account comes back online in July. Furthermore, if I keep infracting on the games ToS, it’ll be a full ban next time. This leads to somewhat of a conundrum. Obviously, if I was a cheater, I would know exactly what I had done wrong. However, as a 100% legitimate player, I have no idea what I did, or what warranted this ban. Indeed, if you play legitimately, then how can you play  legitimately in the future?All attempts to contact support have ended in failure. “All bans are final.” is parroted back at me. No one can tell me why I was banned. This account, then, is ruined. If I know I have done nothing wrong, and as such don’t know why the account was banned, what could I possibly do to prevent a ban in the future? Especially if Rockstar have simply closed the door on me when I ask for help and clarification. Researching some more into this recent “ban wave” to see if there are other honest players banned like me, I discover that used accounts can be bought for as little as $5. In addition to that, there are apparently many free mods and cheats out there that can go relatively undetected online, and unlock .  Apparently, there are also paid for cheats (I don’t know how much these cost yet), but one gamer I came across seems to maintain that he was banned because he used cheats he’d paid for. If he’d stuck to the free ones, he claims he probably would have been ok. So, for $5, you can have access to everything in GTA V: Online, as well as apparently more (max all skills, max all unlocks, no wanted level, infinite ammo etc.).From personally using Shark Cards, it’s my estimate that to unlock everything legitimately, you’d probably need to pay somewhere between $4000-$5000.As you can see, you can pay $4000-$5000 and get everything, and probably have your account banned, or $5, get everything, and most probably have your account banned. But then after it’s banned, just spend another $5 again.From this I can conclude that there is absolutely no reason to play this game legitimately. There is a high probability you will be banned for no reason and have everything taken away, with no chance to appeal or find out what happened. If you use the cheats, you will also probably be banned, but you’ll have access to everything and may have a lot more fun with all the added extras.Therefore, I highly recommend this game, but  if you’re going to cheat. If you want to play this game legitimately, I would buy something else.Also, FUCK Rockstar."
117,Shekelstein,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hahnfruh/,134,8,1,"2,775.6",March,"15,",592,1,1,"To review GTA 5, one has to analyze the singleplayer and multiplayer part seperately.Let's start with singleplayer: GTA 5 offers more variety and things to do than any GTA game before. It features 3 main characters instead of one, lets you use all the weapons you can carry, and offers tons of cars, bikes, trucks, planes, helicopters, and other means of transportation. Furthermore, there's a huge city to explore, along with large rural areas, mountains, small villages, and a giant ocean. Experience a fun, crazy story about crime, family crisis, and general madness which you can repeat at any time at any point if you feel like it or if you want to unlock certain achievements. And if you get bored of causing mayhem all the time, you can relax at a game of golf, tennis, or choose some other, non-violent activities. Hang out with your virtual friends, take a dive in the ocean, do some parachuting, the choices seem virtually endless!However, compared to previous titles in the series, there are also some aspects which have been downgraded a bit. For instance, some of the old minigames are now missing (bowling, pool). Also, they cut classic side missions like checkpoint parcours, vigilante, fire fighter, and medic. Furthermore, the AI and general behavior of the NPCs has worsened as well: Instead of being a useful tool to get healed on the spot, medics have now become completely useless. Also, cops are now working much less efficient compared to GTA IV, which had impressive AI mechanics for the side of the law.Nevertheless, the game is already worth buying for its singleplayer part alone, and if you get bored, there are a ton of gameplay mods to enrich your gaming experience. Don't go into online mode if you have them installed though, it won't end well!Speaking of online mode, this is a completely different world. First: you need to put a lot of time and work into it (which basically means grinding for months) if you want to have all the fancy stuff (see my playtime? About 250 hours of that is singleplayer). You start as a little nobody inside a sea of people with flying bikes, tanks, pink fighter jets, and other things you've never seen before in singleplayer, who won't hesitate to blow you up as soon as the got you in their crosshairs. Also there's modders, but you can avoid trouble most of the time by changing session once they've been discovered. This might not sound very inviting at first, but once you've established a foothold and found other people to play with, you can have a lot of fun. The things you can do in multiplayer are so many more that i can't even count them all, but the two most important things (if you like to make money) are heists and criminal businesses. Grab four friends (or random players, but it's more likely to fail then) and plan robbing banks, drug dealers, or get involved in a plot where you have to save the entire world! If your team is good, so will be the payout. Once you got your first million, get out there and buy a drug lab, research bunker, weed farm, or whichever else your heart desires. Set them up, look after them, and you will have a constant flow of guaranteed income. Watch for griefers though! They love to ruin other people's experience and generally ♥♥♥ things up for you. There are ways to avoid them however without having to cancel whatever you are currently doing. After gaining your first millions, use your money to buy super fast cars, missile shooting armored trucks with machineguns on top, a jetpack, there's something for everyone (as long as you have the money for it). And if you prefer certain gamemodes instead of a freeroam world, you can go racing, join in a deathmatch, play tennis, golf, or play some of the contact missions offered by different contractors. And if you just want to have fun, you can always goof around with other players.In short:Singleplayer: greatOnline: Even greater IF you have a lot of time and people to play with."

Now every server I join over half the players are flying them around just waiting for you to run supplies then destroy you instantly. Even if you manage to kill one or two there are 5 others on rocket bikes taking their shots. How is it even feasibly possible to deliver supplies in a rotor plane in free mode, what a joke.I will say though, Story Mode is great."

Made some investments with the Starter Pack, took advantage of double RP sessions at certain times due to work commitments in real life, and I think 2 Shark cards to top it all up. Got some nifty rides and choppers in-game to play with, and I was so looking forward to doing it over-and-over while listening to some of the finest selection of contemporary music via the in-game radio.But lo and behold, just only made RP 102 yesterday by taking advantage of double RP week, only to discover I got banned TODAY. Yup, an abrupt, unexplained lock-out for the next 30 days. And NO, ABSOLUTELY AND ADAMANTLY NO, I have NEITHER used any hacks NOR installed any mods to my game. To add salt to injury, my progress was reset. My hard, unmodded work, all flushed down the gutter with no explanation given. And NO, I AIN'T very tech-savvy so I can NEVER understand mods or hacks, let alone use 'em.Seriously, man... what the F? Was about to write a nice review for ya until I got unjustly banned, and with no explanation whatsoever. You fellas at Rockstar had better get your damn act together implementing a better system at detecting hackers or modders without wrongfully or unjustly and without any form of explanation subjecting paying customers to this, this debacle.Goodbye Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. It has been fun playing through your saga, and I would love to do so again, but this bovine excrement is an ABYSSMAL turnoff. And hello Geralt, Vito Scaletta, and Noctis and gang.P.S. Hope bankruptcy catches up with your sorry, greedy corporate selves. You know who I am talking about. Pray one day you don't get served a class-action suit for this debacle.P.P.S. The automated response to your ticket submission for complaints ISN'T helping anyone. Whoever your customer support is, I hope you receive your just dues when the time comes.P.P.P.S. Don't even think I will fork out my hard earned cash for Red Dead Redemption 2, even if it comes out on PC.

I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:1. Loading screens take forever.2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking retarded is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.6. The f*cking loading screens X___X7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make. 11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).15. And shark cards can gobble my balls._________________________________________________________________Other than that, this game is an awesome game and very addicting, totally worth the money, you'll have tons of fun, especially in online mode, I promise :D"
129,Rauthr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rauthrn/,350,27,0,"2,194.6",July,"14,",457,54,1,"I've played this a fair bit, primarily in Online which will be the sole focus of this review.Having played this for years, I've put up with a lot of stuff. Between greifers, modders, greifing modders, R* wiping my money for no reason - I'm especially careful to avoid modders giving away cash - and just a generally toxic playerbase... But I put up with it because, at its core, it's an incredibly fun experience with lots to do. Lately, however... After the Epic free giveaway of the game a while ago, the game has quite literally had at minimum 3 modders per server, and one of them is always a guaranteed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you stick your neck out in any way, you're going to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with, greifed, disconnected to singleplayer or your game will get crashed.This is because suddenly every previously banned modder can get a FREE or VERY CHEAP account easily, and those who did get it for free don't give a damn if they get banned. Coupled with mod menu creators aggressively marketing their menus via Social Club (I've gotten 3-4 different random messages that are essentially ads, ""feel like a god!"" seems to be a popular tagline.) and you've got Online as of late. It has NEVER been this bad.Over the course of the last couple weeks, I have been lucky to complete any public session event, mission or just plain having fun with people without a mod greifer interrupting in some way. Fight back effectively? Disconnected. Hide/go passive? Like that has ever helped. They can even stick objects on you that last between sessions - Sometimes obscuring your view completely requiring a full game restart.""Do a public solo session!"" I hear you whine. Yes, this works somewhat for missions and sales, when you need to make money. But what if you just want to ♥♥♥♥ around with other players, the main attraction of the game for me - Or do PvP against the unceasing horde of tryhard MKII bike greifers, a common complaint I actually find fun to take down? ♥♥♥♥ out of luck for the foreseeable future, as R* is and has been notoriously bad at dealing with this issue historically (and it's never been this bad!).On top of all this, a thing that's always been a small issue in the past is rearing its head big time lately - Inability for  your game to sync up and ""save"" your progress on the servers. There's nothing like spending an evening grinding money/crates/vehicles/heists for nothing because the game decided it didn't want to save it. No, forcing R*s servers to prioritize it by quit-not-quitting doesn't seem to work consistently, and this happens every night.I've been willing to put up with a lot in the past, I'm not some carebear money high score grinder, I don't care about K/D ratios or any of that ♥♥♥♥. But being completely unable to play without getting disconnected for daring to exist outside of a heist or public solo lobby is completely unbearable. Even when I find a smallish session and start to have fun, it's never more than 20 min to half an hour before it's ruined again by an egocentric kid who threw 20 bucks at a mod menu.You won't - Can't - fix it, so just ♥♥♥♥ you R* for being completely inept moneygrubbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for years, doing your best to ruin any fun you can have in this game.EDIT: No, I won't get a mod menu. You guys are exactly what I'm complaining about, having more people trying to boot off eachother just makes the problem worse. Not to mention a lot of the ""better"" mod menus come with DC protection from those same methods anyways.EDIT2: 276 game hours later...Mod menus are so powerful that they'll intercept ingame reports, and they can spoof their names so you can't report them out-of-game either. The worst ones are the ""good guy"" modders trying to play vigilante crashing or messing with people they think deserve it; But half the time they get it wrong and only see the greifer getting his just desserts and assume you're the bad guy. ON TOP of that, if they save your R* ID they can pull you in and out of sessions on command, so you're literally never safe if one sees fit to ♥♥♥♥ with you specifically."

139,⇋⎰ＤＩＡＢＬＯ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yazanmg/,74,29,1,"9,536.3",March,"20,",632,4,1,"Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:1. Loading screens take forever.2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.6. The f*cking loading screens X___X7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make. 11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).15. And shark cards can gobble my balls._________________________________________________________________Other than that, this game is an awesome game and very addicting, totally worth the money, you'll have tons of fun, especially in online mode, I promise :D"

147,Master Manan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Manan669/,246,24,0,"2,532.1",July,"29,",47,14,1,"The singleplayer is great, funny, interesting, relatively balanced, has plenty of biting satire, details, etc. etc...But anyone who has yet to buy this game ought to understand: singleplayer isn't the Rockstar's focus. It's GTA Online, which is an absolute dumpster fire of an experience. It's unbalanced, annoying, and often designed to be irritating in hopes you'll pay for the privilege of the game becoming fun, instead of just being a good experience on its own. All the content they've made for over five years is for multiplayer -- including the vehicles that WOULD work just fine in singleplayer if you put them there; they went out of their way to add a kill switch that removes them from the game if you dare try them out. Thankfully on PC that's laughably easy to mod around, but know that they put in the effort to withhold that from you.One in five times, game softlocks loading into GTA Online(which takes forever, even with an SSD). It's always fun wasting more than five minutes on loading that will never end... It's much harder to catch on to when you expect such long load times in the first place.Get on, and immediately get bombarded with job notifications and in-game telemarketers and e-mails. The job notifications you can at least silence(every time you launch the game). E-mails and telemarketers will only give you peace if you buy whatever it is they're selling, and if you're starting from scratch, that's an  investment of several-hundred IRL hours or dollars to get your hands on one of every(baseline, un-upgraded) facility, just to make the obnoxious, perpetually-outstretched hand begging for microtransaction money to go away... Until the next DLC comes out and there's something else to sell.Buy one of the businesses that you're constantly nagged about, and you'll have the pleasure of keeping them supplied and safe in order to aggregate supplies for you to sell for profit. This could actually be nice -- missions in freemode to steal supplies. Firefights, car chases, the works. Sounds like Grand Theft Auto! Well, it *would* be nice, if every business didn't have the MO of literally painting a red target on you for everyone in the server and saying, 'Hey! Kill this person and get a negligible amount of cash and RP!' Almost every freemode business endeavor that gives a worthwhile amount of money is made as tedious as possible. Any jerk using something faster than a turtle and stronger than a cap gun can rush over -- while you're driving a literal FedEx delivery truck up a mountain -- immediately kill you, and earn for themselves about a tenth of the value of the stock you're carrying (which took you two hours to accrue). The hope is you'll realize how unfun that ""game"" is, and pay MORE money to make the game better for yourself instead of taking your money elsewhere (which lots of people are... okay with doing these days?).Ah, and there's of course the hackers, which are especially bad on the PC version of GTA Online. You'll find those in every session with four or more people -- no exaggeration. They'll get their kicks blowing you up on the spot over and over again, attacking you in while they're in godmode, teleporting into your vehicle and controlling it(or just halting it in place permanently), softlocking your game, kicking you from sessions, force-crashing your game, among other things. I had a real charmer the other day spamming hard-R n-words in the chat, and when I tried to report him, I was immediately hit with a network error and booted into singleplayer. They can literally detect your reports, block them, and boot you from the game -- automatically, on the spot. Lots of these exploits have been in the game since 2013, and hackers are only banned in non-negligible numbers of when the game receives a major update... Once every few months. Any given time more than one or two weeks after an update, it'll be infested once again.Once you properly get IN a lobby, hang up on all the telemarketers, and hackers are bothering someone else for the time being... you'll likely just get a non-hacker using absurdly overpowered equipment come to harass you, instead. Anyone who doesn't already have the money and tools from playing the game a long time will get absolutely demolished by people looking to attack them, with their only recourse being Passive Mode(AKA agree to not be able to do 85% of what you normally could until leaving Passive). Incessantly harassing defenseless low-level players is a common pastime for people with overpowered equipment, a familiar concept for anyone who's played a game with moderation this poor; it's an excellent environment for players who enjoy being toxic. Around once a year, Rockstar will add some expensive gadget that makes fending off attackers miserable or impossible unless you also have the expensive, overpowered gadget; the Hydra, the Insurgent, the Oppressor, Explosive Snipers, the Deluxo, the Oppressor Mk II, the bloody Orbital Cannon. Oh, yeah -- that's another thing. People with enough money and the right facility can literally just nuke you from orbit and insta-kill you nearly anywhere on the map. No warning, no counter, you just better just memorize the location of every facility people MIGHT do that from and hide underground if anyone is in one.TL;DRI could write a book on all the reasons new players should take their money elsewhere. The game hasn't been balanced for seven years. If you don't already have the foothold of being level 120 with $10m in the bank, it'll cost you a LOT of time or real-life money to get to the part where the game can maybe be fun."
148,DutchFurnace,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003112328/,665,68,0,493.3,February,"10,",238,49,1,"I will never buy another Rockstar game again, I simply can't because they don't give me any other option.Last year I got banned from online play. No, I'm not a cheater or hacker, which is why I'm writing this negative review.What I assume happened is the following;I hadn't played GTA since launch, but came across the ""LSPD"" mod on youtube. It's a mod that allows you to play as police singleplayer. I installed GTA and the mod and had a couple days of fun. I'm sure I accidentally pressed Online play with the mod loaded once, but killed the game right away. Then I uninstalled GTA via steam, and didn't play for -months-. The Christmas holidays came around, I had some spare time and installed GTA again. I played Online for an hour and got a 30day ban. I initially had no idea why, and no idea to find out, as there's zero response from support about bannings other than an automated response saying all bans are final. And to be honest I didn't care too much as I had only played for an hour, and didn't feel invested. I considered GTA5 Online to simply be broken. I uninstalled GTA again via steam and didn't think about it.But a couple weeks later my brother said he had gotten GTA5 during the steam christmas sales. So we waited for my 30day ban to be over, and had a week of fun playing the game. But then exactly 7 days to the dot after the 30 day ban was over, I got a permaban. I assume I got flagged for another ban the second I logged in again and simply had some kind of 7 day cooldown timer. Or perhaps they have/had a weekly (un)banwave I was ""lucky"" enough to play in between.Again I tried to contact support, again no response but the automated one.I tried asking for help on the forums, but there I got called a lying cheater, and actually harrassed by people, so gave up on that quickly.While googling for answers, I came across the LSPD mod again, which reminded me I had tried it before. I had a eureka moment, searched my computer, and came across some residual LSPD files from MONTHS, and a couple of full game reinstalls ago. I tried to contact support again, but still no human response. I gave up.Forward to now.After getting constantly reminded on Youtube about GTA5 videos of clearly modded ONLINE play, I'm still pissed I got banned for what I can only assume were some residual files from a mod that didn't affect my online game at all.And let's not forget, anyone who has ever played GTA5 Online, knows it's FULLLLL of REAL hackers/cheaters constantly messing up everyone's game by teleporting them around, killing whole servers, even dropping hacked money ontop of you. So I figured I'd see if Rockstar support had gotten any better since last year.To my surprise there's now a ""I don't want to get banned"", support request option. I'm pretty sure that wasn't there last year, so I at least got my hopes up on finally figuring out WHY I got banned. What's a better purpose for the ""I don't want to get banned"" support request than someone who doesn't know why he was banned and wants to prevent it from happening again. But no, just another automated message saying all bans are final and cannot be appealed, even though I wasn't asking for an appeal. My second support request, stating my first request wasn't a ban appeal but an inquiry with information about my first ban because ""I don't want to get banned, again"", got the same automated message saying all bans are final.Listen, don't get me wrong. If the anticheat system detected those residual files as malicious, I totally deserved the first ban. BUT.- I reinstalled the game several times. Technically I didn't do anything to the new installs, it did that to itself by not cleaning the folders it uses and not protecting itself from outside influences on a fresh install.- I had no way of figuring out why I got banned the first time, so no way to prevent it from happening again. I'm still only guessing it were those files. The only victims of not letting people know why they are getting banned by an ""anticheat"" system, are people who have no idea why the anticheat singled them out because they weren't actually cheating. I mean, mister l33th4xx0r can hack as much as he wants till his first ban, and then has a good idea what to do to not let it happen again. - Support is nonexistant, not for ""I want you guys to have a look at my ban"", nor ""Can you at least help me to not get banned again"", despite having a specific ticket request option for it.- Again, both youtube and the game itself are FULL of real actual hackers/cheaters, and people using non malicious mods online seemingly for long periods of time with no risk, or even sense of wrongdoing, of getting banned during online play.I think it's simple;GTA5 has so many players, but also so many real hackers/cheaters, that they ban such an enormous amount of people every week, with thousands of them making false ban appeals, that they can't search, and perhaps don't care, to look for those few who deserve a second opinion because the banning is perhaps the result of an over zealous anticheat program on their side. So I simply cannot buy another Rockstar game again, nor recommend it to anyone else. If I can't get support to at least figure out why I got banned, it may happen again in the future, and it may happen to you."

The online aspect of this game has always been one thing and that is promising, I remember getting home excited on the 1st of October in 2013 (Crazy to think that that is 6 years ago almost) and loading into GTA: Online for the very first time, making my at the time god awful character (anybody who has played the old gen gta games can vouch that the character creator was even worse than it is now) and being so excited at this new world of possibilities, fast forward 2 weeks and this was all that myself and a bunch of my close friends would play, we would sink days on end into just roaming around the map having fun.The world to us was limitless and we never got bored. I remember being the last one in my friend group to reach level 75 and unlocking rooftop rumble which we proceeded to grind until each of us was at least level 120 to unlock the last bit of content. After that all my friends kind of lost interest in the game, but not me. I started a hobby of collecting unique cars and meeting people and we would have car meets by the Los Santos Customs. This was an amazing thing for the then 16 year old boy whom I was. I still remember the excitement of the first christmas event when we woke up and the whole map was covered in snow, it was like an entire new experience.One of the first games I got on my brothers ps4 was also to no surprise GTA V and again it was like a second wind to the game, there were more features on making your character look unique and the big one bigger lobbies and more new content to come. I played this on and off every time new content came out because I had my original character from my PS3 and they had a lot of money which I worked way too hard for, so the moment the DLC came out I would go on experience it buy all the clothing, cars, and properties I wanted and then played for a few days before leaving the game again.During the 2019 Summer sale a few friends bought the game and I caved and got it as well, this was after a 4 year hiatus from the game so there was a lot to take in. I immediately got back to grinding away to get a high rank so I could unlock all that the game had to offer as well as to make money to again buy all the things I wanted. This led to me being up until 2 am on most nights for a few weeks just getting the most progress that I could. After making my way to Rank 100 and being satisfied I ran into a griefer who also had a mod menu at his disposal, he stated that everyone should make their way to the airport in game as he is going to be dropping money for people. I told him that I am fine since it was 2 am for me and I did not need his money. I was completely satisfied with working hard for my money. This person then dropped 2 bags of cash on me using their mod menu, then in game I saw my cash go up by $2 billion. I decided to log off because I didn't know what to do, and as I was attempting to write an email to rockstar support to ask if I could get this money removed from my account that's when I received the single most pathetic copy and paste email of my life stating that I have been banned for 30 days, this definitely made me feel betrayed as I was wrongfully banned for something that a lot of other people also get wrongfully banned. Fast forward to the 12th of August and I got my access to GTA online back and I did the one thing I knew would keep me happy, I continued to grind with the free content I was given from buying the Premium Online edition of the game (To anyone looking to play online this is a great purchase) and I made my way back the where I was at least in rank withing 2 weeks again. I was happy with helping friends with their import and export missions and just all round messing around in the game. That was until today when I helped a friend deliver cargo for their Business as they had just started out. After the delivery I decided to modify a car that I had been looking to find for a very long time. After I finished modifying my car and making my way to my friend to show him this car, I got interrupted by a haunting message. You have been permanently banned from GTA Online. Please return to GTA V. This was followed shortly by the aforementioned copy and paste email but this one changed to say permanently.Now I know that I was playing legitimately and I was not cheating so I do not know why I got banned, however I do know one thing. The people behind GTA Online do not care about people cheating in their games, you will spend a lot of your time trying to escape people who have godmode or aimbots or just people who are caging you and all round stopping you from enjoying your  game. Those people might never get banned and if they do they will just buy a new account off of sites like ♥♥♥ and get back to making money by modding peoples accounts. But if you are a legit player who spends a lot of time grinding to get money. You are more likely to get banned by them. I will never be supporting Rockstar Games again and that is a shame because as many of the other people who grew up with games, their games have always had a soft spot in my heart."

The trio get together and perform all sorts of daring heists and escapades.The game is action-packed with chases, gang shootouts, and intense heists that get crazier as the game goes on.When you're not robbing a convenience store or shooting rednecks, you can partake in all sorts of activities. You can walk your dog—Chop, go golfing, play tennis, and even get a lap dance at the strip club (Sorry Roman, there's no bowling)!The GTA Online Protagonist can be created according to the taste of the player to customize (gender or appearance). The player will choose a gender, then choose the parents and grandparents of the character to affect his/her appearance. Then, the player chooses how much the character spends his/her daily life; this will create the initial stats for the character and slightly change the appearance.After you have finished creating your character, you arrive in Los Santos with an open welcome by Lamar Davis (Especially if you're a female). He then has you do a street race with him (and other new players, if available), and shows you to Gerald, a drug runner who'll give you easy jobs to start you off in Los Santos. After you complete this tutorial, you'll join a free roam session with up to 32 other players (Who'll either become your friend or your enemy).There are multiple game modes in Online, including:There are multiple glitches in GTA Online, some are funny and weird, the others are exploits and game-breaking.

But for this game I’m willing to bother, mainly because of the  that this game possesses. Single player is great sure, but online is such a bigger part of this game now, most people play it just for that mode. But I’m sure you’ve seen other reviews saying: “modders have ruined it!” and “online is no fun cos of hackors!”.Well that’s because it’s true. All of it.Allow me to put this as realistically as possible.I have amassed a total of 420 hours on GTAV. Didn’t play the campaign, I had already done that when it first arrived on console. No, these hours are mainly online play. I’ve grinded mission after mission to earn the cash. I’ve spent hours buying, customizing and completing challenges. I now have a profile that has all the levelled unlocks, cars and guns you could ever want, making it a very hard earned profile.HOWEVER, I have now lost most (if not all) of my desire to switch this game on, and I’m sure you have a pretty good idea of why that is. Nether the less, I shall give you an example of a typical session of online play if you were to enter the game today (which let’s face it, is the main reason why we play it).Enter my first match. > begin attempt to have fun. > Player arrives on a bike and kills me to death. > very well, I shall retaliate by firing a rocket at his bike. > Rocket hits.  > But wait, the player didn’t die. > Then quickly learn from further attempts and other players that he is using God-mode > I then attempt to use the player menu to ‘vote to kick’ him, as others were attempting to do the same thing  > Turns out he has used a mod that removes his name from the player list, making it impossible to kick him out of the match. > I then call him out for using Mods (with restraint to call him many, many things) > At this point he proceeds to delete my car and spawn 100,000 things on my head, making my game crash to desktop (and probably anyone else who was near-by in game).Now after lots and lots of match surfing, I can quite confidently state the following with applied calculation and experience: So to give you an evaluation:Prepare to have unfair play, have your things deleted, and get crashed to desktop by modder’s whenever you challenge their actions, because Rockstar will never regulate and control this issue.You can enjoy being invincible, gank on players then delete everyone’s things, and if they call you out you can just crash everyone, because you are a big man and Rockstar will never regulate or control this issue. Then they’ll write negative reviews, losing the game its popularity to a point where it just becomes garbage. Then you’ll have it all to yourself, and your mission to alienate everyone from online play will be complete.To quote another game (that I would recommend more tbh):“Well done Stanley, everyone thinks you’re very powerful.”P.S - The second biggest issue is the micro-transactions, and rockstar's ever vigilant attempt to take in-game money from you in order to force you into buying shark cards with real money. but that needs a whole review in itself to detail that issue (which i really dont have the time in my life for).   My only hope is that enough people will see this review and get it to the bench, so that maybe some people will decide not to ruin this game with bad modder/hacker behaviour.Rockstar did a ban wave and disabled the ability to use console (apparently), soo... yay?Wonder if my moaning review had some sort of effect, anyway im going to leave this here just as a principle.Well here we are again. Rockstar have dropped the ball and now modder/hackers/whatever you wanna call them, have returned. Its worse than ever now. Back to the drawing board...."
166,UN0W3N,https://steamcommunity.com/id/UN0W3N/,162,9,1,225.4,November,"18,","16,572",15,1,"The embodiment of gaming's self-irony. Mocking corporate greed until you start showcasing that precise trait in real life. That is how Grand Theft Auto 5 can be summarised, at least as far as I'm concerned. Out of sheer boredom rather than explicit intention, I've decided to review a title I still hold in high regard even if it's starting to feel more and more like an excruciating, guilty pleasure with each passing year of its far prolonged ""shelf life"". The catalyst for this article was reading recently that GTA V has sold over 170 million units in nine years since release. I played it since day one, on the PS3 and 2013 now seems like a far cry from current world circumstances. I would lie if I claimed that I didn't have a boatload of fun within this condensed open world, yet I must warn you that I shall only  write about the singleplayer component which I have completed several times by this point.Yes, covering just the part that's been an afterthought for Rockstar Games, since their dear cash cow is still being represented by Grand Theft Auto Online. If you're looking for hate or praise in regards to Shark Cards and the ""organised chaos"" of multiplayer GTA V, this isn't the right place. I have no desire to indulge in it, even if I may have some strong feelings for the practice itself. Suffice to say, I've been a GTA fan for almost 25 years, which means I'm one of those ""dinosaurs"" that enjoyed the series before it went 3D and left its mark upon the gaming industry. Out of respect for those countless hours of entertainment this franchise has provided me, I shall allow it the benefit of doubt in regards to its uncertain future as a singleplayer experience. I truly want Rockstar to prove me wrong.From a narrative perspective, you'll either find GTA V's story to be a step forward or a side step from the gritty realism of its predecessor. My jury's still out, yet I am certain of one thing: I enjoyed the new approach encompassing multiple protagonists. That was the right move in terms of finally bringing a novelty factor towards the same rags-to-riches pattern exhibited since GTA III. Not all our current anti-heroes start poor and clueless this time around. Some are even likeable, once you role play with them a bit.While they still share law breaking proclivities, their personalities are fairly fleshed out, so they can no longer be boiled down to just ""thugs with ties to organised crime"" like in previous GTA entries. The 2013 renditions of Los Santos and Blaine County are no longer linked to San Fierro or Las Venturas like in 2004's map of San Andreas, but it would be a mistake to consider the playground smaller. It is in both larger and more condensed.Chock-full of interesting locations and walking caricatures. Without a doubt, the map is the fourth character and the one you'll interact with the most, no matter how often you switch between the three official main characters. Hiking off the beaten path and into the wilderness, should still be excercised with caution, as cougars can spawn fast and they'll one-shot kill (more like tear you to pieces) unless you spot them in time. Hunter becoming prey is a nice twist and this title is filled with occasions turning tropes upside down.  The Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, abbreviated as RAGE is state of the art and proprietary to its developer. No surprise given the massive popularity of Grand Theft Auto and the near limitless budgets which Rockstar titles can enjoy. While stability can't be guaranteed on launch day, it's mostly smooth sailing after a patch or two. By 2022, you can't expect any technical issues from GTA V, if you have a decent enough system adhering to the recommended specs.A sight to behold, if you can max it out and it's making my task very easy in terms of disabling the HUD at will and going crazy with the screenshots. Still resumed myself to a number shy of 300 images for my official showcase, but I surely archived twice as many pics by the time I had reached story progress and side activities to 100%.Never a dull moment, trust me on that. The ""vanilla"" textures and assets are still passable, but if the system can handle it, dip your toes into some visual mods. First person perspective on PC was a delight, coming from the PS3 version. GTA titles have been shining through their talented voice actors since 2001. With no exception, whether we're talking Hollywood actors past their prime or ""illustrious nobodies"" skyrocketing to fame (and online harassment sometimes). It sounds convincing and amusing even in situations when these games try to act all serious.No cause for complaints. And that can only be highlighted by stellar choices in terms of soundtrack. My love for '80s music started with GTA III and reached maturity by the time Vice City was all the rage. I'm forever grateful to this series for shaping my tastes in music.The true heist only takes place after you've completed all the heist missions, if you play your cards right. And you should, as gaming the stock market is highlighting a very real concern in regards to our society today. The real crooks are sharply dressed and strolling around in their ""ivory tower"" skyscrapers. Manipulating the stock markets and banking system for their own selfish interests. What you rob during the story's heist missions will be little more than peanuts in comparison to what you'll score once you ""gently push"" the markets in your favor. Save Lester's Assassination side missions until you've finished the rest of the story. You can then find guides on how to maximize your payout. By the end of it all, you'll have more cash than stuff to spend it on. Just be patient and don't go on a shopping spree prior to manipulating the stocks. It may even open your eyes on how that world and ours truly operate. Only thing missing after that is a ""career in politics"" DLC. Or any sort of additional content for GTA V in fact.DLC plans were obviously scrapped to make way for the lucrative Online modes. Still won't throw shade on them even if a single hour of multiplayer was enough in my case. Different strokes for different blokes. More SP heists would have been nice.You certainly don't need anyone telling you how to play a GTA entry, right? Obeying the traffic laws isn't a very high priority. Mission diversity is guaranteed and the cutscenes almost give the Metal Gear series a run for its money. If only they'd be just as lengthy.Overall, I am not surprised that Grand Theft Auto V has stood ""the test of time"" for nearly a decade. The singleplayer component alone, is superior to all open world competitors focusing on contemporary urban tales. They don't call them ""GTA clones"" without a good reason, of course.I've played a lot of open world titles, since it became a favorite genre of mine. Also thanks to GTA, some two decades ago. Much has changed, even Rockstar itself. I won't be entirely pessimistic about what the future may hold and regardless of that, make sure you enjoy GTA V's story before heading to Online and never looking back.+ Steam Achievements.+ Replay value overload.+ Excellent story & characters.+ Gorgeous graphics and sounds.- No Steam Trading Cards."

The game is okay, but this ""No Modding Policy"" is ridiculous and I will not stand for it. *EDIT* They eventually relented and changed their stance on modding but I will be leaving the original part of the review up. The campaign is a great campaign and worth playing. The multiplayer used to be good but honestly I cannot in good faith recommend the multiplayer. So, if you are getting this for singleplayer and mods, go for it. If you are getting this for multiplayer, it just isn't good in my opinion.

I can't say too much about single-player. However, on multiplayer / online mode, with all of these updates coming out, it seems like EVERYONE is getting banned online for doing NOTHING! Whether you are modding or innocent, it doesnt matter at all! Innocent people are getting banned for something that another person has done that is out of their control (example: modder dropping tons of money to player)Even if you do the tiniest bit of grinding and pull out a shopping spree with friends, Rockstar will just think that you're hacking because they will think you somehow magically pulled out $3.6M+ out of your crotch to pay for a luxary apartment with nice decorations.Worst part about this is: you are unable to appeal your ban because it's a final decision by them. Rockstar WILL ROB YOU for your money!Customer support SUCKS because when I tried to get support from a legit person (instead of getting an automatic message), they just threw out / deleted my support ticket like it was nothing when I just asked why bans are non-appealable and pointed out to them that their EULA & Policies are a little out of date. That is NOT a way to treat customers! Seriously, as of right now (10/30/2018) when i'm typing this review, they havent updated their TOS for almost 1 year now. Rockstar WILL swallow your money just like any other gaming communities that do not give 2 $#!&$ about you. Rockstar expects you to call them a gaming business? I will just call them a fraud company that produces pay to win video games (just like EA for most people). This was once a great game, but nowdays, it's just a huge disappointment with a big fan base.I guess it's a good thing that I purchased this for cheap when it was on sale, but DO NOT pay for this game at full price!I wish I can file for a refund, but sadly, I can't do that.If you are looking for a fun game to play with friends that is similar to GTA V, play/purchase Garry's Mod!"
178,Dr.Badass,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bsw2142/,176,6,0,229.9,November,"18,",195,5,1,"I hate to have to give this game a negative. I really do, flat out makes me tired of it having to do so. It's a fun game, great map, wonderful level of detail, amazing amount of things to do. The single player story is awesome and if you plan on buying it for the single player I would recommend it. Played it during the PS3-era and really enjoyed it. Even online at the time it was fun. But on to headache of why I have to give this a negative. Shark-Cards. Paying real money to get yourself in-game currency. I think it's trashed this game significantly. I get it, yea Rockstar you somehow need to make money to keep this game active and for the free DLC you've been providing thats available for all players. First off. The price of these Shark-Cards and how much you get out of them. $100 for 8 million. Come on. Really? That buys you 2-3 top-tier vehicles tops because you have everything inflated in the market making it practically a grind nightmare. Hell, the Megalagon gets you halfway to a Yacht that's priced at 16 million. Literally, $200 worth of Shark-Cards for a single Yacht that you can't even drive around. From what I hear the things practically pointless and all you can do on it is change your clothes and sleep. Like if Rockstar did this the standard way and sold their DLC it would literally be priced at a couple or even several hundred dollars in their world. Or hell, $200 for a single thing that serves you literally no purpose. And I’m scared to even look up how amount of in-game currency I have to even get in order to buy every vehicle that's released in these DLC’s. Literally a massive grind nightmare.Which leads to my 2nd point on Shark-Cards. Like, lets say I magically have the money to afford and waste on a couple thousand dollars worth of Shark-Cards (Rockstars Wet Dream). Than what? As a 90's gamer what in the hell is the point of doing anything like player missions, heists, cargo missions, etc if I already have everything provided cause I paid real cash for it. Maybe have fun doing them all once with really nice stuff, but that isn't really all that long to do and you have absolutely nothing to strive for in-game cause you already have everything...Thirdly, Rockstar will do anything to this game and at all cost to get you to buy a Shark-Card. Raise prices of new vehicles and really just about everything they add. Lower payouts on missions not to mention long cool-off times so you’re not making so much so fast.. Increase costs of practically everything and make sure that it remains high for you, and I’ll continue on that and why I mentioned it. Their whole world revolves on whatever it takes to getting you to buy a friggin Shark Card. It, just sucks frankly.Now on to the CEO work. Ugh. This system that they have going on here, just doesn’t work. Nobody in their right mind is going to be your associate or bodyguard with these payouts. Nobody. Maybe if you can trick a scrub into working for you a bit before they realize they can make more money doing their own thing. Seriously, it isn’t worth it. There's absolutely no incentive for people to work for you… but against you. Now that's when a bigger grind nightmare happens because every player in session is bound to screw you up. Like Special-Cargo for example, all it takes is one player in a fancy Hydra and its over. You’ve lost tens if not hundreds of thousands on all this cargo that didn’t make you jack in the end. Which leads to people especially us PC gamers to resource monitor the hell out of a full public session and play it absolutely alone. And that sucks too. To fill a 111 crate warehouse would take you days worth of gameplay if done alone and hell a week’s worth doing one crate at a time to give you the better profit margin. Like what is this Rockstar? A job? Its supposed to be a game. Not everybody has that amount of free time like I do sadly. But if you have $20 to spend on a Shark Card it will give you close to the amount you’d make… and that gives you really nothing that's going to help you grind. Vehicle cargo literally blows me away. Never have I felt so ripped off in a video game making on average 75k profit selling… a supercar that markets for close to 3 million. I’m sorry. What? And what you have to go through to source a car with NPC’s left, right and helicopters shooting and crashing into you to make sure the repair costs rack up. You’ll have a similar story doing VIP work. I find it so dumb. That the only thing worth doing in all that is cocaine and that accounts for a small margin of what else you can do. And their payouts literally are not worth the cost.So thankfully I saw right through those shark cards and never bought one. Infact I’m proud I never gave Rockstar that satisfaction. For the sake of GTA6 and the future of GTA Online I have to give this a negative review. This turn the Gaming Industry has taken the past few years is just depressing. It's definitely not what it used to be. But hell Rockstar may never read this or even consider a thing if they did cause it's all about profit and statistics now. Guess I’ve made my point."

If your purchasing this game for the single player experience, then I can assure you that it'll be quite fun and immersive. Along with modding, and the FiveM application, you'll be in for a great time. Though, for now lets get into the review.I've can say that I'm more then qualified to give a proper review for GTA Online, which for most people can become the REAL reason they are grabbing this game. Right from the start, I can easily say that GTA Online is a great and overall fun to experience. There is a lot to do, in almost any department... if your playing with friends. With friends, the PvE of this game can be amazing. A very massive variety of missions, heists, racing, and freemode content. Working to gain more level, unlock weapons and cars, earning money and investing it on whatever you please. It can be quite the grind, I will advise that right now, but if your with buddies, it can be great and worth the time. This game does have some P2W elements, but this can be easily voided with some dedication. As for a solo player... I would advise you to look pass the game and find something else. GTA Online can be quite dull, and boring for the solo player. Most missions require multiple people, and will pair you with random players. While this might sound good... it has negatives. Some missions require multiple people, players leaving during heists can result in the game ending immediately, which gets very, very frustrating. Freemode activities, such as businesses or organizations require multiple people as well. You CAN do it alone... but there is no fun in doing such.The PvP side of this game is at the most possible, worst state it's ever been in. Any new player coming into the game is going to get curve stomped into the ground due to level advantage, and lack of equipment. Even for players that are fully equipped, such as myself, the game's PvP is still a mess. Meta vehicles such as the Oppressor MK1 and MK2 flood online, along with meta weapons such as the explosive sniper and shotgun. Tryhards exist in this game, if you thought that they were horrible in other games, you've seen nothing until you play GTA Online. There almost so much more things I can ramble on about as well in terms of the game's PvP, but I'm going to cut it short, cause this review is getting a bit long. GTA Online PvP is a horrible, degrading steaming mess that I advise you not to touch with a ten feet pole.Modders also plague GTA Online. In almost every single session I've joined in the past few weeks and months, there seems to be a hacker with in every single one. I won't go into depth what they are capable of, but I can say it's quite bad.Final words? GTA Online is great, if you avoid PvP and play with friends in private sessions. Playing alone, your not going to have a lot of fun with the game. I've played since 2013, and there is so much I can say that they've done to this game for better and worse. The choice is yours, but my overall opinion on the game is to avoid it unless your going for role playing and modding on FiveM, or single player."

People do that to trick you into giving you steam points (the steam currency) by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, lies and deceipt.""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."""

I didn't buy a shark card. I didn't hack. I didn't exploit. I grinded for several hours using the methlab to get 6 million dollars legitimately. I was going for 10 million so I could buy a yacht. Stupid investment, I know, but I really wanted that damn boat.And I woke up one morning, and got a message that said that Rockstar noticed an ""anomalous cashflow pattern"" in my account, and they had ""adjusted it accordingly"" All my money, except for about $2000, was gone.I got in contact with a customer service rep on the forums, and she informed me that the server reported that I was earning way too much money way too quickly to be playing legitimately, and told me that if I wanted my money back, I should just buy a shark card. She refused to give me back my money, refused to transfer me to a superior, and warned me that if I didn't drop the issue, I would be banned for cheating.Admittedly, at this point I started testing her, so she left the chat, and when I tried to contact another customer service rep, I was unable to, because, as expected, I was permanently banned from the Rockstar forums. I also received a 2-month ban from GTA Online.I know the singleplayer's good. I know the game is polished, and I know that I'm not the best player out there. This isn't about any of that. This is about a large game company using microtransactions to effectively hold hours worth of hard work for ransom. Rockstar has gone down the path of EA and Ubisoft in how much they treat their customers like dirt, and I don't want to just stand by and watch helplessly. I know this review isn't going to do anything, but it's better than doing nothing."

Considering I ported my character over from Xbox 360, it should be at least double that. So lets say 700 hours. I have spent aproximately 700 hours playing this video game.Yet I cannot recommend it. Yes I have had some of the best gaming I've ever had with this game. I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign, I played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside. I even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card. I was there for the DNS glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur, and I was there when they cut literally everyone's funds to 500,000 as a ""fix""But one day I was playing and some guy joins the server, forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him, freezes us, and makes bags of money rain from the sky. Don't get me wrong, I'm not stupid, I know people hack and people give out money. I've seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc. I've generally ignored them, but this guy didn't give me much of a choice. Regardless once I figured out what was happening I left the server. I didn't want the money in my bank so I blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up. A couple hours later I was temporarily banned and my character was reset. I lost all of my cars, including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched, not to mention the majority of that 700 hours I'd put into having a character I liked. Rockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me. My ingame wallet was raped and they decided to blame the victim.There was no way for me to voice my displeasure to Rockstar. No appeals process for them to hear my case, check the evidence, and see my innocence. That was several months ago. I uninstalled the game and let it go. I'm only writing this now so that others can see what they're getting into. Yes, as I've said, this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content. From an objective standpoint, its very good value for money and the free, regular, DLC is a nice touch. What ruins all of that is the way Rockstar treats its customers. There's no consistency, and no compassion. I know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and they've never had any trouble. Yet it happens to me once, without my consent, and I get temp banned and lose literally everything. What motivation is there to play legitimately then? If people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision, and those who don't can get away with it indefinitely. Hell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience. Rockstar, if you actually end up reading this, please start treating your customers with some compassion. Don't assume we're all hackers."

Now you can run your businesses in private sessions, which completely circumvents the prices for things. I have made about 12 mil in the past week with my buddies. My prior review, I complained about making 12 mil in 100 hours of hardcore grinding. The difference is that I haven't felt like the game was a job, and I put half as many hours into it.The Online is totally worth it if you have friends, there is easily 100+ hours of content available, and the singleplayer is as good as it was at launch. if you had hesitations, don't worry about it."

But for this I make an exception ;)You're probably wondering to yourself. How does one of the highest grossing games of all time get mixed customer reviews on steam despite the PC edition coming out 3 years after the console version? You might be wondering if they care about your custom, or if some decrepit fat cat just wants your money so they can go retire on a mulitmillion $ yacht someplace and not give a damn. Well, I'm not sure I can answer all those concerns, but I'll try my best.->Fan since 1997 (21 years). ->Buy pretty much every GTA for full price including pre-ordering. Buy GTA 5 twice, once console, 5 years later PC.->Did not allow me to transfer my console 110 rank character. Ok fine, doesn't make sense, but okay... I roll with it...->They randomly erase legit [no cheat, no glitch, no mod money] PC character (300+ rank, effectively 410+ rank if you add my console character) after 1200 hours of brutally accurate grinding and rare achievement accomplishment (1/500 players) and false ban, NO REASON GIVEN. Meanwhile sessions constantly filled with cheaters at every turn. Real cheaters on forums pointing out they have never been banned...->People who money glitched and accepted Mod money never banned. FACT!->Terribly glitchy and lazy development, recycled missions, interface glitches, game crashes, unstable sessions, infinite loads->Zero customer service and support, pointlessly outsourced to clueless external company that copy and pastes answers where you can communicate with their uneducated, low paid slave goons.->I spent hundreds of hours teaching noobs to play. Literally, 3 minute missions can sometimes take one hour or more due to disconnects and noobs (and pronoobs). -If you don't have many friends online, expect to wait for hours to fill up your game lobby sometimes, and await your impending character erasure.->Never once used passive mode, and cannot remember ever destroying someone's product (why should I?).Legit, honest, pro players are collateral damage. One of my worst gaming experiences in about 3 decades of gaming? A game built for noobs and suckers to spend real money on microtransactions and wreck the missions of good and honest players. But games are not banks to me, they're entertainment and challenge. Oops!But if that wasn't enough. The game will have you scratching your head with waste of time philosophical questions such as: How do you NOT accidentally glitch in a glitchy piece of garbage with cheaters running around every corner? (Oh wait! $2000 for good behaviour in a crime game, yey! WT*?)Don't let yourself be caught in the cycle of addiction. Let this 5 year old dinosaur of a game run it's course and lay to rest. Forget about it. This game is not worth it. Your life is worth more than this. Maybe pick this game up from the trashheap some time, but sure as hell don't fill their pockets with £50 full price just so u can be thrown into a glitchy mess that is designed to try to squeeze money out of you like water from a rock.

I mean seriously, when did we start believing people who were banned, just because they say they're innocent? 90% of these new negative reviews are unfounded and outright lies. Not only that, but they have no changed the EULA, either. If you have a DLL injector installed in your game directory, it DOESN'T MAGICALLY STOP WORKING WHEN YOU GO ONLINE. Just because you don't use it, it's STILL there. YOUR OWN FAULT.Like seriously, when did people get dumb enough to think an anti cheat wouldn't pick up DLL INJECTORS? DLL INJECTORS ARE THE MOST COMMON WAY HACKS EXIST. *headdesks* There are two groups of people - actual cheaters, who got banned from online for cheating using the scripthook and trainer (dll injection), and then there's people who only used it in single player but left it installed when they went online. Newsflash - it's still there, it's still injected into the games memory.In any case, the game is great. There's a few speed bumps and quirks here and there that need to be worked out, as with any game so soon after launch, but overall it performs great, online is fun, and you can mod single player. Not really a lot more you can ask for, amirite?9/10, because I don't believe in perfect scores.P.S. Stop being idiots.Edit: In light of a few ignorant jackasses, here's the proof:But by all means - let's just believe the banned people because they said ""they didn't do it"".

Graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible. The game runs smooth on any kind of GPU's and CPU's as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements. By the way, these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details.2. Graphic details are the best I have seen, especially in an open-world game. If I was to tell you all about this topic, I would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours, because boy there are lots to talk about. I'm just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me. a)  Sure this is not something new in its essence, it has been done before and not just in GTA, but the way we see it here it's what's amazing. The way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it's off the charts. You don't even realize when the afternoon becomes evening. The only way you can tell, it's that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you.b)  Again, not a new feature, actually is quite an old one  the way it's been reproduced in GTAV ... You can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact. Apart from the obvious, what makes rain so special in GTAV ? Well, . This is something that not many people talk about, yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game.The way Rockstar Games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain (besides everything else).c)  Sure we had night in GTA IV and even before that, so why do I mention this ? Well, because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows. I am not talking just about the graphics aspect. What I'm saying is that the night in GTAV gives you the impression of actual liveliness; the whole city comes to life. It's just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever.3. Cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we've seen in previous GTA's. I'm not talking about a direct comparison, because of the obvious reason (2015-2010) but what I'm trying to say is that I personally wasn't that impressed at the time by the cars/helis/planes in GTA4 as I am now in GTAV.Gameplay and FeaturesOh yea, the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for GTAV to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come.1.  I feel like thanking Rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter. Car control was preety much garbage in GTA IV and for this reason alone I had no big expectations for this new series. Well, I was wrong. The car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing NFS MW back in the day. Besides the control, there is the sound of the car's engine which is perfectly accurate.2.  Now what in God's name I'm talking about?! Well, have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help ? A woman's that was about to get raped, a kid who's bike was stolen, hitchhiker asking you to take her/him home, etc usually for a reward. If you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal, but baby, this stuff gives GTAV a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game.3.  Again, not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special. Have you tried modifying the car's suspension? Of course you did, what am I saying! But have you actually paid attention of it's realism  the change was made? Well, for those who haven't and for the one's who dont own the game yet, let me tell you that this feature is game-making. My favorite car in GTAV is the Grotti Carbonizzare also known as the Ferarri F12. Now think, how am I gonna drive that beast on the city's roads? Especially in areas like Groove, Hilwood, Rockford. These are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads, so you cant really drive a Ferarri in these parts of the town. Well, you can. Modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn't just make for visual effects, but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads, turns, hard turns. BTW, if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn, you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings. For me, this is one of the best things I've seen in this game. 4.  Driving, mission making, robberies, flying, hunting, diving, piloting aircrafts, submarines, boats, golf, tennis, cards, smoke weed, racing, playing the stock market. You will never get bored in this game, not even in Single Player mode."

I got back into the game for 3 weeks, and 2 of these weeks were Double Money weeks for MC businesses. I bought my MC businesses, which brought me down to around 2 million. And within these 2 weeks and help with friends, I got up to 48.8 mil. And that was after I bought probably around an additional 7 million worth of stuff (Deluxo and Oppressor) during those two weeks. Felt pretty good. All legit with just watching the in-game TV and selling my businesses' products when they were full. My father and I play this game together and he's well over 200 mil (1200+ hours), all legit because of this method. Based on how much the community hates Rockstar, I'm pretty sure he was one of the last players to actually support this company. Until of course, his daughter got banned.So those 150-200ish hours from these past 2 weeks are wasted. My character will be reset after a 30 day ban. At first we had faith that Rockstar Support would lift the faulty ban as they did when the March 2018 ban wave hit hundreds of innocents. But no. Rockstar Support is such a joke. Submit a ticket about appealing a ban, and it gets closed immediately with a message from a bot. Submit a ticket about a ""game issue"" takes me to live chat support, who I have spoken to for 3 hours now. Basically just keeps giving me copy-and-paste messages that claims all these false facts like ""their ban systems are perfect"" (refer to March 2018 ban wave, refer to ""GTA VI coming in 2019"" goof, etc.). When you call Rockstar over the phone, they are all mindless robots and speak off of a script the same exact copy-and-paste messages. The customer service is awful and Rockstar will hit Rockbottom and no one but the braindead 12 year olds and manchildren will be there to support them.Rockstar never really had experience in multiplayer games anyway. GTA Online shows this with their customer service and also just how the game works in general. Loading screens typically take forever, as I can have two diarrhea attacks before I load into a game. GTA Online was actually fun, but late-game turns into Delivery Guy Simulator if you want to optimize your grind. But I just got to that point where I have enough money where I could grind and have fun without feeling like I'm losing money from not optimizing my grind enough. But I will say that GTA Online was fun before all my progress was reset for playing the game legit. If you want some fun where your progress is NOT guaranteed to be saved even if you follow the rules and do everything right, then yeah buy the game. But don't buy Shark Cards, like ever. Really. Criminal Enterprise is cool maybe but never ever Shark Cards.But if you wanna play for the story, that's cool too. But wait for it to go on sale, story ain't worth the full price."

And as of writing this, (4/5/18) we  haven't gotten any sort of proper response, that isn't some generic copy-paste nonsence.This new system appears to have been targeting cheaters, but happens to label seeming randomly people as cheaters.But you wanna know what will likely come of wiping the progress of some thousand people's charaters? More cheaters. Because, who realisticly is going to come back after a month, having lost some hundreds  -in some case thousands- of hours, of legit grinding thinking ""well, let's do that ALL over again.""And don't even get me started on their support policies. If you even MENTION the word ""ban,"" your support ticket is thrown directly into the trash, and given a generic ""bans are triggered by a number of things..."" ""and all bans are final."" Like, they give this anti-cheat so much credit that ""It can do no wrong"" in their eyes. And you're placing a losing bet if you think they will admit any sort of failure on their end.On top of all this,  you somehow get a real responce from someone, they can't/won't tell you why you were even banned. This is just plain stupid on many levels. You're just, SUPPOSTED to know what you did wrong and not do it again.This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Especially when one of the listed reasons for a ban is ""Disrupting play."" That's so incredibly vague, they could ban you for just about anything under that label.If they're banning for minor exploits/glitches, they have a lot longer list than what was banned. I guerentee at least a third of the community has exploited some glitch one time or another. And if that is so, that's some pretty backwards priorities when you STILL can't go a few hours in freeroam without bumping into a cheater.That's all I have to say. I know the general consensus on steam is/was, ""lmao, cheaters BTFO."" But I still felt the need to get my thoughts out there. And if Rockstar plans to treat their players in RedDead2 with the same respect they do GTAO players, they can just piss off. Yes, I was one of those affected. No I've never used any sort of mod, single or multiplayer. I've never sought after any sort of modded money or xp. And yes, I have used minor, non-malicious glitches in the past."

235,Expat waifu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Asian_Cowgirl/,299,11,0,"1,059.1",October,"1,",389,8,1,"Okay so, after having put in some nearly 600 hours in the game I feel its time to make a review.Graphics wise on PC, the game is pretty solid if you have the hardware required. You can see it wasn't just a straight port from consoles. The attention to detail in sounds, dialogs and everything is quite astonishing! The singleplayer story is interesting, though some characters mainly Trevor just feel kind of... forced. That is excuseable however since everything is in order and with quite some polishing put into it. There's plenty to do singleplayer wise, altough until now there is no word as to singleplayer DLC's like the episodic DLC's for GTA IV. The bad thing when it comes to singleplayer is mods. Not too long ago, the developers decided that modding this game is bad, and that you should feel bad if you mod it, pretty much killing the entire modding comunity from day to night. That has generate some huge backlash (take a look at other reviews).Now let's get to the rotten core of this review, the multiplayer aspect of the game. Now, you have to understand, when the game was just released on PC, the first week of online play was quite nice, barring server issues but even those weren't that much of a problem and most of the issues started to rise later on and most of them are still very much unadressed up until now.The first big issue is the amount of hackers in game. It was worse, but it's still quite bad. Often times you will find yourself in a lobby where you get exploded out of nowhere. Or have an UFO and other things spawned on top of your head pretty much preventing you from doing anything. You may also find that the streets and roads have turned to quick sand meaning you'll end up driving a few feet and your car will get dragged back to the starting point over and over and over again. That won't happen if you're on foot though. Shortly after you will get sniped by someone on the other side of the map as they also simultaneously snipe everyone else. You will also occasionaly  be teleported to other places or face people with machine guns that are fed with rocket belts.Other than the issues mentioned above with hackers, the main issue is hackers dropping tons of money out of the sky on top of you, most of the time also preventing you from avoiding these pickups and turning you into a millionaire by accident. On any other world this would be a good thing but it is not in GTA Online, as Rockstar has been known to occasionally ban players who receive hacked money. They don't really seem to worry much about you getting hacked XP points though, or so the community has pointed out. As of the latest hacked money wipe a lot of people who earned quite a few bucks legitimately with the double money events also had their legitimate gains wiped out with the Smuggler's run update that added hangars and a variety of helicopters and planes.Speaking of the online DLC, here's the really crippling issue, that seems to outweight the bugs, hackers and everything else with online. While the online aspect of the game is free to play and you can build your own fortune from the ground up, there are ""soft pay walls"" that will likely lock you out of the DLC content in online as it is quite frankly, extremely expensive. The most recent DLCs, Smuggler's Run and Gun Running are a very good example of one such thing, with most of the content requiring a few millions for you to purchase a hangar and the vehicles you want. If you happen to want cold war era bomber tough luck because it will cost you over 5 millions to buy it, + a few more depending on the hangar of your choice.With the gun running DLC, it's the same issue. You will need to buy a bunker in order to research the upgrades for your vehicles. Want an APC with missile launchers? You'll have to buy the bunker then research it. But here's the thing, you CANNOT choose the type of research to perform so if you're unlucky, it'll be the last thing on your list. Of course you can boost these research projects at a cost of about 220,000 each, and if you boost them all it'll cost you a whopping 11 millions in online currency. Then you will also need to buy a mobile command center WITH a vehicle workshop and then buy the APC, and then spend the money to add the missile turret to it. Oh, and it doesn't lock on aircraft.Now you may be thinking that making a few millions in this game isn't so bad... Well... it is. It really is. When you think about a tough grind, you might think of World of Tanks and it is quite a grind indeed, but it's not as bad as GTA Online's. The regular jobs you get from contacts... Sure, do them so you can get a good amount of RP, but don't trust them to net you any significant amount of money. Heists can be interesting if you're the leader, where you'll take most of the payday after the heist finale. But they're much harder and it is very difficult to find a team that will not troll you, will not act as idiots and will not generally just give you a VERY bad time.There are other options such as exporting cars once you buy the car garage, but don't exepct it to be as easy since you have to source the car, pay for the repair on it if it gets damaged, then pay for the mods if you want to sell it at a high value and then whatever damage it sustains from your warehouse to the delivery point, comes out of your commission. Oh, and expect plenty of military helicopters and jets to try and succesfully bomb your while you're delivering the car, causing you to lose money on it.You can get around this grind if you can shell out money for the shark cards. The ones that give you any real amount of money that you'd be able to actually spend on things you might like are more expensive than the game itself. And with each online DLC, odds are you'd need AT LEAST 2 or maybe 3 of that one specific card. One DLC comes to mind where the total amount of vehicles and other assets you could purchase totals in the 33,000,000 for all the content, so unless you plan on making GTA Online your full time job, you will likely not see most of the online content. The exception being if you were lucky enough to be playing it when it was released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 and where around when the ""moneypocalypse"" happened and you're pretty much an in game billionaire.And by the way, the online DLC content that comes from time to time, does not get put in the singleplayer portion of the game and you'd only be able to access with mods, which are not okay according to GTA V developers.Edit - 25/10/2017: As of recently, rockstar has announced there will be no singleplayer DLC for GTA V. Also, corrected some bad spelling and non-sensical sentences in this review.TL;DR The singleplayer portion of the game isn't bad, but don't expect any singleplayer DLC soon. The online portion is riddled with connection problems, hackers, trolls and is somewhat toxic. The DLC content for online does not get put on singleplayer and is safely tucked away behind a soft paywall (which is actually a VERY thick paywall). The only real way to get significant online currency is buying shark cards that are pretty expensive and you'd need several with each DLC to be able to access all the content."

If you value your time and sanity, make sure to skip this gameComing from a last gen console I had legitimatley earned $5million (Heists, missions, sharkcards). I moved to PC to play the new content and get new updates, and along with it I got a $1.25million Sharkcard. I spend some money here and there, and ultimatly I'm left at $3million and I decided to get back on the grind. One day I join a random lobby after finishing a mission, and the lobby happened to have a hacker who was giving away money, and put $30million into my account. Couldn't do anything about it. I contacted Rockstar Support about this and they basically said ""whatever, just keep it"". I didnt spend much from it, and put it into my second character so I could go back to trying to be legit.A couple of updates later, Rockstar removes all of my money. That includes my Sharkcard and my legitmatly earned money. I contacted Rockstar Support again and they said that they found all the money in my account to be fraudulent and removed it all. I tried pursuing it further to get my $20 sharkcard back at least but I was threatened with being banned for ""false reports"".Okay, so whatever I'll just sell some cars I don't use, and use the businesses I have to make money again. Come around to the new Smugglers Update, and I have $2million legit from my businesses, ready for whatever boat-motorcycle-plane they have for this update. Keep in mind that I was grinding this money for a good while now and spent a lot of time working for it having to deal with public lobby bs and griefers. I update the game, and what do you know - Rockstar removed my money again for being ""illegitimatley earned"".Now I'm again at $0, with Rockstar Support being Rockstar Bot Support, I have not gotten any responses or any sight of help. In total I spent about $150 on the game (from console and PC with Shakrcards) just to be treated like scum of the earth. I'm done playing the game.

Worse still, these trainers are now capable of launching denial of service attacks and rumored to be able to use your game client as pivot point into your computer.Make no mistake, if I ever had F-U Money, I'd buy R*, fire all of the top brass and network coders, hire new ones that know their butts from a hole in the ground, and have GTAV rewritten with proper, secure netcode so as to allow for this gorgeous open world game actually be playable.Until then, Rockstar ought to be held criminally liable for their negligent greed."

This game is literally a security risk for you. every time you play there is someone in the session that has every ones IP address and information.

I was excited as huge GTA franchise fan! Intrigued that finaly I would not need to dream about PlayStation to play one of best games ever! That was huge... pricy, but huge, loved it anyway - ordered a pre-order with some huge bonuses here in Steam for quite a lot for that time for game! Enjoyed!First I enjoyed game really much... liked it, loved it, played it a lot... but real life took my attention and GTA V and especially GTA V Online hours reduced till I was legit to say Im not playing it anymore... so few weeks before I write this review I returned and was suprised that there is a lot things to upgrade, purchase and amazing new content - even got new friends, since my old friends was not playing GTA V anymore! Started to understand that it will take few weeks to get some of my mostly desired content... that meant playing MC stuff, selling bunker stuff, researching bunker stuff, playing heists and everything... since my cars was so slow and not top notch (couldnt afford compatable for racing). So far so good ? Yeah... I always was aginst cheating - public looby modders always f**k things up.. bomb you remotely, engage PvP with god mode or etc... simply hated it - till I found community to play with and who usually occupies public lobby and kicks anyone who is just cheating or creating cage around you!Perfect! My return will be easier in such community - I will need few less weeks to get desired items - some members are rich and lets test me newest cars (my best was Zentorno and Osiris, T20 too) but there wooow Buggati Chiron like car and it cost millions! So community players see that I cannot afford even security on my MC businesses and in some heists they put me in clear advantage since they gave double digit millions in account (I usually didnt have more than 1.5 million in-game cash) and put my reward for heist ridicilusly high (75%)... nice good heist time evenings and luckly selling some bunker stuff and woilaa - got 3.7 millions in-game cash - tought about what to buy and since it was late evening - went to sleep with idea that tomorrow I will choose what of desired content I will buy :) Got really excited about community and game again - fully returning to play it...Sounds too good ? Yes... today (its evening of the day I wanted to choose what to buy) I recieve email that Ive been bad boy by violationg Terms of Service/EULA and I got suspended for 30 days and all my items will be deleted...Devasted ? At beginning not really - even tought: ""Phe, Ive have done nothing bad, didnt cheat - whatever. It must be error and usually that kind of stuff is repaired and all will be fine""... Ive been heard that there is ban waves where innocent people been banned and tought that Rockstar should be fixing that - so with good willing - made ticket in Rockstar Support about my suspension and warning to delete all achievments Ive been earned so far (some of them, for example my first supercar - Zentorno, more than few years old). Guess what ? They auto-close this kind of ticket... Okay, thought thats a bug - so I got live chat with support and explained what halppened... and first line of support just say he cant help me - there is some factor that is reason for banning me and when asked about what - he was not able to say, just that its violation of ToS/EULA! As experienced customer support guy - I understand first line guys problem and tell - okay - please escalate issue about bug to his supervisor if he really cant help... so amazingly my live chat with support is taken to other guy which is less coming to me back and just closes conversation with same text ""I will not tell why you got banned, its not without reason"". Im shocked... even angry! I paid at that time 60€ for game... Devasted! Support should not be so bad but then I started reading reviews and internet about everything and I see a lot complains about banning innocent players, yet I remember how was going in random public lobby - if not blown appart, then caged with some modder... and then me - who hard work in-game cash to get desired car... and now this - my GTA V Online character will be deleted, all my cars will be deleted...How I feel about it ? Im devasted,,, paid for game and I will be honest - Online part of game is last that Im in there for, since single player I have been 100% completed on XBOX360... and now they take me from me without reason or because their ban bot is failure or mistaken or simply badly coded... I keep asking why Rockstar is doing this ? My only guess would be that 60€ I have paid to them (ofc steam takse some part, so tehnicly a bit less) is not enough or they want more... You would ask how I become to this illuminati theory ? Just keeped asking why ? Ofc I have another steam accounts and by CS:GO items (played that game for more thousands of hours) I can sell - I can easaly earn those 20€ and not be ♥♥♥♥♥ about all unfairness of Rockstar here, but Im man with principles and I can publicy tell - NO. Rockstar, I will not pay you more to get content I already paid for long time ago overpriced amount of €.What to do next ? Sue Rockstar ? Nah... I readed ToS/EULA and terms I have checked checkbox that I agree and it basicly removes any rights to me to go to court to say that Rockstar is simply abusing me... Forget ? No, Im man of principle. Wait 30 days and start from zero - probably... at this point thats only thing I have left and apparently I will return to game, but probably It will take for me more than 30 days for that - just because my anger about unfair situation is too big but I still love this game, yet I understand that developer company and support is softly saying BAD.At this point Im really glad that I never bought any shark cards and I will never buy extra copy of GTA V on other accounts to pay extra to Rockstar! Over and dissapointed!"

I even bought copies of this game for over 8 of my friends when it came out on PC because of how excited i was to play it on a quality system instead of a console, with that said however, I would never recommend buying a RockStar game of any kind, both GTA Online and Red Dead Redemption Online have become utter and total garbage.''We are also committed to ensuring that our games are fun for everyone and as safe as possible from modders, cheaters, hackers and those who seek to harass other players''The above statement from RockStar is a joke at best. RockStar legitimately doesn't care at all about user experience or about being accountable to their promises or offers.They allow players to mod and hack their game online and do nothing at all to enforce any kind of rules regarding this, however, they will punish players who haven't modded but have gotten cash from modders, whether the player wanted that money or not.They constantly add new game features that are either broken and don't work at all, or just ruin the enjoyment available to game-play (Oppressor Mk2).Rockstar will also punish players for using so called ""in game exploits"" that their poor programming and total lack of testing/foresight created yet they refuse to do anything at all to rectify the untenable situation that modders have created in their games, its honestly just pathetic and indicates that their programmers and project managers are either lazy, amateurs or just plain dumb.They will also constantly advertise bonus cash payouts for their Shark Cards that they literally never pay out, check the RockStar support forums regarding this and you can find countless entries regarding players not being paid out the bonus cash for more than 6 years now.You are better off buying a copy of Fallout 76, or any EA game even. At least that garbage is better supported and maintained than any RockStar game and speaking frankly I doubt that Rockstar will ever change how they respond to player requests and their game being ruined by the select few who choose to cheat. RIP RD Online and GTA Online, you were both beautiful ideas that your creators simply saw for cash cows. I pity any of the developers who were passionate about this because their passions have been treated with 0 respect and 0 care.TL;DRGTA Online and RD Online are so plagued with hacking, modding and glitchy missions/events they aren't playable.

If you're looking to just play solo and randomly hop into public servers, it's going to be a gamble whether you get a relatively decent server or one full of cheaters/modders running around deleting things from existence like they're roleplaying as Thanos. The online side definitely can be fun, to help avoid issues like that I'd definitely suggest looking for a GTA crew to join.

You get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over by everything in this game every 5 minutes, but you still keep playing because it's fun.The game is constantly playing against you. You want to deliver your 2.8 million car for merely 100k? Yeah, yeah, sure, just let me spawn a couple of enemy NPCs that can randomly spawn at any moment (quite often literally in your way) and drain your car's worth significantly.Ok, don't want to export your ? Sure you can do some cargo missions maybe? Awesome, enter your BigBlackTruck and start a 3 box mission, which is basically a 50/50 chance for a  20+ minute deliver mission or a 5 minute delivery mission. Not that bad to be fair, but as I said, some of these can be completely cancerous to complete, ESPECIALLY if you're new. Try to take down a Valkyrie helicopter with your puny Carbine Rifle. It's not that bad when you have a homing launcher or a sniper maybe, but for someone who's new, (these cargo missions are for all types of players, be it new or veteran), it can be quite a hassle to complete one of these, especially picking them  and deliverin up to 5 miles to your warehouse.Fine, it's annoying, but what about Heists?  are the selling point for some people in this game. Yes, you do get heist, and they're actually great, they're fun, they're enjoyable, though repetetive - they are fun... When they work. Unless you have 4 (2 for some heists and Doomsday ones) people, for best experience friends. They work wonders, it's really fun and challenging to go into a huge bunker, shoot up some ♥♥♥♥♥♥' mercs and steal some delicous money. But see, you probably don't have friends, and you try to complete a heist with some randoms, well that's where the fun ends, because in some way this game has attracted a lot of stupid people, who can't even use a keyboard to play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. You could spend literal hours trying to get pass one heist and be amazed at how stupid people can be.  Yeah there are more ways to make money but who cares? lol.I do, kinda.Freemode money making is a pain if you dont know how to make a solo public lobby. I don't want to talk much about this so imagine it as Vietnam war. With Jet bikes that shoot missiles, cars that fly, cars that shoot missiles, and cars that have literally saws on them. And you're a poor Vietnamese farmer, trying to tend to his field. Even though the game tells you to destroy people's business cargo and ♥♥♥♥ like that (you get like 2-4k for destroying someone's 3 hours of work), DO NOT. TRUST. THE. GAME. In my eyes this is just an advanced trick to tilt players into making them buying shark cards, which are majorly overpriced.I'm just writing this to let people know what they're getting into. You see a lot of reviews saying that there's a lot of KD warriors, modders, kids, griefers, although its true, in my experience they aren't that common. As long as you aren't in a 15+ lobby you really shouldn't  be afraid of people. I've truly met a lot of people who were bad, but it wasn't always bad. I had people come over and defend me from enemy spawns/police or even other players. Rockstar honestly pleasantly surprised me with the new Casino update. To sum it up shortly: Quite a few ways to gamble, they are actually quite fun to do, I, personally, really like to play the different games and basically pray to RNG gods for a blessing. They added new cars, a few new missions, a penthouse ('highly' customizable) and my favourite feature: a Wheel of Fortune where you can win ♥♥♥♥ lol.This was really good content and a lot of people really did like it, but what most didn't expect is Rockstar throwing an unexpected curve ball and nerfing some PvP aspects like passive mode. Which is great."

Then, two days later i got banned, my characfter was reset, all my money, vehicles, and my house were erased from history.This is unacceptable behaviour, the devs are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that never care about their customers and fans.They mentioned 'cheating', i never cheated in GTA V, not even in SP. I never even had any shady software open at the same time as GTA. I did run into an incident with a cheater that kept killing me whilist being invulnerable after we got in some argument, and he threatened to get me banned, but it was quite a while before that.I did have recording of everything, but of course, nobody from Rockstar Support cared.Cheaters can just steal your name and get you banned, it's the simplest thing.Whether my ban and reset were because of my review, or because some cheater used my name and people reported him (while he was using my name), it doesn't matter. This isn't a company i will ever forgive.A highly priced game, with an noline system built to extort money from you if you want progression (otherwise you will grind for dozens after dozens after dozens of hours to get some cool vehicles, a nice house and whatever), a system built on purpose to make you want to pay extra for stuff.I never minded grinding much in games, because it adds purpose, but in this case, it's total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and rip-off.On top of the game price, an 8.000.000 shark card costs 74.99 euros. You know what that money will get you in game? A nice car with mods. That's all.It might seem like a lot if you didn't play the game, but no. Shark cards indeed. Because this company, that many grew up with, and loved ate their fans alive, they're a shark tank themselves.The game is also ridden with some nasty bugs, optimized like hell (CP2077 has graphics10 times better, has a bigger world, and advanced graphical technologies and works with 20% more FPS than GTA V, a game released quite some years ago).If Rockstar ever wants to redeem themselves, they will need to stop destroying their players' hard work in their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ online game, they will let people enjoy the game without intervening, they owuld fix what's broken.Awful product, awful company, awful everything.It's just a money siphon for them.(And as a reference, 74.99 euros would be too much even for 8 billion in-game cash, not million. Because the money goes away fast, the more expensive vehicles/house you have the more you pay for in-game 'daily' fees, and one day in GTA V is not 24 hours either, it's 48 minutes)"

As we made money, playing stupidly-fun minigames and going on deathmatch rampages, we created our characters’ lore. Buying new outfits, houses, and cars, we created the personalities and relationships between our characters. From the first convenience store robberies we committed to the “hard mode” heists we tried over and over to beat, everything we did spawned stories of our virtual lives.After 140+ hours of glorious, stupid fun, we took about a month’s hiatus. We played a few other group-based games, such as ESO and Don’t Starve Together, but we ended up feeling inclined to reunite our virtual characters in GTA Online. After this time away, we were ready to have some more fun, reuniting in a game that brought us all closer together as a group.That was until one of us logged on, saw that they had been suspended for 30 days, and read that their character had been completely reset.Why was our friend banned? Who knows. Based on what I’ve read (and we’ve been studying into it for hours in hopes of getting our friend's character back), there’s no hope. Rockstar’s employed some sort of algorithm that ends up banning both guilty hackers and innocent players alike out of nowhere, with no distinction. I’m not going to lie, when we went onto public servers we frequently met hackers. The issue is that my friend wasn’t one of them.“You have violated the EULA,” the suspension email states, “this decision is final.”Rockstar, you know how to make a really good game - Red Dead Redemption and both Grand Theft Auto 4 & 5 were excellent in single-player - but I can’t support this blatant lack of care for supporting your online players. 60 dollars and 140+ hours just went down the drain, because your robot randomly banned our friend, you won’t say why, and none of your “support” staff (if they even exist) care to respond to any players in the same situation.I won’t support this bafflingly unprofessional treatment of GTA Online’s playerbase.=====Basically, single player is great. Online can be as well, but good luck not getting suspended or banned out of nowhere, for no reason. You won’t know why you were banned. You won’t get support. You’ll lose time and money. And Rockstar won’t even care."

277,Fruit,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AngelFruiti/,186,19,1,615.5,December,"17,",506,7,1,"Grand Theft Auto V is the definition of a love-hate relationship. It's one of those games that would greatly benefit from a ""neutral"" recommendation. This game does a lot of things right, and a  of things wrong. I'll be discussing the single player portion and the online portion in seperate sections, as at this point they are nowhere near the same game anymore.TL;DR at bottom!The attention to detail throughout the game is absolutely stunning. Puddles are dynamic, people comment on your car as you drive by, cars will have their tires turned into the curb when downhill parking. . It's clear that significant amounts of effort when into creating a living, breathing environment for Los Santos. The game is gorgeous. Everywhere you turn there is a beautiful sunset, impressive reflections, and eye-catching, vibrant colors. It's such a breath of fresh air compared to the generic brown/grey colour palette. Luckily, optimization allows GTA V to run as smooth as butter. I've been running the game on a GTX 1060 6GB on ultra high settings, and have been consistently getting a 60-70+ FPS with very few frame drops. Friends with lower end GPUs have reported the same thing to me. This game is widely playable across a lot of systems in my experience.First Person is a welcomed edition from the last gen edition of the game (if anyone still plays those...). Nearly the entire game can be played through in first person, which offers an interesting (and often times challenging) perspective for races, firefights, and roaming the city.The single player is, and always has been, an amazingly enjoyable experience. It's a lovely blend of gritty, twisted, dark plotlines and absurd, entertaining fun. There are some scenes that were a bit too much for me, () but this all ultimately comes down to personal preference. The character dynamic between Franklin, Micheal, and Trevor is fun to watch unfold throughout your time playing, which could be a while. It took me about 50+ hours to finish the main story, and 90+ hours to 100% it. However, content is limited thanks to Rockstars inability to hear the community's cry for solo content. A lot of people wouldn't mind spending $10, $20 on an expansion for the single player, but Rockstar continues to ignore half of it's game to continue to work on it's cash cow.GTA Online sings a tune very different from that of the single player. Online is at best, a hugely entertaining passtime, and at worst, a horrible nightmare to play. The game essentially revolves around completing missions, jobs, heists, etc. in order to acquire large sums of money. You then use this money to buy vehicles, weapons, and property (which often times unlocks new missions, jobs, and heists to play at your disposal). The main problem with this model is that unless you're willing to grind your ass off, you're not getting anything quick. As more and more updates come out, the prices of things go up and up, all in a desperate attempt to push Shark Cards (In game currency for real money). What's even worse is that the value of Shark Cards has not kept up with the insane inflation that GTA Online has had over the years. On launch, $1,000,000 was an insane amount of money. Now it's chump change. With every new update comes millions upon millions of dollars you need to spend in order to get anything. The most expensive Shark Card in the game ($99.99 USD) gives you $8,000,000 in game. You  burn through that quick. So unless you're ready to spend a LOT of money to get everything you want, you'll be grinding. What adds insult to injury is all of the hackers spawning themselves infinite amounts of money, and all the bans that don't get applied. You'd be lucky not to have some sort of hacker in your lobby. They run rampant, with free rain to kill everyone and everything, and spawn themselves (and you) money. Don't worry, Rockstar will just ban them, right? That'd be nice. Most of the time they do ban waves, they catch thousands of innocent players who have worked hard for their money, and will either take their money or ban them completely from Online. It's entirely innapropriate and Rockstar really needs to work on it. So say you've acquired your money, you've bought some nice things, and now you're enjoying free roam. Prepare to be blasted to hell by one of the most toxic communities I've ever experienced. This game breeds toxicity. People  blow up you, your car, your plane, and your will to live. Low leveled players have little to no chance of fighting back, as they don't have sticky bombs, miniguns, or any other of the strong anti-grief weapons. Your only option after that is passive mode, which is no fun whatsoever. Basically, what I'm getting at is Online is a complete nightmare to play alone.  if you and a couple buddies pick up the game and play together, you're in for some of the most fun you'll ever have. Playing races and missions together, away from public lobbies, is the most entertaining thing I've ever played. The most recent update, the Doomsday Heist, reintroduced new PvE content instead of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥, hollow PvP content they've been pushing lately. It's a huge step in the right direction for the future of this game, and if they continue on the path of PvE and co-op I can see this game lasting a lot longer into the future. I want to be able to fully recommend this game 100%, but I simply can't. While I do fully recommend it if you plan on playing it with friends, the downsides of playing Online by yourself are staggering. I repeat, if you plan on playing the Online, play it with a couple of friends. You will enjoy your experience exponentially more."

The story isn't perfect or a masterpiece but it's still good. It's a pretty old game at this point, yet it still competes with anything released this year. It looks great, has great gameplay, well, it's the best GTA there is, couldn't really add anything more.Online is fun, yet it could be improved so much in many different areas. First of all, the content itself could be much more diverse and less grindy. I understand that Rockstar games is making bread through microtransactions but still, grinding for a hundred hours to buy expensive things can get stale really quick. Secondly, many online mods in GTA San Andreas had better ideas for businesses and jobs in terms of their mechanics that make GTA V slightly underwhelming in that regard.Next up are griefers. Damn, so many of these stacked up, high level kids with flying jet-like bikes that can automatically lock-on and shoot homing missiles. And there goes your slow ass post office van stacked with cocaine that you've been driving for the past 10 minutes to your destination and waited beforehand for an hour after paying for supplies to produce the product. It's a very large gap between newbies and daily grinders. It's also pretty overwhelming for a new player at first: plenty of activities, constant emails and messages, no idea where to start or what to do. Besides the griefers, the community itself is pretty good during missions and heists. It's true, they're mostly bad at their tasks or just can't cooperate properly but it seems that they always apologize for their mistakes and no one really starts insulting each other so that's pretty dope. I also have to mention the hackers. Though I see them constantly, the majority of them doesn't even bother me, they're mostly just having fun on their own and don't disrupt the crowd. Lastly, the glitches and crashes. Yes, they're pretty common and it seems that Rockstar doesn't really care much about the majority of them. Crashing and losing your valuable product, glitching and getting stuck in the middle of the heist or just entering into an infinite loading screen is just another ""feature"" at this point. Though some glitches, such as teleporting or playing in a solo lobby, are almost necessary to ease your life a tad bit."

If the game could've just merited a little more attention OFFLINE (a.k.a. where I don't have to fear the Rockstar Police), then I might feel a bit more off-base with a ""Not Recommended"" review.  However, this game is only getting development with the Online portion.  And that is quite literally a ""Pay-to-play"" structure.  Gameplay Online is severely reliant upon having the GTA$ to afford nearly every aspect of the game.  Even other players can easily cost you money without even being cheaters.  Just the typical griefing of online MP.My final thought on this game online, which is all that counts to Rockstar, is the same thought I had countless times when playing, and struggling for cash to afford even some casual playing.....""I already WORKED for the REAL MONEY, and bought this game.  WHY am I having to WORK MORE, just to PLAY..!?"""

Well they only ban people using free mod menu but it's rare.-You are risking yourself to get your PC or laptop overheating, getting damage for some components, by cheaters.-You are also risking yourself to get a DDoS attack.-You will expose your IP address, in case you want to protect yourself against cheaters using a VPN, developers will ban you instead.-You also opening yourself to possibility to get hacked.If you want a better explanation.In GTA ONLINE there are a lot of people that use CHEATS by using a MOD MENU, that will make a unfair game experience against you.↳What can a mod menu do?-Grants them GOD mode, they cannot be killed by any reason.-They can kill you automatically for the time they want just clicking the option in the menu they got.-They can change their names even to already existing ones, sometimes they use your username in chat saying strange things.-Also gives them the ability to be invisible in the map for the time they want, teleport to an exact location, fly without any flying vehicle, even follow you by different sessions.-They can see your IP address, and use it to DDoS you, follow you to different sessions, even private sessions aren't safe.-They can spawn ton of things near you, overloading your game, making it to crash, also sometimes it overheats your PC damaging some components of it.-The MOD MENU prevents you reporting them, making your game to crash automatically.Also if you report them by the Customer Service, developers just repeat asking you to report them in game, where you get crashed when you do it, so they are in the same team.The food chain in GTA ONLINE is MODDER > DEVELOPER > NORMAL PLAYERSo.. if that is all the experience you are looking for, feel free to buy the game.Also you are getting scammed by Rockstar, since they are selling a game that they cannot control.-------------------------------------------------Updated: 17 May @ 12:18pmYeah, the game is fun to play, cool vehicles weapons and there are ton of great/funny/cool people playing it but it is getting off hands.All what I wrote is 100% what I experienced against Cheaters. Also I can add some more detailed experiences I had to pass trough, I have 3400 hours of game play in this game and for bonus I will tell you what I saw during a live stream too..- I had the experience of a friend quitting GTA5, because he lost his interest of grinding after tasting the money drop from a modder.- I also have been getting spawn killed in different sessions for no reasons. I mean everyone were getting killed because the modder was bored or a random guy started to fight with a modder in the chat, that's not fair, also it is not fair to being able to get spam killed because he has a mod menu and you don't.- Getting invited to a apartment without accepting the invite, and getting killed by a guy spammng rockets or with a minigun at the door, I can guarantee that it is not a good experience if you were doing some stuff like missions or driving with friends.- When I discovered that I was able to buy supplies and sell the stuff from bunkers and MC businesses, I experienced getting my cargo blown up by a user using GOD mode, I mean it's okay if some random person comes to destroy my stuff (that happens a lot and yeah it's part of the game) but at least I should be able to defend myself to make it fair, right?- Getting in game messages threatening me saying he/she knows my IP so he knows where I live, (I know IP address does not give you the exact location but it is not a good experience).- Getting some tryhards wanna be to challenge me, and then when they start to lose turning on their GOD mode to get their kills back.- Getting DDoS Attack after fighting against a modder.- Not getting able to log in on GTA Online because a modder was messing with my social club account (Disconnecting me over and over)- Getting my game close/crash. I mean yeah not all the times are because a modder but you can tell if it is because a cheater or not, I mean, e.g. like getting the game crash every time you try to report a cheater, or when you say he is a cheater in the chat magically you get disconnected.- I had a guy following me every time I get Online, I don't have him as friend, but he can join even my SOLO session, and the funny part is that he is doing that because he tried to kill me with his Jet on god mode (the user and his jet were in god mode, I tried to explode it with explosive rounds also tried to kill him but well that's how I knew the cheater was in god mode) but he failed, so I laugh and left the session, I assume he got pissed because a non cheater user made him look stupid. So he followed me and changed his name for mine and started to talk in the chat saying ""I am a cheater report me please"" and then crashed my game every time I log in.Ah and had the experience of watching a streamer getting invaded by cheaters even in friend only sessions without having the cheaters as friend, the cheater joined even when the streamer was alone in a private session, I mean nowadays people can join and hunt you just having your in-game username, and well them crashed her game since she asked to leave and YEAH! the streamer is a Woman, not 100% sure but I assume that's why the cheaters wanted to join so bad, but why women have to pass trough this experiences? because a horny guy wants to play with girls?..But after all the reports people made, what did Rockstar? Well... nothing. At least for me they just told me to try to report them using the in-game report system for a better result.So... are all those things fair? I hope no one else get those experiences..And for last...Why is a person COOL if he/she has to have advantage over other people to play an Online Game? I mean if the person is cool he/she should be able to play without any problem, without using cheats..Sorry for my english.Thats all, Have a good day!"

It has been completely ruined throughout the years, every lobby you run into has a modder or more guaranteed, grinding is extremely boring and repetitive, and you'll probably run into hundreds of thousands of Broomstick MK2 braindead griefers trying to ruin your experience, and since the company (Cockstar) cares more about selling you virtual credit cards instead of actually attempting to make their game more fun or even playable, you'll most likely get a really negative experience in the online, and maybe even your account banned for nothing, and your personal info stolen and your internet DDOSed in the worst case scenario (modders can do that), unless you play solo (which kinda breaks the point of multiplayer don't ya think) or with friends only, there's really no point to the online. Which makes me really sad, since it has so much wasted potential because of company greed, me myself i love to dogfight in this game using jets and helicopters, but it's completely ruined when a tiny ass moskito which is really hard to hit comes at you with a barrage of absurd almost aimbot tracking homing missiles.

Its a living hell.I heard reports of people getting banned thanks to these ""modders"" by giving money to them. Some modders screw their sessions by transforming the players into objects, or attaching objects in them. First the abusive players, now these modders?To Worsen it all, Rockstar only keeps releasing content updates, its good they are making good things for the game, but each time MORE expensive, MORE grinding, and LESS fixing their game, and LESS security methods for the multiplayer.To close it all,  Grand theft auto Five is a great game, and its great to be played with your friends, live your life in the game, enjoy the stuff.

And this is also factoring in my 5,000+ hours in CS:GO. The reason for this? its not that i didn't have fun in GTA Online, especially when you add your friends into the mix the online portion in this game is great. Single player was enjoyable as well, with a decent story and several laughs id say the 80 hours of single player was worth it. My problem with this game is the company behind it, Rockstar. As a company that has such a lucrative franchise as GTA how could someone spoil it? Well let me tell you.GTA Online is driven by having fancy cars and the latest in OP military hardware to absolutely shred people that don't have something worthwhile to defend themselves. To obtain these vehicles you need BANK, and im talkin bags on bags on bags of money. Multi million dollar equipment, that would take HOURS of in-game grinding to be able to obtain. Thats where the flaw is. Having to put SOOOO much time into a game to get basic stuff, to actually have fun even. Just with high end sports cars that ALSO cost millions. A way around this? Buy shark cards... Rockstars very own cash cow. To get the best vehicle in the game (At time of review) which is the Oppressor MK II, you need a terrorbyte and a nightclub as well. All in all, about $5,680,000 in game money. To buy a shark card for that? You'd need a Megladon Shark Card, worth $100 USD. That right there sums it up.Glitching is something that Rockstar hates with a passion, because it eats into their precious shark card sales obviously. I (like many others) took part in a property trade-in glitch to get 10's of millions of dollars. Why? to buy all the military style vehicles and pretty sports cars my heart could desire, without having to put hundreds of hours into the game further. At that point i had about 900 hours into the game. Of which i didnt have very much to show for it, compared to after doing the glitching of course. Now, since Rockstar doesn't like a loop hole in the game they made allowing me to get 10's of millions with NO THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, i get a character reset. Now why on earth would i sit back and think ""fair enough"" after i put 900+ hours into the game. This game as it sits is dead to me, if i ever play this game again i will be using a mod menu to give me in-game cash. The game is the biggest time waster to date, and i wont put anymore ""legit"" hours into this game. Years of playing online, gone in 1 second. Thanks Rockstar, for encouraging your fanbase to download mod menus... the very thing you hate ;)"

The  only good thing is when I get friends and we can clear a public room and just do our things without having to worry about griefers, the MK2 Oppressor users and the Orbital Cannon users.Playing with friends can be the only redemption unless you like greifers and a terrible moderation system that bans you for being in a room with random modders who you report but inturn somehow are banned instead.Guess they dont know what the F*CK they are doing.SO Cheers! Good Luck to you if you decide to buy it, it was fun before I got banned for a MONTH for playing the game legitly and grinding my @$$ OFF for little to no payout.and I hope you dont run into any hackers and modders that cause you to meet the same fate as me.Unless rockstar changes their mind and removes my ban/doesnt reset my account (idk why they are in the first place)I may change my Review, cause I did have some fun until the grinding became the only thing to do (it is more fun with friends)7/10 for the game itself1/10 for their moderation service, especially since I know Modders who are still active and never banned (but I get banned..)2/10 for RockStar as they need to fix this game A LOTBetter Payouts, more ways to pay associates without having to swapbeing able to use the Motorcycle club and CEO stuff in private modes and without having to change between being a MC President and a CEO... cause that is tedious and annoying.And for a better moderation service.that is why RockStar is receiving a 2/10 from me. the game isnt terrible tho, but if I am getting banned for being innocent, I cannot recommend this game."

There obviously also are nice modders but they don't reveal themselves quite as often as the bad ones do. If you play multiplayer, expect to: -get killed by an invisible person, -get killed by an invincible person, -get killed by a person that can't be knocked back (by driving cars into them), -get lifted into the skies by a water fountain spawned by modders that keeps you in the air unable to do anything, get killed by an uncounterable orbital cannon (repeatedly), -get harassed by little script kiddies that think writing your IP in the chat actually has any value, -get killed for no reason, -get killed while doing sales (the best way to earn money) because rockstar actually tells people to do that and consequentally having your product get destroyed only to have to wait a few more days until you can sell again, -get killed by a lot of people using the oppressor mk2 because they want to raise their k/d, -get killed by people usting the oppressor mk2 just for fun. Modders can also crash your game if they want to, so just keep that in mind :)As you can see, the multiplayer includes a lot of getting killed which can be especially off-putting to new players because guess what, you unlock the good weapons at higher levels or have to pay huge amounts of money for vehicles to help you fight other players. Don't get me wrong, I like doing PvP but only because I have already been playing this game for a very long time and I have the equipment to make it a more fair fight for myself. Coming back to the topic of modders, there's a lot that they can do and very few that they can't. One of the few things that they can't do is behave and talk like normal people.Most of my interactions with modders have gone like this: I see someone's cargo getting destroyed, I head over to investigate and kill the cargo griefer. As usual, they are using the oppressor mk2, a flying bike with the (second-)best missiles in the game, which makes it utterly unkillabke without the right equipment. As it turns out, even this equipment is of no use to me because the griefer is using a mod menu to give himself godmode, in which he is invincible. So after hitting a few missiles, they just turn around and shoot one missile at me, only to kill me instantly. Now on the ground the modder focuses me and basically spawnkills me until I'm forced to switch lobbies or someone else steps in so I can escape.10/10 Gud gaem, gud balance, gud anticheat"

I'm exclusively speaking about Online. I won't even write everything I think. I'll just say this game is addictive as hell with the right people, but the problem is that finding the right people in this game is like finding a needle in a haystack. It's just hell.The game is riddled with modders that always want to mess with everyone, and it's a real pain. If you want to mod for money, go for it. Everything in this game is disgustingly overpriced and the payouts for things are garbage. Making money in the game is easier than ever, but the problem is it takes too long, and the payout ratio when compared with the prices of items is just ridiculous. Not everyone has the time to grind for days just to afford one super car or whatever they want to indulge in.But when you mod in order to mess with other people's gameplay and hard-work (e.g. cargo), you're just a worthless scumbag. The sad thing is that Rockstar don't do anything about it. This has been a serious issue for years. They don't seem to do much about the modder infestation, and it's sad to acknowledge because this game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Do I recommend it? Unlike what my review states, yes, I do. It's fun, and if you have friends, it's even better.But it doesn't deserve a positive review until Rockstar show they care about their community.It's that simple."

Wander through the countryside and you'll see backpackers, cyclists, and people walking their dogs.

Despite that the game feels alive, the open world offers a lot to do and mods make that even better. As for Online, it has its upsides, but the one major downside is the community itself: Griefers, K/D warriors, overall annoying people and don't get me started on the ""professional"" racers in the races. Of course, there are some people that do actually enjoy the game and play it for fun or just grind their way to billions of dollars so it's not all that bad. Despite any of the before mentioned problems, the biggest plus is the game itself, the graphics are amazing (if you have the hardware to run them at least on medium) and the things to do are endless.TLDR: It's GTA, you can't go wrong with any of them."

Well it's is hard to sum-up, but here goes. Most people I know buy it for the online aspect but there's much to love about the story as well. I'll try to be brief with two short ""COOL"" and ""NOT-SO-COOL"" lists to specify when I'm talking about what part of the game, enjoy and thanks for reading!COOL: STORY+ Plot, dialogue and acting. Rockstar somehow found a perfect balance of fun and realism in this one. Things go over the top like it should in a GTA game; but not in a way where you take nothing seriously, the story has a lot of weight to it. The main characters are written phenomenaly, I guarantee you'll have some great laughs and many surprises through the course of it all.+ Gameplay is solid. Movement, shooting and controlling vehicles all have their learning curves but every challenge is something you can overcome by training yourself. You can also customize all your keyboard keys or even use a Controller, which seems to be easier to use for controlling aircraft by popular opinion. This GTA seems quite a bit tougher then previous titles however; you die surprisingly quick for one and acquiring larger of money is basically impossible early on in the game, but has it's reasons for being that way.+ Atmosphere, area design and graphics in general are fantastic. Us PC users can tweak it any way we want so even lower-performance computers can handle the vast world of San Andreas. It's filled to the brim with NPC's; all with weird, interesting or simply funny dialogue and after a 100 hours you probably still won't have seen every detail. + The perfect game to find your own goals in. Wanna try to steal that helicopter on top of that base? Maybe just find out exactly how many pedastrians you can punch before getting shot dead by the cops? Fun times.+ There are many challenges to be done, secrets to be found and achievements to attain. If you're a completionist like me you won't be done any time soon.NOT-SO-COOL: STORY- Fans of previous incarnations, especially San Andreas, might be disappointed by some of the changes. Mainly the reduced size of the titular island, it's still very grand for any regular sandbox standard but you'll still find that the ""small"" city of Los Santos is the place where 90% of the game goes down.- Though you can save at any time outside of a mission, loading games or missions is quite a mess.  While you're in the game at no point during any mission, race or other activity can you restart to try again; you HAVE to die or fail to get the option to restart. This can be infuriating during races where it's sometimes relatively easy to make a mistake you can't come back from and you either have to do the entire race or kill yourself to respawn at the nearest hospital. Not fun, and goes double for those trying to get gold medals for longer missions.- Prepare to follow guides if you really want to get the most out of the game. Money isn't as easy to come by, so the ""investment assasination"" missions are something you should know about before ever getting them. I didn't on my first playthrough, so I missed out on a lot of things late-game.- Meager or no rewards for doing a lot of the extra stuff in the overworld. No real reason to do stuff like collect letter scraps for 100% completion unless you're a madman like me.COOL: ONLINE+ All the gameplay and writing aspects from the story should apply here, but with some extra's. In online you're simply dropped into the world with nothing, and it's up to you to just earn money. Why? To get more money of course! And probably to acquire the huge array of vehicles ranging from old hippie busses and dirt bikes to literal plasma tanks and stealth bombers.+ The game still receives updates occationally, and a lot of people still seem to be playing.+ You can go at it completely solo, but I'l tell you it's better with friends. Get yourselves in a game, make a company, buy some assets and get to work. Most major missions in the form of heists need 4 players, so that would be the ideal way to go for it as waiting for random people to join your session can be quite a pain. Especially if they don't communicate and/or perform well.+ Heists themselves are cool with a similar taste of grandeur to the story. But extra fun since now it's actually you and your friends dressed up in silly stuff doing it. Fun for the whole (adult) family.+ There's a lot of fan-made content in the form of races and challenges that can range from cute to insanely awesome. Races in muslce cars that can jump are among my favourites.+ Dude. Me and my friend dressed up as Elf and Santa for christmas. Painted a hovering, missle-shooting Delorean in jolly fashion, got ourselves some throwables... and started raining presents down from above. Then a hacker/modder/scripter came to us, beat us up for killing him, then told us our outfits were cool and gave us $100,000 each before leaving the server and kicking every one else but us from it. Then we went to the store, bought over 20 beers each and had a drunken brawl until there was no more booze to celebrate the occasion.When does that happen? Only in GTA 5 Online.NOT-SO-COOL: ONLINE- Your Mileage May Vary applies. As an online game, your experience will heavily depend on your fellow players in the server. Half the time it seems every one is leaving each other alone, while one or two big companies do some work and duke things out. The other half; it's people who just want to watch the world, and specifically you: BURN. Be it in the overworld or inside a mission: grievers and just run-of-the-mill-buttmunches abound. This is why I suggest to play with friends. Found an evil hacker/scripter/modder? Just change servers is my advice.- Loading times in general are long, and happen too often. Re-loading after doing a session, or leaving one because no-one joined, can take ages even if you're still in the same server as before. It also puts you and your friends in different servers at random, making the waiting times even longer which can be a big annoyance.- The delayed controls, wonky character movement, laggy shooting and the infuriatingly unreliable phone (which you need to do anything) do not make this a good PvP game. There is little skill involved; most of online is just showing how much money you're willing to spend to kill someone. Don't EVER expect a fair fight, the game isn't about that.- Finding random people to do jobs or missions with can also be a real pain. If any of them decide to ragequit then EVERYONE gets kicked back into Los Santos. Which means more loading times and a bunch of waiting until you can try the same mission again.- Even harder then story, and not just because of the PVP. The Police and most other NPC enemies get a noticeable upgrade; shooting with insane accuracy.This really impacts the difficulty of the heists, which already have very meagre rewards for the amount of time you need to invest in them. This is obviously to push you to buy ""Shark Cards"".- Making money and showing off your pretty cars and assets is the point of the game. This can feel shallow to some. I personally don't care for it too much, just do it with friends. I'd really see no point to playing online if I had to do it on my own.And a final note: Don't let kids play this, please. Not only is it a mature game, I've witnessed a lot of borderline scary behaviour from the younger crowd who take things very hard. This game isn't for the easily distressed or those with a short fuse. Just a warning.And that's it, I hope I kept things short enough and that this was informative to those who were still unsure on purchasing this after all this time. I'm a bit late with this review but I couldn't stand not making one while I have so many hours put into it. I probably forgot to mention a bunch of stuff but that's why I'll answer any questions you might have.Thanks again for reading and have a nice day."

That's exactly what led me to this - the game being so good that I'm baffled by how they ♥♥♥♥ on it.Evidently, the issue is Rockstar itself.It doesn't matter how long you've played for or how much you've earned over that period.

376,Dasd,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dasdy/,356,40,0,96.6,April,"20,",444,29,1,"The singleplayer is great, worth a try - for me, the best story rockstar managed to tell. At this point singleplayer of GTA V won everything it could win, so there's not much to discuss about it.However, the multiplayer is just a mess. There is definitely fun to have there with friends, but every time I decided to join a game, a full list of problems pops up:- Most sessions are filled with cheaters. They either will turn you into a giant orange, bomb everybody on the server from an invincible flying submarine, and once in a blue moon they will ignore you or even have fun with the game without annoying everybody on the server.- Some people aren't necessarily cheating, but buying these awful flying motorcycles that can spam rockets and kill basically anyone who isn't specifically prepared for encounter with these trolls. I am baffled that rockstar provided them with a legit tool to harass everybody in the session.- Everything is confusing - starting from gathering a team of 4 players in 1 session to making a decision about what is worth buying or not. For example, I mistakenly bought a high-level property thinking that it would give me access to heists, but it turned out that it's basically useless until you pour into it 5x money that it's worth for it to return a noticable profit.  - The Motorcycle Clubs, VIP, and CEO as methods of creating groups are explained extremely poorly, and I still don't see a reason why can't they function as clans in any standard MMO.- Half the time me&my friends have troubles logging into sessions or online at all. Every now and then somebody randomly disconnects or the whole session goes offline for no apparent reason. Game can hang during loading and mess up the mission progress for everybody else-  EVERY time you login to session, prepare for 3-9 voice calls from NPCs nagging to you about uninteresting stuff - side quests for killing npcs, missions about selling cars and other busy work. single player contained most of these, but for some reason did not need to bother me every day with messages about them- Aside from heists and generic multiplayer stuff (races, deathmatches), most of the time you wouldn't be actually playing the game for fun. Most of the time is spent doing busywork: selling product from your businesses, promoting your nightclub, taking supplies to your businesses. This is because heists require a significant amount of money to prepare for them (buying property that gives access to it, and most of the time you need to also pay initial price, so the profit will be given after 3-6 missions, depending on heist). Getting to a highlevel heist such as casino feels like playing a mobile city-building game: you have to log in each day to not miss the daily objectives to get 30k; you have to spin the casino wheel for a chance of 10-50k; you provide your businesses with stuff and sell stuff (this will result in 3-5 trips around the city, just riding bike or car, nothing else. The more you have stuff - the more you have to ride). It feels exhausting.The impression from GTA Online is that of an old MMORPG, but with a dozen disadvantages from a regular MMO. The game is clearly designed to force you into the loop of unnecessary, boring busywork, padding out interesting content - while forcing you to spend real money on shark cards, that would free you up of this busywork. It's a shame, since I don't know any other game that gives you ability to do heists with this amount of choices by the mission design, and by inherent fact that you are playing GTA and can go off the rails most of the time."
377,[GS] Glennmp,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017419855/,217,18,0,875.2,October,"24,",131,14,1,"Currently sitting at around 666 hours played, so I figured now would be the time to leave this review. I've played this game since the 360 and xbox one on and off. Recently I switched over to PC, however, as character transferring was shutdown I was frustrated. I would even have been fine with a 1 character account transfer. It's obvious I've been a long-time member. To summarize what I have learned in the past month or so of playing on PC, I will list the pros and cons.PROS:-Story is excellent, modding single player is always fun.-Online *can* be extremely fun, open world- especially with friends.-Plenty of cars and customization for gearheads, as well as a variety of different weapons to choose from.-Both easy and challenging missions/heists.-Community can be go either way of being toxic or extremely fun.CONS:-Modders. If you play this game expect to run into some modders. Whether they're friendly or not is up to luck. They can either spawn in vehicles and be fun, or, give everyone money and destroy cargo you're trying to sell for some odd 100s of thousands of dollars. I meet one almost everyday. My suggestion is to play in an invite only session when you can, or, if you need a public lobby with only you, there are ways to make your own that google can help you find.-Griefers. When you aren't getting harassed by a modder, you meet a griefer. There are people who will blow you up over and over until you go into passive mode, or that destroy your cargo. Note that these people don't get anything out of destroying it, except to just be mean. The excuse that the games tells them to doesn't make them less of an ding dong. -Crashes. I'm not sure if this is due to modders or my own game, but sometimes, about once or twice a day I'll get the random crash and have to wait through the 10 minute loading screen. Note that modders can boot you out of a session and crash your game however.EDIT: I haven't crashed as of recently, but I am still looking out for this one closely as I believe it is on Rockstar's side.-Game age. While I admit I'm surprised to see this game as lively as it is right now, no game lasts forever. If GTA 6 has an online feature, gta 5 online won't be getting as many/if any updates and most of the playerbase will switch. So, if you're brand new it might not be worth the effort to get into a warzone as this, especially in it's current state.-MK2 Oppressor. Do you think missiles are bad enough? What about jets? Now, imagine making a jet and compacting it into bike form. That's right, you have the oppressor mk2. A flying jet bike that can shoot missiles. One of the most adaptable, pretty fast vehicles in the game is also used for griefing. (For obvious reasons.) Anyone that plays gta should- maybe if needs one of these. While they are fun to move around in, they can also be very annoying.This concludes my review of the game. As far as rating would go, I have a decent amount of fun on this game when I'm not being tormented by modders. If it were free of modders I would give it a 7 or 8 out of 10. In its current state however, I would say a 5 or 6. If you can make your own public lobbies then it isn't too much of a problem though. Thanks for reading. :) I would suggest getting the game IF IT IS ON SALE!!!!! and only if it is on sale, and trying it for the time steam allows you to before you can't refund it."

This game is not worth playing anymore unless you solely intend to play single player."

A great story with indescribably great characters. A detailed and big world. There`s so much to explore. The graphics are already breathtaking. With great attention to detail.BUT! There is also the ONLINE MODE: That's downright ridiculous. Endless loading time, overpriced content, boring missions... I'm annoyed by GTA Online.

384,Adrianthx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Adrianthx/,519,21,0,301.4,April,"17,",123,21,1,GTA Online doesn't have any anticheat.With GTA Online being a game where you can purchase currency for the game with real money surely they can't legally be selling shark cards right now. Someone can literally spend £50 on a shark card and have all that money drained by a modder in seconds. With this catastrophic exploit in the game surely Rockstar are not legally compliant in still selling shark cards until this is fixed. So I urge them to take shark cards off of steam until this is properly patched.

386,Elixus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/superelixus/,204,5,0,881.2,December,"24,",157,9,1,"GTA V is a hit-or-miss game. The greatness shines in the singleplayer with its amazing and flamboyant narrative, good character development, and well-written dialogue. I would certainly recommend buying the game purely for the story mode - at a discount of course. I don't think it's worth the $59.99 price tag as it is. If you're a fan of a good crime narrative, GTA V is definitely the game for you.Perhaps the weakest element of GTA V is the online mode. Most of the reviews here are complaining about the modders, hackers, false bans, and griefing players who ruin the experience for other players, which is quite true. However, let's dive into the more fundamental elements of the online mode's overall design structure. This review will be mainly about the online experience, as Rockstar continues to update the game's online sessions with new adversary modes and DLC today. : In a nutshell, GTA V's online design is nothing short of awful. The menus are incredibly cluttered with lists upon lists of jobs (mission, races, stunt races) to do, and some of them don't show up. If you want to do a mission, you'll need to scroll through menus of needless tabs just to get to your specific mission unless you bookmark it. If you want to do missions with your friends, you'll need to go through multiple loading screens to start them. Loading back to free-roam takes a few minutes. Matchmaking is some of the worst I've seen in an online experience; it can take anywhere from one to fifteen minutes to gather a group of 2-4 players together to do any mission. When the game actually does pair you up with someone else - assuming you don't have many friends who play the game - it is with literally any player with any skill level. The game will sometimes pair a high-level player with most of the weapons and rewards unlocked with a low-level player with most of the weapons locked, often causing the job to fail due to player inexperience. Invites sometimes don't reach your friends, glitches with menus occur, and there are still many gamebreaking bugs that prevent the online mode from being a decent experience. If you're a fresh player just joining GTA V Online, good luck - most of the weapons are locked behind a level requirement. It will take you weeks to months to gain enough reputation to get the weapon you want - rocket launchers, grenade launchers, explosives, etc. Rockstar can also dish out permanent bans regardless of behavior, and you cannot appeal them. In summary, don't anger Rockstar.: Very unforgiving. At times, the AI will be perfectly cunning, dodging and weaving around obstacles to gun you down where you stand. During missions and heists however, most of them are unfair. They never seem to miss; they always have their reticles glued to you, so the moment you pop your head out to return fire, they quickly whittle away what little health you have. You can restore health in combat with snacks - purchased from convenience stores around Los Santos in free roam/freemode. If you want to heal when you're being gunned down by police, mercenaries, or gangsters, you guessed it; you need to open your interaction menu, scroll down to inventory, scroll down to snacks, and spam the enter key to heal your character, then exit the menu to resume combat. Run out of snacks or armor during a mission? You will need to quit to freemode, drive to another convenience store - or CEO office - and restock them. Buy too much and the convenience store will run out of snacks, forcing you to drive to another convenience store to buy more. How inconvenient.The AI isn't easy at all online, and requires precise movements, well-stocked equipment and health, and pure luck to beat them down.: Some online jobs - similar to quests in an RPG - require you to have more than 2 players. If you start a solo session or an invite only session, most of the fun jobs are all closed off, with Rockstar prompting you to join a public session with other unpredictable players in the lobby, because Rockstar wants the playerbase to mingle. In hindsight, it might seem like a great way to connect with other players, but with the hit-or-miss community of ""public lobby"" GTA V Online coupled with matchmaking flaws, it's difficult to get anything done.Want to do a heist? You are required to gather 4 players together to do them. Individual heist setups can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes. If you fail a heist setup? Moreoften, you may restart from a checkpoint and try it again. If a player leaves the heist setup? Everyone fails the mission, and the party leader will need to exit to freemode, go back to their apartment, re-initiate the heist, and find 4 new players, rinse and repeat. Heist finales contain the highest payouts, with rewards spanning from $80,000 to $200,000 depending on the heist, and can range anywhere between 10-30 minutes to complete. There are rarely checkpoints in heist finales; players have team lives instead of individual lives. If one player dies, your team loses a life, and in 99% of the heist finales, only one team life is available. Therefore, if one player continues to die and uses up your team's lives, you will need to replay the entire heist finale from the beginning or checkpoint. If one player leaves or disconnects while the heist is in progress, you will need to gather another 4 players to do the heist finale from the start. : GTA V Online's playerbase is really a hit or miss, though they should be somewhat feared. There are some decent and friendly players who are looking to have fun with heists, rewards, and such, but the majority of the time you'll be killed the moment you leave your apartment - run over by cars, sniped from afar, etc; this can be combatted with the game's passive mode - a mode in which other players cannot attack you, and you cannot attack other players or pedestrians. The problem with this mode is that you can't rob stores, take part in public lobby events, or defend yourself when the cops begin pursuing you.Also, there doesn't appear to much of a localization option with other players; you are grouped together with players from around the world. God forbid you get paired up in a serious heist where communication is next to impossible due to a language barrier. 50% of the time, you'll luckily encounter an English-speaking player. Most of the other players are from other countries, which makes coordinating missions and jobs frustrating if you or others don't speak a common language.: The game's online items and cars are progressively getting more and more expensive. Super/hypercars cost upwards of $1,000,000 to $6,000,000. There is a plane in-game for $10,000,000. Luxury yachts go from $6,000,000 to $10,000,000. CEO offices go from $1,000,000 to $6,000,000. Apartments go anywhere from $40,000 to $2,000,000. If you're earning $10,000 per job, and about $80,000 per heist in a great while, you bet it will take a long time to buy the things you want. Rockstar releases ""free DLC"" every few months, which are nothing more than introductions of new vehicles and buildings with inflated price tags. Don't want to play the game to earn money? Simply buy shark cards. $20 USD gets you 1.2 million dollars. $100 USD gets you 8 million dollars. And Rockstar wonders why modders and money hackers grow by the minute. The business model with ""free DLC"" is simply a hellish sanctuary for micro-transactions. You're not buying a $60 game. You're conned into paying for a $500+ game; that is, unless you either grind out every bit of cash slowly, or stay the heck away from online.Overall? Beautiful story. Story mode gets Greedy Rockstar in online mode. Bad design, mixed playerbase, unfair AI, disappointing rewards, but fun with friends. Online gets a"
387,Mingus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hawkhooves/,154,10,1,258.1,January,"2,",777,20,1,"the devs add nothing new to single player only adding more and more products in the predatory online game mode which are made purely for the common schmuck to not afford so they will flock to ""ShArK CaRdS"" they are only adding things to milk the playerbase which is now nothing but modders and hacks which R* has made no effort to exterminate.None of this new content is added to singleplayer the new vehicles, customisation, locations and mission are locked to online so to experience any of it one would have to sink MORE THAN 200 hours of grinding into the game while playing against money drains like literally paying the daily bills, garage fees, power bills for your house, paying out insurance companies,OR one could give into R* greasy pestering and fork out money to buy shark cards, a classic example of create a problem, sell the solution. R* have truly sank as a game developer even going as far to attempt to push these predatory tactics in the new Read Dead Online.People created this false hype of GTA V having endless possibilities with the PCs glorious ability to mod eveything but R* seem to be fully against this by making it harder and harder for people to mod the game with every update for fear of them  having fun by modding in the vehicles and items from GTAO (GTA Online) into singleplayer without bleeding some money into R*'s purse. The mods that are available for the game are bare basic and aren't anywhere near what we expected to be able to achieve for instance to the extent of Skyrim.However the single player is great fun despite lacking the hulk of paid for/locked content for online but that may be remedied by installing one of the few mods available.Probably one of R*s best works taking elements we all loved from the classic GTA: San Andreas such as recreational activities like golfing, tennis, working out even yoga and combining that with the new updated GTA style and gameplay.It also has some of the best graphics and optimisation of recent years being a near perfect PC port, in my opinion, with ability to play perfectly with a controller or mouse and keyboard.Also a great game to play with the Steam link."

390,Grubby Shinoda,https://steamcommunity.com/id/grubbyshinoda/,92,4,1,37.0,April,"22,","1,442",25,1,"Until today, I did not write a review for this phenomenal game. And  definitely deserves a praise.Even though I only played offline plots of the game, I still regard it as a must play.Can't believe this game was released in 2013, for the graphics are still great to enjoy even nowadays. I can say with no exaggeration that  has a good picture quality which is not yet out of date.The plots of  series never fail you. The thrilling and tortuous plot is always fascinating and a attraction to all players. What's more,  is always good at making a character.They use many statements ​​and actions to create realistic characters, along with unpredictable storylines. So here I wanna talk about the three characters in . Black, street gangsters. stealing cars for a black car shop owner to make a living. He's always dealing with all kinds of troubles for his unworthy brothers. The only relative was thinking about his own small house. And he is often in the conflicts of various gangs.A former robber, semi-retired, financially surplus. His wife has an affair, his son is addicted to games and drugs, and his daughter aims to be famous no matter what it takes. His painstaking effort was not only not understood but was rejected by the family.A former Air Force pilot who was refused flight due to psychological factors, and a gangster, was deeply self-blame for having to escape alone in a robbery ten years ago. No relatives and no families, only two errands.So I understand Franklin very well. He just wants to make more money, do a big job, get rid of the poverty, and it is best to help the brothers. As long as he has money to take, as long as he can help the brothers, he is willing to do anything.It's not difficult to understand Michael. Betraying his teammates, getting rid of all this, seeking help from a psychologist who can't provide a little help but that expensive, and get involved in trouble again to help the corrupt FIB officials do dirty works. All those just to stabilize the family and hope that the family can live peacefully and smoothly.Trevor is a freak, but everything he does is reasonable. He was so upset that he had escaped alone, so he was furious about Mike's fake death and Brad's true death. He robbed it not for money, but as a great cause that could be entrusted to it for a lifetime.Life is so helpless, sometimes you may not really have much choice.Even though I chose Ending [b[C[/b], I know it can't be real at all.Trevor can repeatedly make trouble with other gangs because of an insult. And just because O'Neill brothers robbed his own drug business and he did not hesitate to kill all of his brothers and thus make enemies with the buyer. For the sake of his old friend Michael, who has not seen him for many years, he can repeatedly endure the unreasonable arrogance of FIB officials and give up the raw materials stolen from the bottom of the sea after careful planning. Such a man of temperament, after learning that Michael's betrayal and the news of Brad's tragic death, how could he let Michael be alive?Michael's family is close to collapse, and his wife has already issued Trevor's eviction order. It was the appearance of this old friend that his family's decline continued to intensify. Not to mention that he knew how Trevor would react once he learned the truth. For the sake of family and hard-won peace, can the powerful thief in the past endure FIB's control for many years, but will not attack Trevor? Besides, he has betrayed Trevor once.As for Franklin, even though he has become a rich man in the end, his mentality is still nothing but a poor. But his ideas are not the same as his brothers. He has goals. Then one side is the corrupt FIB official who can bring him back to the prototype or even his life. The other side is the rich capital boss. He is too late to entangle between the two choices of killing Trevor and killing Michael. How can he think of a counter-attack?, not an ode to heroes, nor a contemporary copy of Robin Hood. It is just the dance and tragedy of a group of losers, and it is the most insignificant scene in the surging human drama."

It's about the Online aspect on Rockstar's servers, not any FiveM server at all.The Online community is usually absolutely horrible, either people using meta vehicles like the Oppressors or using mods/hacks to get what they want.The Online's community feels more like 1% good players, 5% griefers, 5% try-hards, and 89% hackers/modders.Modders have far too much power in the game and Rockstar does literally nothing about it. No friends&clan-only lobbies to progress safely away from some modder who has the ability to lockup your controls, crash your game, and kill you with it claiming somebody else did it.. Even worse things than just that.The modders are the reason an entire Discord server of 30+ people stopped playing the game, why we no longer care to actually progress, and refuse to buy SharkCards, when a modder can either just give you tons of money or reset your bank account and properties.It makes me glad I got GTA5 for like $5, because the modders don't make the game fun anymore..All Rockstar has to do to help entice at least some people to spend money on the game, is alloy you to progress in Friends&Clan lobbies, even if it's at a small amount less like maybe 20% less income from anything unless there's more than maybe 8 people in the lobby. If we get the ability to progress normally without being forced into public lobbies, maybe than i'll give a positive review."
408,Mapple,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mapplemobs/,383,117,0,418.3,December,"19,",148,0,1,"I liked this game, for a while. When I first got into it, it seemed like I could have a lot of fun doing the big missions and heists, gradually getting cash for more and more exotic assets. But unfortunatelty, gradually can go a long way, and this game proves that. Over my 400 hours I feel as if I've accomplished nothing. And that's the reason for some of the people who play this gaming having thousands upon thousands of hours on this game. Most of the missions have minimal rewards to them, providing only a smlal amount of cash. While $100,000 may seem like a lot of money given to you after doing an hour of cargo missions, that's not even enough to buy most of the cars you'd ever want to. You have to spend more like 20 hours for that. And that's made longer by the fact they put limits on how often you can do certain things. And after you finally get that car you want, it becomes boring pretty quickly after that, and all of a sudden you're grinding for something else. And with how broad the selection is, and with them adding a new swath of cars every now and then, it seems you can never truly be satisfied playing this game. Which is stupid, because you're playing to feel satisfied, but you can never be. It's like cigarettes - you can never have just a few, you've always gotta come back for more, and more. Which is why I say this game is addicting. But not candy crush addicting. It's like heroin addicting. Sure, they're both fun, but at least Candy Crush isn't ruining your life and your family. And you'll have to start telling your wife you spent that $50 on gas for the next few weeks, when really it was for shark cards. Ultimately, she'll become more and more suspcious, but by the time she figures it out you're so far down the rabbit hole you're willing to put your kids up for adoption just so you can have more money to buy that new set of cars in this game. This is of course made worse by the fact they have no anti-cheat system, it seems. Making just about every lobby a ""hacker lobby."" Of which can get you banned relatively easily, and takes away from the experience of the game, considering most people who do hack are ♥♥♥♥♥. But some of the ones who do hack are doing it for money, only because Rockstar has their thumbs up their ass and expect all of their players to tryhard their lives away (assuming they had one in the first place).The elaborate review is to demonstrate how pissed off I am at this game. I've had great moments of fun and memories on this game but in the back of my mind I'm always angry at Rockstar for doing something bad to the game, and I'm not wrong for that. I wish more people would protest them for all of this, but nobody is. For that, this game will continue to be crap, and when GTA 6 rolls out, that will also be crap, since they'll be copying the GTA 5 model ultimately. I blame the community almost more than I do Rockstar. I can understand their capitalistic desires after all."

415,Kastrenzo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kastrenzo/,392,39,0,744.4,May,"10,",531,14,1,"I feel I can only write a review for GTA Online, as Grand theft Auto V has been left in the dust since it launched on PC, All of Rockstar's attention goes into GTA Online now. Buying GTA V is basically just a means of distribution for the Online component.I'm level 99 or something like that, I feel I've played the game long enough to have a solid opinion on it, so let's begin.- Base game hasn't recieved an update since the first weeks of launch, they don't even port Online cars to it anymore. And they have been actively taking steps to prevent people from spawning online cars in singleplayer. Looks like they don't want you trying something before you spend half a million GTAbucks on it only to find you don't like it. - Very few of the updates have added any genuine features or changes, most of the time it's the usual combonation of a new vehicle or two, a gun that no one wants, like the antique pistol for example, and some tacky clothing options.  For an online game that's technically been going for 3 years, there's been very little innovation.- The whole point of the game is to make money so that you can buy toys, and once you've got everything you want, and once you get bored of the missions, adversary modes and races, and get tired of screwing around in freemode, the game becomes pointless, just a never ending quest to buy more and more overpriced cars and clothing for no better reason than to promote your internet ego, and then realize that everyone else in the game is driving Chrome Adders and sitting on golden Yachts- Rockstar doesn't think when it comes to implementing game features, the bad sport system is horribly abused. More often than not I find myself getting ""bad sport points"" for doing nothing else but defending myself against an Armoured Kuruma full of raging teenagers who are killing everyone on sight.  Do that enough and all of a sudden you're broke, and forced to play in a lobby full of dunce hatted griefers and cheaters... not that there's any difference between the dunce lobbies and the normal ones, and on the topic of cheating- The cheating is just insane. it's out of control, Rockstar has lost whatever grip they have on this game, and usually it's not someone cheating in a competitive mode or a co-op mission, more often than not it's just straight out griefing.  Getting C130s dropped on you, cars exploding for no reason, having a gang of stripper NPCs with miniguns spawned on you.  And then you've also got people who spawn moneybags on others, which completely removes any reason for playing legitimately because Rockstar rarely bans, punishes or otherwise goes after anyone who gets hacked money, just the one who spawned it. They slap cheaters on the wrist, often using a strike system, the first 2 or 3 times you're caught, you get banned for a week or two. It should be permanent. There is no excuse for the amount of hacking that goes on in a game of this size- Free roam is a toxic swamp of internet tough guys, racists, griefers, hackers, tryhards, screamers and squeakers. Freeroam was supposed to be the place where you get to show off, and play with all the things you earned during your missions, and you're extremley hard pressed to find a lobby that isn't full of hackers, Raging griefers with tanks, or one with a blood raging argument going on over voice/chat.GTA Online is like one of the seven circles of hell, it's a circle of hell reserved for the morons and half-wits who get off to a toxic, unforgiving and completeley malicious enviornment.It's a shame, because GTA V isn't that bad of a game,  I think GTA IV was ahead of it's time, and I still enjoy it even though it doesn't run too well anymore for some reason.   but GTA V has largely been forgotten since it first launched, because in this industry, if an action game isn't an online game, it's irrelevant.GTA V: An impressive technical achievement, hit some nails on the head, missed some others compared to it's predecessors.GTA Online: A toxic pisshole that should be avoided at all costs."

Only game I've ever owned on three platforms.Managed to transfer all my progress (houses, cash etc) from PS3 character. Game looks fantastic on PC, no wonder it took so long. This isn't your average PC port. Performance is generally around 60fps on high/ultra mix with a GTX980Ti and i7 config.To the game. Personally I'd say the campaign is worth the price alone. You control three characters, with varying degrees of likeability. Story is lengthy and fun. Lots of side missions. Great humour throughout. Solid script. Bank heists are great. Everything you expect from a classic GTA game.To the multiplayer, where a total gem can be found. A true open-world title. You can do as much or as little as you want in the multiplayer. Feel free to just explore, or undertake in the endless number of missions available. You can even play user created games, or create your own!Online heists were added, and although only 5 of them, they are a huge amount of fun playing. (Especially with friends) each heist requires several setup missions - all varied in nature. Heists are one of the best ways to build up currency for GTAOnline.Why would you need currency online? Because there is literally a mountain of things to buy. 100's of cars, planes, helicopters, yachts, weapons properties. You need a lot of cash if you want to live the Los Santos high-life. Participating in jobs online also pays (though not much) this could be races, team deathmatches, stunt rides or contact missions.PvP is also pretty well done, with mayhem potential considering some people have purchased tanks, jets and all sorts of advanced weaponry. Tip, if you're low ranked, think twice about starting trouble with any higher ranked players. If you're fed up of players C4'ing you new hypercar there is a passive mode, which means you can no longer be shot (or shoot)There doesn't appear to be any online level cap, so you can keep advancing. Though the final unlocks for weapons happen around 120 (minigun)My only two negatives would be -- Modders. Modding splits a community in two. Some people love it, some hate it. GTAOnline is ravaged by modders. My opinion is that modding is fine, if on the single player, or doing random jokey things online. It can lead to hilarious moments (shoutout to the guy who spawned a coffin around my waist and seagull on my head) but equally ruins the game. Here's why - some may have no intention of harming other players, and instead throw endless money on people (probably as two-fingered salute to R*'s extortionate cash-cards you can purchase with real £'s (£60 for $8m credits)) Great! You say. Not really. It's fine for those of you that just want to buy things with zero effort, but it leaves mission lobbies as ghost zones, noone does missions, because it's easier to beg a modder for cash. (You see this in EVERY lobby) Taking cash from modders can also get you banned from GTAOnline. So, even the good modding is bad online. Why grind a 30 minute mission for <$50k, when a modder drops $2m in 5 minutes... Sadly, this is now the mindset of most players.Now to the bad modders. Modders who use mods for PvP purposes. This could be all your usual expected PC game hacks. Aimbots, boosted health, invincibility, teleportation etc. But it can also be so much more. Modders can literally wipe every single player with a push of a button. They can set it so players spawn, and instantly explode - leaving it impossible to quit the server unless manually shut down GTA in task manager.They can change the rain to jumbo jets, crashing PC's as they cannot cope with the strain 100's of jumbos falling causes. Griefers can place giant blades outside apartments that destroy your vehicles the moment you leave your garage. They can drop UFO's on you when you're trying to fight, fire endless rockets out of their rocketproof cars. It's literally an endless headache playing vs modders who want to agitate the server - best option is to change servers, but most the same currently.- Second negative is just a general lack of cool details in Los Santos. In San Andreas, if you saw a pinball machine, or a pool table, chances are you could use it. In GTAV this isn't the case. Not a massive issue, just an observation.There is so much more I could say about the game. Overall the amount of free DLC added since launch, plus endless XP events and sales held weekly for in-game items, new game-modes. This is by far the best value for money game I've ever bought. £35 is almost incredible, given the trend of charging for DLC etc. Rockstar have given it all for free."

However, upon people actually seeing it and criticizing a negative review of the game overall for the sole reason of shark cards, let me provide a comprehensive review of how I feel about GTA V.  Skip to the end for a summary, otherwise the review will be split into an introduction, and three main sections detailing each issue I have with the state of this game.Intro: GTA V is a good single player game.  There is plenty of things to do, an engaging campaign, and a massive world to explore.  My issues with this game come with GTA online.  First of all, in my experience, it is very hard to have fun in GTA online unless you or a friend of yours has a significant amount of in-game money.  Sure, there are heists that you can do with your friends, and ""fun"" activities in the forms of online lobby tasks, but this becomes bland and repetitive very quickly, more on that later.  To get money, people have taken to hacking, and these hackers now populate online lobbies often.  The other way of getting money is the purchase of shark cards, with your money.  This microtransaction method has always bothered me to an extent, but more so recently.  The nature of GTA online is by nature very cutthroat.  The game incentivizes you to sabotage other people, which already promotes a toxic community atmosphere.  The people that are trying to make money legitimately (through CEO work, Biker Gang businesses, etc. rather than hacking) will often be terrorized by people in the lobby with far superior gear and vehicles.  This toxicity in online lobbies has become the norm; sure, from time to time, there will be people that leave you alone but more often there will be people that kill you for no reason.  And this isn't the worst part of the people in online lobbies.HACKERS.  I haven't played GTA online over the last month, but before that and presumably still now, there were hackers everywhere.  In half the online lobbies that I joined, there was at least one blatant hacker there.  Some hackers will just spawn money for them and their friends (a practice that is still ""unethical"" and ""wrong"", since it is stealing Rockstar's shark card revenue), which does not affect any other players directly.  Others, however, will take pleasure in blowing up everyone in the lobby, their vehicles, and ruining any opportunity for fun.  The hackers were one of the main things that drove me away from GTA online; why even play if there are people running around committed to ruining your fun?This brings me to my final and largest issue; the in-game money situation and the ""optional"" microtransactions.  Everything in the latest DLC additions is ridiculously expensive; take for example the ‘facilities’ in the new Doomsday Heist DLC.  The cheapest configuration costs $1.67 million and the most expensive is $5.74 million.  If you were to buy these with shark cards alone, as I’m sure many have, it totals from $30 to $80 of real money.  For an in-game bunker that is only one small part of the DLC additions.  Some of the cars can cost $40, some of the warstock vehicles up to $90.  With or without friends to play with, getting this money without the use of hacks or shark cards is extremely repetitive and relatively slow, and gets boring very quickly.  This is my largest issue with the state of this game’s online.  Without guns or vehicles, it is very slow to make money, and in my experience, it is very hard to have fun without a vehicle in GTA V online.  The only way to get these quickly without using hacks is to spend large amounts of money on shark cards, which always has bothered me.  It bothers me more as of late because of how expensive the DLC has become, it seems next to impossible to get any of it without the use of shark cards.In conclusion, the state of GTA online is not a positive one.  If you are buying GTA V for the single player, go right ahead; maybe wait for a sale, but that is up to you.  But if you are buying GTA for the online?  Don’t.  Thanks for reading my review"

433,Gamincarnation,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gamincarnation/,346,42,0,61.5,December,"6,",47,54,1,"TL;DRThis review has taken on a life of its own, so simply allow me to say, that GTA 5 story mode, is expensive, given how old it is, but quite good. However, calling GTA Online trash, would be an insult to trash.The community is toxic, it's poorly balanced, and there seem to be as many cheaters (called modders in GTA.. yeah, sure, let's call it a 'community')/griefers, as proper players.GTA 5 on story mode, 5 years after release is pretty expensive - but excellent.However, GTA Online is a swirling vortex of toxicity and excrement - The amount of cheaters and griefers is astounding.I have never seen the like in any game - in fact I only have about 20 hours under my belt at the time of writing,and I have already reported about 10 players for actively griefing(flying around, killing with missiles, waiting for you to respawn, rinse and repeat - that seems very common)or cheating, being unkillable (I got the Unnatural Selection achievement, because one player couldn't be killed and killed all npcs on screen, the rest of us just stood by and/or died) and killing every player in the session seems common (the latter, I just had 3 players do within 5-10 minutes of each other in the same session of 29 players)Ironically, the cooldown on reporting players means that it wasn't possible to do before they had switched sessions to make gaming miserable for someone else.GTA focuses heavily on multiplayer, so the vast majority of missions, heists and basically everything that's interesting is multiplayer. That can be great, but for the most part, if you aren't playing with friends, it probably won't be.You will usually either play with someone who seems incredibly overpowered due to gear, and they'll just take care of everything while you wait or you'll get someone who is at a similar stage to yourself, but somehow seems to always have a terrible understanding of the game.I would say that if you have plenty of money, then GTA 5 story mode is worthwhile, but don't waste your time on GTA Online, it is horrible - not because of the game (although once you have played story mode, the only pull in my view is playing with friends), it's the toxic players and that no exploit seems to have been fixed at any point, and the most toxic players also seem to be the people benefitting Rockstar Games' indifference towards exploitation.Funny thing.. while I wrote this review, there was another cheater, who seemed to put everyone in cages (certainly put me in one), and then killed everybody once people started leaving the session. He managed to kill everybody twice before I had time to leave the session.Update:I can see I gave GTA online a full 30 hours more since I wrote that review, despite the repetitiveness of the quests to keep your factories going, but that time has been spent mostly loading - to be fair it's a massive world, loading taking a while should be expected.However, I have been constantly loading because I have to leave the sessions prematurelyh due to the amount of bored, griefing cheaters. Combined just in the last 15-20 hours or so I have been killed more than 70 times by 5 players - those are just the biggest griefer I have encountered during that time, all of whom where either unkillable or damn near it (we're taking multiple RPGs to them nothing happening or very little (losing about 10 percent health by getting an RPG to the chest).(the cooldown on reporting meant I had to let them keep killing me(even when I ghosted their organizations they found ways to grief me out of the game, giving me max wanted level and destroying every vehicle I attempted to use, so I couldn't get away)).Not that reporting does the slightest, but I won't let R* claim that they ""can't do anything about it if the players don't report it"" or something to that effect.Anyway, game uninstalled amd I'll be seeking a refund, cause this is the worst MMORPG experience I have had. Toxic gameplay and chat, poorly balanced. a bit repetitive, expansions to the world doesn't seem to have been well-planned out, and worst of all an incredible amount of cheaters and griefers (not necessarily two-in-one, but was often the case).Sorry, my response was too long for the comment section. So, I'll just leave it here:@crispychickenwings1stly, ignoring trolls or generally people who decide to come with unconstructive and/or inane comments is in my view counterproductive - if I didn't rebuke xxxanatos' comment, it would implicitly validate both their opinion and the manner in which they expressed it, indicating that it was well-reasoned and/or acceptable, which I don't believe it was in this case.Therefore, I rebuked them, and I believe my comment, at the very least, was no more rude than the one I had received from xxxanatos.""You do realize that you can fly around and shoot missiles without cheating right?""I do, which is why I used it to exemplify a common tactic that griefers use to (surprise) ruin the gaming experience for others, as I already stated in my review.""Base your review on the actual game and not your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ experiences""I'm just one big question mark with that statement - while writing that sentence, you should at some point have realized it makes no sense when talking about a multiplayer game.I would argue that when reviewing anything, unless it's overly technical, like a CPU, people tend to review the complete experience, not just the technical aspects, simply because it doesn't matter if GTA were the best game ever created, cause it is completely ruined by the players, and how poorly Rockstar Games manage those players.""You can't give a detailed review with like 30 hours in the game. How many of that is story mode""Since you insist, although I hardly see the relevance, you may also have notice that I stated that story mode is excellent, so I provided both a review of the actual game, and the elements that ruined it, and I know story mode is excellent, cause I completed in on console years ago.I wanted to give GTA Online a shot. I played about 60 hours before quitting GTA, and about 55+ of those were in GTA Online."" You can do [...] much more in a private online session or a session with chill people""I had aircrafts, helo, offices, warehouses, 3 businesses, a boat, and I'm guessing around 10 cars.I ddn't have any yachts or an oppressor, and I have no idea of how much of time was spent in sessions with ""chill people"", but I have done a few heists (all unsuccesful), and using the watered down ""private sessions"", specifically to avoid other players, kind of defies the point of a multiplayer platform doesn't it? it's like avoiding crashing your car by never driving it.Hopefully, ""chill"" people were in every sessions, and it was just 1-5 cheaters/griefers that ruined the experience for one, two or all the other players, rather than every other player who wanted to ruin the gaming experiences of others.While you seem to believe that, the amount of time I have wasted being griefed out of GTA Online, should somehow invalidate what I'm saying, which seems kind of ridiculous to me.I would argue that the important part is that I played GTA Online for ONLY around 60 hours, and I spent what felt like the majority of that time, switching sessions because of the constant griefers and cheaters.You should be asking yourself how, in just 60 hours, my GTA Online gaming experience could be this bad.I mean just the amount of different situations and types of cheats/griefs I have described must indicate to you that I have experienced quite a bit of cheating/griefing, and I have experienced it all in less than 60 hours.You shouldn't be trying to invalidate my review, because I haven't played (suffered) for long enough, you should be asking yourself:What the hell is wrong with GTA Online, since anyone could have that many, as you said, ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ experiences"" in less than 60 hours?!Sidenote: yes, I'm indeed regretting enabling comments.."

Exceptionally disgraceful, coming from a multi-billion dollar company.""Shark"" cards, indeed.Grand Theft, indeed."
437,Jackson =D,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JackRX/,756,30,0,67.3,September,"27,","1,156",64,1,"Edit2: Rockstar have now sent a cease and desist letter to the main modding program. It disables itself online, it has no effects for hackers, it's just for modding SP. They are trying to stop it to drive more people to Online and microtransactions. Their reason was that ""OpenIV allows users to create malicious mods that allowe harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience"". OpenIV does not touch online and immediately disables itself if you try.  Why are people still supporting Rockstar?Edit: These problems seem to be ocurring less by now, but I'm leaving this review up as a warning to the scummy business practices of Rockstar.-----------------People are being banned for no reason and Rockstar agrees with them, yet they are still refusing to reverse the bans or do anything to help. Using Discord, Fraps, Any third party Framerate counter or any program that adds an overlay to your games will result in you getting banned, and support will not reverse it. Heck, if you buy shark cards and they don't work they won't even refund you for that!Do not support awful business practices like this. Their anti cheat is terrible and their support just wants your money.EDIT: A lot of people seem to be taking this as ""Waaaah! I got banned!"", so let me clear things up. I have not been banned, I uninstalled the game myself as the hard drive space it took was massive and I didn't play it much. For those who don't believe the large amount of people who have been falsely banned, here are a few more reasons why you shouldn't support R*.There is a limitless amount of bugs for Online. Ranging from everyone in your session suddenly leaving the game at once, you being booted for no reason, connections timing out randomly, all of these are punctuated with the worst error screen I have ever seen. Instead of presenting you with a simple ""You have timed out"", the game instead spends much time loading up Single player, puts you into the world, and *then* gives you an error message, with an option to rejoin. Which how ludicrously long the load times in this game are, that's a good 2-5 minutes waiting for an error to appear just so you can start waiting again to get back into the game. It is incredibly easy to fix, but rockstar still haven't because they do not care.There is no server browser. This means that with the endless adversary modes they add, all are dead within a week. The only options you have when in an adversary mode is to invite people of a similar level (which almost never works) and to invite everyone who was in your previous free roam session. If you are playing free roam, would you want to suddenly be pulled into a small mode which likely won't have many players? I thought as much. Thus the modes die off extremely quickly.And finally, the Anticheat is still terrible. You can have people flying around the map, spawning props locking you in place, dropping money bags on everyone (Which in an amusing way, can result in *them* getting banned) and just generally causing havoc. Every ""attempt"" Rockstar has made has resulted in false positives, and an extremely intolerant system towards modders. You remember how much Rockstar said they ""loved"" the PC Audience and their modders? That's amusing considering they're filling the game with dummy code to confuse them, and you will be instabanned if you go anywhere near Online with the slightest hint of a modification to your game files.In all, do not support a developer who does not care about their audience. They release modes (The recent Further adventures in Finance and Felony update is a great case for this) that require either for you to grind an unreasonable amount of money, or buy shark cards to make it all easier. Not to mention the adversary modes they throw out are easy to make and take little to no effort, as again, they'll be dead within a few weeks.You will be better off supporting another company. Move on."

443,starvix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Roxas146/,"1,104",41,0,76.6,December,"3,",655,44,1,"If this game was split into two Steam hubs for the Single Player and the Multiplayer, the SP would have a 99% positive and the Multiplayer would look like No Man's Sky. It is an excellent single player game, but mimics a trash and cash-grabby freemium game for multiplayer. It seems like Rockstar only sees their players as wallets.The lowest price this game has gone for is $30, so wait until then. When you do, just stick to single player. For a good open world multiplayer experience, head elsewhere. Cons first, pros second.Rockstar intentionally designed their online ecosystem to be like a cash-grabby mobile game. You are able to own property, vehicles, etc. However, you have to earn currency by playing similar grindy missions/heists or competitions. This seems great in concept, but the numbers are intentionally designed to make you feel like it would be easier to just ""buy"" the in-game currency with real money. Also, if you come from the single player, you get much less cash in general, so you are getting less money than you are ""used to"", which contributes to the aforementioned psychological pressure. Yes, you can theoretically get it all with time spent in-game, but this is similar to the League of Legends IP model in which the time spent per money acquired is so low that you are constantly pressured to just spend the real money. This sort of constant pressure does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience.There are superfluous accounts of Rockstar refusing to appeal any bans for online play. The ban-worthy offenses include but are not limited to: using any overlays, recording software, voice chat software such as Discord, etc etc. Oh, and make sure to hell that you don't EVER mod the single player, because that'll get you banned in multiplayer too! (maybe this is why Bethesda doesn't do multiplayer?)Let's also not mention that some hackers can appear in your public games (because you can't do these grindy missions by yourself) and just spawn money over your head. You can go jump through a bunch of hoops to try to get rid of that ""hacked"" cash, but even the fact  that this is possible is ludicrous. How on earth are you supposed to prepare so much for all of these detrimental nuances? No one should have to be this scared and pensive to just play multiplayer normally, but it primarily exists as a cash grab to support the ""free"" DLC that Rockstar releases (which you need to acquire with in-game currency, of course). If you get banned, you will get ignored. Rockstar already made their money off of you, so who cares.Rockstar also has a history of greed by refusing to put the game on sale during Steam sales. They instead will lump the game at the reduced price and throw the ""Shark cash"" in with the, so it is tough to find it below 60 bucks. You probably won't want to play multiplayer anyway. This is one of THE best single player games I've ever played. The over-world has an astounding amount of detail and nuance, the content is ample, the characters and story are interesting, and a lot of the mechanics are fun to use. The story is surprisingly deep and is on par with a gang/mafia style movie. One of the things that Rockstar has understood about GTA is that making the driving/traversing around the world fun makes everything else fall into place, and this game is the best in the series at it. Sometimes you just want to drive around and go sight-seeing, which is extremely fun. As a PC port, it exceeds expectations. This game is proof that it is always worth it to wait for a PC port (most recent example being Final Fantasy XV), as long as the developer makes sure to do it well. Uncapped framerate, resolutions, lots of options for optimization, etc. The rendering distance is great, and it's very easy to see most of the distinct features of a landscape at a long distance. One of my main complaints is that hitting a high vehicle speed can make the rendering suffer a bit, but it's not a big deal."

The story is legendary. The cutscenes are really well done. The multiplayer is also very good. There are many cool vehicles, eg. the DeLorean in the game called Deluxo. And there are many super sports cars and many military vehicles, many planes and helicopters, there is also a bunker, the Maze Bank Tower and many missions that you can handle with your friends. There is so much to discover. Then comes the mod community. There are countless mods on the  site where you can upgrade your game. Many graphics or auto mods, there are superhero mods, tsunami mods and more. Then there is FiveM or StateV. These are extra launcher with which one can join servers created by other users. This server is mostly based on Roleplay which is based on the real life. There you should behave as in real life, have a job, run this, report to the police crime and always treat each other respectfully. GTA5 gives you so many options. It is huge. Just try it."

This game is very kid friendly and has no cursing or drugs in it. There is also no guns or any weapons so I would 100% let any child buy this game because it helps with their math skills and is not violent.

466,Ebenezer-Screw,https://steamcommunity.com/id/weirdlurker/,245,21,0,548.8,May,"22,",28,20,1,"This review is about GTA V OnlineI don't even know where to start... While the game has so much potential to provide a good gaming experience it somehow manages to fail at almost every aspect that makes a game enjoyable. The COMMUNITY is the WORST i have EVER seen and i've been playing games for over 25 years. There is not a single lobby where there aren't any cheaters/hackers (and yes i purposely call em that). Be it the guy that just uses a mod menu to have fun with the game (those are not healthy for the game but somewhat tolerable) or the guy that teleports across the map to other players, having god mode on and randomly killing anyone they come across just to forcefully exit/crash your game when you give them a hard time doing that. It is ACTUALLY UNPLAYABLE in most public lobbies due to the insane amount of disturbed and sad souls out there. It's just a perfect example of what happens when anyone can have ""power"".Even if there is no hacker trying way too hard to make your experience the worst, there are still unbelievably many people griefing/randomly killing anyone they come across. And the best part (sarcasm) about all that is that the game entitles you to do that. If someone tries to deliver products to get a little bit of money which they can spend on 1/5 of a car the whole lobby gets a message about what you are doing and that they should kill you and take those products. The game tells you to be a toxic person. And since the game is catering to kids at least as much as to adults (lets not forget that this game is rated M = 17+) Rockstar is creating a prototype of gamers that are out of anyone's control.It is a widely known fact that Rockstar does not listen to their community at all (if you can even call it a community because it contains the word unity). R* has made over 6 billion dollars from this game yet they leave the game in such an unbelievably bad shape, riddled with bugs, no anti cheat precautions, extremely out of touch additions, vehicles and stories, very bad controls, balancing, AI, obsolete features (damn the list doesnt even stop there) that is has nothing to do with what they got known for. This is a game that feels like it is halfway through developement.They are milking their players with an insane amount of ignorance. And everyone who buys shark cards (ingame money for actual money) is actively supporting what they do.How did this happen? Well, money! Money is the answer here. The developers take awards, smile at the cameras, bathe in money, ignore those that made them who they are and they are getting away with everything.SOME PROS would be that it is a pretty decent looking game for such an old game and the driving has improved quite alot, also you definitely can have a good laugh from playing this game. I wish i could add more to this list but it gets tainted by everything bad about it way too much.Would i recommend this to anyone? Well...no. MAYBE play the single player game if you can pick it up from a sale but if you think you will get that good ol' GTA vibe but with friends this time... be prepared for a hell of a surprise.Rockstar has lost hundrets of thousands or even millions of potential buyers that liked to play what R* made them who they are, or at least who they were. If you could sell your soul to the devil, be sure they did not only sell their soul, they happily ripped it out of their bodies, took a piss on it, have it go through all circles of hell and laughed maniacally while getting a molten gold injection in their liveless bodies.EDIT: Oh and please take a look at those reviews. Anyone with a working brain should realize it's mostly children and trolls writing those ""reviews"". Like come on.."
467,jgfghfhgf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hjgmfhgfcg/,"1,609",211,1,45.6,November,"29,","2,956",69,1,"Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure game developed by Rockstar North. This game is the fifteenth in the series. The game was originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3 in mid-2013, and then got a remastered version on Xbox One and PS4 in late 2014, before finally being released on the PC in April 2015.  The game quite rightly is a record setter, selling over 11 million copies and grossing over $800 million on the release day, before breaking the $1 billion marker three days afterwards. GTA V continues in tradition with the type of game play on offer. You play in third person over the shoulder view of the characters. The game has three main protagonists, who each have their own story and plot to go with them – somehow all three of these characters’s path cross throughout the game and they soon become key to each other’s story.  The driving in the game has been improved over the previous versions of the game, cars feel even more realistic to drive and the game’s physics engine is almost perfect with figuring out how objects will react should you hit them (or they hit you!). The gun play in this game is significantly better than the previous versions also, I did have issues with aiming and general fight scenes before, but GTA V sets out the controls and feel of the gameplay perfectly allowing you to not run into any stumbling blocks in terms of the controls or mechanics.  I did find the flying missions to be quite annoying at times, since I was playing the game on mouse and keyboard, I found the controls to be a bit fumbly when manning a helicopter or plane, but the flying parts of the game are few and far between.  The main core of the game revolves around completing story missions for each of the three main characters; these can range from stealing cars for a billionaire’s collection, right the way to robbing banks. There is plenty of variety in the missions you can do, and you will find it very difficult to find a moment in this game where you are bored. The game has gorgeous graphics, no they aren’t photo realistic, but that’s because the game’s style isn’t aiming for that. The PC version of this game is most certainly the pinnacle of gaming; it just puts the console’s version to shame when you compare the two.  My rig which is a monster, couldn’t handle putting the game out at 60 fps at 4k resolutions, but was quite happy to run every setting at maximum on 1080p, and it just looks fantastic. Normally open world games try to reduce the graphics slightly just because how much is being loaded at any one time, but GTA V does none of that; each of the textures are all high res, animation is absolutely perfect, and the lighting effects are some of the best I have seen in any video game. As with all GTA games, you are going to get a blockbuster style story line, this is one of the best, if not THE best plot to any video game and one which I will remember. All three of the character’s story are so well written, and perfectly intertwining with each other.  The game does have a large amount of cut scenes at the beginning of each level, some people may find this to be annoying as they would rather be playing the story rather than watching it; but personally I found the cut scenes to be just as interesting to watch as it is to play the game. They fully immerse you into the world of Los Santos. Not only is there a captivating main story to the game, there are also plenty of side missions whilst they are all quite basic tasks for you to complete, they all have some sort of story behind them for each character, which are all well worth your time in completing. The sound effects and voice acting goes above and beyond here as well. Every single one of the characters is so perfectly voice acted that you sometimes forget that these aren’t real people in front of. The ambiance sounds of the city are all amazing too, there is never a moment where there is just silence, whether it is people in the street chatting to each other, or someone getting road rage, there is always something going on.  Not to mention the game has 162 songs on the radio station, so you will always find something you are in the mood for when you are traveling across the map. The game isn’t exactly hard, there are missions which you will probably have to do over again because of silly reasons, such as crashing your plane from not being able to land it (I have had to do one of the missions way too many times to remember because of this!!), but I don’t think I actually died in a gun fight or a heist of any kind, since most of the time you are with one of the other characters you always have some kind of backup should things turn nasty. Los Santos is one of the biggest game worlds to ever be made, it is bigger than GTA IV, GTA SA and Red Dead Redemption combined. Whilst a good portion of the map is mountain ranges and open fields of emptiness in the northern regions, the actual city is a bustling hive of entertainment and action. Round every corner there is something for you to do, whether it be a side missions that involves you getting your mother the drugs she needs, helping a young lady get her purse back after being robbed (or not?) or just earning an honest day’s work by towing cars that are parked illegally. The world is your oyster in Los Santos.The main story with a good portion of side missions and extras in GTA V took me just about forty six hours to complete. Whilst the main story is complete, I still have plenty of heists, extra missions, stunts, races…so much more to finish! The single player alone in this game can probably hit the heights of eighty hours if you want to complete everything, and it is something I am going to be aiming to do over the course of the next few months. Never have I played a game that has made me want to do that more! Having only played the game through once, I cannot be 100% sure on this, but I feel there is a slight portion of the game which can change depending on what actions you take towards the latter stages of the story so if you do want to replay the game again, there is going to be a bit of a different story at the end of it depending on what you choose. Technically, GTA V is faultless. Many worried that the PC port would be terrible, but they really knocked it out of the park here.  The abundance of graphical options, audio options, and options in general, really make this a proper PC game.  The game can be played on a gamepad, or a mouse and keyboard. Normally with GTA games I opt for the game pad, but the game is so well optimized for the PC, the mouse and keyboard feel like the only option for me - it just plays so fluidly. I am going to go out on a limb here and say that GTA V is one of, if not the greatest video game out there today. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game, and it excels in every area in which you will critic a game. The stellar gameplay, exquisite story line, and huge open world for you to explore;  it is hard to put this conclusion into words as to how perfect this game is – it is something you really need to be experiencing for yourself as this is a piece of history right here. 1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommendedIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

468,Archangel138,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tonytreloar/,44,4,1,540.6,April,"21,",154,2,1,"While the PC version of this outstanding game is new, it's been out long enough on consoles that I don't need to go into every single thing about the game so I'll just sum up what I personally like, (ALOT) and don't like (Not too much).Likes:-The EnvironmentAn insane amount of detail has been paid to recreating parts of L.A. (L.S.) to near perfection. Having been to the actual city several times, I could easily recognize landmarks and accurate streets while in game. The Viper Roorm, Ripley's Believe It or Not museum, The Scientology Center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same.When the sun sets and rises, all of the lighting is accurate and at times, absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around Mt. Chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities, it's some of the best weather FX I've seen in a game because it feels real. Roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes.It truly feels like a living world.-The SatireWhat I feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle that's so prevalent in L.A. across all social classes. The rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way, it's never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto.The signage and radio commercials are also perfect, knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself. This can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations.-The CharactersThere are many who dislike the characters, especially Trevor and I can see why but I liked them because of how they played off of one another. Michael, the would be retiree who's juggling family problems. Franklin, a young man growing up in the hood, doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle. Trevor, the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit, taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey. None of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but they're all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them.  The voice actors do an A+ job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life. -The First Person ModeNot only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made, it's also one of the best FPS's in years. Being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes.-The Radio StationsThere's nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking ""We Built This City"" by Starship or ""Heartbeat"" by Don Johnson.  If you like pop, rock, country, rap, trance or even talk radio, there's something here for anyone to like. Dislikes:-The PoliceThey seem overly aggresive and I don't know if that's a play on the LAPD or not but there have been time that I've simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds. Also while in a car, I've been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot I could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me.-The StorefrontsI just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but I also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world. I'd be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games.-The Sub and the HelicopterFor me, the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode. The model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few. The helicopter, while fun, could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets. Thankfully Rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this.-Real Time DestructionAgain, like the storefronts, I know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and we'd probably be lucky to get 10-30 frames per second with Phys-X cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will. Something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments.-Extra ActivitiesGiven the sun and sand vibe of L.S.(L.A.), I wish that you could surf and skateboard. Seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth.That's not to say they couldn't add these things in a dlc pack, (fingers crossed) but I just find theior absence strange and overlooked.Those nitpicks aside, this is still one of the best games I've played in a very long time and, with so much to do, I'll be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time.Overall Score: 9 out of 10"

I enjoyed my time in Los Santos just as much as anyone else although I feel that there's so much to praise and criticize Rockstar on with this product that all of it can't fit inside the confines of this review.●  It wouldn't be a Grand Theft Auto title without a wide range of unique music to listen to, would it? You certainly have to give credit to Rockstar for their unique selection of licensed music in their game!●  Not many developers have ever took the time to create a content creation tool such as the Rockstar Editor. This tool provides seemingly limitless opportunities for videos and screenshots.●  You have stealth mechanics, silencers, fragmentation mines and sticky bombs along with the ability to use your weapons while parachuting at your disposal.●  Although Grand Theft Auto V doesn't give you any way to listen to your music on-foot, you at least have the ability to add your own custom songs just as in previous titles through Self Radio.●  In previous Grand Theft Auto titles you had no way to re-experience missions once you've completed them. This time around Rockstar has implemented the feature to replay missions! It allows you to re-experience mission and aspire towards a 100% gold rating through weapon accuracy and various mission specific objectives.●  In previous Grand Theft Auto titles the only way you could save was to go to your safehouse or apartment. This time around you can quick save straight through your phone!●  Grand Theft Auto V offers hundreds of unique articles of clothing including hats, earings, glasses, armor, shirts, pants, shoes and a multitude of other accessories to customize your online character with.●  You can't purchase car insurance, call for vehicle delivery for your vehicles or purchase apartments in single player. If you take your car out on a mission or it gets destroyed, it's gone forever.●  The ""First Person On Foot Field of View"" slider isn't labeled in any way and is extremely narrow. There is  way to increase your first person field of view in a vehicle. ●  Unfortunately, it's always been this way in every Grand Theft Auto title. This leads people to favor motorized vehicle transportation and procrastinate longer than they should as they don't want to leave the vehicle they're in. For a game that takes place in 2013 you would think you have the ability to purchase a pair of earbuds at the gas station and use your phone to listen to the radio or purchase music with in-game money on an iFruit app, but no.●  There is no way to skip the introduction in the beginning of the game and it's locked to 30 frames per second. Most don't mind waiting 30 or more seconds every time they start the game but all of those seconds certainly stack up, especially if your game crashes often. As for the frame rate restriction, the only limitation that should affect a loading screen's performance should be your hardware but that unfortunately isn't the case in Grand Theft Auto V. Some people can't handle going from 80, 120, 144 or higher frame rates to 30.●  When ever you first load into single player, switch characters or return from multiplayer, your character will have their clothes reset every time. Some don't care, but some inviduals painstakingly customize their character only to have it reset. This doesn't affect your online character however.●  While Rockstar may continually increase the amount of items you can purchase with the money you earn, they don't bother themselves increasing the amount of missions you can earn money from. Not all missions are created equal so Grand Theft Auto V Online can turn into a grind fest very quickly.●  Players are segregated based on their targeting mode preferences in the ""gamepad"" settings menu. Assisted Aim is set as default thus every other gamemode on any other preference is never full and players will constantly leave. You have to continulessly leave to find a new session and at times you'll randomly disconnect from everyone else.●  On the 15th of June 2017 Take Two issued a cease and desist letter to the team at OpenIV essentially proclaiming  modifications should be illegal. They've done this before with an alternate multiplayer service named FiveM.●  Steam owners of Grand Theft Auto V can't play unless they're signed into a Rockstar Social Club account  it's launched through Steam. These restrictions only affect people who have legally purchased this product.●  Because everything you do online is tied to the Social Club service and not any sort of offline save file that you can backup for future use or load into individual user hosted servers, 10, 20, or 30 years from now when they're not raking in enough money to keep their servers afloat, all the ranks you achieved and money you earned or payed for would have been for nothing.●  Instead of adding the feature to change your license plate in-game, Rockstar decided to outsource this feature to a third party app called ""iFruit."" This app is only available on Google Play, the Apple or Windows app store."

The graphics are great and it runs well in mid-tier PC's.(Then again, that it runs well doesn't mean that the map will be fully rendered before you, so watch out for that.) If you want to give it a try, just wait for a sale and get it. The usual stuff.I really liked the story. It was interesting and it kept me playing as the game slowly unravelled the personalities of each character. If that's not enough for you, there's always side activities to complete.And then, well... There's GTA Online. Don't take it the wrong way, I love the idea of being able to play with other players, building your very own criminal empire (sort of) and overall having fun. Then again, with Epic Games recently dropping in free copies of GTA V for the grabs, there's been modders and griefers all around (They were a problem BEFORE this, but the point stands).It's hard to enjoy the game sometimes because, chances are, you'll be in a lobby with either of the two previously mentioned. Solo Public Lobbies are a thing, of course, but it doesn't stop it from being a nuisance. Is it part of the game and I shouldn't criticize because of it? Yeah! But the game condones you to, for example, break someone's business cargo, which is pretty much what gets them money. For what? For a miserable sum of $2000. The guy would've gotten more money, YOU would've gotten more money... If you had helped them instead. This indirectly incentivises players into buying Shark Cards (Basically using real money to buy GTA money), as they can't get money and griefers get more and more ways to, well, grief.But please, do not let the toxicity nor the aforementioned griefers push you away. After all, it's not the only game that has both. Watch out for the Oppressors though. And Lazers. And-Have fun, and enjoy the game."

502,Jace,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thebrownweiner/,162,7,1,761.7,September,"6,","1,036",11,1,"This is my 600 hour review.I'll break this down between single player and online.Because I have different opinions on both.First is Single Player because its easy.Single Player is a near perfect masterpiece. Probabaly the absolute best single player game of all time. If you are looking into this game for SP, then its a no brainer.However, next we have ""GTA Online""Its a mixed review.I have a lot of hours into online and I will continue to put a lot of additional hours into online.PROS:It gets constant content added several times a year the release ""free"" DLC'sThere really is a lot to do, if you wish you can really role play the most corrupt criminal to the fullest extent.CONS:I'll just start out with the biggest con.The game has clearly taken a big turn in the last couple years and its intesifying toward micro-transactions.Its pretty obvious, the keep raising the prices of items you purchase in game, compared to the amount of money you earn. Unless you are dedicating your life to this game, its pretty hard to obtain the in game items. And if you are starting out as a new player, the amount of money you need to catch up is really a huge obstacle. I am not one of those people who are defiantly against micro transactions, but these aren't even fair micro transactions.Rockstar keeps raisning the price of the in game items, but the amount of money given out on a ""shark card"" has never been adjusted. Here is an example, a 8 Million dollar shark card (unless on sale) costs $99 always has.It use to be that most items were under 1 million with the extremely high dollar things around $2 million.So for $99 you could typically buy say 5-15 items for $99. Fast forward to today. Most items are over 1 million closer to 2 million on average) and the most expensive items are 4 million with a yet to be released item that is going to be 6.5 million.  Rockstar is really going for a money grab here and they aren't even attempting to hide it. Not to mention that the latest DLC the amount of money you can earn per hour has actually gone down from the previuous ones. So higher prices to buy stuff, lower income from doing work. So you are forced to not really play the new DLC but the old ones for cash.  Which is a shame because the new missions are actually very fun, they just dont pay well.So if you are new and want to ever come close to catching up to current players you have 3 choices. 1.) Buy Shark Cards and ALOT of them. Several hundred dollars worth. 2.) Play an insane amount of hours, quit life and play this game every day, all day long  3.) Cheat - Find mods or a modder and get ""modded money"". Warning you can actually get banned for this. I cant even beleive I am giving this advice out, I use to depise money modders, but given the greed coming out of Rockstar now days, I really understand why new players would do it, and I dont frankly care anymore.So you might ask, Why do I have this game as recommmened still.When it comes down to the game itself, single player and even online. It's fun, there is a lot of varitey, I can do missions, I can race cars, I can pvp, I can play mini games (and there are dozens of varietys of games) I've played 600 hours and honeslty still to this day havent even played 1/2 the things you can do. There is a massive amount of content. The game is fun.The politics behind the scenes is horrible, the comminity is toxic, and the micro tranactions are getting out of control.  But at the core its still fun and I still enjoy it after all this time. But on the other hand we probabbaly wouldnt get all these updates without the microtransactions, so there is that factor too.I rate GTA 5Single Player gameplay: 10/10Online Gameplay:8/10 (-2 for community)Variety of things to do:10/10Game Updates:8/10Microtranactions:0/10"

Rockstar can't even keep their own stuff secure through Social Club...Story ModePros:-As always an excellent story by Rockstar, with an amazing cast of characters.-Huge Open World to explore and filled with easter eggs and fan service.-Ludicruous ammount of attention to detail put into the game, even to the smallest parts.-Multitude of side missions and activities to do even after you finished the main story.-The AI make the game feel alive, even with animals that fly around and run everywhere.Cons:-After you complete all missions and activities you feel like there is not much else to do.-Some of the places you could access on previous tittles are now closed off.-Sometimes the AI feel a little too dumb.-No DLC to expand it as of yet.Over all the Story Mode is an excellent experience to have even if you're new to the franchise. It is the meat of this game and it delives, and the negatives are mostly minor grievances that don't take away from the experience at any point. For the Story Mode alone this game is a must buy and I'd recommend it any day.OnlinePros:-Nice character customization that lets your character look how you want.-Immersive system of buying property and vehicles.-Awesome vehicle customization with tons of vehicles to own and customize.-Free updates that always bring more missions and activities to do.-Ability to play with others on public sessions or with friends only on private sessions.Cons:-Everything is very expensive and geared towards buying Shark Cards.-Toxic community full of griefers and hackers that run amok in public sessions.-Many missions are locked to Public sessions only, severely limiting the ability to grind in peace.-Rocktar support leaves much to be desired.-Not much to do in private sessions.Online started as a sweet note, but as time passed Rocktar let SharkCard money go to their heads and now it is nothing but a sweet-sour after-taste. Locking all big activities and missions to public therefore forcing players to play online with randoms as a way to prevent grinding, even though everything is too expensive. Online alone infuriated me so much that I gave up on future Rocktar games. Don't get me wrong, I have over 1000 hours put into this game and I did get my money's worth. But the direction that Rocktar is heading towards with Sharkcards is just not healthy and rather a fine recipee for a toxic community. But definetly do try out this game if only for the Story Mode alone or the ability to goof off with friends, but don't expect a public online experience without getting extreme frustration from the community. And Rockstar did amp it up with the latest DLC which takes a big load off the shoulders of people who are trying to grind instead of taking the easy road. But everything is still expensive."

We've all been waiting for you.EDIT: After playing for a while I can attach a more informative review. Will update further when enough time is spent with the story and Online portion.Performance-wise, the game runs relatively well on my GTX 680. I have suffered from an apparent memory leak bug that forces me to shut down the game, but it can be fixed by adding more virtual memory page file size (look it up on the internet). Aside from that, the launch has been relatively smooth for me.The game world is full of detail. Put on sunglasses and you notice your vision is actually tinted. Park your bike in front of an entrance and a guy might shout you to move it. It's really the kind of benchmark-setting experience that makes other open world games look bland and lifeless.In my opinion, the story and mission pacing are far steadier and faster than in GTA IV. Driving is a little bit better, hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so, but to me it feels more responsive. Shooting can feel clumsy, especially in first-person, and the guns don't feel all that special, but it's still fun.In addition to the updated graphics, the other PC-exclusive features include a custom radio station and the Rockstar Editor. Custom radio station is pretty simple. Add music files to a folder in the Documents, and you've got a Self Radio station in-game. It works, nothing more to add. As for the Rockstar Editor, it's really simple and fun to use. You mainly use markers to change cameras, apply effects, slow motion et cetera. I tested it for a bit and the end result is this:(I'm planning to make longer and better videos in the near future)The online feature can be a little bit confusing for new players to get into first, since it lacks direction, but you'll get it. Haven't played it too much to comment further, but it's fun to play jobs with friends, although the progression feels half-baked.Thanks for reading my review. I'm planning to report on narrative and more of GTA Online soon."
516,Lux,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lux_vq/,57,8,1,196.8,December,"18,",80,4,1,"The game is almost 10 years old, but I just played it for the first time.Considering how delighted I was discovering GTAIV (details, physics, lightning) I was already sitting down to V with a certain standard in my head. I perfectly remember a similar feeling when I sat down to VC after III.I won't elaborate, the game tastes like a really well-cooked, spiced dish, served just the way I wanted it, but damn, I didn't define ""it"" before.I remember a scene from the movie ""Coffee and Cigarettes""  The lady is sitting in a pub, drinking coffee the way she likes it. The waiter comes up, supposedly asking whether to refill, but without waiting for an answer, he pours more. Annoyed, she points out to him that she already had the perfect color and temperature and it was great (the coffee).Now:In III and IV I missed wild, extra-urban areas, so I liked playing Mafia for instance. However, I will never forget the first time in SA I drove from San Fierro to Las Venturas, through those desert hills in Bone Country. I felt the same when I jumped in Trevor's shoes for the first time.The difference between the possibilities in VC and SA was huge, in the latter, the latter there was too much of everything, and it was overwhelming. Here, it's fine, lots of mini-games (golf, tennis, yoga, etc.), enough clothes, plus jet ski, planes, car tuning. I am filled, not overfed.Interestingly, I've managed to avoid spoilers over the years. I knew that the game bows to movies, among others ""Heat"" (1995), but I didn't know it was that much! I dressed the characters in the screen above on purpose, because they are Waingro, Donald Breedan, and Neil McCauley respectively.Michael started out as my favorite character and ended up being the most irritating and a bit grossed out. His attitude and character can be summed up in his final words in the A-final:Keyword: Survival.When Trevor killed John in the beginning, I thought it was an exaggerated attempt to show how dangerous and unpredictable he is. But since then, he's only gotten better. Definitely the most coherent and deep character, despite the apparent madness. His attitude and character can be summed up in his final words in the B-final:Keyword: Authenticity.Franklin, Franklin... everything and nothing, fun and boredom. I enjoyed playing it the least but ended up losing the most hours with him. Because he is practical, he has the most useful skill, funny dialogue. A bit like beating the fourth wall, in style, the least interesting character from the ""viewer"" point of view, but the most necessary from the ""player"" point of view.Keyword: I don't know, maybe the Fourth Wall.I like immersing in the presented world the most, and with the enormity and variety of LS and Blaine Country and the possibility of playing from the FPP view, GTAV is a great pleasure.Random encounters are surprising. The biggest WTF I had was when I met two old men on the road trying to rape a girl. I laughed when I picked up a drunk couple and they started banging in the back of the car. Definitely an adult game, I reminded myself when I saw the short film ""The Loneliest Robot in Great Britain"" at the cinema.I would love to release a series in which I play without radar, hud, in FPP, and roleplay. The only thing missing is the physics from IV. On the other hand, it's GTA after all, and you can really have fun with V.I forgot about the muuusic. Countless stations, I didn't have time to listen to everything yet, but the absolute number 1 is the track when we pause the game:"

Even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story, there's really no excuse for not playing it through at least once.A lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since it's original release, but from an objective point of view, even if this game released for the very first time this year, it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away.The driving is much easier than GTA 4, literally anyone can be a decent driver in GTA 5 unless you have brain damage, but I guess it makes it more accessible, lol. Shooting is also much improved and is high quality, and those two elements combined with many others, including but not limited to the excellent map, make this game a perfect sandbox.My only concern is there's too much cheater in online mode, and they are so really annoying. I hope Rockstar improves there Anti-Cheat program (If there's one) so the players can really enjoy what GTA Online can offer."

One of those games that deserves to be recorded, saved and displayed on a museum for all humanity. This is definitely the best version of the game, best graphics, FPS option, mods and etc. BUT (and this is a big but), the new anti-cheating mechanism, which was long overdue since cheating is rampant, is now generating a lot of false positives. That is, players that don't cheat or engage in illegal activities are being banned for one month without a specific reason. No one is really certain on what triggers this ban, some say Discord, Xplit, OBS and even Windows 10 Recording might be the culprit. As if that was not enough the worst part is the response from Rockstar, after the ban and you try to open a ticket to resolve the issue, they have already placed an automated response denying any form of contest. Like DONT EVEN TRY, NO ONE IS EVER GOING TO READ YOUR CLAIM.This is completely ridiculous and a shame, and probably an unethical consumer stance. The game is really amazing and GTA Online is getting better content every month, unfortunately the customer service and the anti-cheating is a big stain on Rockstar’s track record...If you buy this game now, you are running a big risk on getting a ban out of blue, and not being able to play it online.

If you were planning to delve into GTA online...don't. If you do, all I can advise is: to play in friendly lobbies, don't record your gameplay, make sure your internet is 100% stable, never play missions with random people or do anything publically.As you can see this is very limiting, but any one of these reasons could have gotten me banned. Rockstar has the worst anti-cheat system I have ever seen and I did not expect to buy the game and be unable to play it after spending around 500 hours on it (which makes it all the more bitter).

Even after reaching out to them 5 times and even a phone call they told me it'll be fine and the ban would be lifted shortly. Sadly it didn't, so i waited. The last ban I received was permanent all due to being put into a server with a user that teleported player to him, froze them, mass spamed props and money on them till it crashed my game. I even reported this incident to rockstar and the next day received a permanent ban. Not a single email and no repsonse were given to me.

557,xedla,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zedla_/,103,2,0,"1,343.2",June,"16,",328,6,1,"Would like to start out my review by saying I've played 358 hours of this game. I think I have a good idea of what it's like.I'd also like to list my PC specs now and what they were when I originally bought the game.CPU: Core i7 7700K   (Was Core i7 6700K)GPU: MSI GTX 1070 (8GB)   (Was EVGA GTX 960 (2GB))RAM: 8GB, Dual-channel DDR4 @2400MHz (Was 8GB, Dual-channel DDR4 @2133MHz)I play the game at 1080p with 'Very High' settings. (Was High-Very high settings)   I bought this game a while back. Enjoyed the singleplayer until I finished it. Once the story was finished, the endgame was boring with nothing left to do but install mods. As of recently, Take-Two Interactive ordered a Cease and Desist for the popular modding tool OpenIV, essentially gutting the GTA modding scene. This is unfortunate because without mods the singleplayer endgame is pretty boring.   GTA Online is arguably the biggest selling point of GTA V. I'd like to say I enjoy it but I don't.  Everything in GTA Online is purposefully tedious for the sake of making microtransactions viable it seems. Servers are either mostly empty or full of script kiddies. On the off-chance you do get into a mostly full server, you'd better be prepared to be killed repeatedly by players who spent hundreds of dollars in real money to buy all the best weapons and vehicles. I don't have a problem with microtransactions when they're done right but I don't feel they were done right here.   I feel GTA Online is a huge victim of power creep & spectacle creep.    Personally I think this game looks great. I did get tired of looking at it after maybe 100 hours and installed an ENB mod.  The sounds are a bit on the weak side for me. I don't know why exactly but the guns just sound dinky and weak to me. The ENB mod I installed fixed this though by replacing the sounds with (IMO) better ones. The game performs well usually with my setup (See top of review). At least 60 FPS in most cases. There has always been a sort of stuttering issue I've had with the game. After visiting many reddit and forum posts I couldn't find a solution to the problem though this issue doesn't seem to happen to everybody.   I liked GTA V's story mode. Given that I was a Nintendo child, that doesn't say much. I don't have much else to say about the story. I think most people just bought GTA V for the Online anyway.   GTA V is still entertaining with some mods but with the Cease and Desist for OpenIV  mods may not be an option anymore. The Online experience has been mostly negative and without mods the singleplayer experience gets boring after a while. Overall I don't think I would recommend GTA V.I'd like to clarify that I do enjoy the singleplayer campaign. It can make for quite an entertaining and even sometimes immersive experience though without mods it does lose a bit of playability towards the endgame, like I mentioned. Personally I won't stop playing the game just because mods are gone but it is still a concern to me. That is all."

You can probably see from my profile that I have a lot of hours logged, so I hope it is telling on how much fun I used to have playing this game. I pretty much only played Online, though I heard that the campaign (solo) was great. problem is that it became a game where grinding was more important than enjoying the environment, the vehicles, story, etc. Most of the new vehicles that are being released by these updates- arent available in solo play, so online play is the only way to use them, you can use them in missions, and if you really like them, then shell out millions for them. If you dont have the time to grind and make money, then there is no way you'll get them, and even if you do, everything costs so much that you'll have to do more grinding to get that next overly priced vehicle.  Rockstar knows this, and that some people with money will pay to get these things, so they became all about the shark cards. for $100 you would receive $8Mil in in-game cash, and it wouldnt be enough to purchase the two most expensive vehicles in the game. the Bombushka alone is nearly $6Mil, or $64.98 in real cash. the mammoth tula and the Molotok are about the same. you are paying the price of a whole new game for ONE plane that you can store in your $1.5-3Mil hangar, which you barely had money to pay for after buying the dang plane. I am uncertain if they made any changes to purchasing military vehicles, but last i checked, you could not sell them back for some fraction of the original cost, so if you decide later that you don't like the vehicle, you've just wasted a lot of time, and possibly a lot of real cash. I'm tired of doing the same missions over and over to get poor returns, then spending it all on one thing. i just wanted to have fun and not get bored after doing the 20th resupply or cargo theft run for whatever business im operating. Stop giving Rockstar your money and make them do something that isn't all about Rockstar. -----Bottom line, I cannot recommend this game to anyone that doesn't have A LOT of time on their handsEDIT: @Amputator, thanks. page wouldn't load, will try again!no i can't recommend it anymore, it was tons of fun before, but now they arent adding anything new. no new concepts. each of their last additions are the same. spend at least $1mil on a new place. get packages which have a timer bewteen runs, finally get enough to sell, and walk away with maybe another mil after 12 hours of doing the same missions over and over. if this were an RPG, their additions would actually add a variety of content that lasted more than an hour or two. instead, i have to do the same bs for hours to get half-way to purchasing one item. but they know the user base is stupid enough to puchase a shark card and use it to buy a plane worth $65. more than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game was to begin with.@Rhyathymia , says the guy who spends too much time playing FO4. ♥♥♥♥♥, that was the worst one by far. you really have no idea what a good RPG is to begin with. online has no RPG basis, that is the solo campaign. smh. online has no decision making, no character development, and no narrative other than a half-assed conversations with Ron. the whole plot is making money so you can buy the next expensive car that rockstar inevitably releases that may make you slightly better at doing the same thing you always do, like terrorizing other players. Hell, they even have mods and modded servers for RPG style game play."

573,Marshie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/StrawberryPancakes/,95,3,0,216.7,September,"14,",310,11,1,"GTAV is probably the pinnacle of Rockstar's game design. Game design, where the smallest details are included just for the sake of it, yet the general gameplay is stuck somewhere in the 00's. Game design where side-content is jammed into the game for no good reason, has barely any gameplay, no reward and exists purely to waste your time. Game design, where lots of mechanics are introduced and then get no use throughout the game. ""The ultimate sandbox"" wide as an ocean and deep as a bath.In an attempt to be The Biggest Sandbox Game of all time, GTAV completely disregards the fact that all content should have a place in a game and be as satisying to play as the main course. Just like GTA San Andreas, its direct inspiration, GTAV is filled to the brim with activites and sidequests which are as bleak as writing a retrospective review to an AAA game released almost a decade ago, have absolutely zero action and/or interesting mechanics, and have no rewards (because, in fact, this game has no progression whatsoever). The thing is, San Andreas was released back in 2004, when the sandbox genre was still being figured out and the mere concept of sidecontent was novel. GTAV was unleashed into a world where Saints Row and many action RPGs exist, where sidecontent is often as important as the main campaign, and also provides a meaningful reward.Well, of course, you don't HAVE to do side content, so what about the main storyline? It's, well, bumpy. GTAV  provides an interesting set up for a criminal drama, and sometimes delivers, but, in a truly Rockstar fashion, with lots of unnecessary clutter along the way. It can deliver some truly awesome moments, but between those moments you'll be stuck with unnecessary arcs, boring dialogue and narrative that can't figure out if it wants to be serious or wacky, resulting in jarring mood jumps. The whole scenario feels like it was cobbled together from many completely different arcs, which especially shows during the final mission. Since it was the 2010's, of course the game had to provide you with a completely reduntant choice (literally ""do you suddenly want to work for antagonists who screwed you throughout the game or get a good ending?""). The good ending itself is The gameplay side is also hurt by the kitchen sink approach. The game does a lot of things at once, and none of them are good. The shooting is unresponsive, the guns feel weak, and there's literally zero interesting mechanics tied to guns - ammo doesn't matter, upgrades don't matter, anything dies in a single headshot anyway, and vehicles go in a single grenade/rocket. The cover system is still a sluggish mess it was in IV, and combat as a whole feels unimpactful. As for the missions themselves, they suffer massively from awful pacing. The game knows no restraint when it comes to bore you. You'll be doing things that would have been a cutscene in literally any other game, oh and the game just loves to do 5-10 minute drives with zero action whatsoever. The thing is, when GTAV is great, it's truly great. It was made with lots of experience a huge budget and sometimes it shows - the problem is, you'll have to earn your great moments by grinding through literal hours of filler.Naturally, all this needs be taken into account with the sequel, right? Take a smaller and more condensed map (GTAVIce city hype!), fill it with sidecontent that is actually engaging, maybe introduce deeper mechanics so doing said content actually affects your playthrough, write a storyline full of action. But nah, instead, GTAV was turned into a soulless life service by Take-Two-♥♥♥♥♥ and is gonna be milked till the heat death of the universe. The fact that THE biggest videogame franchise of all time was turned into a ♥♥♥♥♥ that constantly asks you to buy $100 shark cards shows just how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up the current game industry is.GTAV is a swan song of what used to be one of the definitive videogames. Whatever GTAVI would be, it would be a product of corporate greed, and a new set of writers that would most likely misunderstand what makes GTA's satire work. GTA as we knew and loved it died - and not with a bang, but with a long, and rather dull, whimper.Although, nevermind all that, the last line of the story provides a perfectly clear explanation on why GTAV the mess it is: -Dan Houser, ending Grand Theft Auto as we know it forever."

That game blew me away when I first played it. I honestly thought the freedom it offered you was an illusion and that the game would spontaniously end. But it never did, and I kept playing it over and over again.Nowadays sandbox games are a dime a dozen, but Rockstar has remained top dog in the fight since the PS2. Why? Unlike Volition who make excuses as to why they couldn't provide features everyone liked, Rockstar takes risks and gives you things you never thought you wanted.GTA5 takes place in Los Santos, which was previously featured in GTA San Andreas. Los Santos by far is the most detailed single location in the entire series. The game features things like industrial ghettos, vast mountains with wilderness, and expansive oceans you can swim through and uncover secrets while dodging sharks. It lets you seamlessly switch between three protagonists who are not only just as detailed as any of the previous ones, but are also completely distinguishable from each one with individual sidequests and unique gameplay modes. GTA5 looks great, plays great, feels distinctive and most importantly took risks that paid off immensly. In a world of botched launches, underwhelming overhyped titles and a desire for a game the developers actually cared about making. GTA5 goes above and beyond the call of duty. It is hard to describe any one flaw with this game without comparing the 2000 things it does well. What other modern game can you say the same?"

586,heybabyxxx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heybabyxxx/,58,3,1,257.6,September,"19,",859,1,1,"SINGLE-PLAYERI've played GTA IV (for the 3rd time) 6 months ago and now I've finally played its successor, 3 years after its release on PC and 5 after consoles. I've seen several people saying they prefer IV and I suppose it's mostly because of the narrative: besides some inconsistencies, Niko continues to be the best protagonist in the series and his story is way more dramatic than Franklin's, Michael's and Trevor's (the same goes for CJ in the original San Andreas title). Still, V is a bigger game (took me over 150 hours to get to the end, against 55 to finish IV _ more 37 hours for its 2 expansions) and has a way greater mission variety.One thing that bugged me is how easier this new installment is: escaping the police is a cakewalk; health quickly regenerates, so I've never bought armor (something that was indispensable in IV); and not only your car doesn't explode anymore when it rolls over but it magically turns back on its wheels, like it was a turtle with supernatural powers. Another big letdown is the original music, not as memorable as IV's.Having 3 main characters may have weakened the drama, but I enjoyed changing from one to another, quickly going to different parts of the map and catching them going about their routines. Franklin could have been way more interesting, never rising above the cliché of being the smarter guy from the hood, the one who knows that being in a gang in his 30s is pathetic but still failing to move on to an honest living (although he tries at the beginning). Michael is interesting, especially because he's so despicable and has a very dysfunctional family, but also doesn’t stray too far from being a parody of Tony Soprano. And Trevor, the mentally ill Canadian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, is the star and could have been the sole protagonist, because he’s the one who manages to be more than a stereotype, with an interesting and dramatic backstory; his introductory sequence, involving an old acquaintance from IV, is mind blowing (literally) and what he does to an apartment he inhabits for a while in Vespucci beach is a riot. Again, the sense of humor is one of the greatest things about a Rockstar game. Particularly on the “internet”: you better check your phone after every mission (thank god we don’t have to drive to a cyber café anymore) to follow the news, Bleeter and Life Invader, besides the websites. They’re hilarious, very well written, and you’ll be missing out big time if you ignore them. TV content is also amazing, as the talk radio stations _ the best program is Chakra Attack, with the great comic J.B. Smoove. GTA still is a great satire of the USA.  The tennis minigame disappointed me because it is very simple, but the golf one is great _ in almost every session I had to play it. There are a lot of other activities, including triathlon _ the last of them is so big that it takes over 30 minutes! Hunting is nice, but it's hard to go very far (those damn mountain lions!). And although I liked Chop, I didn't care about walking him out, especially after Franklin moves from his aunt's house. There are several references to IV and San Andreas (one cool Easter Egg is OG Loc’s gold record on Franklin’s wall), so I strongly recommend that you play at least these two before enjoying this one.ONLINEI’m about rank 18 now, so I’m still far from having experienced all that the online portion of GTA V has to offer. But, differently than Red Dead Redemption’s online mode, this one is very co-op oriented, so you’ll need good friends to really enjoy yourself. I haven’t noticed any hackers or cheaters yet and that was a pleasant surprise, because I read so many horror stories about that. What I usually meet are players that are reckless or not very good during missions; others that kick you out of jobs because you’re still low leveled; a few that think it’s funny to kill you while you’re going about your business… and some cool players too! The occasional bugs and crashes, the constant phone calls of NPCs that ask me to buy expensive stuff whenever I enter a session and the fact that the weapons I collect ingame disappear after a while (I guess you only keep what you buy) are very bothersome. But the online game can be great if played with a group of friends that “take the fun seriously”, although  I don’t think I’ll play this for the same amount of time I spent in single-player. I’ll probably return only when there are good discounts on property and money prizes for logging in. If you wish to play it, here’s my advice: forget about grinding, just have fun and the money to buy stuff will come naturally.Edit (January 2019):I'm now at rank 28, made some money and bought some property: a nightclub and a motorcycle club with a cocaine lab. The businesses unlock additional missions and it's all great, but also very daunting, because every little upgrade costs a fortune and it will take a long time until I can access all that the game has to offer. I guess I'll keep playing for longer than I thought, which can be a good thing _ as long as it keeps being fun instead of a grindfest. In the meantime, I had an encounter with my first hacker, who threw bags of money at me. I left the session right away.  The next day I played again and everything was normal."

It really feels this game is taking PC gaming to its limits, so if you have a solid rig to run it then you will find here one of the best looking and most technically impressive games for PC ever. Having a system capable of running this beast on ultra-settings will make you think that all your hardware is being put to the test and that your investment was totally worth it.I’m very happy with this version, yes the PC version is awesome and everything is almost flawless. As a good sandbox this open world has literally tons of things to do, it feels huge!Coop is really fun and amazing, with lots of unlockable missions, races, heists, sports, shopping, activities, and a lot more to do, plus they keep adding more and more content.The story mode is well developed and it has funny characters (in their own GTA way). The humor is satirical and politically incorrect (as it should be in a -rated M- GTA). At first I thought the idea of having 3 characters simultaneously was strange and probably not good, but when you play it you realize it works really well.Gameplay wise, driving is well implemented, intuitive and feels natural,  shooting, swimming, running and moving around are too. The game is cool as it is on 3d person already, but it adds the bonus of a 1st person experience, you can switch on the go and it’s really nice too. And with so many types of vehicles, ground, air and sea, and a lot of guns at your disposal, it never feels repetitive or boring.

Realmente se siente como este juego está llevando los videojuegos de PC a sus límites, así que si tienes un equipo sólido para correrlo, entonces descubrirás aquí uno de los más vistosos juegos y también uno de los más impresionantes a nivel técnico para PC jamás logrado. El tener una PC capaz de correr esta bestia en ultra	 te hará sentir que todo tu equipo está siendo puesto a prueba y que tu inversión ha valido la pena.Estoy muy feliz con esta versión, la versión de PC es increíble y casi todo es impecable.Como buen sandbox este mundo abierto tiene literalmente montones de cosas que hacer, ¡se siente enorme!.El cooperativo es realmente divertido e increíble, con muchas misiones desbloqueables, carreras, golpes, deportes, compras, actividades y más por hacer, además le agregan a menudo más y más contenido. El modo de historia está bien desarrollado y posee personajes divertidos (muy a la manera de GTA). El humor es satírico y políticamente incorrecto (como debe ser en un - Clasificación M – GTA). Al principio pensé que la idea de tener 3 personajes simultáneos era extraña y probablemente no muy buena, pero cuando juegas te das cuenta de que funciona muy bien.A nivel de jugabilidad , la conducción está bien implementada, es intuitiva y se siente natural, disparar, nadar, correr y moverte por todos lados lo son también. El juego es genial así, pero  agrega el bono de una experiencia en primera persona, puedes cambiar en cualquier momento y también es genial. A esto agrégale que con tantos vehículos de tierra, aire y agua y con montones de armas a tu disposición, nunca lo sentirás repetitivo o aburrido.A mí me encanta la ropa e ir de compras, he pasado horas en las tiendas de ropa, ¡ir de compras es divertido!En el departamento de sonido los efectos son maravillosos y ¡me encanta el soundtrack!, muchas de las canciones de GTA V ahora forman parte de mis listas de reproducción personales.En general  le pusieron bastante atención a cada pequeño detalle. Esto es básicamente una obra maestra y un juego perfecto, simplemente uno de los mejores juegos que hay para PC. Se le hizo justicia a los gamers de PC y la espera valió la pena. Yo lo adoro, este debe ser la edición definitiva de GTA V.Así que una vez más, si aún no lo tienes, ¿que estas esperando?, deberías estar jugándolo justo ahora en lugar de estar aquí leyendo esto.¡Nos vemos en Los Santos!"

I wasted 250 hours of my life in this game, I thought maybe I would get to play more.Now you may wonder why I don't reccomend this game. Here it is:Rockstar is a blantantly terrible company that bans people from the game that were ACCUSED but never actually did. This past week I recieved a permanent ban from the game because I was NEAR a modder causing chaos and someone falsely accused me and reported me. The very next day I got the ban. I sent in a support ticket, even said the modder's name that the report was meant for and the response I got was ""All bans are final decisions and cannot be appealed"". Keep in mind their support tickets have an option to ask for a BAN APPEAL. Why make it an option if you refuse to do it.8/10 if you play in private lobbies with your friends1/10 if you play online with randoms"
590,Snowej,https://steamcommunity.com/id/snowej/,441,74,0,"1,033.8",June,"6,",228,60,1,"***FINAL EDIT ???*** Permanently banned today. I am very surprised and never saw this coming /sarcasm. Why would I be complaining for months about my bans, but continue to cheat and get banned? 1002 hours played over the years, not a single cheating infraction until 2 months ago, when their anti-cheat was updated. Bans within weeks of each other since then. Hmmm, seem legit.***EDIT #200: I contacted Rockstar support online 3 time. Each time they were unable to verify my claim. I called their support (1800-601-237 for Australia) and the guy I spoke to wasn't able to verify my claim. That's 4 people who couldn't verify my claim. I asked to speak to the supervisor, who finally COULD VERIFY MY CLAIM. That's right, you actually have to look into the problem to verify it. These people are incompetent duds. But at least I got my $4.8 million back.******EDIT: My third ban finished, but they took all my legitimate money. $4,800,000 that I farmed for hours, doing Pac Standard, stolen from me. For reference, to buy $3,500,000 from Rockstar it costs $50. Rockstar have stolen $70 worth of in-game currency from me. They shut down support tickets. They say they're auditing my account, but they never get back to me. If you know of anyone or any place I can contact to help me out, please let me know.***I've left the old review below, but I'm writing a more in-depth one since I've been through a lot of ♥♥♥♥.About a week before the Finance and Felony update, I started up GTA Online to kill some time. Played around for about an hour, then went out. About 2 hours later I got an email saying I was banned.I played as I normally would, never used mods in single player or online etc. etc. Created many support tickets, which were all instantly closed. TOP TIP: If you want to send them a ticket regarding a ban, file it under 'bug report'. This guarantees a human will look at it, at the very least. Filing it under anything to do with a ban will auto-solve it and get you an automated message telling you to ♥♥♥♥ off. Good support.So 10 days pass, no reply. My ban was over exactly the day Finance and Felony came out, so I played it for a bit. They'd taken all my money, ~$15,000,000. Some was given to me by a modder, most notably I got a very large sum by beating a random person in a point-to-point race (~$10,000,000 instantly for winning). My money was reset to $20,000.TOP TIP #2: You don't get banned for receiving or using modded money. Only by being a cheater. Google it if you don't believe me, there's a post by Rockstar Games on their support forums.About 2 hours later, I was banned again. 1 month this time.At this point, I'd spoken to a lot of other people with the same issue, but no word on whether Rockstar was even aware of it.About a week into the 1 month ban, I heard people were getting unbanned. Started up the game, and I was unbanned too. I have screenshots in my library that show the initial ban, the 1 month ban, and then the unban message. Stating my RP had been returned to a previous state for whatever reason.So I played normally, everything seemed fine.That is, until about a week ago. There was another ban-wave. Wouldn't you know it, I was banned again. 1 month again. There is a screenshot of that too, which proves my other ban was overturned (Rockstar NEVER overturn bans, unless they ban you by mistake). I received my second 1 month ban before the first one was even scheduled to end.I am still banned now, and have been banned for almost 1 month all up, completely illegitimately. ♥♥♥♥'s ♥♥♥♥♥♥, Rockstar doesn't care and I get a bunch of nerds telling me I deserved it.It's interesting to note that Rockstar have not contacted me at all through-out this entire mess. Not even when I was unbanned, to let me know they'd fixed their ♥♥♥♥ up. Much less to apologies.Also interesting to note that a lot of people blamed VoIP programs and a bunch of those nerd gamer overlay programs for getting them banned. I don't use any of that ♥♥♥♥, and it still happened to me. All just speculation.10/10 game.♥♥♥♥♥♥ old review bellow.__________________________________________________________EDIT #2: BANNED AGAIN. THANK YOU ROCKSTAR. THANK YOU.EDIT #1: UNBANNED NOW. THEY DUN ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UP. THEY TOOK ALL MY MONEY THOAt least 1 hacker in every single online session, and they choose to ban ME for 10 days instead. Try to contact Rockstar, and they instantly close your ticket with an automated message telling me cheats have been detected, but no proof of course. So I do some reasearch, seems like a lot of people were hit with a false-positive and Rockstar doesn't care."

It comes with GTA online where you can have your own character and get Free DLCs while grinding in heists or missions, solo or with friends, to get that new car you liked.Fun facts about the game:• It's based in Los Angeles, USA• It has a foul language coming from the NPCs, so be careful buying it.• It can be addictive, but fun at the same time, especially playing online.• You might need to buy ""Shark cards"" to get some in-game money to spend on your favorite item(s) but i highly suggest you grind your way there, since heists are available and are a good source of money.And finally, while GTA is a fun game, it has a problem with modding, or simply cheating, where you might find players using mods to alter the game's way to be, therefor making it either fun or unplayable, or even getting you banned by giving you Free money in-game, so i highly suggest you DON'T go near them and just leave the lobby as soon as you spot one. Other than that it's a fun enjoyable game.Recommended. ✔️"

Sometimes you can't even play because your controls are locked for the cheater's amusement. Cheaters can kick you and ban you. I've even heard of players getting banned for reporting the cheaters, and the cheaters just remove their reports. There's no PvP, just you getting destroyed by outlandish stuff like a meteor falling out of the sky while you're in passive mode. Just the other day Jesus popped up out of nowhere and killed me. He said ""you're not worth saving"" with a rather disgruntled look on his face and shot me with an RPG. It's like you can't even step out of your apartment or you are instantly griefed."

597,Ropongo,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198439913860/,33,2,1,423.4,January,"31,",16,0,1,"It's fun to play offline mode with mods after finishing the main story. It could have been better if the online vehicles and weapons were included (so I wouldn't have to download a lot of mods), but after a while it can get quite repetitive. So why not hop on to online? Well.....Online is better played with your friends than alone, because of trolls, griefers, and quitters. It's really hard to start the apartment heists or most heists in general with randoms or trolls who would quit halfway or waste your time in the prep phase with no repercussions. Since these heist are very vital for beginners, considering how expensive some items in this game can be, it really is a turn off for new players to continue playing in this kind of environment. What's most annoying however are the locked items you can only get by leveling up in these ""dead game modes"" where your only chance of playing it is if you invite a friend. Whats worse is that it takes a lot of time to level up in these game modes and I don't have the time and patience to spam play that mode with my friend, if the max payout per game is just a bar in that respective game mode (arena war or tuners).And don't get me started at the locked color modifications! I mean you can buy an autoshop and modify them there, but that's only reserved for non-warstock vehicles. I get the performance upgrades, but  Its not like that color does anything other than being an aesthetic feature.Overall:If you have friends to play this game with then, by all means, buy this game and play with them. Otherwise, the climb to  the top will be rough, depressing, and not worth the effort. Just play story mode with mods and have fun :) GTA Story Mode: 8/10GTA Online: 5/10"
598,Novalkyrja,https://steamcommunity.com/id/novalkyrja/,284,47,0,"1,656.5",April,"12,",408,13,1,"The game is both singleplayer and multiplayer, so I'll rate the product with both in consideration with the current asking price. TL;DR included at bottom.The story in singleplayer is great, but you're only getting half of a product that is now three years, six months old if that is all you buy the game for. The story has not been touched since release and as game value is set to depreciate as newer and better engines and systems come out, it's not worth what it currently costs. Compare it to buying a vehicle, and how it's value depreciates as the technology involved slowly moves from state of the art to not so much.It's not obsolete, but it's not new or fresh enough to be 'new game value' based on singleplayer alone.Multiplayer can be great, and with the right group of people, it usually is. The online activities are fun, the mission creator is fun & open-world sessions can also be fun- But generally only if you're playing with close friends and avoiding random stranger-dangers. Multiplayer is built around microtransactions, with any and all new DLC requiring a disgusting grind of the same 5 heists, the same well-paying contact missions and the seldom double GTA$+RP events. I mean disgusting as in they purposely make the grind unreasonable to better entice you, the player, to keep giving this multi-billion dollar company more and more of your hard earned money. That's a good business model, a really good one. It's where you sell a game, and then continue selling more and more of the game. But wait, there's more!Nevermind the grind, if that doesn't bother you. It didn't bother me too much, either, knowing the prices of the cars released cost roughly $40 USD each in GTA$ if you couldn't be assed to spend hundreds of hours grinding it out. If you were fortunate, a player who downloaded a trainer menu (read; a cheat menu) would take a break from looping explosions on every player in the open-world sessions and drop sweet, sweet GTA$ nectar on your thirsty, starving character. Presuming they don't use that menu to crash your game, as they do. It's never a nice feeling, watching your game explode into oblivion before drifting away to the sweet release of death as thousands of clones split from the void that has become your character.But that didn't happen too often. There have been cheaters ever since the game released, from console to PC; though the PC release saw with it the PC potential for modding, which caused a massive influx of cheaters that the game has failed to recover from. My biggest issue with the game is not the fact that items were either paygated or locked behind thousands and thousands of hours, it was not the community, nor was it even the modders themselves. My issue with it was the fact that a multi-billion dollar company that has earned several mass fortunes each week since release cannot be assed to properly implement a system that properly deals with the mod menu issue, and it has seemed they do not care UNLESS their profits (earned by selling GTA$ for real $) is impacted by the modding players dropping free GTA$ on everyone in range. You can look up a slew of the menus and see for yourself that if an option it gives the player affects the cash-flow of Rockstar selling cash for money, it's seen as risky/high chance of being caught.To add onto their stinginess with spending any of their hard earned several billion dollars, I've come to the conclusion that they pay their customer support workers in bottlecaps and breadcrumbs, judging by the few tickets I've sent in. TL;DR Singleplayer good; only worth it if game is on sale for %50 off. ($30 USD or less)Multiplayer bad; Only good in private sessions, or else cheaters will grief you, lock your character, loop you in endless explosions, attach large obnoxious objects to you, become invincible because they do not like PvP in a PvP game, crash/lock your game forcing either a game force-close or a computer restart, or if you're fortunate they will drop money on you. (Before murdering you and your mother)Rockstar is in it for the money, as any good business should be & they are quite successful at it. Their PR is absolute ♥♥♥♥ and they do not give a rats ass about their clientbase. Rockstar management is full of horse eggs.░░░░░░░░░░░█▀▀░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▀▀▀▀░░░░░█▄▄░░░░░░░░░░█░█░░░░░░░░░░▐░░░ ░░░░░░▐▐░░░░░░░░░▄░▐░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░▄▀▀░▐░░░ ░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░▐░▄▄▀░░░░ ░░▄▀░░░▐░░░░░█▄▀░▐░░░░░ ░░█░░░▐░░░░░░░░▄░█░░░░░ ░░░█▄░░▀▄░░░░▄▀▐░█░░░░░ ░░░█▐▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░░▐░█░░░░░ ░░▐█▐▄░░▀░░░░░░▐░█▄▄░░░ ░░░▀▀░▄Rockstar▄░▐▄▄▄▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░"

I'm not a multiplayer guy and were it up to me, I'd separated GTA V solo and GTA Online completely. But anyway, that's not an issue, and I'm just talking of the single-player game Rockstar finally released on the PC, despite their ugly ""maximize profits"" policy. And I really think that GTA V is hugely overrated.A little spoiler up ahead (it's not even a spoiler, technically): At the end of the game, Michael says ""I'm too old for this"", and that's, I think, the words of Sam Hauser.You see, technically GTA V kicks asses, alright, it is still the best GTA-like game on the market. You have cars, bikes, boats, jets, a helluva lot of activities and stuff to make your play a unique one, an unforgettable experience... But it fails in the most major aspect, for what so many people loved Vice City and San Andreas titles: the attractiveness of the story. The compassion thing. I've blamed the GTA IV for it, and it's the same, and somehow even worse with the GTA V! Just like the Mafia 2 & 3, where the main characters are so boring and unpleasant people I'd kill them myself, were it an option.The case of GTA V is worse than GTA IV and a lot worse than San Andreas by the originality option as well. Let's take Trevor, for instance - for he's obviously the most noticeable guy of the whole trio. He's all kinds of a bad dude, sure, but I've played the game with just the same character a decade ago! It was the Scarface, and even the ""special"", the rage mode, was the same for Tony Montana, as it is for Trevor. Scarface game was quite a mediocre one, somewhere on the level of True Crime maybe, and by the time of San Andreas, it would be a joke to copy something into Rockstar game what was done in some wannabe competitors title. Today it's a major issue. Now, GTA V is still a quite good GTA-like game, it's still making shots and all, but it's just one in a row. It's not an overmighty king it was once.Oh, I'm sure that 10-years old who now plays and streams GTA Online like mad, are not gonna agree with me. And some middle-to-old aged creeps like Sam Hauser itself would point me at the more realistic world around, that was made in GTA IV and V. I know, I know, I'm myself a middle-aged creep who likes realistic stuff much more than some phantasy elves and ponies. But, there is still a compassion thing. A mood after playing San Andreas or Saints Row 2 is better in my case than the mood from GTA 4, 5, or Saints Row 3, 4... Those late games provide less than pretends, and sometimes even hollowing your emotions rather than provide you with some new and strong ones.So, let's come to the mark thing. I'll give GTA V a 7.5/10, for the amount of work they made. Minus point is for hollowing unlikely characters, minus point for an overall creepy atmosphere GTA V providing. Even the radio was worse than usual, oh, mate, that's a disaster!"

After playing GTA V more than 300 hours I think now it´s time to discuss buisness!PROS: -The singleplayer in this game is awesom .... there is so much you can do that you will have fun for many hours and more.-The storry from singleplayer is great, good redline through the game with lot´s of fun missions and great heists.-Graphics on high end PC are quite nice, could have been better :D-Fantastic ambience throughout the whole world ! AMAZING !-Masterpiece of soundtrack! The radiostations in this game are really good and have something to offer for almost every taste of music!-Great sarcasm and lots of eastereggs and funstuff to find or collect.-TV and Internet ... all thumbs up :DCONS:-The multiplayer!!! (I have waited sooo long to play a GTA game in actual multiplayer together with friends and puplic people! but it is impossible)-Permanent laggy gamesessions.-Connection errors all the time.-Friends getting kicked out of invite only sessions permanently!-Hours of loading screens!!!! (I´m running this game on high end PC with SSD drive and still loading for hours)-very low payout rate of money! (a friend played GTA V on PS3 and told me that the payouts were way better back in the days ... so they nerfed the payouts down after releasing heists! it takes really long to save up for something big like hydra or whatever) which takes me to my next point ...-HACKERS!!! The damn game is full with hackers .... everywhere!!! Rockstar doesn´t seem to do a lot against them because they are everywhere at any time!!!! jumped through 5 puplic lobbies, encountered 7 hackers.breaking the whole realm, shooting moneybags or cars out of their weapons, teleporting with godmode, screwing up other peoples clients so that they get banned instead of the true hacker! I`M SICK OF THEM ....I ALSO AM SICK OF ♥♥♥♥♥ PLAYERS JOINING THE LOBBIES ... FIRST QUESTION ASKED: Is there a hacker here, I need money!!! WTF ... such a-holes should be banned too, right from the moment they typed in this question! Don´t missunderstand me here, I HAVE A 0 TOLERANCE POLICY FOR HACKERS! They ruin everybodys game expierience!!!

The over-world has an astounding amount of detail and nuance, the content is ample, the characters and story are interesting, and a lot of the mechanics are fun to use. The story is surprisingly deep and is on par with a gang/mafia style movie. One of the things that Rockstar has understood about GTA is that making the driving/traversing around the world fun makes everything else fall into place, and this game is the best in the series at it. Sometimes you just want to drive around and go sight-seeing, which is extremely fun. As a PC port, it exceeds expectations. This game is proof that it is always worth it to wait for a PC port, as long as the developer makes sure to do it well. Uncapped framerate, resolutions, lots of options for optimization, etc. The rendering distance is great, and it's very easy to see most of the distinct features of a landscape at a long distance."

They will take your money, and they will blame 'you' for accepting modded cash. They used it as an excuse multiple times to drain my account, over multiple sessions, over a period of months. Example: Say you went into a lobby, and some ass hat just started flooding accounts with GTA$. You tried to leave the session, but before you could you wound up with some 75 million in your account. Instead of buying cars or what ever people do with modded cash, you sit on it. You start making some money, and start purchasing business upgrades and realestate upgrades. You get a notice a month later that R* has debited your account - 'x' dollars. So you're like, okay, fair enough. Well you spent about 20 million over what you had accumulated yourself (about 30 mil) before they took the money away. At no point do they mention that they can just reach right in whenever they want after the fact and continue removing GTA$. Months pass, and some new DLC is coming out. They gotta make sure they drive up them shark card sales. I log on... 'Your account has been debited - 'x' amount', and convieniently enough, they drain my account empty again. After just spending the past month working up enough cash to get a head start on the DLC content, they swipe it away. I contact R* support, and they pretty much tell me what I had initially feared. They can, at any point in time, regardless of how much time passes, continuesly remove cash from my account to make up for the illigitimate, but not requested, GTA$ that was placed into my account against my own free will.

I cant say Ive ever had a game I both loved and hated at the same time.I'll start off by saying that this game IS good. My negative review is simply because it doesnt deserve such high praise.Everything in this game thats good is offset by something bad, almost always tied directly to Rockstar being greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The world is incredible. Beautiful map, the amount of detail is astonishing. The vehicles are fantastic. Theres plenty to do and see. Its also a NIGHTMARE to play.You'd think some of that over $500,000,000 they made JUST IN MICROTRANSACTION SALES would go into moderating the online play, but that would cut into their profits.It is next to impossible to join a single server that isnt plagued with MULTIPLE modders. Almost all of which do nothing but blow you up, teleport and godmode their way to win events, strip your weapons, and crash your client. Considering the price of EVERYTHING in this game is set by Rockstar to try to make you buy their horrendously overpriced shark cards, Having modders ruin damn near everything in the game that you can use to make money makes it next to impossible to buy anything if you werent lucky enough to have had cash dumped on you ages ago that didnt get you banned. The only modders Rockstar ever seems to even try to deal with are the ones that spawn money, because Rockstar doesnt care about players who are ruining the game, only ones that might make them lose money from microtransactions.Once Rockstar has your money for the game, they dont give a ♥♥♥♥ how your gameplay is.They even removed the ability to email information about modders in, which could include video footage. Now its just the report button. Which the latest mod menus seem to be able to block from sending anyways, from what everyone says now.I dont regret having bought the game, but its saddening to see Rockstar going the way of EA and so many AAA game devs these days. I'll honestly have to think hard about it on whether I'd be willing to buy a new GTA after this one.I miss the developer that ruined my childhood innocence with San Andreas back in the day.

November 8th: Me and a few friends decided to try the new Deadline game mode after messing around in a private free mode lobby for a while. We do this, and when were done, I got sent in to a public game for about a minute before I quit the game. Approximately two hours later, I get an email saying my account broke the EULA and terms of service, and I have been suspended for 30 days and my stats reset. Why? I have never once cheated/hacked/modified my game files. If I had to guess, there was probably a hacker in the public game I was in, and I was in just long enough to get dragged along with him. All the horror stories about getting suspended are true, I found out. I tried contacting support and got a copy/paste response about how the ban system works. My friend also contacted them and got a name for me to ask for, even going to the length of calling their support hotline and speaking to a (rather cocky) employee who told him that I would have to call (the entire call was also recorded). It was late at night at the time I heard about it so instead of calling, I sent in another ticket explaining in detail what happened, and mentioned his ticket number and the persons name...same response. Thanks Rockstar for taking over 600 hours of gameplay away from me for no real reason.

If you can catch a  on this and get it for $15 I would  giving it a try if you liked previous GTA's, it is worth those $15.However, as much as I like GTA5's Story Mode ... GTA-Online is a total different story. I guess you now expect me to talk about all the evil Hackers and Cheaters that roam Online ... but that is  the main reason I would  recommend to get GTA5 only for the GTA Online part.GTA Online is  What you do in GTA-O early on is run some missions for paltry money, trying to save up enough to finally buy a Business. All that said Business then is for is adding more Missions that can be grinded.The worst part is most Missions have one version of them, so it feels like you play the same thing over and over and over. Like if you do the Grand Perico Heist as example, the Prep-Missions you need to do are always the exact same, in the Heist itself then the enemy placement is always the same. If you would program a Bot well, he could play and replay the same stuff to a T since there is no variance to it to shake up the gameplay.If you like games where all you do is grind the same thing non stop give it a shot, especially if you play it with 3 or more Friends. So as usual ... everything is better with Friends, even grind trash like GTA-O."

I love the singleplayer mode and think it contains one of the most amazing, meticulously crafted game worlds of all times and is still worth its full price… However, the online mode is a completely different beast. And since I can‘t review them separately, I have decided to give the thumbs down for the increasingly annoying cash grab that is GTAO.The concept itself is fine. There are lots of fun missions and crazy stunt races that you can play alone or in teams. You can buy all kinds of vehicles and tune them, and you can buy a lot of garages, apartments and businesses to brag with and do missions that give you higher rewards.In theory, a fine concept. In reality: not so much.Problem 1: Cheaters. This problem is old news, since Rockstar never planned to use their own secure server network, because it would be too expensive and would narrow their sweet, sweet revenue. So they made it all client-based, which is a walk in the park for cheaters. They are everywhere, and R*s banning policy doesn‘t change anything, even worse: Honest people get banned for doing nothing wrong (or being targeted by one of the ""money cannons"" that spawn lots of cheated cash on your position, forcing you to pick it up). The world record times for EVERY race, be they two miles or ten, are around the ten second mark, which is a slap to the face of all the people who seek a fair competition.Problem 2: ""Nudging"". GTAO is all about selling you ""shark cards"", the ingame currency that you can buy for real world money (and which generate the mountainous amounts of revenue for the game company). And there is a lot to buy, even the smaller businesses are so expensive that you have to grind for days. Which wouldn‘t bother me that much, if the game wouldn‘t harrass you so aggressively to buy that stuff. About a year ago, there was not that much hassle, I got one or two phonecalls after I logged in to remind me of new mission opportunities. One or two emails about new stuff to buy, that‘s it. Nowadays when I go online I get up to 8(!) calls in the first ten to fifteen minutes, nagging me to buy this business and try that opportunity, together with a cascade of about twenty or so message texts spamming the top left section of the screen. And there is NO option to turn the cellphone off, refuse to answer the call or to turn off the messages. The annoying thing is, when a call pops up, you can‘t perform any other action and have to wait for up to two seconds till you can terminate it, which doesn‘t sound like much but can be a very long time when you are in the middle of a shootout.So I thought, okay, I‘ll buy some of those businesses and the calls will stop.O boy, was I wrong. I bought two enterprises - and now I get even more calls, BECAUSE I HAVEN‘T BOUGHT THE OTHER OPTIONAL STUFF THAT GOES WITH THEM YET AND I DID NOT EVEN USE THESE OTHER AMAZING FEATURES ONCE…Especially problem number 2 is is very infuriating, because the single player game seems very consciously designed NOT to be annoying and to present a smooth experience.Whoever is in charge of the online game mechanics policy is very aware of what they‘re doing.I can only plead to everyone to stay away from those shark cards. Don‘t encourage this shoddy, shifty business practice.Shame on you Rockstar."

I was never allowed to play it before I moved out of my mom's a year ago, so generally speaking my reviews are on the game as it stands now.Summary: An open world crime sandbox game with a detailed, well-scripted (although short) story mode and full featured online mode with a full fledged online mode. [singleplayer] follow the story of Franklin (an up and coming thug from the hood with strong ties) Michael (an ex-criminal who is trying to stay on the downlow with a faked death coverup by the government, a slutty daughter, a loser son, and a B***h wife) and Trevor (unique phyco who litterally is not able to stop suprising you) as they go to pull of their greatest heists.[online] full featured open world with a light weight immersive story that is designed for multiplayer gaming where you custom make yout character.PROS:- Detailed graphics- A online mode that is constantly getting updates and new features.- Highly advanced online character creator- Comercial and shows that are more honest and real than real life- Mock internet that is amazing- Tons of comunity created as well as first-party missons that expand every day- Well developed protagonists that each one has many things that make them unique- Heists in online mode and singleplay that give you multiple outcomes and payouts depending on the crew and way you chose to do itCONS:- Ever since the introduction to shark card, the payouts for online mode over all is terrible (with the exceptions of Heists which has been planned and developed before the game released)- Online hacking is terrible (because of ileagle mods which is why Take-2 took drastic mesures in the first place). It is good as long as you stick to playing with friends and don't join open freemodes.- Generally does not integrate well with Discord (this is actually just a con of personal prefrence, and as long as you don't care about game overlay, is not a problem)- despite requirments for the game, This game will run okay on most of your current everyday PCs (modern and with optimization)NETURAL:- Cops are extremly unrealistic. It makes the game playable and beatable. But really, flipping the bird to a cop sitting on the side of the road causes same outcome as robbing a bank.- Terrible flying controls when playing with keyboard/mouse (controller fixes this)OVERALL:an amazing game and well reccomended"

There is not much to say about it that hasnt already been said. It is one of the best I have ever played. I am not new to the GTA franchise, and have always held San Andreas on a ridiculously high pedastal, but I would say that this game has exceeded everything San Andreas held for me. The story is immersive, the characters are unique, insane and well built. There is plenty to do and more than enough to keep you coming back way after the final heist is complete. It is one of the best games of all time and every gamer should have this in their library (I somehow own it over 2 consoles plus PC).However - I also have to include a review of online play in here too. Which is where I become torn. I have spent many hours online, doing various heists with friends, completed CM, grinding CEO, MC, bunkers, hangers ... grinding - endlessly.The problem is that everything in the game is now so expensive that its becoming obvious Rockstar are trying to push people into buying Shark Cards to be able to afford everything the game has to offer without spending days/weeks/months killing your soul with grinds - or cheat.Leading me on to issue number two with online play - other people. Hackers, cheaters, trolls, idiots. EVERYWHERE. And with the introduction of the new prep missions for the new heists, involving running around in free mode fully visable to all of the above, you have to luck out and find yourself in a session with some reasonable and quiet people - if not, some idiot with a tank/hydra/other form of destruction, will float in and mess up your day - or cost you all the supplies youve spent hours grinding (did i mention grinding?). Oh, or hit you with the unavoidable death ray from his/her facility.  I love playing the heists with my friends, I enjoy the odd supply run to kill time, and dont get me wrong online play is ok. But .... *sigh*I want to both thumbs up and down this game. For different reason. However, in the end I do think there is enjoyment to online, if youre lucky. But the overall near perfection of the single player mode means I cant not recommend GTA V."

Not with the size of the world or the weapons, vehicles and people in it, but with the sales figures: Since its initial release in 2013, GTA 5 has sold about 165 million copies worldwide on all platforms. That's an elusive number. California is home to a little less than 40 million people. If copies of GTA 5 were people, the total number of copies sold would equal the population of Bangladesh. The game is unimaginably large in its impact and reach.That number will only increase after Grand Theft Auto 5 is released on the latest consoles (and now that new details about GTA 6 have reportedly surfaced). After all, it's an artifact. The Grand Theft Auto series has always been a commentary that drew directly on elements of mass culture, taking the plots of various crime films and eras, relying on heroic melodrama, and spicing up those worlds with silly violence. Vice City played on the nostalgia of the early 2000s for the coke-soaked party scene of the 1980s and its visual and musical industries. GTA 4 followed the story of an immigrant into a deeply commercialized culture of grifters and schemers. Both games spoke to both their time and place in specific ways, parodying the mass culture of those eras while becoming the dominant mass culture of the early 2000s.We find ourselves here, and it becomes clear that Grand Theft Auto 5 wrestles with this paradox: What does it mean to stick it to the man when you are the man? How can you flip the monoculture the bird when you're the standard by which every other open-world action game is measured?The solution GTA 5 found to this problem, which I think has something to do with its decade-long staying power as both a single-player and multiplayer game, was to create an extremely robust driving and shooting game skeleton and infuse it with every interesting idea you can think of. What's striking about playing GTA 5 in 2023 is how unfocused it is, how willing the game is to take the player on a strange route of heists, train hijackings, cargo plane heists, and a full torture mini-game (more on that in a moment). In both online multiplayer and story mode, this willingness to engage in any idea is always backed up by the game's willingness to return to that safe, solid core. The player knows that there is always something in the middle waiting to catch him, that the AAA game's ""30-second loop"" of driving and shooting under new circumstances will eventually return. Everything is solved by killing your way out of a dicey situation."
709,Kommander,https://steamcommunity.com/id/m4tl0ck/,99,10,0,"1,385.5",September,"20,",156,8,1,"Let's face it. We all love the story-line of GTA games and their single player mode. When I bought GTA V, I wanted to continue my regularity with GTA Series. GTA Online mode for me was not the main attraction when I bought it. To me, it was like a bonus feature. Still, when I was less than half way through the story mode, out of curiosity, I launched GTA Online and made my first character. In 10 minutes I understood that without going through the whole story, it will not be wise to enter this mode because to survive the online sessions, it would be better to know about all the weapons, features, controls etc. Maybe I was wrong, maybe as usual I was more interested in the captivating story rather than spending time on the lifeless (at that moment) online sessions.At the end of the story-line, I could not wait any longer to join GTA V's online sessions, because I understood by then how much more fun is waiting for me in there. I must say, GTA V Online did not fail to impress me, for first three days. Then reality has hit me point blank on my face. And the reality is, if GTA V Development Team spent half the time of their GTA Online content development into controlling hackers and modders, they would not have to develop so much new contents so fast to ensure the game's lifespan.In GTA V Online you run your own criminal empire consisting of different kind of businesses. Imagine you have worked on a supply gathering, spent time on waiting for the supplies to be processed into finished goods for sale and on the 3rd day you decide to start your operation of selling the finished goods in the game. Either solo, or with a team of friends. You start driving your cargo to their destination then suddenly a huge wall in the middle of the road, just appears to block your way. You evade and keep driving and if you are a long time GTA Online player you would also start cursing your luck for being in a session of hackers. Another wall spawns, you evade somehow, another wall, then another, until the hacker succeeds in caging you with his wall spawning hack. The time of delivery counting down. You can't get out. You chat and plead to the unknown hacker in the session to not let your three days' work to go to waste. Time runs out, your mission fails, no one answers. How would you feel?Another one. You are driving to your destination. Suddenly your character exits the vehicle automatically and stands still on the road for a brief moment. And then the character catches fire automatically and dies when the health bar depletes. You re-spawn, same thing keeps happening until you quit the session for a new one. How does it feel? There's another steel cage mod/cheat where the hacker in the session can attach a cage to your character so that you cannot move anywhere anymore. I am not going to talk about the god modes and other bitter experiences I had during my one year of GTA V Online sessions. Yes, one year, I tried to play GTA Online, in the hope that things will improve.Rockstar had countless complaints in forums, boards from countless sufferers, but things hasn't improved and the game eventually lost all my trust on it for pure, mind refreshing fun. Instead, GTA V Online gave me frustrated nights after work many times. I could not recommend this game to any of my friends later on which I used to when I first started playing GTA Online.Thus, the verdict, if you love the single player mode of this series, then go for it. It won't disappoint you. But if you are seriously considering GTA V Online to be your main source of fun out of this game, I suggest you steer clear from this one. It WILL disappoint you, in the worse possible ways!"

Housing, cars, businesses, motorcycle clubs, nightclubs etc. Definitely a joy to play alone and with your friends.My favorite feature however, is the Rockstar Editor where you can create videos, movies of characters and use the built-in game editor to work your magic of bringing the characters alive. This game is a MUST have. Its definitely way up there on the top of my list of favorites."
715,pvk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pk27main/,36,13,1,"1,238.6",October,"18,",201,0,1,"One of the best open world games I have ever played. As a huge fan of the open world style of games, I have played many games that are like GTA but very few can come close to this level of quality. For a game released in 2013, this game looks surprisingly amazing. The attention to details is incredible and the map is beautiful. The main city at night time looks stunning and the areas surrounding the main city are incredible. The world is astonishingly well crafted and feels alive with endless possibilities. The story is great and the characters are amazing. While the story is not as good as RDR or GTA IV, the characters are equally (if not more ) likeable/charming. We have 3 protagonists and all of them have very unique personality. The voice acting is pretty great. And as expected from the series, the game has a satirical tone and I would say this is the most well executed entry in the series. The music selection for the 10-15 radio stations is stupendous. First of all each radio station has a particular vibe and you can switch them depending on your current mood or to match the theme of the task you are doing. My favorite radio stations are Non-Stop Pop FM (favourite songs : I want it that way by Backstreet boys and Tennis Court by Lorde) and  Los Santos Radio(favourite songs: Swimming Pools by Kendrick Lamar and ADHD by Kendrick Lamar: I am a huge fan of K-dot). I have bought this game on PS4, PS3 and PC and each time, I have thoroughly enjoyed exploring Los Santos. I have even played the story twice (PS4 and PS3) and I still don't mind going through the missions on PC once again but I keep getting distracted by : While I won't say it is the selling point of this game: as a free addition to a primarily offline series of video games,  the online is really amazing. It is incredibly fun to do missions with friends especially the heists. Seriously, doing doomsday heists is freaking incredible. The game has a lot of activities for friends to do together. For solo players, there are a lot of things to do online as well. From grinding for money using various businesses to just participating in random free roam events, GTA Online has a lot to offer. While a lot of these things are locked at lower ranks and you need a lot of money to enjoy all the stuff GTA online offers, making money is pretty easy and there are a lot of ways to go from having almost nothing to having all the major content in the game. For beginners, VIP missions and daily objectives are an amazing way to make money and ranking up quickly. And after getting CEO office and MC businesses, it is a smooth ride., PvP of the online is absolute trash. I used to think that it was bad on PS4 (which is my main account) but on PC: it is so much worse. Modders can completely destroy your experience. High level players enjoy shooting low level players using overpowered weapons. And Oppressor MK 2 has completely broken the online experience in PvP for lower level players or those of us who don't wanna use it for PvP. You either need to have appropriate weapons (like Up n Atomizer or machine gun) or good vehicles to be able to fight back. I usually avoid general public lobbies(you can always do invite only sessions or solo public lobbies and invite your friends to it). I don't engage in PvP (like if I am in a public session and someone shoots my character : I just leave the session and create a solo public lobby) and imo, PvP in this game is pointless."

It's badly balanced, badly designed, and the team is charge of it have a contempt for it's users. I even got banned for litterally just lagging at one point, and I am now perm banned for money exploits (Ban was fair, perm wasn't).That however does not change GTA V being an excellent game, one of the best ever made in fact. The Online is an extra, and is not and should not be the main focus of the game. The world R* have created, combined with the excellent shooting, driving, and just general gameplay make it an incredible experience. The story is weak, esspecially compared to GTA San Andreas, however that doesn't change how incredible the experience is. Don't let the bad reviews made you think the game isn't good, it's just people justifiably annoyed about the poor online experience."

723,ShelLuser,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shelluser/,125,11,1,"2,430.7",February,"3,",554,18,1,": The main reason I'm writing this review is because of the increased negative reviews this period (According to Steam; early January 2019). Although I do agree with some of the critical comments I also believe that plenty of players are picturing things  too negatively. There's more to this game than some realize...Don't get me wrong: the story mode is definitely enjoyable, you'll be taken into an adventure and see how easy it can be to fall into the darker regions of society. Unfortunately though there are three stories rolled into one and as a result the game is lacking some severe character development. Think about it: there are  stories to tell within the length of a regular game play. That simply doesn't work too well, some things feel seriously enforced and don't always add up where storyline is concerned. But... it probably doesn't help that I'm also an invested GTA IV player and that I know where the idea of having three main characters came from. In my opinion GTA IV did it better ;)But the main problem with the story mode is that it's trying to tell a story but due to the somewhat rushed method it also feels rushed and doesn't always leave you with that sense of satisfaction you should be getting after having accomplished something. One of the main reasons is that there's little to accomplish. After all: all three main characters are already established within the city, so from a storyline point of view there's usually nothing more to achieve.Unfortunately it also doesn't help that R* didn't bother to add anything which could account for that. Although you can buy properties which should give you new random missions to do the problem is that they're so expensive that you'll never be able to make enough money during the single player campaign. That doesn't help at all for getting that satisfying feel of accomplishing something. The main reason for this also doesn't help: you won't get paid for most major missions (""heists"") because you're basically trying to raise funds in order to get something done... for  involved parties. And the three main protagonists just see it through and let it happen without doing anything about it. See, all those missions usually require plenty of shooting, and ammo isn't free. So the little money you do make will probably be spend on ammo, better weapons and protection (body armor).Basically it boils down to the open world being truly amazing. But the missions and the way they've been set up often not so much. Lineair, bad AI and often predictable.For me GTAO provides  which GTA story mode (single player) is lacking: a chance to truly accomplish something and get some satisfaction out of the game. The main problem though is that GTAO is a non-forgiving environment and if you make a (costly) mistake and put your money into stuff which doesn't pay out then you might end up having a hard time. In other words: if you spend all your money on getting every car in the game then you obviously won't have enough left to invest in things which could help you to make even more money. Which you're going to need if you also want to upgrade those cars as well...But in all fairness it  doesn't help that once again R* doesn't put much attention into storyline and gameplay and are basically only pushing their own agendas forward. A good example of that can be seen if you're new to the game: you get constantly bombarded with plees to buy into high end equipment which you  won't be able to afford for a long period to come. But strangely enough you  get any calls about the availability of missions which can help you progress further into the game. I've been playing for 70 or so hours now and I've only got 1 call from Gerald (for a contact mission) and got 1 car repo request from Simeon. That's plain out bad for the new player experience!Question...  You spend  on filling up a warehouse and finally managed to reach a value of around one million GTA$. This is going to  push you up the ladder and will help you to buy all those cool things you've been aiming for. Unfortunately during the delivery mission you get attacked by one or more other player(s) and they destroy your cargo with ease. Goodbye investments, goodbye 1 million GTA$... all gone ""just like that"". So is that other player simply really good in playing the game, just a plain out jerk or was this too easy for them so he obviously had to be a hacker?I'm heavily invested in this game. Up to a point where I also roleplay. When my (female) avatar finds herself in a mission which requires to go on a boat she'll hop into her swimsuit. I can't tell you how many times players accused me of being a hacker merely because I changed my clothes during missions. Even though this is a fully legitimate option provided by the game itself! It gets worse... You can eat snacks and items during missions which can help you restore health. Now, this doesn't happen very often anymore, but I've also been often accused of being a cheater simply because I used snacks to boost my health in order to complete a mission (when other players die during a contact mission they get to spectate the others, it wouldn't be the first time where I was the last one left and managed to finish the mission on my own).Of course that's not saying that there aren't any problems. But it's also hardly as bad as some people want to make you believe. Especially because there's plenty which you can do yourself to avoid issues. For example: see (or hear) people talk about hacks in your session? Then why not do the smart thing and find yourself another session to play in? Or maybe you don't enjoy multiplayer at all? Well, there are also plenty of solutions for that. The so called 'public solo sessions' if you want to do CEO missions or the down to earth friends or invite -only sessions.Yes, if you want to earn some good cash you're going to have to work for it. But if you use some strategy and can have some patience then it really doesn't have to be as bad as some players claim. I haven't timed myself yet, but I can roughly make around 150 - 200k per hour. Let's do this safe and say 1,5 hours. So if you play for 1,5 hour every evening you will have gained yourself 1 million at the end of the week. And that's  using any of the more enhanced ways of making money; such as the import/export business (stealing & selling cars), coke business (= best paying MC business) and fully utilizing the bunker (weapon selling). At the time of writing I'm working hard to get a vehicle warehouse for the import/export missions.Seriously... in a way I sometimes compare GTA 5 to Minecraft. Yes, I know i'm crazy ;)  But it's true: in the overall it all boils down to  making your own game. Devise your own strategies, plan your own route in earning some solid cash. And  try to have some fun while doing that!And if you don't succeed on your own try making friends. There are good ones out there, trust me on that!(edit: did several edits to fix typoes and other nasty stuff)"

Interesting different differetials - AWD, RWD, FWD with different power distributions like 30% front 70% back and so on. It was a little annoying that there are many rwd cars but non of them can be drifted. After using the handbrake seems like the car goes from 200hp to 50hp. But yea the most interesting part of the game seemed to be the cars for me.Some things are still really unrealistic like killing a npc with a gun what has a silencer, nobody sees or hears it but u r still getting cops on you.

The money pool in gta got inflated to an extend that a car that looks like a ramp now costs 4million$, when i started the best existing car and the car of dreams was at 1million$.So by making stuff so expensive and not really doing anything about the hacking problem they gave people an insentive to get money dropped, because the only way to get this stuff you needed to ask a modder or give up completely on your reallife and use bugs and exploits to get some money.The lack of content would be a problem too, but its the smallest i can think of, you'll have hours of fun in gta even with the existing content if you dont get banned.And here we come to the biggest contender for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the year, banwaves.When i first heard about it i was like: wow they finally do something about it maybe after this is in controll they could work on the inflation, but no, random people get banned and so did my girlfriend.I always wanted to play a game which i love with the girl i love but because of the random banning of innocents i, my girlfriend and 2 other friends got robbed of that experience. I dont have a reason to play this game anymore because the bans are random and the customer service laughs at you because apparently everyone who gets banned deserves it.You just have to go through all the other reviews to see the irony in that.People with 10 hours of playtime to 1000 hours of playtime get banned for no reason.I havent even heard of real modders getting banned.Dont ever buy this game, not even in a sale, its likely that you'll get banned or the friend you intend to play with."

A game of such depth and scale it overwhelms ones mind to even attempt to think of the development complexities involved. One that is the product of years of slowly but surely tweaking and refining the wildly successful GTA/open world formula. It once again pushes the envelope of what an open world game can and should be...... All to be ruined by hackers. Rockstar, you should be embarassed by your blatant failure at even pretending to handle the hacking epidemic that is the GTA 5 multiplayer. They are everywhere. Do something about this and I'll edit my review to positive. A company that devotes  almost two additional years of development to a PC port obviously cares about the platform, so please do not abandon us now. Clean up the hackers.*UPDATE*Well, over a year later and Rockstar continues to ignore the problem and ban legitimate players.Again, stop calling them mods and modders. If you are referring to playing the single player, by yourself, and altering the game, then yes, that term is correct. However, in multiplayer, running a program that directly effects and disturbs the gameplay for all users in a multiplayer environment IS NOT ""a mod"", it is a cheat/exploit/hack.Mods are meant to alter or improve a single person's experience, customize skins and textures, add features to the game that the devs didn't think about, etc. They are not meant to disrupt online players and THEIR experience. That is called CHEATING. Calling them modders makes it sound less insidious and more innocent then what is happening in this game. A single hacker/cheater/exploite, will quickly demolish a server or fill everyone with cash so they get banned blindly by Rockstar. Immediately the joy of playing such a brilliantly crafted game with your friends and strangers alike goes right out the window.Calling what people do in this game a ""mod"", when referring to the multiplayer game, would be the equivilant to calling a Counter-Strike aim bot or wall hack a ""mod"". The reason it is not is because it gives a single player a distinct and completely overpowered advantage against others in a sandbox environment where everybody is supposed to have a chance to work their way up.So a year and a half later, and Rockstar doesn't give a damn. I've been a life long Rockstar customer, but if they don't get this together by GTA6, then Rockstar will never see another dime of my money. Ever."

When Steam's Summer Sale first began, the base game of GTA V was on sale for $30, but it was only at that price for roughly 10-20 minutes. Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business.

Been playing it back and forth for 330 hours total. I had a ton of fun playing with friends and just doing stuffs online. Then all of a sudden i got a ban after i got the X80 Prot car (Or whatever it's called). A 1 week ban. I made a ticket and got a automatic bot reply. Waited for the ban to disappear to go in again. Then I notice all my money is gone (they wipe your account when you get a ban) so I started playing a heist with my brother and some friends. On the last part of the heist, I got another ban for 1 month. I still don't know what it is I am doing that's against their rules. I make 4 tickets in hope of getting a reason for my ban and all I get are bot replies. After a while, I manage to do a ticket with the title ""connectivity issues"" and explained that I was afraid to log in cus I didn't want another ban, and this time, I get a reply from a person. This person said ""we do not know the reason since it's a bot that's banning people"" and calmly said ""but you shouldn't be afraid to log in."". I trusted this guy so I logged in after my 1 month ban and managed to play for a day. HOWEVER on the next day I started playing, I got a PERMANENT ban and I still have NO clue whatsoever what I got banned for. Talked with some guys in a GTA group and they said I will most likely not get unbanned. *NOTE* I was NOT modding, cheating or abusing anything in the game at all. Pure vanilla version of the game. *END NOTE*The Game is very fun to play with friends, BUT their anti cheat system bans people for nothing and the Support gives no ♥♥♥♥ whatsoever to help or explain what might be the issue.If you can look past the risk of getting randomly banned and having cheaters nuking you anywhere in the world, then you might have a good time.

768,Hyokkuda,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hyokkuda/,18,5,1,"3,400.6",June,"14,",433,36,1,"I must say that there are many ups and downs in this game. The story is very interesting and mysterious since there are things you will only know or figure out at the end. This is a nice touch I really liked. I also like how the characters interact with each others. And not just between main characters but also with random people in the streets. The news at the radio stations are also very well done, including the conversations with the HQ from a radio in a police car or other emergency vehicles. All this is quite well scripted. The other types of details are things such has trespassing inside someone's garden where they own a dog, the dog might go after you just because you are a stranger. Driving over a weapon on the ground can cause it to fire. An heavy car accident can cause a leak in the fuel tank. Or even forcing the engine of a damaged vehicle can overheat it and stall it or could even catch on fire. A vehicle on fire does not necessarily mean it can explode in 10 seconds anymore, that can take 2 minutes, which is very well done! An exploded vehicles can still have flashing lights, alarms and tires still inflated. Those are some very nice details which someone perfectionist like me is looking for. But there is more, like shooting an electric box can turn some lights off or cause sparkles. All lights in the game can be shot or can be broken, from buildings, lamp posts, pools, etc.. You can cut vegetations with various weaponry, knives, helicopter's rotor blades, vehicle crash, etc... Every vehicle's dashboard has its own meters for various things such has the speed, temperature, fuel, handbrake, engine condition, headlights, stronger headlights and flashing lights. Altitude, horizon and compass for planes and such.The AIs seems to have been improved from its predecessor ""Grand Theft Auto IV"" for the survival and tactical point of view. They will do everything they can to take you on or run away from you. They drive quite differently every time, but still as ruthless and impatient as ever. They either drive faster, be scared, give you the middle finger or want to kick your butt if you honk at them. Wild animals behave realistically from afar but seems to be slow for their reaction times at close range.Each weaponry has their own statistics and they feels pretty accurate. Like the Micro-SMG will shoot all over the place like a powerful Micro-SMG should be doing. The SMG (MP5 look) is accurate, quick and feels like the one from your named-favorite FPS game.Entering a convenience store and hearing the cashier saying ""I just opened"" or ""I am about to finish my shift"" is actually pretty well done. By the look at the time in-game, you can see that the guy will say that during a specific time of the day, either 6 PM, 6 AM, 12 PM.For the bad details; Modified weaponry will have all their attachments removed once you are using them inside a vehicle excepts for sight/scope. Suppressor, grip and probably the extended magazine will be gone from your weapons temporarily. Vehicle's distortion is actually awful and unrealistic. Unlike Grand Theft Auto IV, vehicles can not bend like you want them to bend. Landing violently a vehicle on the roof can not flat it, it will remain solid like if the vehicle had a roll-cage in it. If a roll-cage was actually installed, that would make sense. I believe they did that so the head of your character or AI does not pop-out of the roof for more realism. Indestructible side mirrors too. You can scratch your vehicle somewhere, the scratch will not be on the right spot. Some AI will die in car crashes if you go at 10 MPH.Customizing a vehicle is pretty odd, nothing in the options will actually bring the top speed higher, only the acceleration and braking ability. The traction will stay the same. Some customization are pretty useless. I do not know much about mechanics, but if I am correct, bringing the suspension down should improve handling and aerodynamic for better top speed? In this game, nothing happen but does improve traction.Having no music will bring-up various default themed soundtracks, it is all good and all, but this soundtrack can not be brought down during voice chat if you set it to 0 to clearly hear people talking. You have to go to Audio instead of Voice Chat and bring the music way down. It could be a bug.I must be unlucky, or Rockstar Games lied to us when they said that we could hunt in Online session, I did not see a single wild animal yet during my play-time. No cats, no dogs, no deer, no rabbits, no boars, no cows, nothing.Normally, an ""armored vehicle"" should also have bulletproof windows, right? Or is it just me thinking that? The only vehicle with bulletproof windows are police vans, and N.O.O.S.E trucks. Nothing else... You can also get shot inside a tank which does not make any sense, and of course, it is only 1 player inside a tank despite the fact that there is a mounted machinegun on top of it. Some planes have backseats, but only 2 players can get in.There is no pretty houses online, the only thing pretty are modern apartments. I bought a house near of Martin Madrazo's location, it is not that bad but could be better for a house. And from the inside, I got windows which are actual walls from the outside.. Does not make any sense. Same thing actually with Macheal's house, if you look carefully, there was windows shown outside which is actually a wall and a library inside.The shower in online mode is pointless, all it does is cleaning your clothes from bullet holes and blood, but your face will still have bruises, they can not be removed unless you go back to story mode and then online again.Despite the fact that the AI has been somehow improved, Rockstar Game did a better job in GTA IV with the police. In V, they will try to kill you every time. There is not a single time in this game where I actually got busted and I tried to be arrested. In IV, with one star the cops will run after you unless you show a firearm in your hand, they will try to shoot you. But in V, weapons or not, you are dead for them. Another thing, which is rather funny but not really realistic, you are caught in a chase, but you are in a jet. Fly close to the street and you might hear them saying; ""Get out of the car!""... what? ఠ_ఠ This game does not have a filter, you can not really search for a full session like in IV, you have to spam the New Session if you wish to find a session with more people. The server seems to have a terrible connection, I have a very good Internet connection, 4 ping, 60 MBps .D /30 MBps .U and I keep losing connection, actually I am still in-game but everyone in the session leave at the same time.For online, in IV being in a stealth stance could actually hide your display name, but in V, there is no point in being stealthly.. And speaking of stealth, this new stance is awful.. in IV you could crouch, but in this one, it is no longer possible. It could also save your life avoid to have your head shot. The cover feature in V does not always work like you want it to work.In IV, I could tip someone who was singing in the street or playing saxophone, guitar, etc.. but in this game, it seems like we are some cheap prick.And the last one are hackers/cheaters. Online is filled with griefers spawning clones on you, attaching characters on you, forcing someone to molest you, spawn static objects, antennas, UFO, etc shoot fire spray, air spray, water spray, money, removing all your weapons, money, killing everyone instantly, downgrade levels, etc."

I remember the great times I've had on console, so I buy GTA V for $30. It takes me four hours to download the massive 70gb game. I start GTA Online and start to drive around in a car and terrorize the civilians. After an hour of gameplay I decide to go to sleep.When I wake up I see an email from Rockstar. ""Rockstar Games Account Suspension and Character Reset Notification"" (which was an email sent by them 50mins after i stopped playing). I remember looking at the reviews about the game and seeing people complain that they've been mysteriously banned for no reason. So I think about the situation. I just bought the game, I just gave these people my money, I played for maybe a little more than an hour of GTA Online, AND NOW IM BANNED. Have I ever exploited the game with any malicious programs? NO I LITERALLY JUST BOUGHT THE GAME FOR $30 ON MY MAIN ACCOUNT (WHICH IS CLEAN).Also to make it just all that much better, these people don't give you any information as to why you were banned, they just tell you that you have violated their rules and tell you how long you're banned for.So in the Rockstar support pages it says that 3rd party applications don't cause bans in GTA Online. Yea right. SO WHAT COULD IT BE?! Could it be that I said one thing in chat which consisted of ""hi guys."" Could it be that I shot civilians and ran from the police? Could it be that I slightly damaged another player's car when I rear-ended it? Nope, i guarantee it isn't any of those things.These people have made billions off of GTA V, so why would they care about my petty $30? DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU ARE GUARANTEED A BAN.These people are too lazy to actually do anything about their rotting reputation.Seriously please do not buy the game guys it seriously makes you feel worthless and degraded. To explain my story hopefully a little better. I bought GTA V for $30 off of Steam because I remember the fun times I had on console. It takes so many hours to download and once it's done I am excited. After the prologue, I head into GTA Online because it's my first experience on pc. In summary, I shot civilians, stole cars, ran from the cops, typical GTA stuff, I didn't PVP. To convice you others that I am a legitimate player, this is my main steam account. This is my first time playing GTA Online on the computer. Why would I waste $30 on my MAIN account just to hack a game? AND why would I spend quite a long time writing this review if I were an actually cheater? I realize that I have actually violated Rockstar's agreements. To play GTA V without being randomly banned you must ensure that your computer doesn't have any programs Rockstar doesn't like? In my case it could've just been cheat engine sitting on my computer, not running. GTA V is a great game, but Rockstar's auto ban system seems faulty to me but that's just my opinion."

(F.U.CCK those kids)4- No long hairs styles and strappy high heels platform for female characters.5- Shark Cards are for those riches kids who don't know what to do with their parents money ( You deserve to get your butt spanked if you ask your mama for her credit card to buy a shark card STUPID !!! )6- The Opperssor Mk II is an stupidly overpowered piece of flying bird's poop due to their tiny nature sniping them out the sky with homing missiles is difficult as F*7- A powerful nuclear submarine cost $2 millions shark ass money but an old classic car can cost you $3.6M so Rockstar logic doesn't make any sense cuz' they've got no healthy brain cells.8- I was banned from online eight months ago for two weeks for just wearing a pink catsuit and green sandals in the Casino Heist (PUNKS !!!)9- Cayo Perico Islanrd is now full of manics modders ( FU-CCK* those punks too)Do I recommend this game after all the negative aspects of the online part post here ?YES ! it's a very fun game."

In all my years as a gamer, this is the game I have played the most and gotten the most enjoyment from. The game at this point has become way too grindy in a way that seems to push players to buy shark cards. That, coupled with T2 and Rockstar's treatment of the players and the lying about supporting modding, is the reason I have switched to playing this game through FiveM, and can no longer recomend the game in its vanilla state."

I can say for sure that this is (in my opinion) the best game of the whole series and I am not writing it just for the sophisticated graphics, but for the amazing stories that this game offers, also for following up on the story lines of previous episodes and especially for the constantly evolving online mode that offers literally thousands of hours of fun.The story of the whole game takes place in the fictional city of Los Santos in the state of San Andreas, which in our world represents the city of Los Angeles in the state of California. The whole game is set to incredibly detailed resemblance to everything in our world (cars, brands, buildings, places...), but due to the rights of companies and government in our world, Rockstar decided to name everything differently and change the design a bit so that they do not have to pay real tags.I'm not going to write spoilers of what the game has to offer... so I'll just write this - the story mode is basically like an action crime thriller and the online game mode is the same, only in more numbers and with much more options. It is simply as if the player lived his own life in a different reality, for many this reality is better than the real world.Despite the fact that the game is via steam, the player must also be logged in to the Social Club, and the entire application for the game is often a lengthy and annoying process.Achievements are some really hard to get here, in online it is a difficult challenge for a soloist, but it is not impossible. I have gone through the story mode several times, but it is still evolving in the updates that are online.Personally, I plan to actively exist in the world of GTA Online until the game continues to evolve and as long as there are still more players on the servers, as is the case today.Despite this commitment, I cannot take it so seriously myself.. because.. GTA VI is approaching."

And Rockstar replies to the rampant in-game hacking and game sabotage by ignoring concerns for days or week, denying the concerns exist, admitting they exist when confronted with video evidence but then blaming my computer/graphics card/drivers even though IN THE VIDEO the hacker is saying ""look what I'm doing to you!"" The peer to peer model is too vulnerable to hacking and has failed, and Rockstars reply is to say ""well, most of our money comes from consoles, so, we'll do nothing about PC hacking and we'll build GTA VI peer to peer the same way!""Don't buy this game for the online portion.

788,Falbere,https://steamcommunity.com/id/falbere/,21,1,0,"2,226.1",May,"10,",167,0,1,"Here is a perspective of a player who had played GTA Online extensively, for more than 1000 hours recorded on Steam now.Let me give you some background. I first played GTA Online on the PC launch day. I have been playing this game for years, and I had been through a lot of the changes it had made. The game had changed a lot since its release, and if you are looking to play GTA Online, give up any guide that is a few years old. Everything is different.GTA Online's infrastructure is fundamentally flawed. Due to the fact that there is no central server for each lobby, a peer-to-peer (P2P) network is used. What does this mean? This means that every player in the lobby acts as a server, where traffic, NPCs and even PvP hitbox registration is player-sided, and not server-sided, because there is no server. This allowed the development of client modifications (AKA mods, hacks and scripts) that is much harder to patch than a game like Overwatch, FiveM (GTA V's Online mod counterpart), or even Minecraft. No matter how hard Take Two or Rockstar Games try, the game will always be full of hackers.That comes to the next part of my review, that explains the problems it caused. Money modding is prevalent. Rockstar's inability to properly find the difference between legitimate and illegitimate players let to a game where everybody is a billionaire. This caused an actual influx of the in-game currency, (yes, inflation had occurred in a video-game) and caused a huge problem for legitimate players, where they are no longer able to properly enjoy every update's content to the fullest extent. For example, One of the earliest DLC cars, the Zentorno, costs merely $725,000 in GTA dollars. It was, and still is one of the quickest Supers class cars in the entire game according to GTA Racing crew leader and Twitch streamer Broughy1322. Fast forward to today, the Progen Tyrus is a $2,550,000 car and it barely makes it into the top 20th place in the Supers class. You are paying more than 3 times the money for garbage!Next up, Rockstar Games had evidently shifted the development focus of GTA Online from bringing fun updates that isn't too costly to the current ""business model"" of continuously adding mostly extremely expensive vehicles, with really bad new money-making opportunities, in order to boost the sales of micro-transactions. The latest Gunrunning DLC had the played essentially forced to buy a Mobile Operations Center in order to enjoy ANY of the new content added, such as the few new weapons, and the ability to upgrade the new weaponized vehicles.Well, you could always say ""Well, they are free updates anyway, so that is good, right?"" Wrong. This is because of my last point, game balance. At this point of time, Rockstar seem to not give a flying f*** about game balance anymore. The new update brought flying motorcycles that fire freaking rockets, explosive ammunition, and a basically indestructible APC. Worst of all, these contents are only available to the paying players. You can technically still grind for it, but I don't expect to grind in a $60 AAA title that is 5 years old and filled with micro-transaction ""shortcuts"" and kids who download stupid scripts to help them god mode around. I want to play a video game."

The failed robbery in Ludendorff, North Yankton, is organized by Michael Townley, Trevor Philips and Brad Snider. During the fight against the cops after getting the money from the bank, Brad is killed by Agent Dave Norton. Dave injures Michael by shooting him. Although Trevor wants to continue fighting with the cops without leaving the team behind, Michael tells him to run away. Trevor manages to escape by taking a civilian woman hostage. Michael's funeral appears in the next scene. However, the buried person is actually Brad and Michael lives and watches the funeral from afar while drinking his cigarette. Michael Townley enters the witness protection program with his family in Los Santos, San Andreas, and begins to live under the pseudonym “Michael De Santa”.And the game continues in 2013. Working as a reporter for a car dealership with his best friend Lamar Davis, Franklin Clinton receives orders from his boss to take back the car of Michael's twenty-year-old son Jimmy, who bought a new car but was delayed in loan payment. Michael appears in the back seat as Franklin takes the car and goes to the dealer. Aware that his son is about to become a victim of credit fraud, Michael orders Franklin to hit the dealer by car, and Franklin hits the dealer.After this incident, Franklin is fired from his job, but becomes friends with Michael. Pressing his wife Amanda on the bed with a tennis coach, Michael chases the tennis coach with Franklin to his mansion and washes the mansion with great anger. But the manor belongs to the Mexican drug lord Martin Madrazo, and Madrazo, who is very angry because of this, asks Michael to cover his mansion's expenses. With the help of his old friend Lester Crest, Michael robbed a jewelery shop and decided to pay Madrazo's debt with the money they would remove from this robbery, and carried out the robbery. Trevor Philips, who is the only survivor of the Ludendorff robbery, gets the news of this robbery and realizes that no one but Michael, his old friend, who believes that the person who committed this robbery is dead, finds Michael's trail in Los Santos and confronts his old partner again.The personal lives of the characters begin to get out of control. The unexpected reappearance of Trevor causes Michael to display thoughtless and unstable behavior at Michael, which causes his family to leave him. Michael gains the hostility of Devin Weston, a wealthy billionaire entrepreneur and capitalist over time. As a result of developing events, Weston begins to have a grudge against Michael and vows revenge.Franklin is annoyed by what he tries to do to Lamar, Harold ""Stretch"", a betrayal gangster who has crossed the rival gang while in prison and has repeatedly attempted to kill Lamar to prove himself to his new gang friends.On the other hand, Trevor struggled to consolidate his methamphetamine market in the Blaine Province, to the San Andreas arm of the Lost motorcycle club, a large number of Latin American street gangs, rival methamphetamine dealers, government-backed mercenaries and one of the top personalities in the Chinese underground crime world. led a war against the Triad gang led by.In order to undermine the FIA's rival, IAA, Michael is forced by two FIB agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines to carry out a series of operations with Franklin and Trevor. At Haines' instruction, they attack an armored convoy that carries an IAA fundraiser and rob a bank that has the payroll of all corrupt police and public officials in Los Santos. When Haines comes to the point of making an investigation decision about his illegal work, he forces Michael and his team to infiltrate the FIB headquarters and delete all evidence about it. Seeing this as an opportunity to remove Haines 'pressure on Michael, Michael deletes Haines' file while also removing evidence of his past activities.ichael and Trevor do a job for Madrazo, and Trevor wants to get back for their services for Madrazo, but instead kidnaps Madrazo's wife, which causes her and Michael's life to be at risk for a while, and Michael's escape from the city. . After Trevor surrenders Madrazo's wife back, the trio begins to plan their biggest robberies ever: robbing gold bullion reserves from the Union Depository.After returning to Los Santos, Michael puts everything with his family and they start living together again. However, Trevor learns that one of his partners in the Ludendorff heist is not in prison, as Brad thought he was, was killed, and that Brad was buried in Michael's grave. Trevor thinks he has been betrayed by Michael, and this leads to disagreements between the group, threatening their plans for the Union Depository heist.Michael and Dave Norton; While the FIB is in the Mexican stalemate between IAA and private security firm Merryweather, Trevor comes to the place and saves Michael. Despite all that, he explains why he saved Michael because he didn't want anyone else to kill him. Although Trevor does not forgive Michael, he agrees to part ways with Michael after they perform the Union Depository heist as planned.The Franklin, Michael and Trevor trio successfully perform the Union Depository heist.After a while, Franklin was forced by Haines to kill Trevor and by Weston to kill Michael and was dragged into a dead end.

This is most definitely true.   I begin my story, 2 days ago, playing GTA 5 - Online and having some fun with friends. Since I'm slightly impatient I decided to purchase a $10 shark card to assist me in getting me started up. Purchased some weapons, vehicle, upgrades, all that jazz. The next day I start up the game only to see that I have been banned with no explanation as to why I have been banned.   Of course, I move onto the support website. I submit a support ticket explaining my issue and get a response back within minutes of posting the ticket. I was impressed!! Such fast response times!!   Just kidding, it was just an automated response explaining that bans are automated and they can't do anything about it. So then I decided to call. 51 calls just to get into the waiting line, 47 minute hold, brief explanation of myself, and another 7 minute hold all to be told the same ♥♥♥♥ the automated system on the website told me.   I still have no idea as to why I was banned. Never hacked. Never modded. Never abused anybody. Thank you support for literally wasting my time.Other than the stupid banning of innocent people, including a friend of mine who has been temp banned twice now and will be perma banned on the next one, it's fun with friends.Would I recommend it? If you can avoid being perma banned by a broken automated system, sure I would, but I can't say that is possible./Ijustneededtovent /endrantEDIT: This was originally a reddit post, when I state 2 days ago, I really mean a while ago.EDIT 2: To all those saying ""just shut up, you cheated admit it, stop lying"" you clearly either haven't played long enough or consistent enough to have the broken automated system touch you in inappropriate places, or you are just that one special snowflake that is so ignorant to all the evidence of false-positives.

I was hyped, I thought it would be like San Andreas again. Instead we got a lackluster main story that does a total 360 and ends with nothing having changed for any of the characters and boring or just poorly-written plotlines. Then GTA Online happened. Instead of being like GTA IV Online with more to do and fun game modes and being able to ♥♥♥♥ around, it follows an awful MMO-styled design method where the work is repetitive and boring, the pay is awful, and everything is insanely expensive so you are forced to either grind the same high-paying work over and over, or pay real life money for in-game cash so you can actually enjoy your $60 game.And that's not even including Take Two's absolutely retarded stance on modding. Instead of keeping their policy of keeping mods in single-player, they have issued a (completely unfounded and unlawful) Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team, who have designed and maintained the key modding tool for the game. Without it, mods are nigh impossible to make/install/update. So on top of the game itself being lackluster and designed to sap money from its playerbase, now modding is essentially banned so that players are unable to get new, fresh content and gameplay in their singleplayer experience, and instead are forced to wait for content updates to come that they must grind/pay real money for.This game is the embodiment of everything that is wrong with the game industry today. Basically zero focus on singleplayer experiences, multiplayer designed with microtransactions in mind, and absolutely backwards views and stances towards modding. Do not waste your money, just get San Andreas and install Multi Theft Auto or San Andreas Multiplayer."

There is real freedom to do pretty much anything you feel like doing, and the city feels genuinely “alive”.The acting, graphics and gameplay all are beyond excellent and personally I cannot fathom how anyone could dislike this game. When you consider how far the GTA series has come, just think of the potential for GTA VI…Until then, GTA V will remain as one of the “must play” games, and is an experience that should not disappoint in any way.

Nothing has exceptionally changed for the better, Recent Patch Notes say that they have updated and tweaked their anti-cheat measures, Ussually trainers would be up and running in a few hours, So far nothing has come up. Players using scripts and what not can now go invisible and hide themselves from others entirely, Add that onto the ability to launch others into the air at a whim, Or having molitovs explode on them, As well as exploding, the only thing actively being gaurded right now is the money, And that's still being shot out from miniguns, Or simply dropped onto player's heads.To gather information if you wish to report a player, the best option is to find a TV ingame and use spectate to report a player that is invisible, They can still be seen even if their husk isn't visible. The script creators already found an easy workaround around the brief scan, It's stopped all money drops long term because they are monitoring it a bit more heavily, But they can do everything else in between still, I'm still suggesting anyone to really think about getting the game. The issue still persists to this date, But is now raised to where Users of said Trainers are targeting players calling out users and reporting players using trainers to rockstar, They can remove the bans placed against them, They can remove all in-game reports on them, They've ruined Online, I implore you to reconsider at all costs as to buying GTA 5 For online, They have so much power in Online and rockstar is not showing any hint of helping out the common player on GTA besides for giving us cash for the cars/ammo/guns we have lost and saying, ""Sorry for your inconvenience."", Perhaps they've forgotten who makes their games so popular.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
859,Preator,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000207900/,47,6,1,37.0,August,"17,","1,973",0,1,"Grand Theft Auto VA game developed by Rockstar North, and published by Rockstar Games.I have been an avid GTA fan for as long as i can remember, from the overhead 2D originals that captured our hearts and ran over them for bonus points to the classics of the series now GTA VC and San Andreas and GTA4 So i stepped into this game with mind pre blown, ready for a whole new destination (well a rebooted one) And some new characters to get lost in and around.GTA5 did nothing but astound me, from the graphical detail to the brilliant story despite its minorly cliche plotpoints. I felt like the whole experience was unique to me. But without further hesitation lets get into this review!I usually break my reviews into 4 categories. Story, Gameplay, Graphics and Music. Followed by an overall section that details my overall thoughts on the game and a more structured final decision. If you don't like long reviews please feel free to scroll down to the overall section.Story: The GTA series has always had a fairly decent and intricate crime story in play, Usually just a paid thug sent to do random jobs for someone who is willing to pay. Thats the overall premise so far. But GTA5 took it to a different level, This time you have 3 main characters. Franklin, Michael and Trevor. Who all have their own stories to follow but along the way become more and more intertwined and friction and friendships are discovered. I thought this was a phenomenal idea because following the adventures of Nico in GTA4 everyone had experienced pretty much every aspect of crime, From Liberty City's organised mafia crime to the gang banger crime of the ""hood"" in SA. They gave you 3 different types of characters all with their own story and personality and it really helped fill out the game in so many ways. The story is diverse taking you basically across the island and back again through its standard playtime, With loads of side story missions available along the way. This game has a seriously fleshed out game world with tons of backstory and history to catch up from the start, which can seem daunting but once you're in. You're in for a wild ride.Gameplay:Grand theft auto has always had a very generic gameplay, you play as a hero...or villain as the case usually is really. And you run around a fairly...linear open world and commit mass crimes from small time burglary to mass genocides. But GTA5 has upped the standard again. The game world is huge and the gameplay is smooth as glass. From stealing cars to gunning down police the game has solidly build the world around you (the player). Occasionally you'll discover a bug i guess you'd want to call it where your car would do something stupid or your character will slip down a hill that should have been a clean traverse and annoy you for a while. But the overall gameplay mechanic is fleshed out and been modelled incredibly well. The gunplay is pretty great, using a fairly generic cover system as most 3PS games do these days, But even still its done extremely well and is well worth the experience. I didn't get a chance to play the online side of the game on PC, but i played it vigorously on console to my own detriment i know. This game has alot of content for the MP side of things but not really a whole lot of content, if any at all substantial content for the SP campaign which is a terribly large let down seeming the game is so expansive and detailed.Driving can be frustrating especially at the start when you're becoming familiar with the vehicles and the world, its incredibly easy to crash and die in this game, which i happened to do very frequently, but its one of those become accustomed to scenarios, once you become familiar the difficulty quickly disappates, flying helicopters and planes is very similar in this regard, Very rarely did i discover a bug that caused my car to just...launch into the air or make me launch through the windshield. Maybe once or twice in my entire time playing GTA, which overall is a pretty astounding effort.Graphics:This game is beautiful. To say the least, On a fairly mid - high end pc this game runs like glass at max settings. 70+ FPS solidly at all times, even under what i would consider the games largest strain, massive amounts of vehicles and people all gathered together at once, or even flying a jet across the skies overlooking the city scape. (My PC specs are in my profile)The game is stunning at all times...Very rarely do i take a step back and look at a horizon or go explore just to see the worlds detail but i did it with this game and i'll happily do it over and over because of how much love and dedication has been put into this game. I have a few screenshots on my profile that help show the worlds detail. Its an experience, for sure!Music:Probably the weakest point of the game...Not because the music is bad..because its far from bad, it has basically music developed by real artists when your in vehicles on the internal radios, which helps you feel like its realistic, definitely but the actual musical score for the game is very bland...A few high and low drops for dramatic effect but nothing breathtaking and nothing unique to this GTA...which i guess is very common in the GTA series as a whole. But the music while driving is extremely addictive, catching myself singing songs i wouldn't normally listen to, or just getting lost in some classic rock or country was a great way to pass the time driving across the world.Overall:This game is a must buy for anyone who loves the GTA series or any of its clones. It has been masterfully developed and detailed by a loving company who has done very little in terms of games badly. Perhaps its largest let down is that the game is a money sink for online play...Things cost far too much in game money that its almost not worth it and you can buy cash cards from the steam store which i found to be rather stupid and to be honest a bit of a slap in the face for the gamers who love this game. But the singleplayer is near flawless and its GTA through and through. I recommend this game whole heartedly and i hope you love it as much as i do.Drive frantically!"

However, the multiplayer had the golden ticket. With an almost perfect world for a MMO, the best circumstances for the human reflection on crime, murder, drugs, taboo and money. But, why work and grind towards anything in this game when you stay in any lobby long enough, you encounter a game breaking hacker. And that's the blatant ones, there are many more modding and abusing the game without your sight.As somebody who has played his fair share of multiplayer games, i do not understand what Rockstar is doing. They could easily have fixed most of the problems before they launched the game. For example; Making it so that money is tracked, so nobody can hack in money. In World of Warcraft there are no money hackers, there are bots on markets and Chinese people farming money, but money can't simply be modded in the game. You sit there spending hours, farming, grinding and for what? Money that could have been modded in seconds, and hundred of thousands in this game have some modded money, might be from the early anarchy days or later.This game has given me some of my favourites gaming experiences, with my gaming library not being the same without it. It is the perfect scenario for a game, and it deliveries in plenty of departments. Nevertheless, i cannot enjoy this game at the level of other games anymore. Every, single, lobby which has some players in it will get a modder in an hour or two. A lot times much faster than that."

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

I do not like this game, but for some reason, I am still playing it. It's like a Stockholm Syndrome of the game, what when I keep playing this game, I become even more disappointed, but still returning to it for some reason.But let's talk about story mode. It is good, and at some points I just enjoyed maxing out every single stranger mission or event. I was going to 100% anyway. And I took them all to the top no problem. There is even a good modding scene, so if you bored, you can install mods and have fun! But my biggest portion of hour investment went into... ugh, Online....GTA Online on PC is terrible. Mostly it's being ruined by cheaters, toxic people and freemode tryhards. When I decide to start from zero as 2nd character, you can and will be hunted by other people, who like to kill others (which, ofc, can't fight back). And from all I see, any people who just want to grind some money and not aware of tricks of being alone in the session or something usually give up, because of how balance was broken after introduction of some vehicles. And it's either you buy in-game currency (shark cards), use glitches for money and to be kept at least from toxic people or tryhards, or you get a cheat menu (and even there is so much scam going on). Without good knowledge in advance & friends, you will be stomped in this game.And R* doesn't even fix half of these problems. Instead, they either add more troublesome grind, what involves you into PVP, adding some annoying characters, paying music artists to get copyrights on their music in the game. But cheater issue, prices on items, balance - nah, ""that's not our business"". This is their way to take your money, so you will buy that shark cards. But since they don't address a ton of issues, they don't deserve those shark card money. And people yet somehow defending it by saying - ""BuT sHaRk CaRdS wIlL mAkE nEw UpDaTeS!!!!111!!"". To hell with this reason. They only deserve shark cards once they make their online game good, not like a gutter. They only fix money glitches just because it hits R* and Take-Two Interactive pockets, while loading problems, transaction fails, broken mechanics what makes hard work of others look like nothing - ""we don't care"", says R*.I strongly discourage taking it for Online. Take it only for single player, because this is the only part, what is not screwed up. Let this Online die in this horrible state on PC. But! If you insist trying Online, you better get either Xbox or PlayStation. Some problems exist, but I think it's way better than PC version."

As of this particular point in time, I wont be playing Online until I get a response from R* support telling me why I was banned in the first place, because Ive read many a post about people being banned, not knowing why, then getting banned again after attempting to play Online again. Go ahead and say what you want, Im sure I'll get lots of ""You cheated, you got caught, deal with it."" comments, but I know that I havent broken any rules and I could honestly care less what people assume of me.EDIT: They never got back to me. BUT, I would like to say that a few of the known programs that can trigger a false ban are things like TeamSpeak, Discord, and Skype as well as (possibly) Steams FPS counter or recording software like Bandicam and Fraps."
886,Big Bad Wolf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lobbo/,258,16,0,821.1,June,"25,",244,7,1,"Hi.This is about my first serious review, and I'll try to advise you if it's worth it or not to buy the game, based on my personal   opinion.As you probably know, GTA has two kind of game modes, Online and Story mode and I'll judge both.PLEASE REMEMBER, this is my personal opinion and everything is based on what I feel about the game, and I'll undersand and respect yours aswell.- Story Mode -Catchy story-mode.Somewhat fun and dynamic questline.Some nostalgic feels.Balanced prices and easy fun.Huge map, but feels somewhat empty.My opinion -  It's pretty standard, same grab this kill that, race this kind of missions, but is it good?  From my point of view, it can be fun, though it lacks the "" Gta San Andreas "" vibes, but hey, it's a new game. If you came for the ol'gangbanging drive-by feel, it will let you down, mostly it's big game moves, stealing banks and others. But, apart from that, and that you can't get all the 'online' perks and dlc stuff, it's a pretty fun single player. - Online  -Huge open world, tho some of it lacks content.Huge grind to get money.Almost everything overpriced.♥♥♥♥♥♥ community ( Imagine COD's and Minecraft community togheter, yeah ).Free DLC's but really expensive in-game content.Hackers and modded accounts.Bad servers with huge loading times and frequent lost connections.Weak UI, somewhat challenging to get around.Game-modes feel straight up pushed into the game "" just to add content "".Races are fun!                                       ...kinda.||| - I understand that my views towards the online mode are mostly money centered, but without cash, you can't get around really. You need money for bullets, money for cars, money for houses, money for almost everything, it's the Lifeblood of the game. - ||| So in my opinion : The online feels like a massive grind. You'll get around but it just feels like you'll never enjoy the game to it's fullest without money.  The community is just random, either they  wont ever bother to talk to you or straight up blow up everything you love and care about.It really feels like a pay to win game. Did I mention the hackers and modded accounts that will make you feel poor?New DLC out! Great! What new content will I try? Oh, I can't really afford any. Alright, I got really side-tracked there, sorry.I used to love GTA, but it feels that they've went way to greedy on everything and basic things that could be done to fix the game or improve it are shunned upon by the creators and instead we are given ever more expensive content to either buy shark cards or grind for 4 hours straight to get ONE CAR. It's just not the kind of game I wouldn't buy, and yes, I regret buying it.-----------------------------Thank you for stopping by, I hope this helped you in anyway, take your time to read other reviews and don't stick with just one, remember this is my opinion and yours might differ from mine. Good luck and Cheers :)"

I've played since June 2017, so I can't attest to how the game has changed over the years. However, from the time I've spent, I can say that GTA V is most definitely a worthwhile purchase whether it's on sale or not. I've spent the vast majority of time in Online, so that's what this review will be focussed on.All in all, GTA V does have it's flaws but there are ways to minimise said flaws. Besides, in my opinion, all the things that make the game great still outweigh the problems that plague it. Pick it up on a sale if you're still unsure. If GTA Online doesn't suit you, the singleplayer is still worth getting the game for."

892,Comrade,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pandemic195/,163,13,0,373.8,May,"11,",100,4,1,"GTA 5 is a bit of a conundrum for me, because I can't really review the whole thing as one game. GTA 5's campaign and GTA online are two very different things, and deserve two completely different reviews (I also want to note, I've also played this on PS3 pretty much since it came out, and have played WAY too many hours on it on console).First off is GTA 5's single player campaign, which is, in my opinion, really REALLY good. There's not much more to say other than that the characters are all pretty damn fun to play as. The game is just good, and the attention to detail is surprising in some areas. You wouldn't think that a group developing a sandbox crime heist em up would spend too much time on the little things like golf or tennis, but both of them play really well. The golf in particular probably plays better than some games that are completely dedicated exclusively to golf. From GTA 4, the driving, shooting and melee attacks are all vastly improved aswell.Now the tumorous, microtransaction riddled elephant in the room, GTA Online. Simply put, it's a massive grind. Apartments that you can set up heists from are so expensive you won't be buying one for a pretty long time. New cars are similarly overpriced (the newest super car in the game costs 2 million). Vehicle modifications such as armor, engine tune ups, suspension, and so on are many times more expensive than they are in single player, and completely uncustomizable vehicles like planes, helicopters and boats tend to cost even more than apartments do (because logic I guess). All of this seems to have been done solely for the purpose of selling Shark Cards, Rockstar's overpriced means of aquiring money with no effort. You can buy these cards at prices ranging from 2.99 (which I believe only gets you a  hundred thousand, not enough to buy and upgrade 1 single gun with full ammo) to 99.99 (which gives you 8 million). Looking back at their newest super car at 2 million, that means that if you want to avoid the grind, it will cost you around 50 real life dollars of REAL MONEY, to fully upgrade a fake car that only exists in a video game, leaving you with just a little spending money. Even more ludicrous are the new yachts, which act as big floating player homes in the ocean. These start just shy of 5 million. To put it plainly, according to Rockstar, they seem to think that a fake yacht in a game is worth roughly 60 to 70 dollars in real life money. This is more than the retail price of GTA itself, and is just aweful.To sum up this half rant/half praise of a review, it almost seems as though GTA 5 was designed and developed by a group of dedicated professional game developers, who cared about what they were doing and wanted to make a genuinely good game, and they did just that. The game that is GTA 5 is still a very good game, and the campaign has a fair bit of replayability to it. The city of Los Santos is colorful and fun, and even out in the country side, there's an astonishing amount of detail. However, it's like this team of good game designers were just sort of set aside when it came to GTA Online, at which point Rockstar decided to have a group of accountants design just about everything. Everything about GTA Online exists to make money, from the painful grind to the overpriced useless tat. It's really a shame because once you've played the heists (which reward you with almost nothing but more cars, boats, planes, etc. to buy) there's no more reason to play the game. If you just like pvp combat there are better games out there dedicated solely to pvp. If you just like to race fast cars there's better experiences to be had. It's because of GTA Online that I can't reccomend buying GTA 5 all together, especially when Rockstar seems determined not to focus any effort on any new single player content. This is all coming from someone who has been playing GTA 5 since release, and it's sad to see this happen to a game that so many had high hopes for."

902,LuNAH,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TasteTheSkittles/,60,4,0,660.9,December,"7,",262,8,1,"I waited a very long time to post this review and with over 350 hours played it's safe to say that I've done everything there is to do in the game. So with all that said, here we go.The singleplayer storyline is extremely fun and I had an absolute blast throwing endless hours into the game's singleplayer shenanigans. I think it was an amazing and refreshing change to have multiple main characters to switch between and instead of the one life you're exploring, you now have three. You've got Michael, the 'former' heister turned FBI informant who faked his death and is living in an upper-class mansion with a dysfunctional family, think Tony Soprano. There's Trevor, the redneck drug-peddling trailer-inhabiting junkie, oh and he's also a cannibal. Then you've got Franklin, the more level-headed ex-gang banger who serves as the younger one of the group. His only real goal is to get out of the hood and make it big.The game's story/missions and its overall gameplay is 10/10 for the genre with little room for improvement without changing everything we know GTA to be. That said, we'll move on to the dreaded topic of the game's multiplayer, which is the sole reason why I cannot recommend this game.Multiplayer is a complete and total joke and Rockstar has truly, TRULY dropped the ball on it. The online play was by far the biggest selling point of the game and it was one that they had advertised and 'focused' on extensively. The group heists are a lot of fun, as are the side missions and the ability to hang out and do whatever with your friends. My biggest complaint is the lack of meaningful content. They haven't added a single new heist since release, nor have they advertised or spoken about any future ones. They also still have yet to add the feature for players to make their own heists or game modes, which is the total key to making this game self-sufficient and community managed, if they were to do that then Rockstar could simply sit back and reap the rewards.The severe lack of content aside, anyone who has played this game has one single complaint in mind: HACKERS. EVERY single online lobby (with the exception of private made games) are absolutely filled to the brim with hackers and modders. While many are 'nice' their 'niceness' ruins online gameplay. Why do heists and missions when a modder can simply drop you millions of dollars? There's also the fact that not all of the modders you absolutely will find in online gameplay are 'nice'. Many will abuse their abiities such as godmode or the ability to blow up every player in the entire server at once - using your name. Rockstar hasn't done a SINGLE thing to rectify this situation and not only that, they haven't even so much as made a public statement about it or their plans.Instead of focusing on the very severe issues plaguing the game's online mode, Rockstar has chosen to release completely meaningless updates that contain nothing but a handful of new cars and horribly meshed/textured clothing items. Not to mention their absolutely god-awful customer support / community management & outreach. There are also a number of bugs that I myself have not run into, such as people being unable to connect to online or join lobbies. Don't even get me started on the apalling marketing practices shown by Rockstar during the 'sales'. I dare say that Rockstar has far surpassed EA in regards to greed and shady business practices.SIMPLY PUT - MY FINAL THOUGHTS:This game is a ♥♥♥♥ load of fun, the storyline and singleplayer gameplay is amazing. The online is the worst I've seen and Rockstar has shown incredible ability to completely ignore its playerbase and the problems plaguing it. This game is only good for private lobbies with friends and singleplayer playthroughs. I hope this review helped you!"

From the moment I started playing, I was hooked. The open-world map of Los Santos is massive and filled with a wide variety of activities to keep players engaged for hours on end. Whether you're driving around the city causing chaos, participating in high-stakes heists, or just taking in the sights and sounds of the game's many neighborhoods, there's always something to do.The graphics in the game are top-notch, and the attention to detail is impressive. The city feels alive, with traffic and pedestrians going about their business, and the lighting and weather effects add a realism that immerses you in the game. The character models and animations are also incredibly well done, making the game feel like a living, breathing world.One of the things that sets GTA V apart from other open-world games is the level of freedom it gives players. You can choose to play as one of three characters, each with their own unique story and abilities, and you can switch between them at any time. This adds a level of replayability to the game that is unmatched.The heist missions are also a standout feature of the game. Planning and executing large-scale robberies with your crew is incredibly satisfying, and the game's cover-based shooting mechanics make for some intense and exciting action.In short, Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece of a game. It has something for everyone, whether you're looking for a sandbox to cause chaos in, a story to follow, or just a beautiful open world to explore. The level of freedom and replayability is unmatched and the attention to detail is stunning. It's a game that I will keep coming back to for years to come."

909,Lara,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Razgriz3/,40,1,0,970.2,March,"24,",186,5,1,"This is a game that seems fun when you first look at it. You can play through a story by yourself or play online with friends. I rarely touched the story mode, since I was in it for the online gameplay. I had friends to play with and I convinced two of my friends to buy it because they wanted to play it with me.I was on my best behavior in the game. I tended to play with just my friends in public sessions, because so much of the community is toxic waste. This is worsened by the game having absolutely garbage PvP. You start off without good armor (and the best armor is still trash), low health, and weak weapons. If you have noone to play with early on, this game is brutal. You will be destroyed by people with either more time and progress in the game, people with more real life money, and/or the endless supply of modders godmodding, trapping, and killing people. This problem tends to not end even when you get better weapons, armor, and vehicles, because no matter what, explosive bullets will forever be broken as all hell. A Hydra (the game's version of the Harrior) with explosive bullets will destory ANYTHING. Armored vehicles are nothing against a barrage. Even the tankiest vehicles (including tanks) will be destroyed within a few seconds or less, thus it is really pointless to try and make money outside of heists if you don't know the trick to empty out sessions. Also, whenever I encountered a modder, I would do my best to report them in hopes that it would help stop the rampant modding that happens.I really did have fun playing, but Rockstar decided that I shouldn't be allowed to have fun. Without any explaination nor reason, I was banned from GTA Online with nearly 500 hours of time and effort invested in the game gone to waste. I try to contact Rockstar, because surely I can prove I'm innocent and maybe, just maybe I could get everything back and enjoy this game with my friends again.Nope. Rockstar Support is just a pile of ♥♥♥♥. They automatically closed my ticket where I asked them to review my gameplay and tell me what I did wrong. I am still confident that if they did that, instead of relying on their garbage automated system (which the rampant modding clearly shows how badly it fails to work), they would see that no violation occurred, but they are too busy rolling in their money to give a care about the consumer.Stay far, far away from Rockstar and anything they make. This is a company that deserves nothing but bankruptcy. They will take your money, time, and energy, then punch you in the stomach without warning nor reason while walking away with everything you put into the game. Please, for the love of all that is good, put your money elsewhere. Never spend a single cent on Rockstar. I hope that their actions one day give them the consequences they deserve.EDIT: I have been unbanned and my progress was kept as-is, however, I'm not going easy on Rockstar. The way they handled the situation (not publically admitting an issue and having no communication with users on social media) was poor and I was not even notified my ban was removed! While I will return to the game once I know the false-positive issue is completely resolved, my trust is something that has to be earned. If Rockstar goes above and beyond with how they treat us, their customers, then I will be more than happy to give them a positive review and sing of their praise. Until then, I will continue to warn people of how they treat customers."

935,Seeps,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tonydle/,15,,1,400.4,June,"28,",88,0,1,"Overall this is my general review on this game:GTA 5 was a masterful game when it came out in 2013. It still is, but now it is not as good as new games that came out more recently (or maybe because I have played this game too much, so that affects me).Still, it is one of the best open-world game out there, so I would still recommend buying it. however...is another storyWhat I have always wanted since I was younger (back when we used to play GTA: SA Multiplayer mod) was to have a truely open-world online game, that I can play with my friends, to do whatever we want that we can't in real life, and have fun in it.GTA Online  thatNow that I have found 3 friends to play with, it kinna is fun. However...apart from the time that I play with my friends, GTA Online is pretty boring, grindy and frustrating., money and level is TOO important in this game. You need to gain levels to unlock weapons, and you need money to buy cars, houses, planes,...And the process to gain money is really slow. I have played 200 hours (only Online) and I still cannot buy most of the new things that came out in the new DLCs., one of the reason why everything takes so long is because of the LOADING TIME.I feel like out of my 200 hours, 1/3 of that is just for loading...Rockstar does this thing where when you join a game you will be put into ""Sessions"" of many players, then when you join a mission it will take the people in the mission into another Session with only them...then when the mission is finished they have to move all of the players back into another Public sessions.All of that moving from one session to another TAKES AGES..., because all of that...comes the hackers and cheaters. And Rockstar's anti-cheating engine is so s h i t that you will constantly see players with 1000+ levels and all kind of weapons/vehicles hunt you down.These hackers/cheaters only play this game to destroy the FUN from anyone else.So what did Rockstar do about this? Upgrade their anti-cheat system? NO. They decided to ban modding altogether.Which of course affected ALL of the modding community, and custom servers,...In conclusion:Is GTA 5 worth buying? YES.This game is still one of the best games you can play out there. Despite all of the bad things I listed above, this game still brings me more fun than frustration. And now since it is on sale, it's a good time to pick it up.If you're reading this right now, and planning on buying the game...maybe add me on Steam and we can play together :D I'll help you out if you're new."
936,Wolfhowl,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045141591/,27,1,1,109.5,March,"9,",165,13,1,"Just to get one point out of the way, I am reviewing this game as a single player experience. I haven’t really experienced the online part, more than playing through the introduction, but there are a lot of other steam reviews mentioning online play, and according to some of them and some youtubers, Rockstar has been banning a lot of innocent players. So yeah, if you want info on the online experience check out other comments and reviews.As for GTA 5’s story mode and single player experience, I feel it is a great GTA game and certainly worth a buy for those that are a fan of the feel and gameplay of the series. Though there are some things I wish would have been a bit different.Then there are the three main characters themselves… Which I feel was a mistake. I much prefer just playing as one character, especially with Michael being the most interesting GTA protagonist I have played so far. The most interesting supporting cast is also closely related to Michael, mainly his dysfunctional family. I would have preferred the game focusing more on him, possibly just making Franklin a heist member, and turning Trevor into the main antagonist of the game.Franklin suffers from the same problem that CJ had in GTA San Andreas. He is just really boring… Unlike CJ though, most of the characters around Franklin are boring too. Mostly just coming into the story to remind him that he isn’t black enough and giving up on the hood, because he is trying to get out of there and move up in the world. CJ at least had the best antagonists I have seen in the series, and an insane - but also hilariously over the top girlfriend/ex-girlfriend - Franklin… He has a special ability that makes racing easier? Other than that, he can be easily replaced by every other character. Plus switching between other characters, Franklin will often switch to ugly baggy clothes like some teenager trying to be cool… So I constantly have to run back home to change his outfit to something that makes him look half decent. As for Trevor… It is really weird playing as the most messed up and psychotic character in a GTA game. Usually you play a guy like Franklin or Michael, clearly both guys doing bad things. But they are the kind of bad guys you send in to deal with the even worse guys. Trevor is as close as you get to a bad guy, and I can best describe him as the Joker of the GTA universe.  Trevor has no real redeeming qualities, and by all accounts he should be the main bad guy at the end of the game, because he is often the main cause of conflict.Then there are the villains… With three main characters, all switching between the spotlight, there aren’t much time left to let any villain shine, which results in a series of smaller forgettable bad guys. Especially since Trevor is often just on the verge of being a full-on villain to Michael. Which is a shame, seeing as San Andreas had amazing villains and a great climax, the GTA 5 climax is more meh...A great thing is that you can give all of the protagonists glorious beards, which really helps improve their ugly faces.Okay so that was the negatives out of the way. Now for the more positive. The gameplay feels much more smooth to me than it has in previous titles. Everything is nice and easy to control once you get the hang of it, well possibly except for helicopters, but I will never learn to properly fly and land those things in GTA. :P I also like the skills of the various characters such as driving and shooting, and that certain ones of them are relatively fast to level up, especially flying at the flying school. It is nice that they haven’t brought back annoying stats like fat.So the core of the gameplay is very enjoyable, and the other drivers have improved a lot too. In previous games, if I tried to drive normal. (Waiting on traffic lights, driving in the correct lanes, matching the speed of the other cars) Which I often do in missions where the characters are having conversations, I would often get slammed into by cars deciding to make a sudden turn. In about 60 hours of GTA 5 I didn’t experience that happening even once to myself, though I did see a few others driving into other cars, but not into me by accident. :) There are also several random encounters, which spice up the city and make it feel alive. Some are just people wanting to get driven places and give a few bucks. But some are more interesting or funny. For example, I suddenly saw hostiles on the map, and decided to check it out because I hadn’t really done anything to warrant hostiles at that time.  There are also some great songs mixed into the different radio stations. Since I have been watching Archer a lot lately, I was really excited when I suddenly heard they were playing Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins.A lot of the minigames are also fun side distractions. Personally I found playing tennis as Michael to be very relaxing.So yeah, two out of three protagonists suck, the antagonists aren’t very fleshed out or memorable, the core of the game is great, the city feels more alive, and the radio has good songs mixed in."

949,YumYann,https://steamcommunity.com/id/YahooYann/,149,20,1,287.7,April,"16,",450,8,1,"This is one of those games that nail that sweetspot of RP [Roleplaying] and the perfected multiplayer that is in GTA V. Personally in these games I go for that and its typically hard for me to find games that are like this that my friends and I enjoy playing. GTA before [so GTA IV] hit the perfect spot of relying on the community of mods to keep it interesting and multiplayer which was fantastic. I think in these kind of reviews it's important to mention its predecessors and judge them to see exactly how far they have come. GTA IV was fantastic but abit buggy alot of glitches to be exploited and kinda fell short in that RP aspect as I saw it.Pros:-Alot more to do in the terms of Role Playing and in terms of multiplayer alot more for the player to strive for which is a key aspect in keeping a player immersed and infactuated with a game alot of the reason why Skyrim and such are still so played - The multiplayer is done really well no ports or anything to have a server just for you and your friends to screw around in - Roleplaying has that optional feature that it isnt necessary to have rely on like in Skyrim. There is that feeling that you can have it with friends aswell the game is what you make of it and I LOVE IT- The asthetics are supremely adjustable more than alot, even most games have out there and helps catch the eye that just give you that itchy finger for screenshots- Friends, if you have any this is a game that can just be played for screwing around in a sandbox feel and keep the game anticipating which most games don't do - The game literally is just for ♥♥♥♥ and laughs there are some many things in this game that just make fun of other things in media which keep the game hilarious and fun to play- The story mode is well done but not alot of replay value and is fun just for a story mode with good characters and voice acting that aren't heard in every single game you play like troy baker as the main voice actor helps make it diverse- Online and Singleplayer are easy to switch to and from with easy access to players etc.- The ingame recording is a nice and good feature to have that makes the game feel a complete package which helps complete that 60$ feeling to a game such as this- PC Master Race> Console Beta TestingCons:- Public servers suck like public restrooms when you enter one you non-stop get killed and robbed, etc. and it seems that no matter what when you leave an activity you automatically enter one unless you set it to make your own private server- When you are in a public server when someone talks in it it goes across all the server there should be some limiting proximity to this because it is just plain mic spam when someone is talking. - The damage system for cars is kind of short cars give way super fast unless you buy armor for it [in about like 100 levels] which sucks and gives the feeling of buying cars just plain dumb- Killing in the game is a bit realistic and a bit stupid a combonation of both which could be easily fixed when you shoot at someone they take about awhole round in anywhere but the head- Cop are extremely accurate and actually do stuff which is good in the sense never do something bad or the cops will come eat you, but its done in away that if you do something like run over a headlight they chase you. This drags away from the initial feel of GTA in my opinion- The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOADING there are so many loading screens that take awhile to through even with the game optimzation- The game is the most demanding game I've played ever which makes it hard to have fun and not worry about your fps the whole time and that sucks major cohoanez (i run a 970 and still get 42 fps and some points)- Game invites there are so many of them and that little DING that you get when you are playing sucks ass cause its so damn frequent and sucks, i know there is the setting to pretty much turn it off but you can't from my experience when playing with friendsWith all of these pros they do outweigh the cons in the game in away that yes if you look closely at the game every second you will notice but otherwise if you play the game normally you won't most of the time. This all being said i find the game to still be fun with and without friends hours and hours of gameplay in and will proly delve hundreds upons thousands of hours in the game with friends, mods, and gameplay enjoyment. With so much to do and work toward it keeps the game perfect. This is a perfect game that was worth the wait and everything is lovely and asthetic as a hot girl in the sun."

I've been playing GTA since GTA III launched in 2001 and GTA V surpasses them all, even though the older ones are classics (yes, even IV). The older games are better in some areas (radio stations, humor, etc.) but GTA V is better in gameplay and the sheer massiveness of the open world is pretty awesome.

I love the online world and everything it could potentially offer - like flying your own jets, grouping up with players and playing missions/heists/gang fights, garages worth of pimped out cars and other luxury vehicles. Hell, I'll even pass the lengthy load screens with a push.Unfortunately, it's a cheater infested cesspool who ultimately have all the control in the game. Each ""game client"" is trusted with their own data in this ""P2P networking"" setup, so anyone with the right .exe can control their health/ammo/money/reputation/votekicks, even down to the reports that other players put in to report another players negative behaviour.In a good lobby, no one may obviously be cheating and everything is okay! Then you have the bad where someone is spawning tons of money bags on the ground, allowing you to buy the most expensive item in the game (The Hydra Jet at $3m) within a few minutes thereby stripping almost any need to grind missions. Then you get the ugly, where you're being forcibly ejected from your vehicle no matter your location, weapons stripped from you, everyone in the server killed from confetti explosions and giant ferris wheels being spawned that crash your game.Rockstar only bother removing your ""modded money"", because they're deluded into thinking you might buy their $100 ""Shark Card"" that gives you $8m worth of in-game online money. Otherwise, when it comes to issues that plague GTA:O, they stay more silent than Gordon Freeman's backside-orifice.Maybe mods in the future such as FiveM will fix this since it'll have dedicated servers. Time will tell.*Edit:Note that this review came before the issue regarding Rockstar and their Summer Sales business practices ordeal.

Just like all other GTA games, the single player mode is very well done, and there is a lot to do.  There is more than enough story and gameplay to justify the price alone without the Online mode.  The game runs great and is so much fun to play.  There is no denying this is one of the best games out there in quite a while.The Online mode has strong positives and very strong negatives.  It is lots of fun, plenty of different modes to try out and things to do.  The heists in my opinion are the best part of online and are tremendously fun for sure.  Just driving around with your friends is great, or doing races with stunt courses. There are many many problems with online however.  First of all everything costs a crazy amount of money, including the required buildings you need to start heists, especially the doomsday one.  There is a huge amount of hackers or modders online also.  So many that it's rare I play the game and there isn't one the lobby, or at least someone complaining about one that just left.   The modders can do any number of things like lock your character, kill you instantly from far distances, or spawn any number of vehicles, items (including money), or just random obsticles such as UFOs.  For someone that would be playing the game legit and worked for weeks to collect crates to sell, having that inventory blown up instantly by a modder would be devastating.There are a number of technical issues mostly related to online mode as well.  The time it takes to load the online lobby can be extremely long.  This includes when you're done missions or heists and go back to the open world.  I've had numerous ocasions and so has everyone i know where the lobby takes past 10 minutes to load back up, or wont load at all forcing you to ALT-F4 to quit.  In fact, the loading is so long that almost always when i'm done playing i wont wait for the game to load again, i will close it with ALT-F4.  Furthermore, the menus seems extremely delayed and are very awkward to use with mouse and keyboard, you very often dont realize you're on a certain screen when you think you are.  The online matchmaking is also very hard to understand and use.  Sometimes when you want to start a new heist/setup/mission/race you join other peoples game by mistake because there's no option to stop that.There is so many more issues with the Online mode that there's too many to list and could really go on forever.  Almost every time i play there's something that's extremely frustrating about it, purely on a technical aspect, not related to modders or other players.Saying all these faults about the game, there is no way i could not recommend it to everyone.  There is so much polish in the actual gameplay, controls, story, characters, voice acting, overall feel, and pure enjoyment in this game that it's worth playing no matter what else is wrong with it.But seriously, the modders/hackers need to stop.  Although with the price of everything online, it's not going to."

However, that is not what this review is about. Most of you reading this are here to see if this is ok for your child. The straight and honest answer is entirely not. Unlike most who have made a review, I have taken the time to play this game. Now I don't mean I played it for an hour or two hours, or even five hours. I have played the game in full and have experienced all of its content. Some reviewers before me say that Common Sense is only telling half-truths and that they are overreacting. If you took the time to play the game, you would realize they are not. I'm going to debunk some of the reviews before me. Nothing personal, just the honest truth. A lot of parents on here say that they trust their child to stay away from the optional sexual content the game provides. Good for them. Trust is a good thing. However, we've all been teenagers and did you ever do something that your parents told you not to do? Think about it. We've all done it. A lot of reviewers say that all sexual content is avoidable. That is NOT TRUE. Some of the material is avoidable, like the strip clubs which offers topless dancers or the fact that you can pick up prostitutes on the street and have intercourse with them in your car (it does show the scene without an option to skip). However, the story does have sex scenes that bear all. One mission, in particular, you are working as freelance paparazzi taking pictures of celebrities. Next thing you know you're actively taking photos of an outdoor sex scene (again without the option to skip). Some say that it has an educational value in the form of a stock market. There is, in fact, an in-game stock market but let me elaborate. The stock market is in place for you to abuse it by killing the oppositions customers and employees to raise your stock price in turn making a ""killing"" on the stock market. Oh, and I can't forget about this. Some time into the story, you play as Trevor and to continue on you have to actively take part in torture. You pull some teeth, break some kneecaps, and apply a bit of electricity. This is unavoidable and must be done to continue on through the game. Now I've only grazed the surface here and take the time to read some of the kids reviews; they did give a higher age rating than the parents on here after all. So that you know, I'm 21"

However, this game has both pros and cons. Here are my thoughts about GTA V.Pros:- Stunning visuals- Great soundtracks- The gameplay is very easy to understand. The tutorial is helpful enough to get you to know the gameplay.- Full controller support which makes it easier to drive / fly vehicles- There are lots of stuffs to do in GTA V and the devs keep updating / adding new missions on it, so it's still fun even after many years of release.- More fun with friends, but you can also play solo if you don't have any or if you don't wanna play with them. :P- Has both story mode and online mode- I like the options that you can customize your online session to play with friends only or with pubs.- Basically The Sims for guys (and girls) with more actions!- I would consider the shark cards as a pro because why not? It's a shortcut to getting rich. Still better than hacking though.- It doesn't matter if you start playing the game late. In addition, money in game is pretty easy to earn.Cons:- So many hackers killing the buzz of the game- Laggy <<< The game runs on P2P because Rockstar has no dedicated servers for online sessions as per Ender's comment. I sometimes get disconnected or lagging moment when playing with some friends.- Some other players may be annoying by constantly killing you. If you get salty, just change the session or kill them back until they change the server instead."

The franchise is certainly one of the most anticipated titles of all and Rockstar never disappoints, delivering us a well-polished adult campaign in addition to the extensive online mode.On the streets we find people of all kinds, and it only takes a short walk to notice that people are talking about the most diverse subjects, and sometimes even find someone in need of help, which can earn you an extra mission.The traffic is also quite convincing, with changes to the busiest times and even pedestrians who complain if you stop in the lane. The number of vehicles on the streets is perfect and their variety is quite extensive. As usual, more upscale areas maintain a high level of luxury cars, while more modest areas are full of older cars.Regarding the size of the map, in GTA V clearly things are bigger than in San Andreas, but, even so, there is the impression that in the old game things were better used, because, despite being smaller, the interconnection between the three cities created a new look with each new city, and now we have a lot of underutilized rural area.The cool thing is that at times it is even possible to recognize places that were part of the old Los Santos, such as Groove Street, the initial area of ​​San Andreas and where the protagonist CJ lived. This type of mission includes its own chain of sideshows that work as a preparation in which it is possible to hire cronies to help you, choose the way to approach and even the methods of escape. There are some scams that are made even during the campaign, but others are exclusive to the online mode, being possible to execute them with real partners.GTA V is not a difficult game, and in almost no mission you will need to repeat. In case you fail for some reason, the automatic saves that are randomly made in the middle of the missions were still kept, as implemented in the expansions of GTA IV, so that you won't need to redo the entire mission.Another very welcome change is the change in the dynamics of vehicles, which in previous titles were almost disposable, as they were very easily broken, you didn't love any car, changing vehicles whenever you saw a better one on the street.Cars now take a lot more damage, and a customization system has been added, not to mention that whenever you return home, your honestly purchased vehicles will be there, encouraging you to build equity.As it could not be otherwise, visually the game is also very good, with great textures and good lighting effects, weather changes and even NPCs with well-defined features and several character models. If you take a helicopter and climb to the highest point, everything that your eyes can reach really exists, and it's already rendered, without that thing that moves and sees the horizon come out of nowhere. Really very good.The online mode is also great, and allows the player to freely explore the entire city. When creating a character, you must save money to buy their cars, clothes and houses, participating in a series of tasks previously created such as missions and races, or even carrying out activities proposed by the community itself, but with the presence of hackers and the infamous micro transactions can be a bit of a nuisance.Of course, the game also has annoying bugs that insist on showing up every now and then. While I was playing, one of the most annoying that occurred to me was the bug that prevents the player from starting certain missions, showing the message that the time of day is inappropriate, even though it wasn't.After many attempts, I found that to be able to start missions with this error, all you have to do is get to the place by taxi and the problem will be solved. It's the kind of annoying bug that gets in the way of the game, but it was to be expected that a game of this proportions will show something like this."

And still up today R* keeps releasing new pixel junk updates on the same piece of crap online p2p infrastructure to milk the consumers even more... with no intention at all to really improve the whole online experience.  Online experience:  Start the game. Get a 2 minute loading screen. Choose online mode. Get a 2 minute loading screen. You are logged into a session without any other players. Okay fine, lets do a quick race then against some players. Choose quick race. 2 minute loading screen.'No active race could be found'. Only options in the menu you have now is 'host a race' or 'join a random mission'. Choose host a race. .... loading screen. You are dropped in a random race alone. Set 'auto invite' active. wait 10 minutes and still nobody to race with. You escape out of the session and go back to freeroam. 2 minute loading screen. Okay back at freeroam, check for other players. Nope, you are again in a session alone. So lets do the 'random race' again. ... and you get where I am going at. You get the same frikking loading screen crap and again the terrible barely functioning p2p matchmaking bull crap. Imagine doing this for 10 hours, imagine doing this for a 100 or a 1000 hours.  And in the mean time R* tries to get you to buy sharkcards ,because they made all the cars etc intentionally expensive... and then you have to grind for ingame money in this piece of crap online infrastructure. What a joke!Story mode: Really cool, love it! even more a shame that R* abandoned story mode completely and went for online mode cash grab scheme. R*, one of the biggest sell out companies of the last years.And pls note: I play GTAV on a good gaming rig and with a 200MB fibrewire connection."

Only overshadowed by San Andreas and its missing features and contents I wish it were here... such as crouching during shooting, horse races to bet, cassino heists and mini-games such as pool and  things kept out from the final game. Yet, swapping the main character middle-game is a innovative move we still feel. Large balls and guts were required from the devs to do it. The work of a master if you ask me. GTA IV was a mix between Shoot'em Up, Pulp Fiction and Fight Club while GTA V sounds like the best Heists movies and totally like Cheech & Chong's adventures with mary-ru-ana. I couldn't stop laughing. It was worthy to wait for the PC version, I don't want to be a PCnazi here, but we're the master race indeed. So I think I'm now after that statement.

The famous heists were intensively cool to play together and the CEO's mayhem with your bros and sis just made the game quite endless. So why would I disconsider all the fun-factor there is because of ''hackers''? Are you kidding?

But even that, there's a bug that occurs more than 50% of the time where you just get disconnected while in the mantrap and fail the heist. Literally wasted hours for nothing because of that. This bug exists for like a year, and nothing has been done. Probably too busy adding more flying bikes with missile launchers.

This requires several screens of arbitrary menus that serve no purpose but to slow down the depositing process. Not sure why this is a thing.-before making simple checks to see if a session is full or if friends are playing, GTAV Online will end your current session, forcing you to have to load in again if the search for a new session fails, instead of just letting you do it while still in the current session.-Loading screens are kind of long-So many weird issues happen during multiplayer missions, including players spawning without the correct gear, spawning in the wrong locations or simply not spawning (messing up the game for everyone else). This happens way too often.-So many missions require a ton of driving to/from destinations. The map is not interesting enough to warrent this.-Everything in online is rediculously expensive in order to push Shark cards. I can see why everyone wanted to hack this garbage system.-A personal note: A recent update removed all of my cash because some of it was obtained because of hackers distributing money in online.

The NPC interaction is amazing. If you steal a car from a tough guy, there's a chance he'll pull you out of it and beat you up, or even set a bounty on your head. Heck, you can even ride up to streetwalkers in your muscle car and shell over $50 for sucky-suck.The game's PvP does not shine. Certain PvP gamemodes involving shooting each other can be fun, but for the most part the open world pvp is pretty fruity. There's a lot of modders and hackers who roam in flying cars and bikes and shoot rockets at you, and there's not much you can do about it. There's armored cars that will charge you and blow you up, and you can't really shoot the drivers out. You can enable passive mode to get around safely, but that takes away your ability to shoot or even ride with friends, so it's not very effective. At the end of the day, the game's so fun that getting blown up or harassed every once in a while isn't that big a deal. You can always just start a lobby with friends.

1063,Vallinek,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/,31,6,0,141.0,February,"24,",511,11,1,"Grand Theft Auto 5, part shooter, part open world with lots of side activities, and with a story to tell. The game focuses on three characters: Franklin, who's trying to make a name for himself in the town; Michael, a retired criminal with short temper; and Trevor, his old heisting mate with downright psychopathic tendencies. The main story is about how they meet up and end up as partners in a lot of, let's just say, illegal operations, which is to be expected given this is GTA.Graphically you can tell this is more than a couple years old. I would say it aged relatively well, you can see most of the details on objects or especially characters, with good draw distance and maybe some textures being kinda blurry.Overall, it's the typical GTA experience: go through story missions, do side activities like races or parachuting, or just go on the good ol' rampage with rocket launchers and miniguns. The game plays primarily like a cover shooter, with most headshots being instantly lethal and regenerating health (up to a certain point). What makes the game a bit more interesting than an average cover shooter is characters' special abilities - well, a little bit more interesting, as they're not particularly special. Franklin gets slow-mo superdriving, Michael has bullet time when shooting, and Trevor... well let's just say he goes nuts, tanks bullets like they're nothing, and the ones he fires tend to explode enemy body parts rather violently.Besides that you can use the in-game money you earn to buy properties, whether for storing vehicles or making more money.Despite how solid singleplayer is, it ain't making up for how  Online is.The general gist of Online is pretty obvious: do stuff with friends that you would normally do by yourself in this type of game. You can also play various multiplayer activities like PvP shootouts, battle royale, or races, to earn cash and experience to level up and unlock / buy more stuff. And here's actually the first flaw of the thing: you need amounts close to a million to buy just one major property than isn't a simple apartment for you to stay in, or a single vehicle. More expensive weaponized vehicles have a base price of 3-4 milion, with even more if you wanna customize them, sometimes requiring  one or two purchases worth a seven-digit figure each just to be able to even fully customize them in the first place. And a lot of the stuff you buy is mostly just so you can have an easier time making  money. The most recent piece of content, Casino Heist, will likely get you and your buddies a bit over half a milion per head, after about two hours worth of setup and running the heist itself, if split evenly. It takes quite a lot of grinding, especially with no income, to even be able to afford one major thing. Well, that, or what Rockstar wants you to do - buy shark cards.Another major problem is how easy it is to grief in Online - everyone who played it knows the flying terror made of highly concentrated bullcrap, the Oppresor Mk2. A jet-powered bike with homing rockets, countermeasures to avoid enemy firepower, tiny size, fairly high speed, and, in contrast with all the other aircraft, the ability to be used at almost full effectiveness by potatoes. It's the griefer's favorite tool, and it makes the job extremely easy. It's hard to really get anything done when every session you're guaranteed to have at least one of these guys blowing hundreds of thousands of in-game currency worth of stuff you're trying to sell. It does have counters, given it's made out of paper and doesn't protect its user from enemy bullets, but when you're new and don't own anything, or you're stuck driving a slow-ass garbage truck that's basically a sitting duck? Kiss your potential money goodbye. Of course it's to the benefit of Rockstar - making life hell for people trying to earn money just drives up shark card sales, which is their bottom line.Also their anti-cheat is basically nonexistant. It's extremely easy to use some kind of modding overlay to do all kinds of crazy stuff, so cheaters are extremely common in this game. If you're lucky they will at most meme on you while being rather harmless; at worst make everything explode in the world, nuke the entire session from orbit, or force crash your game.The majority of heist prep objectives usually boil down to three things: getting something from point A to point B, losing cops (it won't let you actually finish much if you're on the radar), or getting killed over and over with one-shots to the head until you can actually get whatever you wanna get done, well, done. In heists themselves, you have usually a spare life on Normal, and none on Hard (which has 25% higher payout) - anybody dying when there are no lives remaining means automatic failure and restart from the last checkpoint, which is usually start of the actual activity after driving there, or - if the game's feeling merciful - the halfway point. In general it frequently feels like it jumps from sleep-inducing driving to extremely frustrating cycle of dying and respawning over and over again, with hardly anything in-between.And on a technical level... Online's one giant amusing glitch at best, a complete and utter joke at worst. It takes between 5-10 minutes just to join an Online session, loading time wise, on start-up. Still a few minutes when you're switching sessions afterwards. Besides that there are tons and  of bugs, so I'm just going list the ones I personally experienced: constant issues with joining any friends' sessions or their heists, inability to join them outright due to having to ""complete the tutorial first"" (this being after I have  that session meaning it's definitely completed already, otherwise it wouldn't let me do that in the first place), textures just straight-up disappearing to reveal the void beneath the city, constant desync issues during heists which cause illogical things like cameras surveiling walls or doing 360 turn-arounds, purchasing clothes only for them to be magically un-purchased next time you check on them - on multiple occassions, heist cuts resetting to default where the host takes lion's share of the cash and everyone else is left with piddling amounts - on two occassions, and softlocking the game while doing something as simple as .I have absolutely no idea how this mess of a ""game"" can be Rockstar's cash cow. Unless their idea of making money is to keep it in a laughable state to frustrate the players to the point of buying shark cards in order to skip the dysfunctional grind. That's both the only logical solution to it, and also something that makes me wonder just how much longer this industry - or humanity itself for that matter - can even function, if this is what people are actually spending money on, en masse.So overall, my recommendation is no, just due to how insultingly poor Online is, since I'm judging the whole package here. However if you're not interested in Online, it's a fairly decent and sometimes good game to have a few tens of hours worth of fun with, even if it's nothing special - in which case, I would say pick it up on a sale."

That said, Rockstar is one of the worst gaming companies in the industry, and I hesitate to ever support one of their products today. The state of this game for PC is abysmal, they have routinely shortchanged the PC version over the years, but it has gotten to a point that it feels like they are intentionally trying to drive people off of this platform to their new gen console variants. It has been nearly a year since Rockstar released the Expanded and Enhanced version of the game, which brought exclusive new cars (some of the most anticipated ones players have begged for since launch), new cosmetic effects (chameleon paint and other highly requested features), new graphics, and new speed caps; in short it completely changed the gaming experience. This version however never came to PC, seemingly for no reason other than their inability to charge for it as most of the upgrade has been within the scope of PC for a decade. Since the release of E&E, the PC experience has continued to degrade. Not long ago they removed most of the anticheat features, and since then PC has devolved rapidly. PC always had a major unaddressed cheater problem, with mod menus being used rampantly to both exploit and grief players. Today, there is an unchecked cheat system available that is allowing bad actors to access and destroy player accounts regardless of what gamemode you are in. They can ban or destroy your account in solo lobbies or even story mode, potentially even gaining access to your PC information. It is unclear the extent to which this is occurring, but high profile individuals within the Rockstar community are advising players to NOT PLAY THEIR PC VERSIONS OF THE GAME OUT OF PRECAUTION YOU COULD LOSE ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS, AND/OR MORE. What is Rockstar doing about it? Still selling the game, deleting complaints posts on their forums, culling any bad optics while they ignore the problem. Rockstar has always been a scummy company. When I first bought this game, it came with the cheapest shark card, one of their microtransaction pay to win garbage incentives, something that equates to roughly 5minutes of playing the game in terms of value. They included this because it counted as an automatic game addition, thus rendering the game nonrefundable. They have in the past increased the price of the game for sales so they could show it marked down more than it was (selling for 90 dollars so they can call 60 dollars 33% off type of thing). They have gone after the modding community time and time again when it presented competition for their main product, most notably culling the high end graphics modder community with lawsuits and cease and desist orders prior to the release of the E&E graphics updates. They've pushed required launchers making it untenable to play their games without always being online, encouraged toxic game environments to encourage microtransactions, and a host of other scummy practices. Above and beyond an awful company. As good as this game is, I do not recommend ever giving money to this company again.TLDR: Good game completely tarnished by unethical trashbag company, Rockstar. PC version is unplayable at the moment if you don't want to have your account banned, deleted, corrupted, or worse, your PC hacked. Modders have been a problem for years, but it seems they intentionally are allowing them to run wild now to encourage people moving on to their console variants, that come with additional purchase requirements, most likely to protect their microstransactions from losing their value. At every step of the way these last 10 years, they have put money before the game, at times openly encouraging toxic gaming environments to support microstransactions (see MK2 Oppressor). This is a corporate institution now, not a gaming studio, and likely has been ever since they forced out Leslie Benzies."

If you can't, go into windowed mode, (Alt + Enter) open Task Manager, end process of GTA5.exe. Don't beg for money drop.As of now 6/3/2020, with current playerbase of , I rarely encounter modders even after the Epic's free GTA V giveaway.Thank you for taking time reading my review, have a good day."

I've only ever played GTA Online freeroam and missions, and haven't played the campaign. Most of my time was spend grinding rooftop rumble and rolling with the boys throughout Los Santos. I had to stop playing for a few reasons, one of them being all the crazy vehicles and guns they keep adding. Pretty much everything after the homing launcher and Kuruma made multiplayer unbalanced. To each their own, if your mommy wants to buy you shark cards so you can call in tanks every time someone kills you, go ahead. I preferred the meta before the PC release and a few months after. There should have been PC/Console cross-play at the time of release, so I could keep playing with some of my friends left behind in the great PC migration. I haven't played the game in a while now, so I'm hesitant to recommend it. I'm pretty sure there are many fun times to be had with the right people. Buy it on sale bundled with some in-game cash if you want to stand a chance against the long time player base. I'll update this review once I play through the campaign."

I've spent over 1000h in the game and there's still something to do!I completed the whole story (every story missions, side missions and side activities) in around 60h. An interesting fact is, GTA V allows you to play as 3 characters during one play through: as a young gangster , retired thief Michael and psychopathic Trevor. An amazing combination that lets you play various missions and side activities aspecially designed for the character. The story has wacky humor and engaging with a dramatic or very satisfying ending. In addition, there are many side activities that allow you to get even more involved in the gangster world. Almost 95% of the game time I spent in Online mode of the GTA V - . GTA Online allows you to play with your friends. There are  activities you can play solo or in co-op as well as many different types of vehicles (such as helicopters, boats, cars, motorcycles etc.) which, combined with the excellent arcade driving model, creates an interesting alternative to other racing games (such as NFSs or Grid). By regular updates this game tries to keep your attention and engagement at the highest level possible."
1089,serious mode,https://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/,124,24,0,169.8,January,"1,",666,33,1,"I waited a while to write this, mainly because I wanted to find quite a bit to write about. Nevertheless, after 100+ hours, I feel this game can be thoughtfully and precisely judged, more inportantly on all aspects of the game. I'll be dividing this review into two categories: Single Player and Multiplayer. Let's begin.:Single player starts off with the characters Michael and Trevor. Finishing a heist job from the North Yankton bank, they decide this is the last and final score. Yet, not all good things end well. They end up getting caught, and one of their crew members die. Trevor escapes, and that's where the story begins. Next and final playable character is introduced, named Franklin. Franklin is a petty thief, who is hired by Simeon (a local car dealsman) to reposess cars at the owners expense, although the reposession is not so to speak authorised. One day, Franklin gets the order to ""repo"" the car of a teenager, and upon arrival, Franklin is met with a seemingly rich family. After successfully lifting the car, Franklin drives away cheerfully, not knowing Michael is in the back seat. After pursuading Franklin to drive through Simeons shop, Michael makes a deal with him to make some ""real"" cash, thus involving Franklin in a series of robberies and other heists. Once word gets out Michael is ""back in the scene"", his old colleague Trevor finds out, who is furious because he thought Micheal died all those years back. That's pretty much the story. You rob a few banks, make some cash. The story is quite well and fun, I found no aspects to complain about, and even had hours of enjoyment playing through it. I actually wish it was longer, or a Single Player DLC was introduced which involved the main characters after the robberies. Even though side missions and such could count as this, I wanted more along the lines of the main story. All in all, the game is pretty much (in it's current state) only worth it for the story. The reason why is in Multiplayer. :Jesus Christ. Multiplayer is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess. Just to name a few problems: -Hackers. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will infinitely shoot rockets at everyone until their dead, or at least until you want to turn on passive mode and ruin your experience. -""DLC"". With the addition of some well planned DLC, ""cash cards"" or microtransactions of in-game currency became available. The only reason I have a problem with this is that the ones that are worth anything at all (meaning the money from the card can't be made in 20 minutes time) are more than what the game is actually sold for. Yes, that's right. The developers are selling in-game money for $50 or even $100 real money. Not to mention this was the spawn of their genius Summer Sale idea to innitially discount the game 40%, only to remove the listing, add a Shark Card to it and stick it up as 40% off, but still cost the regular $60. ♥♥♥♥ move Rockstar. -Foreigners. I, myself, find me to be a very multicultured person. I don't mind at all anyone of a different nationality, only when it hinders my gameplay. Example: I'm still sort of new to the whole online mode of this game, so I often ask for hints during team modes such as heists. So, I was put into a lobby of non-english speakers for a heist, so I thought, okay, I can do this, I just have to fly a plane. I get the plane, go to the area, now I have to evade jets. No big deal. After flying around for 20 minutes with literally nothing happening, the team finally gets their ♥♥♥♥ together, and I can pick them up. I fly off, and we are supposed to lose the cops. My other pilot (who has the missles to shoot down the cops helicopters so we can get away faster) decides he's going to take a break, and lands at the beach. I fly around for maybe 20 more minutes, trying desperately to get these cops to go away, and even when there were none around for miles they somehow still found me. After I finally get them to go away, I now just have to drop them off. Somehow, my experienced skills did not tell me I have to stall my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plane in the sky about 200 meters up just do drop the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, so I spent about another 10 minutes flying around screaming what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on??? Then, my genius teammates start screaming at me ""FLY TALL"". Any English speaker will not know what the ♥♥♥♥ that means, so when someone says fly tall, that literally sounds like nonsense. So, other helicopter guy decides his 15 minute break is up, starts flying upwards into the air, so I decided to follow. The game goes to the cutscene, and we all jump out. After 2 seconds, screen comes up the guy we broke out died. I left the game.Don't get me wrong, online can be some fun, and by that I mean if you have passive mode enabled or are in a solo session. Multiplayer is literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cancer. Just avoid it at all costs."

Losing my character with all the progress I made when I have done nothing wrong except literally going to bed one day and waking up to see I've been suspended. Now I outright fear even going onto the game even after the suspension is gone in a month along with my other friends and never being able to play again.The policy that is in place where one is not allowed to appeal a suspension or a ban is absolutely insane, and I know there are other innocent players that have been getting false flagged by their overly zealous anti-cheat. But due to their policy anyone who plays legit and gets flagged or even sabotaged by a modder cannot do anything about it but accept their fate of losing all their progress the first time and than condemned to just never play again the second time they get flagged. One can go onto Youtube, Reddit or even check other Reviews here on Steam on this matter. They've basically shut down the customer service over the phone and if you respond on their support questioning your suspension you just get the same copy pasted message and your requests locked. Even speaking to a live service rep via their website just results in you immediately getting the same thing and them closing out the chat. You won't even get to know why you were suspended/banned as they stated they will not release any information on why action was taken against you."

You could buy it at the same price but with it's in game money card. Which was the only way to buy it, unless you wanted GTA San Andreas or Max Payne.

I know from firsthand experience. This latest thing about them not wanting people to mod the game with OpenIV is just icing on the cake. Their game and practices have been invalidating users' purchases since it was released on PC, and they aren't doing a thing to fix that.My original issue was with their built-in anti-cheat. Instead of using a tried and true anti-cheat mechanism like VAC or PunkBuster or EAC, they decided they'd do better, and added something of their own to the game. Somehow, they screwed it up way, way worse than any of the other solutions out there. Surprising, huh?Their anti-cheat not only doesn't ban uses who are quite obviously using cheats, but it also bans users who aren't doing anything wrong at all! That's what I paid $60 for! They took a brute-force console-style approach to anti-cheat. Anything that's running on your system that might even LOOK at the game's memory while running will get you flagged, and that includes: streaming software, chat overlays, FPS counters, virus scanners, hell even steam's own FPS counter was doing it at one point. The real kicker is they won't admit that their system makes any mistakes, let alone tell you what on your system is setting the anti-cheat off.That point is hammered home when you try to contact support about the issue. Any and all tickets even mentioning the word ""ban"" in them are automatically closed with an automated response, and calling their support line and saying the same thing results in an aggressive script-reading and disconnected call. If you think I'm joking, just try it for yourself. This review will still be here for you to read, I'll wait.Back already? Good, because there's just a bit more left. See, a large portion of the community is so blindly entranced by the game series that they assume Rockstar can do no wrong, and swear that anyone that has a problem is either a liar, an idiot, or both. I've been falsely banned TWICE from the game, and just about every response I've gotten when mentioning it has been ""you cheated, you got what you deserved."" Productive bunch, eh?So let me just say that this latest anti-consumer move from the GTA giant comes as not even the slightest inkling of a surprise for me, someone who LOVED this game, someone who was waiting for its release, someone who doesn't have a ton of money and saved up for it, who feels completely cheated and betrayed. I won't be buying another Rockstar product again. I hope the company hits such dire times that they get dismantled and the property is sold off to someone who can do the customers justice. Lastly, I hope the people who are making these actively harmful decisions step on a lego, have it fly into their mouth and then choke on it.By the way, you should all go into the tags for this product and report the one that says ""Moddable"". It doesn't apply anymore. Thanks for reading."

Michael who hates himself for being impulsive as he can not help himself most of the time but he wants to get better, Franklin is the most sane character among them with no visible mental problem, he probably represents the voice of reason of the player in the game, and finally Trevor who is the craziest one among them, a bloodthirsty maniac but extremely loyal to his friends.Gameplay wise they all have their own singular unique power. Michael to slow down time on foot, Franklin to slow down time while driving and Trevor to go on a rampage.Missions were well designed and interesting to play through, I did not get lost nor did I feel like my hand was being held too much, they found the balance there.They've done a pretty good job with giving attention to detail to the main story and memes/jokes revolving around the main story.Visuals/Graphics are spectacular, they did a pretty good job with lighting and reflections, I haven't been to California but it truly feels like you are strolling through the streets, pretty immersive.However the player is limited in the open world compared to other GTA titles. You can not go into interior places as much as you used to be able to in the GTA 4 for example. Property aspect of the game is weak compared to Vice City, you just buy the place and it's working. In Vice City, you had to do each property's special mission for the place to start generating money.Assassination missions reminded me of GTA Vice City as well, they were probably better in this game as you were able to manipulate the stock market and make a profit off of the events that occurred.There was no territory system like in San Andreas, I guess it makes sense since you are not playing as gangsters.Car modification was weak compared to San Andreas, you used to be able to do much more in SA or at least it felt like it.Gameplay-wise character development was not satisfactory compared to SA. I wanted to get buffed in the gym like in SA.Attention to detail given to open world aspects of the game was again weak compared to previous titles: VC, SA, IV. Musics in the radio stations were forgettable, most of the time I just turned the radio off rather than listening to it. Vice City and San Andreas had much better radio stations and songs in the radio.Memes and satire criticism of humans/world were pretty fun as well.Story mode and anything revolving around the main story were satisfactory however open world/sandbox aspect of the game was disappointing compared to previous titles. Needed more polishing on the sandbox element of the game."

In less than 3 days I finished the main missions and most of the optional side missions (game completion at 75%), without stealing more than 3 cars/vehicles in total (in the stats I have Trevor with one police car stolen and Michael with one FireTruck and a Taxi stolen, Franklin didn't steal no nothing). I also played on the side Online in that game time and reached a Rank over 20, it's great fun with or without friends. It feels like this game is a drug that stole my life...but I don't regret a thing.Things I really enjoyed and you should probably do too:The game, despite it's large size, it's amazingly optimized with many graphic options to tweak. I have exactly the minimum requirements and I can run it, sure I had to turn every fancy pc enchanting option off and it looks like the graphics on the old-gen consoles, but I am happy, it works with +30fps.The missions are really captivating, the money spending system feels more challenging (because you have a lot to spend it on, to invest it, to simly lose it). You get to meet many interesting sidecharacters and the overall voiceacting is really good. Besides the actual story and the many twists in the missions, they have quite a replay value due to their minichallenges for each of them (like 'finish in the required time', 'complete it in a certain order' etc.) if you are a completionist.The car handleing, amazing, the gave up the GTA IV 'simulator' like driving and brought back the arcade like car handling from the older ones, where you can rotate in the air or do some nice stunts.The world is really immersing, each NPC with it's small story, with their interactions etc. It's a living world filled with living people, animals and moments...and with Internet, Radio and Cable TV!I can't quite say there is a lot of choice based tasks, but there is a really decent number of those, most of them involving planning or the interaction choice, but as long as you have imagination there will always be a choice.It's great that we have animals, you can kill them, you can play/interact with them, you can even become them at a certain point (hidden easter egg). Most of the people are avereage aged, from 20-60 or so, I kinda wished we also had the extrems like children or quite old people...sure it would probablly create some controversy, but it would make give the game an even more real feeling.And I could enumerate so many more...but now I have to get back to the game."

1147,Gandalf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jahama/,11,,0,"1,012.1",December,"31,",27,0,1,"Let me start at the beginning in order to accurately describe this atrocity that has happened to me a few months ago. Just now decided to write a review after seeing the same thing has happened to so many others. I bought GTAV on September 17th, 2013. I waited in the pre-order line at gamestop because I was so damn hyped for this game. I was only intending to play it on console until the PC version came out. At this point I had no clue that there was going to be character swaps from console to PC. I obtain level 72 on console. Loving the game, couldn't be happier (except if the radio stations were better).PC version release date is announced sometime in January 2015. I immediately pre-order it in order to get the bonus money that was available as a pre-order incentive. Upon release I transfer my character from console to PC and recieve my pre-order money. I was so thrilled to finally be playing this great game on PC. In the last year I put in 390 hours online in this game and achieved level 136 if I recall correctly. Countless hours of heist grinding, job grinding, lots of shark cards bought. Sitting at something like 11million dollars. 2 houses, 2 garages. Everything I could ever want in the game. I had things that weren't even obtainable anymore. I was thrilled with where the game was going. Then.... I get bored; So I quit playing for 2 months.A friend asks me, ""Hey come play GTA with me let's wreck some kids"". Sure why not. I get on for about an hour and we do just that, wreck some kids. I log off for the night and log in the next day to a 10 day ban. I was beyond baffled. How could I be banned when I didn't do anything? Surely rockstar support can help me. So I call in an attempt to figure out what is going on. I get fed a rehearsed line about bans being the result of online modding etc etc. I ask for a supervisor, the supervisor says the same thing. I ask for his supervisor. He says there is no one above him available and I was unable to appeal my ban. His reasons are as follows.""Just accept the 10 day ban."" ""If you weren't really doing anything then in 10 days you can play again and nothing will be lost, just take a break"".He neglects to tell me that the system was going to take all of my money and I would have to start over. Grinding countless heists/jobs or buy a large sum shark card (which is ultimately what they wanted me to do).I come back around 12 days later and play for a few hours. Nothing out of the ordinary happens. I then got off for the night. The following day I got back on and was banned again. This time for 30 days. I think to myself ""No &*%#ing way, this isn't possible"". I call AGAIN and get the same rehearsed line AGAIN from both the first and second level of support (always ask for a supervisor). Except this time something was different. This time I was being allowed to appeal my ban. I thought for sure I would be exonerated of these allegations. Nope. I was told that I must have been hacking if their skynet system banned me. That there is nothing they can do and that ""evidence of illicit activity"" was found on my account. So I ask them to check again and they do. Same result. At this point I start thinking ahead. ""What happens when I get back from this 30 day ban?"". ""I'm just going to be banned again for the same false reason?""They reply, ""that shouldn't happen sir"". I reply, ""Shoulda coulda woulda. It's happened twice now so what makes next time any different. No variables have changed. If I record all of my gameplay from now on will that protect me? If I am indeed banned upon return to your game can I use the footage as proof of my innocence?""""Yes"", I was told. Not maybe, not ""we're not sure"". I was told ""Yes, that will suffice"".So I did just that. I recorded all of my gameplay. Unfortunately ""all"" only ended up being roughly 2 hours the night I was unbanned after the 30 day ban because I was immediately banned permanently after logging off for that night.This is starting to get a little longer than I expected so I'll cut it short. I tried to appeal the permament ban. I thought ""I have video that I didn't do anything, surely this time it will be different.... they will have to unban me"". NOPE.I'll just end my review here and link my evidence. The videos of my gameplay and their final reply to me in my appeal where I linked them the videos. TL;DR: ROCKSTAR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE AND IF YOU BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL BE BANNED BY SKYNET SIMPLY FOR BEING IN THE SAME LOBBY AS A SCRIPTER (WHICH WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN). Edit: According to various sources (denied by Rockstar when I called them today) I was banned for MSI Afterburner/RivaTuner. This would make sense to me now that I think about it. However my review remains unchanged because they are doing absolutely nothing to fix the issue. I was told that I am not allowed to appeal my permanent ban because their system is flawless and does not falsely ban people for any reason. The support supervisor (Kyle) even acknowledged that he had heard of the MSI/Riva complaint but that it was ""false"". So yeah I'm still in the same place I started. Still will never support another Rockstar game for as long as I live."

1153,twitch.tv/olkeuk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/officialOLKE/,29,3,0,290.8,September,"30,",967,0,1,"I’m going to be brutally honest with this game because it’s by far one of my favourite games that ever released, I have spent the most game time out of anything I’ve played so seeing the progression this game has made is outstanding. GTA is an amazing game series that never disappoints and I wish there was an option to be null because there are things this game strive and execute extremely well but also fail and are poorly planned out.The campaign is amazing, I cannot fault it. I enjoyed it so much and have played through it multiple times. Before I continue this review I want to point out I have well over 600 hours altogether spread across campaigns and online on console and PC. The campaign is probably the best in the series because rockstar know how to execute the missions with a structured storyline and with 3 characters to choose from, they knew how to get the audience to play since you could pick your favourite character to play with most. Some of the missions are a little boring but I guess it fits the setup for heists and general context to the game, you aren’t going to enjoy every moment of a GTA game I can confidently say that. Also, the campaign is shy of any DLC which compared to GTA 4, received two major DLCs for it’s campaign which both were major successes to the game especially TBOGT, I didn’t mind the L&D but I feel TBOGT had more to offer. They could’ve made DLC about Micheal and Trevor’s life before the first heist or made campaigns about other GTA characters like Lamar or even introduced a female protagonist, I don’t know but I feel it could’ve had a boost since online is messy.GTA Online had a painful startup, from pushing the release back to bugs and glitches, heists took two years to release (I think) and the only real way to make money was grinding missions, people got onto the DNES servers and started cracking the game’s code to give player’s loads of money, god mode and just break the game. Then all of this fell short and people played the game for it’s online which is a huge upgrade from GTA IV, I can’t say any good things about GTA IV online because it was pretty poor, but I didn’t have high expectations anyways. GTA V has had great DLC and updates since then and it’s amazing to see how far they’ve advanced. It’s just online that makes me right this so negatively now because it’s so toxic and unenjoyable for everyone. If you don’t have a lot of money and you’re new, it’s quite grindy and you start to realise that people are annoying and want to make your experience painful by constantly killing you, blowing up cars, setting bounties and so much more. The game is focused on if you have money, which if you do is quite boring too because there isn’t much you can do once you have houses, properties, cars. Looking at the prices in game you can see it’s a cash grab from rockstar, they want you to buy these shark cards with deals with the dlc to save money and give you lots of content for a cheaper price, if the £50 game wasn’t enough. I know this doesn’t entitle to everyone but for some it can be grindy which isn’t always enjoyable or it can be expensive. The game has a lot more content with heists and missions with larger payouts but asks for more of your time and grindiness. I loved this game and would play it all the time with my friends on console, which is what also makes it hard for this game, if you don’t have friends to play this with, it can be pretty boring as well. The whole startup for new players in the current state is difficult with flying cars and orbital cannons but the grinding can be fun for some people I guess. There are ways to work around these problems but it shouldn’t be something that needs to be solved by the player but rather the devs. Make servers for fresh people, servers where there is no griefing. The community is toxic and that is why I don’t recommend online. This game is an amazing experience especially with the campaign and I enjoyed it, if you’re reading this review because you’re thinking about buying this game I’m saying my recommendation is no, I would maybe change my mind if you could transfer progress from console to pc because I don’t know why they removed that feature. This game isn’t at all fun if you’re new since you probably are reading this thinking of buying it, if you want to own this game, buy a key or get it cheap, since the campaign at this stage of the life cycle is the only enjoyable experience you’ll get out of this. Feel free to play online but I cannot promise the same outcome.Campaign: 9/10Online if new: 2/10Online if rich: 6/10"

1156,NWeskey,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Neo_Weskey/,18,2,1,176.6,January,"3,",112,1,1,"Grand Theft Auto 5 is the current latest game from the GTA franchise, after the monumental success of Grand Theft Auto. Rockstar Games decided to make a sequel to the HD universe in sunny Los Santos(inspired by Los Angeles). The game was released on September 17th, 2013 and is to date, the most successful piece of entertainment media. Just to mention in this review I won't mention GTA 5: Online because that it a game on it's own.The gameplay for GTA 5 is a great example of perfection. Everything is brilliantly paced, nothing feels that it was shallow or rushed. Missions end with you finding new things out about the game and its lore.Gunplay is very satisfying, aiming to feel so fluid and responsive. The variety of weapons and their addons is massive, there are 30 weapons all with customizability. Shotguns have a loud and powerful punch, pistols having that firm grip and the snipers having that shrouded effect.The GTA 5 graphics were in 2013 groundbreaking almost 7 years later, that claim still stands. The graphics are absolutely stunning! Rockstar Games really are known for their level of detail. Every piece of shrubbery is unique in its own way. It's amazing how they managed to stuff a world that big in a game. Before i start . In GTA 5, you play as 3 main protagonists; Franklin Clinton - a 25-year-old guy trying to escape gang life and trying to actually do something influential in his life, a newcomer to the criminal life. He is also a talent for driving.Michael DeSanta (Townley) - a 48-year-old trying to live a good life after being a full-time criminal in the late 90s and early 2000s. During a heist in Ludendorff, the United States Michael and one of his partners in crime 'Brad Snider' both were shot after fleeing the police, Brad didn't survive the shot but Michael did. Michael made a deal with the FIB to fake his own death. During that time he tried to cut contacts with his other partner in crime 'Trevor Phillips', which is are next character.Trevor Phillips - a close contact of Michael DeSanta, who in 9 years met new people in the outskirts of San Andreas and founded his own company with Ron Jakowski called Trevor Philips Enterprises. An uprising drug smuggling company trying to get a bigger sponsor to make his company larger. He is also a psychopath and he's talented in aiming and killing.The story feels very good, it all fits together nicely and in the singleplayer campaign, you meet a lot of unique characteristics, which you would never probably meet in real life. The idea of having 3 protagonists is genius in my opinion, mainly because you are able to see certain aspects in the game from different perspectives.GTA 5's level design is of most Rockstar's games, linear and innovative. In every mission, you're given tasks which reap the main goal. The recreation of Los Angeles is spot on. Having been in LA, I knew exactly where I was going most of the time. Some parts are of course fictional and don't exist in real life, but it's executed so well that it might as well be in real life.Grand Theft Auto 5 is a big game, period. It features over 60 innovative and diverse missions. Besides that, there are a lot of little small quests that don't affect the main story. The game took me over 40 hours to beat the first time, and I enjoyed every single moment of it. I've even become fond of the mission fails.The controls are fluid, responsive and free. Movement by foot is a bit sluggish, but that's to be expected because you have so many vehicles to chose from and walking is only used when necessary. Fun fact, there are currently 464 vehicles in GTA 5 (including GTA 5: Online).The difficulty of GTA 5 missions isn't hard. Most missions are easy and are fun. Although saying that, I can say I've failed a mission more than 1000 times.The music in GTA 5 is amazing, for me it is up there with GTA San Andreas' soundtrack. The diversity of the radio stations is nice and it adds a bit of depth. The main theme song for GTA 5 is iconic, it recreates LA so well I can't describe it in words, it's popularity shows that.The trailer for GTA 5 is great, it tells you all you need to know what's going to happen in-game and it showed the graphics 2 years before the official release of the game. You also get introduced with one of the protagonists; Michael DeSanta. In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto 5 is the best games Rockstar Games have ever made and it will always be like that, it has become a phenomenon and it's community comes from all over the world. The game features an insane level of detail and it's the definition of perfect execution. If I had to rate Grand Theft Auto 5 from 0 to 10. I would rate the game an undisputed 10/10, probably goes into the history books as an instance of a perfect game."

The game has urban, rural, and even forest settings - the game world is ridiculously large (you can drive around for hours). I loved all the characters and the settings they were in (though Franklin was my fave). The story is too cool, with tons of crazy situations, beautiful locations and insane characters. The humour and writing is top-notch; I was laughing many times while playing GTA5. As always, Rockstar parodies California culture perfectly. Even the side missions are fun - I spent the time to complete them all, just to hear the awesome dialogue.There are so many different vehicles, clothing options and guns in this game. I had fun just driving around and interacting with the world. I also spent a good bit of time customizing my cars - there is just so much to do. Minigames, jobs, sports, heists...

While no game can truely live up to it all, this game certainly comes close. The Single Player--sorry, 'Story Mode'--is what you'd expect from a GTA game these days; long, fun and somewhat captivating. There's some silly moments in it (not quite San Andreas level, but pretty close) that keeps the more boring bits interesting and some great chase scenes.While I haven't even came close to completing the game at the time of this 'review', I still feel the game was worth the £39.99 I payed.Now, GTA Online; Oh boy...It's hard to explain, or even define, but there's something about Online that makes it addictive. Much like your Skyrims, you're constantly wanting to get better stuff. Be that cars, boats, helicopters, jets, weapons or clothes, you're always after something new.Yes, there are ""lobbies"" with much higher level players in there ""destroying"" us newer players, but they're not that frequent. Even when in one, you'll have some enjoyment getting your revenge (or go into ""Passive Mode"").While I brought the game for the 'Story Mode', I'm finding myself focusing more on the Online play.There's some issues with lobbies randomly being ""emptied"" (in short, you are moved into your own empty lobby due to the Rockstar Servers claiming your rig or connection can't handle the current lobby), but you can still join ""Jobs"" with others no problem.In short, I'd highly recommend this game to pretty much anyone.It's great fun, has humour and is excellent value for money."

The one that immediately became one of my top favorites, which I wanna play over and over again. Los Santos - awesome city. It is so beautifully designed, with so much attention to details, that I could probably live there. If you like hot pursuits, cop chases with shooting - you've got it. Whether you want to take a relaxing ride in a super car on city and country roads with spectacular views, fly a plane, copter, sail a boat, ride a bike, and so on - you've got it. If you're a fan of some sports activities – you can play golf, tennis, darts, run a triathlon, jump with parachute. And, of course, many many different customizable cars and weapons at your disposal. Everyone can find some tasks of their interest. Gripping storyline missions is mixed with many other activities, which will never make you bored. I've played around 65 hours so far, and still only 55% done. All this comes with really awesome graphical performance – city looks almost like real, pretty good music, great voice acting and many funny dialogs.And this is only single player. In GTA online you can do all this stuff together with your friends. Not to mention new heists, which are also awesomely designed, as far as everybody says (Yeah, I’ve not played them yet, but really looking forward to). Or you can just roam the city and cause mass destruction to everything around. It is big sandbox, and what you can do there is limited only with your imagination.To sum up – this is one of the best games in my whole steam library. Definitely recommended."

However, if you're not willing to ignore all of the games problems, This game is basically ""The rich get richer and the poor get poorer"". Everything thats not a normal car require a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money, and each update only add more expensive stuff. This wouldn't be a problem  You will only be able to earn good cash AFTER you have millions, and even then, it still takes forever.The other problem is Sharkcards. Sharkcards are, in short, pay to win, since they give a bunch of cash instantly. This wouldn't really be too bad, if you wasn't able to buy cars with bullet proof glass, tanks you can call for free after you own it, and jet with a machine gun that shoots explosive shots. Because of this, new players has  to defend themselfs with when fighting people with these. Finally, there's the recent drama with Take 2 and modders. Ever since the game launched on PC, modders has been everywhere. Since the game is peer to peer  modders basically have admin powers, able to do anything to anyone. Sometimes you would meet one of the nice modders, but they are far and between. Something had to be done, and now Take 2 finally steps in and fix it...And im not just talking about a ban or anything, i mean they will put you in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ court for making mods. As of now, the game is only fun if you're playing with your friends and have most of the things unlocked. Don't support these scumbags."

Oh let me release a new car that costs almost the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ retail price of this game. if we look to EA's Starwars game, they got so many backlashes on the community but Rockster is getting away with this.I feel that rockster destroyed their own master piece after years. if you look in a buisness way this is a great way for making an Money printer, also because servers are expensive. but sadly i started to get fustraded and decided to glitching money in the game what ofcourse resulted to a ban and purging 3-4 years of gameplay. Sure this is my own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fault, but their anti cheat system is not perfect. Forexample:i've heard alot of storys that innocent people got banned and their account purged and customer support gave a big middle finger to you. this did happen to some of my friends. even cheaters have an way to get you banned and rockstar wipes your account.So this is my honest review after rewriting it after a rage attack 2 years ago, I still cannot recommend this game at all. Maybe the singleplayer content yes, but online? No. stay far away from this game.Now even with the new """"""Free"""""" DLC, it feels like they're no longer put much efford into the game. sure, its a 5 year old game but still rockstar trys you to milk you from your monney. and i feel that GTA online is there to milk you from money until you're bone-dry. oh dont let me started if you didnt bought for example an nightclub/moterclub/company etc, if you dont you're getting constantly nagged with phonecalls you cannot deny, that says that you NEED to buy one."

And of course Rockstar introduced online challenges-- mini games which pit the players head-to-head to win a cash reward. Naturally, if you're close to winning, you'll be any modder's main target. This awful infestation of cheaters has made the game outright frustrating to play with others, something that GTA is meant to be about.Despite the unfortunate multiplayer environment, the game remains very solid in private sessions and singleplayer game modes.

I will include a short list of my thoughts and observations.1. It's undeniable that GTA Online is full of cheaters (or modders/hackers, I fail to see the difference) but the single-player story mode is amazing.2. I have joined several public sessions and it appears there are either fewer cheaters or they do less damage. There are still money drops, hacked jobs, etc. But currently, I don't see (I never run into) cheaters who would ruin the public sessions completely. This was a serious problem earlier as the modders were killing everyone else, exploding our vehicles (disabling passive mode), teleporting our characters, and so on.3. Rockstar has added a new heist (Cayo Perico) which actually helps players to earn money even if they don't have a team. The new heist also helps us to avoid the cheaters because it can be played (with friends or solo) in an Invite-only session in its entirety. We are not forced to join public sessions anymore. So the possible interactions with cheaters can be minimized.4. Rockstar appears to have fixed some stability issues. In my experience, the game loads faster (the loading time is always less than a minute even on my slowest laptop). However, sometimes I still get stuck on loading screens.All in all, I can recommend this game (in its current state) but I will try to keep my review up to date (in case the situation changes)."
1238,FoxByTrade,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxByTrade/,20,1,0,21.7,June,"25,",298,0,1,"I got the game super late. Only 21 hours played. I should've looked into it more before buying it. The game is great. Single player campaign was fun. Then I tried to play online with friends. The first time went fine for about an hour, but then I got slapped with a ban out of nowhere. Super annoyed because I saw no reason for it, but whatever, I guess I can't try to appeal it or even find out WHY it happened to avoid it next time (and I did try). So I played SP some more until the ban lifted.I didn't play online again until a month after the ban lifed because I was still salty. This time I knew some things to avoid like picking up other players' money after killing them. Did some races for cash for clothes and guns. This time I lasted a few more hours. Yep, banned again. Permanently this time...I'd recommend the game for the single player experience. I'd recommend it for the multiplayer too as it was fun while it lasted. I will not recommend this game, however, because of the poor support and the wrongful bans that get so many people. Looking online at other ban claims I saw that no one was believed innocent. ""Yeah right, you must have been doing something wrong to get banned.""...I put in support tickets both times even though I've read that bans are un-appealable and final. The first time I received an auto-response. The second time, a friend recommended not submitting as a Banning Issue but an Online Issue. It looked like an auto-response again, but my ticket was changed from Online Issue to Hacking/Modding Report and Banning. So I feel like someone at least looked at it, changed it, and ultimately dismissed it. Doubt it is the support person's fault as it is usually management that forces that procedure.At the end of it all. I'll no longer purchase an online game from Rockstar, Take2, or their other companies. I have no way of knowing who wrote the idiotic policies, but the fact that they are still making money off the game tells me they just dont care.If you purchase the game for online play then good luck."

The game is decent, but good lord the hackers and script kiddies ruin this game. The cheating is so prevalent that Rockstar has instituted a draconian ban detection system that bans innocent players.  I got banned while running missions with a friend (who somehow didnt get banned as well?) for a week and a half. Im not waiting out this ban just to get unfairly banned again in the future. Instantly uninstalled the game and will not play again. I do not cheat in games and take it personally when I'm accused of it. TL;DR - game is decent, but the level of cheaters absolutely ruins it. If you buy, don't get surprised if you get hacked or get banned without reason."

1279,headlesscyborg,https://steamcommunity.com/id/headless_cyborg/,30,2,1,231.6,February,"9,",580,1,1,"Grand Theft Auto, the series of my childhood, I couldn't miss this one. Let me talk about single-player first.GTA5 takes place in San Andreas, just like GTA: San Andreas released back in 2004. Rockstar tried hard to make GTA5 as good as possible and it's indeed a fantastic game and a worthy addition to the series and my Steam library. It took me about 40 hours to finish it including side missions.It's much better than GTA4, at least when it comes to graphics, map design, missions, vehicles... planes are back, trains are back, parachutes are back.. and almost everything is better except damage system (which is undoubtedly worse). The whole time I was unsure if this is really better than the original San Andreas and honestly I can't tell - 9 years passed between both games, the gameplay and style has changed, both are a bit different, but in my opinion equally good.They still didn't get rid of the old bugs like missing cars (your fully upgraded car can disappear anytime unless you watch it 24/7). It's better, every character has his own car that can be modified and whenever you leave it, it will just respawn near your savehouse but sometimes it just disappears randomly just like the normal cars.it was fun, it's a must have for everyone who likes open-world games. Definitely one of my top 10 games. Now, about multiplayer... it's... unique. Seriously, there's nothing like this out there. GTA Online offers a new open-world+coop experience, it's amazing. Loading times are horrible even on SSDs but the experience is fantastic.What else to say - just get it. If you like open-world games you'll love it. I played on Linux, the game natively only supports Windows but thanks to the official Valve's SteamPlay / Proton feature (translation layer from DirectX 11 to Vulkan) it works on Linux."

It's a new issue affecting 1000s of people and in my close to 3000 hours have never had a problem up until now. Support ignores your tickets.  Might be related to something with the update but they won't acknowledge it or fix anything. They also had an event last week paying double, then took that money away too after the event ended from pretty much everyone I know who plays this.   This whole thing is actually worse than the last issue since this affects real money purchases as well as 100s of hours of your time/life at risk if you farm money instead of buying it, with clueless support agents closing tickets after giving copy/paste responses.   If this has happened to you, you should copy and paste my review into your own review, add/change whatever you want and send a message to Rockstar Games.It also looks like others are putting up similar reviews. This is a real problem happening right now to both people who earn the money playing normally and people who purchase Shark Cards. either way Rockstar just takes it. Their support can't even give you a true reason why if you continously inquire about it. I opened 5 tickets since and have gotten different excuses as to why they took my PAID for money. None of them make sense or relate to one another. I honestly don't think they even know that this is an issue with the anticheat flagging legitimate players.  I am leaving this up until they refund people their money though. Rockstar shouldn't be allowed to get away with this and do not trust doing anything with this game at this point. No game has EVER taken away money or items I bought with real money, EVER.They could easily fix this seeing that people who poured 100s to 1000s of hours into this game aren't cheaters and return our money.  Cheaters always want fast payoffs, they never learn the ins and outs of games or at least traditionally from the ones I've run into in other games on Steam. They have some hours in the game and all the things they shouldn't have that soon and they get vac-banned. That's the exact opposite of all the people I personally talked to that got hit by this money correction bug.Cheaters and Mod menu people are also in RDR2 online.

I play GTA for the RPG experience of a deeply satirical and sarcastic world-view of the one we live in, and this one simply didn't deliver as before.Beautiful graphics, fun to play.It's worth the price, especially on sale, to obtain and enjoy GTA V.  I can't review GTA Online because I didn't care about it.  I tried it, didn't really enjoy the mini-games and heists...I think it's made for a niche crowd.  Probably the kind who get aggressive over nothing, hits on someone's sister (coldly rebuffed, which he deals with as an emotionally stunted individual), then demands the blunt hurry up and be passed.  This person also vows that people on X-Box Live will be dealt with in real life, because they don't know him.  This person is probably also going to rage at me because I don't know how evil Rockstar is for taking his money by making it hard to free play online, but that's because I only gave them enough money to play the game I wanted, GTA V."

Take Two's poor treatment of its PC players and its penny-pinching for shark cards is going to turn a great deal of people against Red Dead 2 and Grand Theft Auto VI in the future.  I love this game and have invested hundreds of hours into it but I can't in good conscience leave a positive review if they're going to treat people who support the game like this. Don't buy the game at full price or pay for a single shark card."

Primarily I uninstalled the game due to the take-two modding debacle currently ongoing. This was the final culmination in the online section of the game, which has been for a while a micro-transaction hell-hole of hackers, cheaters, and people with wallets so big they can afford the £100+ needed to buy everything you could possibly want in a game you bought for £60. The micro-transactions have now made the online near enough unplayable. If you want to win races, you need a car that can only really be gained by purchasing in game currency. If not, you have a very, very long and repetitive grind ahead. It's ridiculous. If paying £60 for the game three times.... Xbox 360 and One, and for PC, isn't giving the company enough money, they ask for £50 every time you might fancy having a new appartment... Or clubhouse, office or warehouse for the latest DLC packages which are now clearly for nothing other than financial gain. I can not recommend buying the game if you want to play single-player as a modded version, and only play the online mode if you are either a:stupidly wealthy, or b: lacking in anything else to do other than vegetate over a grind for not enough money to progress."
1305,Astrobia,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AstrobiaBlack/,11,,0,144.3,June,"15,","2,938",0,1,"So GTA V, in my opinion, is the best GTA we've seen in decades. The single player is by far the best of any GTA game, so good it's award winning outside of the games industry for the character portrayals. Although it's got a lot wrong with it (the entire lobby and loading system) the online is everything we previously hoped for and more. Ontop of this Rockstar has continued to iterate on it over the years since it came out making it better and better.But I can't recommend it to anyone. Because the parent company (Take Two Interactive) are greedy, shady and outright devious sacks of bile.Every single update Rockstar has put together for the game since it was first released, T2I has pushed for changes within it to milk the player base. New vehicles coming in? Buff them and nerf the old ones so played feel compelled to spend to upgrade. This stood out to me most in the most recent update where the APC was released and they nerfed the Rhino. An APC is now tougher than a full on army tank. Because long time players already own the tank, got to motivate them to want the APC instead. What infuriates me about this particular example is the Rhino is a friggen gaming icon. It has been the staple apex weaponised vehicle in GTA since the very first game.The CEO of T2I had this to say last week ""We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetizing on a per-user basis. There is wood to chop because I think we can do more, and we can do more without interfering with our strategy of being the most creative and our ethical approach, which is delighting consumers.""Well, that last part was bulldonk, because they apparently can't even monetise the games at the current level without compromising their standards.The straw that breaks the camels back is just issued a cease and desist to the biggest core mod in the GTA community. The overwhelming majority of mods run off the back of this mod so they effectively just told the entire modding community that modding is illegal and to stop. To clarify these are single player only mods. That is utter insanity.Modding GTA games on PC is as much as a staple of the series as cars and crime. One of the first games I ever tinkered around with modding was GTA 1. I edited the sprites and tweaked the physics to make bikes into rockets, police cars into UFO's and give everything else a futuristic twist. And it was great fun. GTA is a series that was definitive in the evolution of sandbox games. We played in those sandboxed and as we played we imagined, created, tweaked and built new worlds within the open world sandbox it presented us.GTA V has seen multiple releases and it's no exaggeration to say the majority of the hype for the upcoming PC release was how it would open the doors to modding the game. Many people already owned the console version and repurchased the game simply for modding. There was even an entire program to players to transfer their saves from console to PC the move was so popular. But an enormous chunk of their player base buying the game twice apparently wasn't enough.Take Two Interactive seems to think too many people are enjoying the single player side of GTA V. It's bad enough that despite handfuls of DLC updates the single player has never gotten any new content, it's all online additions only. But now they are cracking down on players creating new content for the single player for themselves. Because people don't spend money on microtransactions for the single player. There is wood on the block left to chop.This is not okay."

Every server seems to have someone modding though to make the experience cancerous though tbh.They tend to kill everyone, and make it look like other people are doing the modding so that they get banned.Sometimes they'll give you money which is good or bad depending on if you want to play legit or not. The company itself...y'know it's cool that the dlc is free and everything however the game was much better optimized at release. When Gotten Gains started it started causing many, if not everyone performance issues.Also, Rockstar was originally banning people for using singleplayer mods which was a ♥♥♥♥ move by Rockstar.In fact I believe most negative reviews on this game is because people have been banned for using singleplayer mods such as the FOV mod.Grand Theft Auto V itself is easily a 8, 9, or even 10/10 game in most reviews.The AI is amazing, esspecially the cops in this game.The visuals of this game are incredible.It has a good story and unlike past Grand Theft Autos, three main characters, each with there own unique personality.The voice acting is great, it has a good story and it's so fun to  playthrough it.However that's the game itself, multiplayer lobbies as I said are trash, with hackers and poor optimization.Most of the games community is very aggresive and modders/hackers everywhere.The fun in missions, heists, races, etc can easily be spoiled in some way.Such as doing a heist, and somebody decides to leave. It's over, the heist will end and you'll have to find someone else.This game is very difficult for me to review because this is one of my favorite games.It's just due to Rockstar and some of the community to make the experience annoying.I feel that because after everyone beats Grand Theft Auto V and goes to GTA Online though i'd have to give it a negative review. Considering that is what everyone is going to be doing aside from singleplayer modding or whatever they'll be doing. So, negative review from me."

1326,TaylorB,https://steamcommunity.com/id/taylorb93/,9,,0,40.7,June,"16,",349,1,1,"This game sucks.Grand Theft Auto 1 and 3 are great classic Rockstar games, but for Grand Theft Auto V, the game designers obviously were not thinking straight. At first it seems like a pretty decent game, a little different from the first in the series but, that's okay. San Andreas was different from the first, Vice City was different, but they were all good.The first thing that's strikingly different is the fact that you have to go through Los Santos, talk to people and buy stuff. I never really minded that, it makes it a little more like an adventure story and it's kinda like SA, so that's okay. But the first problem comes in when it changes from day to night.(Cops chase you.)Why does this need to happen so often? Like, every five minutes? Why does it take so long? Nobody feels like sitting through this every time. How would you like it if you were playin' a game and then every five minutes I came over, made cops chase you, then counted ten tedious seconds, and then let you continue to play the game?Now, I mean, why did they think that that would be a good idea and interrupt the game play, did they think it would be more realistic? I mean, in real life I don't have to stop in my tracks when the sun sets and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥' helicopter doesn't pop up in the air. I mean, this is one of the most annoying features in any game ever. What's the point? Yeah, I mean, the cops are stronger at night and the stores are closed, but why's that necessary and why does the game have to stop? It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥' retarded.And why do you have to die when you get arrested? That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen. This guy can go all over fightin' hordes of evil civilians, but he can't even have his rights read to him?Sometimes I don't feel like goin' down the highway just to get down to the Richman, I mean, there's no reason I should have to do that when I can just take a shortcut and pick Franklin. But, oops! I shouldn't do that, there might be cops down there.Another thing that's really annoying about this game is the fact that you have to buy weapons and haircuts. I mean, still, that's not uncommon, you know like I said: that's the same thing you have to do in many great games, like SA, but, lemme explain.Here you have to collect dollars, which count as money. I mean, that's kinda odd, because usually dollars count as life or energy, y'know, so that's kinda strange. But, y'know that's not the point. The point is that the haircuts you need to buy are too ♥♥♥♥♥♥' expensive, and the dollars don't add up enough. It takes too long to get enough of them to buy something, and it gets boring wandering around killing the same civilians over and over again just so you can buy an afro or somethin'.Speaking of afro, that's pretty weird itself, isn't it? I mean, they were really being creative with that one, the afro.Anyway, about the dollars: It takes too long to buy stuff, and, to add onto the problem, when you die, you lose all your dollars and you have to start all over again. I mean, doing this doesn't add to any of the games' difficulty or challenge, it just makes us have to do more of the same monotonous stuff over again, and it's not fun, it's boring.Oh, look, I finally got enough dollars to go and buy a car that I need to cross the highway, now let me get to the store.(It changes to night in-game.)Oh ♥♥♥♥, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥' night time, now the stores are all closed and I have to wait for it to turn day again. Oh well, I might as well kill some civilians in the meantime and stock up on some more money.(The character in-game gets arrested and dies.)OH ♥♥♥♥! Now I gotta start all over again.One of the worst things in the game are the sidewalks, which are areas where there's, like, pedestrians or people that look like you could walk past them, but instead you just get beat up. It's impossible to tell where these spots are the first time walkin' through, so you just have to keep throwin' fists all over to see where they are. It's retarded. Why should I have to do that? Again, it doesn't add up to any of the fun, y'know, challenge of the game. It's just unfair and it's annoying.In the nightclubs, there's no bosses at the end, which is a big disappointment. Every Rockstar gamester knows that at the end of a level or a nightclub, whatever, there's always supposed to be a big guy who ya fight. But here, they just got lazy and only put a few bosses in the game and left some of the clubs just empty like this one. So, most of the buildings you go through (the Dungeon Crawler, to be exact), there's nothing at the end except for a phone call that you can't skip.In the rest of the GTA games the tradition goes like this: You fight a boss, you defeat 'im, then a phone call comes down and you listen to it, there you go, on to the next level. But in GTA V, how would you ever figure out that you're supposed to throw a grenade at that call? I mean, when you first get the grenade you assume it's a weapon, and you throw it, only to find that it does absolutely nothing, and that you waste it by throwing it, so you have to get it all over again.There are parts in the game that are definitely not self-explanatory, and are too hard to figure out. Take this dead end for example: Would you guess that you're supposed to pass through this airport? How? You have to kneel down by it for like ten seconds. Now, still, that's not enough to make it so cryptic and hidden that we can't figure it out, oh please, give us more for our buck and make it harder so we can wander around the whole game and exhaust every possibility before we find out. Okay. Guess what? You need to have a Sawed-Off Shotgun selected, and be kneeling down, and wait a little while before this magic phone call comes and takes you to the next part of the game.Most of the townspeople have things to say which aren't important at all, so why do you have to hear 'em? Here, in the stores, there's books that you may find which actually give you clues about things in the game that you may need to know about. But, when I find these books, half the time it's by accident, so I may hit the button and cancel it out which means I don't even get to read it and I don't have a second chance.Why can't I do that when it changes from day to night? That would actually be helpful. So, what the game designers figured is this: it isn't absolutely necessary for me to read about how to find strip clubs or what I'm supposed to do with a grenade, but what I do need to read, again and again constantly, is: ""You have been signed out of Rockstar Social Club"". How about ""Sign out of this horrible GAME""?What a piece of ♥♥♥♥. I mean, I feel horrible that I had to play this game in order to make this video, but I did it to demonstrate its dreadfulness and I forced myself to play it just so that you don't have to. So, you should thank me for telling you to stay away from this horrible steaming pile of goat ♥♥♥♥. I mean, I know it's useless complaining about a game that was made back in mid 2013 or whatever, but it just blows my mind how ♥♥♥♥♥♥' horrible it is. I mean, it's consistently annoying.Why? Why is it so bad? If all these problems were changed then we'd have a great quintilogy of GTA games, but, history is history, and we might as well try to count GTA 4 as, you know, the last in the series, and leave this awful piece of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ alone, as it stands today as one of the biggest ♥♥♥♥-ups of all time.Thank you for listening, good night.The ending sucks too."

Online functionality. Putting aside the current average load times of getting into the online game being 1.6-3 minutes for people with top-tier gaming PC's that have SSD's, the state of the GTA servers as of right now are a horrendous mess, as anyone that played the game on console (or even watched videos of others doing so) for more than 3 hours can attest to. The problems from there has not been dealt with for the PC version.Disconnect after network failure after server outage after connection issues after time-outs after server overloads, Rockstar continues their behavior of not knowing how to host proper servers. Even after delaying the PC release a multiple times for several months and perhaps more importantly, giving out fat bonuses to people who pre-order weeks before release to massively help them gain a better idea of the incoming traffic, they still fail horrendously to offer any kind of steady service when the online aspect of the game is concerned. It is however, made much worse by how the multiplayer is constructed around clumsy lobby systems with ZERO flexibility. Go through the effort of creating a heist and wait for players to fill the lobby, play 95% of the mission and have someone disconnect? MISSION CANCELLED, LOBBY CLOSED DOWN, CREATE A NEW GAME MANUALLY AND WAIT FOR PLAYERS TO RE-JOIN TO START AT SQUARE 1 AGAIN. Let someone join mid-game to replace him? Pause the heist itself and give the disconnected player time to rejoin? Create an AI partner to take his place? Nope, back to the 2 minute loading screens with you. Over. And Over. And Over Again.------------------------------------------------------------------2. System functionality. Memory leaks, physics glitches that causes crashes, black screens, FPS spikes, blue-screens, graphic-driver crashes and  cases of just plain bad optimization where laptops would have the game run off their integrated GPU's first before checking for any 'external' ones. GTA V has them all and It is a very depressing fact to face after all those months upon months of waiting for the game to be, and I quote: ""As polished as possible""-----------------------------------------------------------------3. Cheaters. On both offline AND online, the number of cheaters have been routinely going up in terms of being spotted by the community and they show little to no signs of slowing down:Due to the manner that Rockstar handles hackers (by slowly detecting them and putting them in queue to only be in games with other cheaters), they can cause MASSIVE amounts of havoc, most of which end up being beyond repair and going outside the control of Rockstar themselves due to the dynamic nature of the game. The most acute symptom of this very serious issue is the server stability for where these hackers roam. As seen in the video, the hacker spammed UFO's and caused insane amounts of lag to happen due to flooding the host with collission data, vehicle spawns and teleports while also flooding other players with money drops. The much more chronic results are perhaps more damaging as money can trade hands in so many ways. Be it, being dropped on the street, have someone get mugged, spend it on cars & other items and re-sell/give them away.. The list goes on and most of these things, Rockstar can't reliably keep record of and this isn't even where the issues stop either.There are also other more logistical things to keep track of. For example: They have to dedicate a number of their servers to actually put hackers on, meaning they are redirecting company resources to let hackers roam around instead of focusing these efforts on contributing to a more positive experience for the non-offending players. Even then, hackers are allowed to purchase new accounts and keep on creating massive amounts of havoc as punishment is lingering at best and there are no immediate counter-measures to deal with these situations.-----------------------------------------------------------------4. System Design.If you were to ask me what personally disgusts me the most about this game, It has to be without the shadow of a doubt, the ""Bad Sport"" system. How does it work? It bans you from the regular multiplayer (including private sessions with your friends), separating you from everyone else if you blow up other player's cars, leave online games early or simply get reports.Sounds like a necessary thing on paper with GTA being what it is, but oh the cancer that can be find if you observe it more closely. Here are 4 scenarios where the game will punish you and cut out your ability to play Online:a) Defend yourself from someone trying to drive-by you in an armored kuruma by blowing them up with a grenade: You're a bad sport.b) Stay AFK in a tank or some other heavy vehicle and have people drive under you with their own cars and explode as a result: You're a bad sport.c) Have your game crash during a multiplayer session due to GTA V's notorious memory leak: You're a bad sport.d) Own a couple of guys in fair death-matches or similar over the thousands of hours you spent in GTA V and have them spam reports against you with no legitimacy to them whatsoever: You're a bad sport.-----------I thought this was a beta thing at first, perhaps a myth or something exclusively on the console.. But one faithful day when I just finished a mission and was outside my apartment, fiddling with my settings, a guy rams into my car from behind using an armored kuruma and proceeds to try and mow me down with an SMG. I pull out a sticky bomb, slap it onto his windshield, drive away and proceed to detonate the bomb as he continues trying to kill me. Boom, he dies along with his Armored Kuruma (which is nigh impossible to only kill the players within using guns)... And:YOU HAVE BEEN FLAGGED AS A BAD-SPORT. Bye bye playing with friends, bye bye actual multiplayer (as everyone who is a bad sport just waits their time out or jumps onto another account/plays offline), bye bye GTA Online as a whole. The first ban you'll get will be 2-3 days (48-72 hours) that cannot be reduced (used to be possible by getting awards, etc, not anymore), next one will be weeks, then months, then years and they will be that much more easy to get after your first one. The timer can be extended if you continue being a ""Bad sport"" by blowing up people's cars and It will very frequently get stuck as well, sometimes even resetting if you do certain jobs, missions or activities. It is one of THE most hated 'functions' of GTA V Online and Rockstar does absolutely NOTHING about it.It is even a walking contradiction itself as the design goal of it is to dissuade people from doing, and I quote here: ""Doing Unsanctioned Mayhem"". The problem here is that THERE IS NO SYSTEM OR DETECTION METHOD IN-PLACE TO EVEN REMOTELY DETERMINE IF A CERTAIN MAYHEM WAS SANCTIONED OR NOT IN THE GAME.Now Rockstar have also recently broken the game even further with FPS killing patches.Just.. Ugh."

I still find GTA VC is better for setting, soundtrack, story and GTA SA the most fun gameplay wise but that could just be nostalgia. Looks like the Singleplayer Expansion/DLC is never coming. Large areas like the casino, race track, prison etc are all well modeled but they remain unused and inaccessable.  As many have already said it's a total ♥♥♥♥ show online. Load times are absurdly long and frequent, UI is crap, theres no server browser and no modded server support.The key element of the game (it's the title for christ sake) is stealing cars, but guess what: You cant keep them in online, they must be purchased. Items worth having online require ridiculous amounts of grinding due to low rewards for missions and any new cars, boats, planes are added at extremely high prices to sell Shark Cards. There isnt enough to do, or enough fun to be had to justify the time required to buy said items without microtransactions.The games anti-cheat system is pretty much non-existant. Cheaters/Hackers run rampant killing players and/or spewing cash.  Seems kind of baron of things to do online with friends once you've completed the Heists.I really don't care about MP in a GTA game, a token mode allowing friends to jump in and do co-op in single player would have been much better (You already have 3 protagonists doing missions together!). I sincerely hope MP's influence is minimal on the development of future titles (Bully 2, GTA VI, RDR 3) but unfortunately that's highly unlikely."

If you have no intention on playing GTAO then the game is fine.GTAO on the other hand is completely terrible. Rockstar does not care in the slightest about the player experience and only wants to sell as much shark cards as possible. The grind is completely designed for that. One or two missions may be fun the first two or so times you do them but after that it all blends into the same monotonous mush. The game is also completely saturated with cheaters that Rockstar will do nothing about because blowing up every player in a session, trapping players in cages or teleporting players into the middle of the sea is fine with Rockstar. The only cheats they might on occassion do something about are money cheats because if you're cheated money then you don't need to buy a Shark Card.Too much effort is needed to have some bit of fun in this game and nine times out of ten it will be ruined because someone decides it will be funny to spam explosions on you with their cheat menu."

The constant delays and hype of the PC version was laid to rest when it finally saw its release on the 14th of April. As for the review, I shall be brief so as to be as less time consuming as possible. GTA V offers vibrant visuals, a modern yet enjoyable plot consisting of a mixture of reality and satire. It also offers replayability due to its vast counterpart; GTA Online and a living, breathing environment in the streets of Los Santos and Blaine County. Aside from the main plot, the game maintains its entertainment standard by offering its players with a variety of tasks, missions, random quests and activities.PC users that may not be as up to date can also try this as the game itself is optimized in a way to deliver utmost performance while maintaining its graphical fidelity. I must say, this is pretty much the only AAA game that deserves a praise in the recent scenario as minimal bugs have been found and those discovered are being eliminated by Rockstar. As said before, I've been brief - very brief in fact. It doesn't matter as to what kind of games you like. This is a must buy and shall remain one for years to come. 10/10 indeed!!"

Not only does mean that the game isn't really on a discount, it also means that you probably won't be able to refund it in case something goes wrong or if you change your mind because of the unrefundable micro transaction along with it. I preorded this game before it came out, but for players who do not currently own it and are considering it, I would probably wait until this is over. Hopefully Rockstar will see how angry the Steam community is about this and sort it out. Until then, I would suggest waiting.

How’s the weather in Los Santos?Do you remember how we met back in 2015? I’ve just met Franklin, Michael and Trevor and spent way too much time with them. My brother contacted me and asked me to join his online session, that’s when we two met each other. I remember like it was yesterday… You stood there, looking like a junkie-prostitute with strong similarities to the King of Pop face-wise. I liked you from the first moment. I liked everything about you, your style, your make-up, your eff-you-all attitude. You were everything I never was. + I didn’t see you for a long time then. Somehow a new character was there, resembling the more „real life me“ in Los Santos but I went back to you when I found you again in 2017. I just couldn’t forget you. You got a new haircut, tried a few new hair colors, new make up, new clothes. You even got a few tattoos, I liked you even more.  - I always wondered what you eat. Do you remember how often we checked out the restaurants in Los Santos? We couldn’t find one single open restaurant so I took you to a 24/7 store to buy a snack and some beers. You often told me that you would love to try the food of Burger Shot, Cluckin Bell or our favorite: Lucky Plucker. And you were sad for days when you found the closed restaurants again, that broke my heart every single time. - And I wondered how you stay in shape. I remember back in the 90s, there were a few gyms around San Andreas. I can’t believe they‘re all out of business now.- Do you remember how often you told me, that you felt so fooled because you only found a few actual stores? How often did you stand in the streets, watching the shop windows just to find the entrance closed? You were happy to try new clothes in different stores but you complained that those stores all looked the same inside. You felt strange when you couldn’t enter most of the buildings you saw.- Do you remember when you called me hysterically crying at 3am in the morning because you saw a guy spawning a tank out of nowhere? We laughed so much about it when we moved away from those people. + We spent hours and hours just to look at everything. You never understood why I was so fascinated by the fast food restaurants, hell you even laughed at me for checking out all the trash in the streets. You showed me all your favorite places in Los Santos and I truly loved them. Everything in your city is so damn beautiful! The cars, the landscapes, the sea, even the trash and the rain. - I often wished I had brought my own music with me since the current radio stations in Los Santos are so bad, wow, I still can’t believe it. I liked the LS Rock Radio and Radio Los Santos but what happened to the stations playing metal? There are too many boring radio stations, but that’s just my opinion. The LS Rock Radio will still do for a while I guess.+ Do you remember the Arena War times? Wow, just wow! That was fun! + Do you remember our first visit in the casino? We lost all the money lol. And you wanted that 6 something million dollar apartment, I could hardly hold you back from wasting even more money. + You have a few great modern apartments everywhere in the city, I wonder if I can stay at one of your places again when I come for a visit again? - OMG, do you remember the strip club? I hope they won’t let people of young age in. I mean, who cares right? There’s still nobody checking the age of the people on the streets in LS. + Haha, do you remember how I got motion sickness when you let me drive once? (In-car view) I could go straight to bed right after that. Loved the realism of LS! Los Santos could have been the best city ever! Unfortunately I don’t like seeing you sad and lonely after a night out. You always seem a bit depressed that none of the restaurants are open, I hate seeing you like that, girl. I’m glad that the landscapes calm you down a bit every time. I think, when more stores come to LS, it will be THE city to live in. I would also see a variety of shops. Do you know what would be the ultimate thing in LS? To have the possibility to buy furniture and decorations for those apartments and houses. It would also be awesome to be able to change the wall colors and stuff like that. Hell, I would move to you in a minute. Annie, I hope to see you again soon. Stay safe and don’t do stupid things please, LS is a great place to live, even when there are still some things missing. All the best!Love,your friend C."

Apparently,it’s (one of) the best game that I’ve ever played.That I myself playing gtaiii since I was a kid left me unforgettable memories. Pity those days are gone.	Enough with nostalgia,as usual, I’m not gonna talk about how the story goes or analyse the characters within our 3 protagonist.There are plenty of articles on the internet.	Anyways, apart from the long loading,which is really frustrating,it only took me a few minutes to immerse myself in this open and non-real digital city. I do enjoy my free roaming and exploring.	Later did I know the fact that there is no such city in a movie that we can see a world so detailed like Los Santos or even live to be so overwhelmed by its noise, loneliness and deprivity.	And, Rockstar rocks.They made the best story and the best city there ever is.No one can deny.			    The last time I ever saw the characters in games such full of fresh and blood were in The Call Of Duty Modern Warfare series – Ghost, Soap,Price,etc. And now, here.	 	You can see Los Santos is an imaginary city based on Los Angeles,but who are the prototypes of the Michaels three?Guess we’ll never have to find out;	ThreeMan Army against the whole world and became billionaires.	American Dreams.	Anyway,Roaming,fighting crimes, killing innocent,heisting,paparazzing,air force,tank,sports,motor sports,American Truck Simulator,Uber taxi driver,etc and even have sex.	That size of game files doesn’t fail its content, Gtav is a true masterpiece.	Violence is the soul of the game,It has never changed.	Just as violent as the story can be , instead of the NPCs, in Online Mode the perpetrators may be as far as the malicious players themselves(hacker) or perhaps the officials who ban normal players who never cheat(of course hackers deserves to be banned for good).	I can relate to how our prides are being deprived,how hackers mess with us by exploding our vehicles with us in it,how we get banned for no reason. Therefore,we send out our complaints and curse whoever there is to hell. It’s not a bad way actually. On the contrary,how else are we supposed to do to make them hear us out more effectively?	But violence in real life isn’t the end, it seldom is the solution ,maybe it works fine in games.we can’t play fire with fire, it’s us who get burned in the end.	To Michael, Trevor, Franklin. Life has never been easy on them ,nor it is fair and just.Sometimes we are just like them,no matter how upstart we think we are , how we consider ourselves above the crowd,reality just slaps right into our face till we realize we are weightless, of little importance,like ants,except,many of us are lucky we have someone who loves us.	Therefore do yourself a favor,avoiding trouble is advisable,actively leave this session if there are hackers. So a dilligent bee like me ,I’d go registering as a CEO and steal vehicles then sell them .Speaking of which, a friend of mine has recently purchased some warehouse and started his own bussiness.How envy I’m of him since a CEO in GTAV is the best thing I could do, or rather,I m not really suited to run a bussiness.	The title may be the best describtion of it ,maybe not even close. I really enjoyed my time in this digital city with the other 3 of my friends, with whom I stayed up till late in the night heisting the pacific bank to grind currency and talking about trifles.

Gta 5 has also a beautiful, expertly realised open world who despite appearances isn't that small at all , a lot of things to do and areas to explore. One of the things that annoys you in Gta 5 is the amount of hackers you have to face every day in most encountered sessions but at the end of the day you can live with that .PROS + :-Fun, enjoyable and well written story.-A lot of missions to play either with friends or alone.-Beautiful graphics.-Gorgeous open world.-Heists.-Good customization for cars.-Characters are awesome.-Impressive degree of freedom.-First-person camera.CONS - :-Not that great MM.-Large number of hackers.-Character customization could be better.-Not enough choices that affect the gameplay further on the story mode.In few words Gta 5 it's an amazing and fun game without doubt , it's like a next-gen remaster of what we have experienced and played so far. You can spend a large amount of hours playing with friends and you still will find new things to do every day . It begs to be played all over again especially when you have company.

I like to load up GTA O and cruise around, do the occasional mission, and on the blue moon where three of my buddies are also on, MAYBE we will do some missions.I can't recommend this game because it's Rockstar's Magnum Opus II: It is them telling everybody exactly how they will develop their future projects. There was no Single Player expansions. There was no addition of new towns or map changes. There are barely no interiors, or fast food. I believe this game might have as many 'In door' areas as GTA 2, a top-down isometric game which almost entirely, due to the perspective, takes place outside on the streets. Its comedy was already dated when it came out- it felt much like Rockstar as a company: Old and tired. Rockstar stripped everything out of Max Payne 3 which made it Max Payne- an intriguing story, good characters, dark comedy and a very dark satire on Film-Noir. Similarly, with their OWN IP, Rockstar has managed to strip out of GTA what made it fun. Shark Cards are disgusting. Lack of SP additions and updates are appaling. Load Times, server latency, etc.. Are so awful that you'll spend as much time loading as you are playing. I am also playing this with a 1070GTX at only 1080P, so it is not an issue of poor hardware. Every weapon in a category feels the same, and the ones that feel unique only do so because of how stupidly underpowered and weak they are. Rewards for completing heists, jobs, etc.. are not scaled to the new content. There have been no new heist missions or series since its initial heist update.This game, upon its release, was shabby and I was eager to give it lots of breathing time to update and polish. After a couple of years now, it's clear Rockstar decided to take a very poor direction. This game is anti-consumer."

Gunplay in particular were pretty terrible as you do a lot of it and it's always the same: aim for the head of every enemy. Buying weapons and upgrades is pointless as a headshot from any gun is an instant kill and you're handed new weapons for free during the campaign. Driving is what you'll be doing most, and both the open-world and mission driving sections are dull. There's a lot of back and forth to the same locations, which is somewhat alleviated by the taxi service, but during missions, you'll be required to drive or fly from one side of the map to the other with no gameplay pressure present. There'll be some nice dialogue between the characters, but not much else. Even worse are the chase sequences which feel extremely scripted, with your target always a minimum distance away from you so that the characters can finish their conversations. There's just .The characters are well written and enjoyable, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are there some pacing and thematic issues. After Trevor and Michael are reunited, about 30 missions of random antagonists and heists occur for no particular reason, halting all development of the main plot until the last ten or so missions, so about half of the total campaign's missions are pointless. Thematically, GTA 5 is just an American satire, which is good and all, but it doesn't really say much, and the endings are character-centric and hint toward ""cash isn't everything,"" but there's a lot of pointless material that doesn't really say much of anything.There are some fun and interesting moments in GTA 5, and the world is real nice to look at, but it's all surface level with not much depth to it."

I played the game for about 300 hours on PS3 so I went in knowing what to expect for the most part but I was nervous of Rockstars past reputation of PC ports. Needless to say this one feels very well done, there are still places where you notice controller priority most noteably the menus,UI, and aerial controls but most of this can either be learned realitively quickly or altered in key customization.Overall the game runs extremely smoothly, I have a higher end PC so it's hard for me to grasp optimization issues but I will say I can run on max settings with a 3 gig GTX 780 and a i5 4670k.There has been the odd burp or glitch while playing with friends which did become an issue through some missions, one time a friend wouldn't load in another time a friend crashed but it's hard to say what targetted this and if it is a common issue. I can say for myself I have not once crashed or had any sort of game breaking bug.

Its sales speak for itself. This game's scale is pretty massive and runs fairly well on a decent PC. Rockstar has really gone all out on this game. It's practically endless to the things you can do in this game. You'll have hundreds of hours sunk into this masterpiece and still find things to laugh at, things to learn, secrets, and memorable moments. Just exploring the entire map is something in and of itself. I've done it all on foot now. The story is something you'd see in the movie theaters. Micheal, Franklin, Trevor, and almost every side character is absolutely perfect, AAA, just blockbuster stuff. Micheal is a washed-up bank robber, now family man clinging onto stories of his criminal mastermind ways. Franklin is a young, loyal, earner who wants to be bigger than just some gang banger in the hood. And Trevor... Trevor.. Trevor is something truly special. Honestly, I've played the game so much and all the other games in the series that I understand how R* pushes the satire of current events and pop culture to the extreme. In ways that some would see as going too far. Trevor is all that and more in one person. The dialog between these guys in and out of missions/heists is one of the pillars of what makes this game's campaign so strong. You are able to switch between all three pretty much at your leisure as the game progresses. The graphics are stunning and hold up to this day. With mods, it goes even further beyond!. From the busy city life of Los Santos to the vast, rural area of Blaine County. It's truly something to see, both during the day and at night. Characters, cars, animals, and environments are all worthy of greatness for detail. Gameplay wise I'd say it's the most fluid and versatile in the series. GTA IV felt like you were a tank and to an extent, it feels like that in GTA V as well. But, it's better. I do miss the ragdoll effects GTA IV did have, however. Also, the vehicle body damage was far better in the previous title. Rather than having one weapon of each type, like before. You have a wheel that has every weapon, in every category available to you, if you're able to obtain them. There is an abundance of weapons to be used, vehicles too. You can also customize both weapons and cars pretty in-depth. Music. Well. GTA is known for having probably the best soundtracks of all time, ever. Nothing really needs to be said there. Online is really something else entirely. You basically level up and fight your way to being a notorious kingpin-overlord-super god. You can buy bunkers, facilities, offices, drug factories, nightclubs, casinos, submarines to satellites that shoot lasers. You can do just about everything you could do in the main story and more AND you can do it with like 30 other people online. It's just never-ending mayhem and provides for a truly great and unique experience every time you go to play it. The only thing that really does suck is the amount of modder/hackers in the game. R* says they do ♥♥♥♥, but it's evident that they do not. The only real question is, why aren't you playing this game?tl;dr: 10/10"

However, that is not what this review is about. Most of you reading this are here to see if this is ok for your child. The straight and honest answer is entirely not. Unlike most who have made a review, I have taken the time to play this game. Now I don't mean I played it for an hour or two hours, or even five hours. I have played the game in full and have experienced all of its content. Some reviewers before me say that Common Sense is only telling half-truths and that they are overreacting. If you took the time to play the game, you would realize they are not. I'm going to debunk some of reviews before me. Nothing personal, just the honest truth. A lot of parents on here say that they trust their child to stay away from the optional sexual content the game provides. Good for them. Trust is a good thing. However, we've all been teenagers and did you ever do something that your parents told you not to do? Think about it. We've all done it. A lot of reviewers say that all the sexual content is avoidable. That is NOT TRUE. Some of the material is avoidable, like the strip clubs which offers topless dancers or the fact that you can pick up prostitutes on the street and have intercourse with them in your car (it does show the scene without an option to skip). However, the story does have sex scenes that bare all. One mission in particular, you are working as freelance paparazzi taking pictures of celebrities. Next thing you know you're actively taking photos of an outdoor sex scene (again without the option to skip). Some say that it has an educational value in the form of a stock market. There is, in fact, an in-game stock market but let me elaborate. The stock market is in place for you to abuse it by killing the oppositions customers and employees to raise your stock price in turn making a ""killing"" on the stock market. Oh and I can't forget about this. Some time into the story, you play as Trevor and to continue on you have to actively take part in torture. You pull some teeth, break some kneecaps, and apply a bit of electricity. This is unavoidable and must be done to continue on through the game.

Consider this a warning. If you want to simply enjoy the campaign, it's excellent on PC. There is no shame getting this game for the story alone however if you plan to play multiplayer, you are better just playing Online on console. The multiplayer is in a middle of a massive decline. Cheaters own the servers. Bot spam is extremely bad and Rockstar Games still expects you to buy into their crappy Sharkcard system. It's pretty much a scam, they aren't doing much if anything about it. So, if you expect to have fun in multiplayer, here's my advice: cheat. If you don't, you'll hardly ever be able to play in a public lobby. It's best to not even bother trying it out."

Instead of playing as one individual you play as three that you can (for the most part) swap between at will.  Each character has their own skills (which you can improve through use) and their own unique special skill.  For example, one of the characters is extremely good at driving and therefor when his unique ability is used it allows him to slow time and pull of incredible stunts while in a vehicle.The first person view is also an exciting addition; while using this the game actually takes on the full experience of a FPS, gun sights and all.  Though this wasn't a feature that I personally felt was needed, once I actually started playing with it I realized that it was a lot of fun and the developers did not skimp out on making it a well-rounded and entertaining experience.On a final note, I very much enjoyed the story of the game.  It had its twists and turns and I actually felt very much in-tune with the main characters.  Several times I got pumped up in real life as if I were actually there robbing a bank or pulling off some other incredible stunt.I would recommend this game to everyone who enjoys the Grand Theft Auto series and what that means.  You might want to avoid it if you're ten years old unless you have some kind of an early warning system for when your parents are coming."

The price is still pretty expensive and I would recommend buying it when it drops lower unless you can't wait to hijack a military jet or you are a hardcore GTA fan. I would also suggest playing this with a gamepad instead of a mouse except in some instances of shooting in moving vehicles. Ok, now time for the pros and cons:PROS- Good balance in gameplay time and character development between the 3 characters.- Graphics is very good and I would strongly recommend playing it at at least High settings, Try limiting the drop to Normal settings as it can really make a whole lot of difference.- Story is great and interesting except for a few loophole plots. Nonetheless, it really got my attention most of the time and future DLCs will definitely make it better- Voice acting is superb, I love the voice casts in this. They really suit their own characters, bravo R*- Director mode is pretty fun, its a PC exclusive and it enables the players to create their own settings (there are limitations though such as dialogues etc) and place characters that can be unlocked during story mode. I usually use it to wreck havoc in the game lolCONS- Online. As with many others, I find it hard to play an online mission without meeting someone who uses cheat. Sometimes, you will spend so much time looking for a party to play in and the missions ends in a blink of an eye.- Garage bug. Yup, I am one of the many victims who lost their heavily upgraded vehicles in their own garage after exiting the game. It doesn't happen all the time but you do get the fear of when this bug will strike next on your beloved carsAll in all, this game is still great on its own. I would suggest GTA fans to get this. For neutrals, maybe get at a lower price."

Do not buy this game solely for the online play!In-game currency is unreliable and disappears at random, bans are handed out to innocent players while game-ruining hackers run rampant, the servers still feel like a day-one release with extremely long loading screens, Rockstar has some of the worst customer support ever, and they use scummy business practices like claiming the game is on sale shortly after artificially inflating the price. GTA: Online is a whole new format of Pay2Win. Even moderately decent guns and vehicles are reserved for people who hack or use their mother's credit card to buy in-game currency. To achieve anything legit without spending a fortune, you'll have to waste enough hours grinding repetitive races and linear heists to make a MMO player squeamish.I've had tons of fun playing with friends, and the single-player experience is one of the best I've ever seen, just know what you're getting into before handing your money over to these scumbags.For the record, I'm not salty over a ban or anything.

But we decided not to.Going to court will take at least few months of our time and huge amount of efforts, and, at best, we’ll get absolutely nothing.Spending time just to restore status quo is really unproductive, and all the money in the world can’t compensate the loss of time.So, we decided to agree with their claims and we’re stopping distribution of OpenIV.It was a hard decision, but when any modding activity has been declared illegal, we can’t see any possibilities to continue this process,unless top management of Take-Two company makes an official statement about modding, which can be used in court.""Probably due to the fact that singleplayer is better than online, and Take-Two want to push people to online to they can sell their microtransactions, so ♥♥♥♥ them."

I'm running this on an overclocked G3258 + GTX 750 Ti (a bit below recommended), played story mode 30FPS(half vsync) on very high, and currently playing at 45FPS average after configuring the graphics settings with help from .The single player mode has a lot of content, the main story itself may take around 31 hours to complete. It has enjoyable side missions from strangers and freaks, and has a big and detailed map to explore. It also has a  wherein you can mess around with the actors (animals & special characters) that you unlock from the game; lets you play with different characters, set time of day, weather, etc. and spawn on different locations around the game world. is getting bigger with each DLC update. Activities/jobs include heists, races, adversary modes, contact missions, parachuting, etc. I won't recommend that you challenge yourself finding randoms who can stick around until you complete a setup/heist because it will always be better to find friends or a stable group. Races will most likely require you to spend on a fully upgraded vehicle if custom vehicles are enabled. Adversary modes offer interesting ways(entourage,slip-streaming,kill-quota) to go up against another group of players. Freemode activities include events like criminal damage, checkpoints, king of the castle. etc.My most recent 200 hours were spent switching between SecuroServ CEO/associate and Motorcycle club president/road captain; doing VIP missions and hauling in crates solo while waiting for friends (may get a bit grindy and boring), and then selling business products once they are online. This recent  has been very enjoyable. It gives access to earn some GTA$, it can get a bit heated and exciting when you have to defend products; it is even a lot more forgiving compared to CEO warehouse sale where you can lose everything you collected for hours if your associate disconnects or another player in the lobby decides to destroy your shipment.Steam says that I've played this game for 598 hours; about 74 hours of that was spent on story mode, 418 hours was spent online, and the remaining 106 hours on the loading screen (this actually surprised me but it includes, maybe less than six hours for the benchmark runs and some video editing on rockstar creator). The game is not without bugs nor online cheaters but with GTA V, you are given options on how you want to play. You may opt to play on a friends-only session, an invite-only session, or even a solo session. I recommend gathering enough friends so you can enjoy the full experience on a public session.Playtime as of writing: 598 hours = 74(story) + 418(online) + 106(misc)I can recommend this game even if you only want to play the single player alone or even if you only want to play online. Of course it will always be best if you get the most out of both story mode and online, and even buy it at a discount!(Historical lowest price -50% )"

GTA 5 is a massive open world game, there are two modes: the regular/story game... and the mode where hackers ruin your day aka ""Online play"".Honestly there's so much content I don't know how I'm going to do the game justice in this review, but I'll do my best. (Also I'm basically going to ignore online in this review. Although it's deserving of it's own review for how much content is there...) Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect going into GTA 5. GTA was the franchise that my parents banned me from playing back in the 2000's, and this is the first title of the franchise. I see why they banned me from playing it, it's definitely not appropriate for younger kids You play as Three different characters: Franklin, Michael, and Trevor. You get to experience the story from three different characters perspectives at once. My initial reaction was ""Okay, who's this guy, and why do I care?"" And I didn't... at first... but after about 45 hours of gameplay I developed stockholm syndrome... even for the crazed psychopath Trevor Franklin is just getting into the ""crime business"", Michael is trying to get out, and Trevor is just here to make meat bicycles out of anyone who looks at him funny.The three unlikely allies eventually are forced to team up, or help each other out of tight spaces  The whole game is kind of a butterfly effect... but that's video game story telling for you.At the end of the game I was given a choice... and I'm mad because I want to know what the other two choices would have done to the game. But there's no way I have enough life in me to make a new game and play through the whole thing again!! Oh man, this review is going to run out of space... The gameplay is more detailed then the freaking story!I finished the main story and there's still an overwhelming amount of stuff to do. Normally once you complete the main story of an open world game, you've done around half of the game, or at least feel like it. I feel like I've barely made a dent! You know, when approached by a friend who doesn't play video games, and asked ""Which game would you play if you could only play one game for the rest of your life"". I typically choose games where there's a huge amount of replay value, or it's moddable, or it's a sandbox game.Minecraft, WoW, GW2, Skyrim... in that order. But there's so much in GTA 5 I very well might add it to the list of games that never really seems to end."

Sure, there is a LOT of modders and tryhards who are out there to make things much harder, but you can just leave or go passive then.I will admit that something annoying about the game is the fact that it is very obviously a P2W type of situation especially with some of the cars and planes alongside other features like the orbital strike that demolishes whoever it hits.The new casino update however, is a very easy way to make those who don't want to pay for shark cards have a chance at getting rich. One thing I found so much fun on the PC version is that you have access to singleplayer mods.I'm not talking mod menu wise, I mean stuff like the zombie apocalypse mod or the superhero mods which are pretty fun to play around with.Overall though, Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece of a game, and I hope that the next GTA can be even better."

GTA 5 singleplayer hasn't really changed except a few minor graphical improvements and it can run super smoothly with a decent PC. If you're going to get this game though, you're probably getting it for online. And that, I can't recommend. There's hordes of modders that can crash your game, imprison you, and overall make your life a living hell at the press of a button. On top of that, there's plenty of griefers that are willing to ruin your experience for no gain at all. The online community for this game is corrupted by modders and griefers, and there is no way to escape that unless you play GTA Online alone. Ironic. Side note: Rockstar will do nothing about modders if you report them unless you make a big fuss about it. But by that time, you're already getting griefed by another one."

(Just Cause 3 is a close second) I think the GTA series as a whole is fantastic, but i have to give this game a negative review for the following reasons.1. The Online mode is a micro-transaction hell, but if you avoid paying for anything with real money. Online is still very fun for doing races, stunt races, and heists with friends.2. Rockstar did a great job making the PC port of this game, but any issues that alot of people are still having have never been fixed since day 1. They really don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about fixing the technical problems for PC.3. TakeTwo interactive (The company that owns rockstar) has sent a cease & desist to the creators of OpenIV the backbone for modding in GTA V and GTA IV. So if you're looking to mod the singleplayer, you're basically out of luck unless you already have it. (See this video for more information:  )4. There have been an increasing number of people getting banned in Online for no reason whatsoever, and when you get banned from Online, that's it. There's like a 0.01% chance you'll get unbannedI personally don't really care for mods, apart from the mods that improve the graphics, but until the state of modding the single-player is back to normal, i cannot reccomend this game in the slightest."

No longer supported so what you get is it.  No new content.  Want to know what playing GTA Online is like?  The significant portion of the GTAV value?  Well...Imagine that you live in a really crappy neighborhood, bullies and criminals everywhere. The authorities are there too, but they just sit on every corner eating donuts, getting paid for doing absolutely nothing. Yet despite all this, the cost of living keeps going up, its harder to get anything at all, but you resolve to work harder.Everyday you leave your crappy home and commute to and from work, always looking over your shoulder, worried someone will do something to mess with you.Today, you're somewhat happy, its payday and you have your pay in your pocket, finally something to show for your hard work.  But then, someone assaults you, but they don't rob you, they plant a counterfeit bill in your pocket and glue a gun in your hand.  They then kick you into the street, and the authorities spot you.  They know what happened, they know it's a problem that happens a lot.  Still they come after you, shouting ""Criminal! Drop the gun!""  You explain you can't. You show them your hand, it's like they don't listen. They beat you, just repeating ""Criminal! Criminal!"" After you're down and beaten, they find the counterfeit 20, they take it, but they take your all your pay as well, ""evidence, it all must be counterfeit,"" they say, ""but we'll let you off since you pay our salary, but stop counterfeiting money, you filthy criminal!""  They kick you one last time, then go back to their donuts, while the bully who framed you is left alone across the street laughing to themselves.That's how it feels to be a legitimate player  in GTA Online.  If a hacker messes with you, Rockstar will go after you, the victim, and punish you to the full extent they can, you can play for 500 hours and earn $10,000,000 and if someone does something to you, they can reset your progress to zero, or ban you at their whim.  They don't have to provide any evidence, they don't have to show any proof. If you protest you get copy paste replies, telling you you're a cheater and threatening you to stop cheating and breaking their rules, and then they close your tickets.  Why buy or play a game, where any progress can be reset for any reason, without any proof?  You shouldn't.Rockstar is the real criminal here, it's a crime to treat loyal paying customers like this.  But they do it happily."

There is really a lot to say about this game. I started playing online in 2015 and back then there was not really that much to do. You could do few heists to earn money and buy some cars / planes and that was it. But back then I did not really care about the money and just used to drive / fly around the map with friends and do random stuff and it was great. Rockstar soon started to add more DLC to the game which added new things to do, more vehicles, more mods etc... And I think this is great. Yes there are people complaining about every new DLC and in some parts I agree with them (adding MK2 oppressor was not best idea lmao.) But just imagine that there was no new DLCs, after some time people would get bored and just quit because there would be nothing to do. Yes Rockstar sometimes add stupid stuff to the game but atleast they are doing something for 8 year old game.Public servers are random. Sometimes you get on server with lot of griefers and sometimes there is like 25 players and 0 griefers. Most of time you will meet players that dont care about you or are friendly.One more thing I dont really agree with is the prices of ingame vehicles / stuff. I think some items are really overpriced which makes them hard to get (for regular players.) Of course Rockstar is doing this on purpose to boost their Sharkcard sales or to make players grind much more.Anyway I would recommend this game, my review was mostly about the Online part of the game. Singleplayer is perfect so I did not cover it in this review."

I recieved (thankfully) only a temporary suspention from GTA Online, however, what was more infuriating was that my GTA Online character, something that I have probably spent the best part of 200 hours or more playing, was to be reset completely.  These Online bans or suspentions may not be appeald, so if, like myself, you are wrongfully banned, you do not even get the chance to fight your corner.

GTA Online is a Pay-To-Win-Cheater-Fest 4000 with flow-breakingly long loading into heists everytime there's a load screen, which is all the time, but single player is a lot of fun plus it has all the replayability that all the other GTA games do but with sweet graphics, great compatability, and an awesome 3-character gameplay system.

Vanilla GTA V is okay but thanks to the modding community it fleshed out into the game it was always supposed to be.  Rockstar laid a great foundation for videogamers and creative minds alike to produce a game with limitless entertainment.This recent C&D on the developers of OpenIV by Take Two is upsetting beyond words.

There's really nothing else like this, and anything that is like this will never live up to this. A lot of people on steam are whiny entitled babies. Here's a few things I'd like to debunk from playing this game for 500 hours. 1. Hackers are common. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones are rare, it happens. If you don't enjoy it just switch sessions. (Or play jobs I literally never see any hackers when I am out doing races, deathmatches, survivals, etc. They all frolic in free mode.)2. Anyone down here crying that they were banned for literally no reason saying ""I ground so hard for all that money!"" is probably lying trying to get un banned for their stupid ass cheating. I've played this game for years, and really the only way to get banned is dropping money for yourself/others. Or getting so many reports that rockstar actually does something about it. I have been friends with countless modders and hackers and they are pretty power drunk people most of the time if I'm honest. But sometimes they can make the session better if you're not a baby. If you start telling modders to ♥♥♥♥ off and that you're reporting them they ARE going to ruin your fun. If you don't like it that much find a new session, easy as Pause < Online < Find New Session. Or easy as One Two Three.3. You CAN legitimately afford the stuff rockstar markets. You want a Luxor Delux? Buy a hangar, buy regular Luxor, paint it gold. Badda Bing Badda Boom. Back in my days on PS3 I could probably make 200 grand a night grinding missions. All you need to get started is to buy a Bunker, I say the bunker because you don't need to also buy a warehouse like the CEO Offices. Normally people don't mess with gunrinning shipments. 90% of the time they destroy your stuff it's just for the sake of destroying your stuff to piss you off. Because people are like that. Whenever you want to sell mass amounts of goods, you're gonna need a few friends and there's plenty of guides on how to get a solo public session you can just invite your friends back to, then sell your stuff before anyone joins. 4. There's a lot to do in this game, I find myself patrolling free mode basically allll the time and I have personally gotten bored doing it. Many people do this and then get mad that they can't go inside perticular buildings, and do this and that, and give it a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Me and my friend were bored in free roam one time and I asked him if he wanted to play from versus missions and races and stuff. So we went and tried it out and we actually had a lot of fun. The rockstar created job lists are massive. And there's even a creator to make your own stuff which I have utilized many a times over the years.5. You don't need to buy everything, that isn't the goal. To say there's an end goal to GTA Online would be like saying there's a specific end goal for everyone in life. After you reach the max level 120 you just keep leveling. I am like level... probably 230 something now. I have everything I could ever want in GTA Online however, I find myself never using a lot of it. Some things are annoying to not have in GTA Online like a lot of guns/ammo. I have all the guns and tons of ammo for them all, and I sort of feel very vaulnerable when I play on my alternate character which is only like level 70. (Back when he was level 20 it was hard fending off rocket spamming 3 Kdr players that stat pat.) GTA is just basically an open world crime game where the only objective is gaining a higher net worth.6. If you like cars it's a pretty good game, Open world, you're not limited to sports/race cars like some racing games. if you like pickup trucks or SUV's there's plenty of those for you to own. You can own up to 120 some cars and you have the freedom to do with them as you wish be it racing, drifting, or wrap the son of ♥♥♥♥♥ around a tree. You do you man. But as a car enthusiast GTA V is my favorite game. The guns and the planes, and the boats, and everything else is just a huge bonus when I don't feel like doing car stuff. 7. The developers are active, they kind of have to be though so it's not a surprise, but I find a lot of good games on steam develop very slowly and updates are few and far between. But Rockstar keeps it pretty up to date with new content. (Although it would be nice to see that content in Singleplayer like you guys used to *cough*) And uh, singleplayer. God it's been years since I played the story, but it's good, that's what all the hype and all the love came from in the first place and we can't forget what a great game this was. When it was released it was the benchmark for computer performance, can I run GTA V? GTA V Budget PC builds. This is really a classic game that I believe lived up and beyond it's predisessors. And don't give me that ""Oh but GTA IV had better AI and better car damage and it was more realistic!"" because yes GTA IV did have some details left out from GTA V, but overall this really didn't ruin the game and probably wasn't even noticed by most people until that guy on youtube made that GTA IV is better than GTA V video. (Which has 10 million views and people are making reaction videos to it.) But I can understand that they basically re-made the game from scratch. Unlike the Saints Row transition from III to IV. If you're going to copy and paste a game I am going to be upset that you removed details. But if you re-make the game from scratch and it's bigger/better. I can ignore some missing details like, how pedestrians stumble when they're pushed. Everyone is comparing their experince to value, I don't care about the money if I enjoyed this. If I ""randomly get banned"" I'd buy it again honestly. Rockstar has a lot on their hands to turn heads with GTA VI, and honestly I expect a heatwave similar to Call of Duty Advanced Warfare upon it's trailer release because PC gamers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spoiled and hop on mob mentality band wagons like Bad Dragon products. For example when they banished OpenIV. There was an influx of over 40,000 negative reviews in like 3 days. People just came to ♥♥♥♥ on GTA V and rockstar because everyone else was doing it and it was cool. If you ask me hackers make the game more fun in Online. You really just have to be creative. Before YOU leave a negative review think about if this is a game you'd really enjoy in the first place. Because it's not just a 'shooter'. You wanna play GTA V multiplayer with mods online? Get FiveM. It's great. And probably exactly what you want."

I've heard stories of people getting banned from GTA Online for seemingly no reason but I never ever thought I'd ever be subject to this treatment.

For YEARS I've been playing this game on and off and never even once have I accepted help from any hackers or modders. Never even once have I used any hacks or mods, whether it's in singleplayer or multiplayer. But today I got my account suspended and, while I'll be able to play again in a month, it won't be worth it as my characters progress, inventory and property will all have been reset. For absolutely no reason. I have submitted a ticket to Rockstar Support surrounding this issue but I doubt it'll show any form of results. If their support would manage to sort this out, I'll edit this review. Hell, I'd recommend this game with a word of warning: Beware the incompetence of the ones in charge here. TL;DR - Don't buy this game if you plan on playing online.

I could care less about the stupid shark cards however what really has me writing a negative review is the recent action Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) has taken against mods.  OPEN IV was something I came across fairly recently and I must say it is an excellent fix to getting around the hard-to-get files from GTA's core game.  One thing to note is that many single player mods (from which I have used) specifically don't let the user boot into their online persona thus returning the player back to story mode.  I have to admit that I've had trouble with R* in the past, but they should definitly take a second thought about take two and where it'll land their personal reputation.  Thanks for taking the time to read this m9, and like a shark, I think this whole thing is a bad idea-and for that reason, I'm out!"

Playing Grand Theft Auto V is never anything but pure gaming nirvana, whether you're playing through the 69 mission story, mingling with Strangers and Freaks, engaging in Hobbies and Pastimes or just pissing around in its enormously vast sandbox. There are fewer limits imposed on what you can do, with you now able to carry each and every weapon at once, making for some of the most glorious GTA rampages ever. There are also proper rampage missions, if you'd prefer to focus your vengeful wrath on deserving targets.Customisation options are also plentiful in GTA V, meaning you can pimp out your weapons with scopes, suppressors and skins, and pimp out your rides with spoilers, skirts, turbo injected engines and so on. The world really is your oyster. If you can think of it, you can probably do it in GTA V. Wanna spend time walking Franklin's dog Chop? It's possible. Just want to go on a killing spree? Go for it. Fancy scouring the ocean sea in a yellow sub? Do it. Base jumping? Yes. Strip clubs? Yup. Jetski racing? Definetly. The list goes on and on.

Oh boy, where to begin.I wish Rockstar would've stopped developing their game after last review but sadly they've added more content that speaks to me they really hate their own game. And how so?Your average opponent online is using flying cars and scooters with infinite homing rockets. The cheaters are also still part of the content and it's a bit funny that they are no longer the biggest problem. Recent popular cheats include occasionally everyone in a session getting teleported to a random players house where they blow up, the street is covered with random game models, or a player with level 8000 that doesn't take any damage spawn kills you repeatedly until you quit the game (because passive mode does nothing with them), which is of course great fun.I have to say if you are planning to coop all the online heists with your friends DON'T. With Casino heist you are forced to play prep missions in an online session just so that you can experience the great homing rockets that annihilate that garbage truck you need to slowly drive from point A to B.The amount of underestimation of players is also amazing. Casino heist starts by you driving ALL they way to the opposite side of the map and once you get there the objective was ""stolen"" and you have to drive all the way back to where you started from.The money grind in online is also so disgustingly slow that you probably have more fun just taking extra hours at work instead. The grind is also balanced like so: a daily random wheel of fortune can give you more money than grinding 3 hours of activities where other players can blow you up and you then earn nothing.Rockstar has also made it very clear that grind is all an online game should be until they find that point where they could get you spend more actual money on shark cards.Don't waste your time. Play something else + don't buy the next online.OLD REVIEW:Gta V is a solid single player experience. And I have had lots of fun in both single player and multiplayer. But today? I cannot recommend it to anyone if they are planning to play multiplayer.When it comes to multiplayer Rockstars ability to create working multiplayer systems is very amateurish. I tolerated the bad net code and awful connect logics, just because the content of the game was awesome. With the free dlc updates, it could be even better, could be. Recently the amount of cheaters online makes it downright unplayable. Be warned, they do not cheat to get money or items, they use whatever they can to ruin YOUR online session. Rockstar has clearly shown what the companys view is on the subject of this trolling. They dont care. As long as they still make money, its all fine.Next time Rockstar publishes a game, its your turn to show how much you care.If you do buy this game. Make sure you have friends who play it, and never ever stay in open sessions longer than you have to. Use private sessions and play coop with your friends."

I repeat, DO NOT buy the game at the very moment.Safety of yours is in danger by playing this game.The GTA Online is filled with hackers that can get your account terminated permanently via their mod menu.They can even install a malware to your computer if they want to.Rockstar you better fix this"

WHY? because I am that pissed off, i am that mad, after all the nonsense i heard about Rockstar doing a good port of this game, from different new sites, from different users, from different reviews, the game just DOESN'T WORK.maybe it's something real easy, something real simple, but if that's the case, then that represents how much Rockster screwed up.people need to know, YOU need to know, before you buy this game, that there is a chance that it just may not work, regardless of your machine, and regardless of what you do, the game is still broken.I may amend this review if Rockstar fixes the problem, but honestly i don't know how good the game would have to be to undo the amount of BS i've been put through.TL;DR DON'T TAKE THE RISK."

You might enjoy the game more than I did if you enjoy urban crime and poor grammar. Maybe watch a few videos of gameplay before buying. I bought it after beating RDR2, and ended up disappointed. RDR2 is simply the superior game in my opinion."

Paid mod menus are already attempting to add these options to their own menus. Please beware this could extend beyond GTAV/O and you risk compromising your PC in the near future.Do NOT purchase this. Avoid it at all costs.R* needs to release a new game with better security, but RDO doesn't inspire me too much about that..."
