5,Houtworm,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Houtworm91/,84,2,1,108.6,May,"12,","2,843",3,1,"Overcooked 2 is an amazingly chaotic management game for up to 4 players, chop the ingredients and cook them as fast as possible for a nice tip, There are a ton of recipes and surprising kitchens.The story is set in The Onion Kingdom, The Onion King read from an old book and he summoned these undead loafs of bread called the Unbread, They are hungry and will consume the entire Kingdom if they are not fed in time. You play as one of the many available chefs and it is your job to feed the Unbread to save the world. The story plays out trough some dialogue from the king after certain stages, The story is nothing special, but it is a funny universe and it should give you a laugh or 2.The Onion king his dog and all playable characters are extremely likable, They don't say much but they all look very funny, If you are a shark a mouse or something way crazier, It will have a friendly face. The enemies are a little disturbing but also quite funny, Undead loafs of Bread, It probably won't give you or your children nightmares.The game is mostly focused on multiplayer, Every single gamemode can be played with up to 4 players, Online, Local but also a mix of the 2. You also can play it solo, But you will control 2 chefs and have to switch between them to manage the kitchen. it is still the same game, A very chaotic experience, Coordinating with yourself is harder than it sounds.There is the Story mode, which brings you to an overworld where you can launch levels, You start in 1-1 and before you can start 2-1 you have to visit the castle and talk to the Onion King. There are 6 worlds in the main campaign, and every world has 6 levels. There is a ton of DLC, some free and some paid which bring a bunch of new worlds, levels, chefs and recipes to the table. Only the host needs the DLCs, You can play along if you just own the game and are in a multiplayer game.In the main Story you can also switch gamemodes, From Story which is the default, Practice which disables timers and Survival in which served meals add time to the timer. Next to the main Story mode there is Arcade mode, Which is just a random level from the main Story or one of the DLCs, It is a nice thing if you completed every single level with 4 stars. Then there is a Versus mode, In which 2 kitchens have to fight it out, It is always 2 versus 2, But you can play 1 vs 1 too by controlling 2 chefs.The gameplay is extremely hectic, Raw ingredients need to be chopped, Cooked, Baked, Blended, Steamed. Grilled, and mostly they need multiple steps to prepare, Then you need to combine all the prepared ingredients on a plate and deliver it as fast as possible. There are more recipes than I can count, It starts easy, But things get complex pretty fast. Good teamwork is essential for getting all the stars.Next to the obvious cooking you also have to wash the plates, make sure nothing burns, deliver the orders on time and make sure you don't mess up the ingredients. If you mess up a recipe you can throw it away, If it burns you have to grab the fire extinguisher and put out the fire before it spreads.The levels are even crazier, There are kitchens with a road running trough it, People dancing in a Conga line, trough it, or even kitchens on a few floating rafts in the middle of a river. There are kitchens which have moving parts, switch positions, have portals, buttons and even cannons to reach out of reach platforms.The graphics are adorable, It is simple but charming, Things you can interact will stay the same and are marked clearly. The decor is ever changing, You go to all kinds of restaurants, Indoor, Outdoor, On a river or high in the sky. The Soundtrack is very cosy and uplifting, But it gets tenser inside the levels as they progress, especially the last 30 seconds. It is a very nice fit, and each theme has its own soundtrack. Together it creates a very nice atmosphere that is fun and suitable for all ages.The game runs fine, There are just 2 things that bother me, First the game Crashes on controller connect, Which is especially awful for a multiplayer game. And secondly the Steam Cloud save is not working. Other than that the game runs very well I get a very nice 200-300 fps. Not a single problem next to the 2 forementioned things. The worst thing is that these are a long standing problems. And there doesn't seem to be any interest in actually fixing it.After you complete the story and all the DLC with 3 stars you can fight it out in Versus mode where you have to compete together with someone or solo against another kitchen. There is also Arcade mode, This will just pick a random level from the Story and DLC. There is no random generation, A lot of DLC, but even after completing everything the game remains a lot of fun, The human factor is just so unpredictable and it causes some very chaotic and funny situations.The game is fun but frustrating, Crazy and Chaotic. Blame your friends for burning the burgers, not preparing the mushrooms and throwing sushi on the road. It is a great game and certainly worth your money, Just be sure to backup your save files."

Just like the original, 2 is a chaotic party game where you and up to 3 friends work together to serve top-of-the-line dishes while coping with and overcoming terrible kitchen designs, bizarre situations and natural disasters. In sum, frantically fun.  Both Overcooked! games are great but I recall enjoying the first game more. The new features introduced in 2 were welcome but sometimes flawed and unnecessary. Somehow the fewer gimmicks and simpler levels (for the most part) in 1 made for a more fun experience. Regardless, I enjoyed Overcooked! 2 as a whole; it is still the chaotically fun co-op experience that I’ve come to expect and love from the Overcooked! Series. Looking forward to 3!"

We simply connected a couple of old wired Xbox 360 controllers to my PC to play this game together in our house and it was a blast! It will test the strength of your relationships, haha.But why can't I recommend this any more? The developers released a compilation version of this game called All You Can eat which was Overcooked 1 and 2 in one bundle plus some extra features. Trouble is, they are continuing to release free content updates for that version of the game but aren't adding those updates to the base Overcooked 2 game!! So anyone who already owns 1 and 2 separately has to pay all over again for All You Can Eat if they want to receive further content updates.This is a despicable business tactic and shows real contempt for long time supporters and fans of this otherwise excellent franchise."

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Review will be from the first perspective.Being quite familiar with the first game, my partner and I were super excited for more cooking chaos but ultimately we didn't feel the game is worth the money. The first three/four worlds we 3-starred everything on our first try just from familiarity with the game, the throwing mechanic has a lot of potential and the Kevin levels were a lot of fun but in the end it feels like we only got about 12 levels of actual difficulty.Overcooked 2 was the time to add in a level editor, not switches on the world map (what are those even for, anyway?). Make the game replayable, maybe a new game+ that you can select at the start if you're familiar with OC already/unlocked at the end of story that changes up the base game. OC2 isn't a sequel, it's just the definitive version of OC1."

Overcooked returned with many new features and the most highlighted one is online multiplayer! Yes, you can play now with your online friends, unlike the first game which only supports local co-op/PVP. We are back to Onion Kingdom and must help to defend it from the hoards of The Unbread. (undead) The story is fun and cute, and the stages are more challenging than before, you also keep unlocking new recipes that require you and your friends to team up or yell and shout during the whole stage. I had so much fun playing it with my friend and sister.The artwork is fun, you'll have so many chefs to choose from and unlock the more you advance into the game. The map is huge, each chapter has multiple stages and each stage has a unique challenge, besides the DLC's which adds even more contents. There are also Kevin's the dog, stages where you have to cook and serve dog food! those are really hard to make!The soundtracks are nice, fitting the gameplay, nothing too loud. I played this game using a controller, not sure if it can work as smoothly with a keyboard. The trophies are a bit challenging and need some grinding, but what makes this fun is when you play it with your friends, you wouldn't feel that you are grinding for anything.  You can team up with total of four players together.Pros:+Beautiful visuals and locations design.+Fun Soundtracks.+Unique gameplay+Multiple Chefs.+Bonus stages.+Huge map and many stages to play.+New Game+ unlocks an additional star to earn and difficulty. +Seasonal free content + paid DLCs.+Local and online multiplayer.+Many recipes (You unlock more as you advance into the game).+Steam achievements.Cons:-When you fall down into the sea, the game freezes for everyone for a couple of seconds until the player respawn. After finishing the main game, you'll unlock a new challenge and that will require you to get a fourth star in each stage! The developers still bringing new content and adding more recipes. With the new Holiday free update, you get to feed angry hoards and defend your kitchen at the same time!  I highly recommend it for people who enjoys multiplayer challenging games."

However as a big fan of the first one I can't help but point out some huge problems with the second one that have kept me from enjoying it.Overcooked is at its best when you are figuring out how to solve the level efficiently given the layout of the level in front of you. You make a plan, divide tasks, and refine your execution until your team is a well oiled machine. Then you move on to the next level and do it again.It's at its worst when the levels are built to slow you down or irritate you. Not particularly challenging, just clunky. You end up standing around a lot. You often have to wait for platforms to reappear or to get to you. There's nothing you can do to speed it up. I'm cool with dynamic levels that force you to adapt, but not when you end up just standing around waiting for the level shifts to occur. The first game's levels felt like they were asking the question ""can you find an efficient way to get things done here?"" This time around the levels are asking ""can you find a way to get anything done here at all?"" I think they knew the levels were clunky and made the scoring system very forgiving to compensate, because we got 3 stars on almost every level the first time through. I know they're releasing a NG+ so maybe the difficulty will change, but going back and replaying levels is not that appealing of a proposition due to the level design I described above. I am hoping future patches fix this game. The foundation is solid, some new levels and appropriate difficulty would solve everything.If you are considering this game and haven't played the first one, I suggest buying that one instead. It is far less polished, but the design is on point."

Many achievements are a bit grindy, and require doing 100-500 of something, which by the way many people have counted including myself to require much much more than the actual amount it says it requires.  Most of the grindy achievements have to be done afterwards since there isn't enough levels to get them on normal playthroughs, unless you replay the levels a lot."

Supporting split controllers and keyboards doesn't even require a lot of preparation for a bigger company of four. Though there can be so much going on that it's better to start from beginning of campaign, since even for a casual game difficulty can spike before you really notice, but in score requirements for progression are lowered compared to Ovecooked 1. Beyond that, it's mostly about how player company can start cooperating (which is wonderful for the genre), and all that cooking chaos is a colorful background."

Also, the last mission of the game was pretty lackluster and probably one of the easiest missions in the game to 3 star. I did most of the game, earning a score on most missions of approximately 2x the required amount for 3 stars and only a few missions required a 2nd try to get full star rating. When playing multiplayer, there were several lag spikes, to the point my friends froze in place for about 30 seconds, multiple times. On the note of multiplayer, only the host earns achievements, chefs, and any sort of progress. I wish the unbread made more of an appearance rather than the odd points on the world map and the beginning cutscene. It is a good, fun game, but not worth the full asking price.

117,aruvin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aruvin/,22,2,1,110.5,June,"29,",482,0,1,"is a massive improvement over overcooked 1 and still delivers the culinary co-op madness.  (ovc 2 in short) is developed by Ghost Town Games Ltd. and Team17 Digital Ltd. It is published by Team17 Digital Ltd. The PC version was released on Aug 8, 2018 and it is also available on PlayStation 4, Switch & Xbox One. As of this writing, Metacritic  shows:I am not going to address the obvious question: Does the sequel of the beloved 2016's overcooked live up to the expectation? Instead, i'll be asking you: Are you  of those people who is  by all the comments you read on reddit/metacritic/steam reviews/forums/etc and is on the fence whether to purchase overcooked 1 or 2 because of all the  feedbacks? I totally understand what you are going through and I can only say, it's not the product's fault. its the people. They are causing all this  over one of the  couch co-op/co-op product in the history of gaming/current market (Well, at least as of this writing in the year 2020).Once again, the onion kingdom needs saving. This time around, onion king accidently summons a horde of unbread. *gasp* So thats where players come in. The objective is to serve the food while overcoming different challenges/obstacles presented in each level. That's easier said than done.Play up to 4 players via local or internet multiplayer. The campaign offer players 6 worlds@regions to explore with a total of 36 levels and 8 Kevin levels that needs to be unlocked. Aside from the campaign mode, Versus mode is still available and there's an Arcade mode now. Once you complete the entire campaign, you will unlocked 4 star mode. Play with your food chefs!If that's not enough to satisfy your culinary experience, there are currently 5 DLC's available for purchase and a new free DLC coming up in July 2020. Controls: WASD keyboard and controller. Keyboard key binding is not available.Audio: The background music sets the mood and tempo for the game. Different background music will be played in different world/region (similar like ovc 1) Every player action has feedback sound; dash, chop, throw ingredients, fire, falls, etc. everything. +1 to the teamVisuals: The overall concept is still similar with ovc 1: simple, colorful, clean and plain looking (does not have details in the costume/looks) however I find that ovc 2's color to be more . Aside from that, we have a lot more new cooks to pick from; eagle, mouse, octopus, beaver and etc. +1 to the teamThis is a major section to cover. The dev's expanded on the existing mechanics & level design of ovc 1. They really up their game with some of these changes. The notable ones:These are just from the base game. If you own the DLC's theres even more creative/weird stuffs; moving around the kitchen via cannons, water squirt guns to wash dishes, backpacks to pick ingredients from, Marshmallows, hot dogs, drinks, milk shakes and more..Looking just at ovc 2, base product (excluding the dlc's) overall, it ""feels"" as if ovc 2 is more polished than ovc 1. The level design is more creative - where it forces players to do more/interact/react more as compared to ovc 1 which makes the game feel more intense. Does that mean it's more difficult? I am highlighting this because , overcooked games will always be coach co-op/co-op centric product that tries to make you have fun with friends/people. It is  dark souls. The fact that the devs made ovc 2 to allow players to make some mistakes/blunders and still manage to obtain 3 stars is to cater for the general audience. From young kids to adults, from casuals to hardcores. Each one of us have different preferences. I dont want to play with 4 perfectionist players. It's stressful. I also dont want to play with 4 jokers. it's crap. ovc 2 offers that balance. Those jokers will never be able to obtain 3 stars - or what if they do? or what if some of us can play or cannot play as good as  but still be able to obtain 3 stars. Whats so damaging? Is there any harm to lower the skill ceiling? to the community? to the mass market? or it's just your pride and ego? or your butt?So, coming back to ovc 2, i expected the devs to build on ovc 1 mechanics  what i did not expect is to this degree of change. It is a massive amount of effort and one that i have to applaud to all the teams involved in the production of ovc 2. The DLC's are great addition but also very challenging/brutal experience. If there's any negative point(s), i am slightly disappointed that they took out the rats and blackout levels from ovc 1. Yes, those were really annoying levels but I have some fond memories from there. I was also really hoping for a final boss, but what i got was a defense game mode. But as a whole, the product offers more positives than cons. So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for overcooked 2 is a  Crispy Golden Taco worth 9/10. *Eats the crispy golden taco in the cannon while the entire kitchen is on fire*"

It leaves you with disgraceful taste in your mouth after spending a full price of 60 USD only to witness the horrible gameplay and terrible false advertisement. If you are like me and just wanted to look for a fun game after being disappointed, again and again from triple-A studios.  Then this is the review for you. I will do my best and shed you the truth about this game and my experience playing through it... (WARNING It's a long read. TLDR at the buttom.) Overcooked 2 is one of the few games that support both local and multiplayer.  A good feature on paper, but I've seen enough games struggling with the input and lags. Overcooked does not do this. They were able to execute the host system flawlessly and it feels great to move around.Like the host system, the gameplay feels polished. The mechanics are simple. Collect, Cut, Cook and repeat. The first maps are set up to be easy, to make you feel accomplished, confident for the next challenge.Suddenly, it all stops. You are surprised at not getting the three-stars in the first attempt. You frown, but laugh it off. The next map is unlocked. But you are not going anywhere until you get that full star.700 Score for three stars? That's easy, you just got 650 and you barely tried. And so you Collect, Cut and Cook. You get past 700 scores, but you keep going. This map had tarnished your hot streak. 800, 900. A thousand... You showed that level designer. No longer would they underestimate your skills.The adrenaline fades but does not completely vanish. It lingers in the background, ready to answer your beckoning call. A small smile form on your lips. And you are pumped for more.As you progress through the maps. New challenges appear and you are forced to be more creative. You are stuck again. 1500 Scores for the three star.You use more time studying, watching. Then you see it. It was so obvious... The answer radiates like a second sun, and the route is set.As ingredients are flying through the air. You start understanding its more behind the gameplay. No longer is it a cooking simulator. But an acrobatic dance. Suddenly, the ingredients collide and fall either off the map or in the worst case; Staring back at you from an unreachable spot. Your brilliant flawless cooked steak is chilling in the cold wind. The time is moving, you grit your teeth and collect, cut and cook another. You barely make it, and a heavy breath escapes your lip. Just to realize you have been holding your breath all this time. Sh*t... The game is really pushing you now.Buttons are pressed, fires are spewing, tables are rotating, people are blocking...What the hell is going on?The level designer you showed earlier has stepped up his game. The previous strategies become useless. The randomly generated actions take you off guard, and you are surrounded by fire. Unable to move, unable to reach the fire extinguisher. ""Bull Sh*t"" You press restart.Again, this time. Your finger slip and you throw your dish into the trash instead for adding an ingredient. Your eyes dart to the time, then to the score, and back to the timer. You realize you won't make it. You press restart. Ingredients are collect, cut and cooked. The time is ticking, you realize this is it... The tip is at x8 and this chocolate cake would get you enough score for the three stars. You pick up the plate, run over to the oven. The beautiful majestic cake sits on the plate perfectly. You nod to yourself inside, the art team have done a fantastic job. Who in their right mind would not take a piece of this cake? After all, it was filled with the best ingredients in this world, and better. It was fueled by your hard and passionate work. Shaking yourself from the thought, your eyes dart back to the timer. It's blinking. In a panic, you move past the spewing fire, and charge the rolling belt head-on. Your eyes widen. In the brink of panic, you forgot it was rolling the opposite direction. Gritting your teeth. You press the dazing button, and it works. You are moving forward!Another button press. Your one step closer to serving your masterpiece.Another, it's so close right now. You could smell the three stars now.Your hands drenched in sweat, you go for one last push.And your thump slip, the character is slightly tilted in another direction. A sudden gasp is audible all around you. And a horrifying scream fills the room. Little-Jimmy in the corner is crying, your best-friend Bob is furiously cursing in the living room. Your girlfriend is looking at you with one of those familiar looks... But unlike the previous time, her disappointing look felt more disturbing, perhaps it was the clothing. Disgusted, defeated, ashamed, you rise up from the couch and turn around to look at all the familiar faces, and freezes. Grandma Maria is holding your gaze. You hear her mutter to herself ""The cake is a lie.""TLDR: The game is one of my favorite games in 2018. Do not let the family-friendly art deceive you. This game is brutal, it's been a while since I laughed out loud playing a game, especially for my own stupidity. This made me realize again how fun games could be. I would recommend playing this game together. But if you like to be challenged further. Playing alone would take some serious effort."

My wife and I were really excited about this game having played through the first one many times over. We will keep playing in case we're just judging this too soon, but so far this is a disappointment compared to the first one. My wife is a professional game designer, and we spent a lot of time just picking apart details and poor executions, which was kind of sad :( the story mode map was just made unnecessarily more complicated and brings nothing extra to the game. In fact it's annoying. We were excited to finish and switch to arcade mode so we didn't have to mess with the map, but arcade mode didn't appear to display our previous scores, so we didn't know what to beat. The levels are either poorly balanced, or we just haven't figured out a good strategy for each yet. The levels have so many little things that get in your way, though, that we often didn't want to replay a level to perfect it. They just were not that fun. In the first game, we would finish a level and be like ""awesome! We can do better! Let's try that again!"" That sadly just didn't happen in OC2. Some levels change 2 or 3 times throughout--the first game did this, but in that one the dynamic levels never seemed out of place like they do in OC2. We would have happily paid for more content in the first game with similar philosophies in level design.To be honest we're not that surprised. So many good games make you think, ""wow this is great, I hope when they make the next one they understand what makes this one so good and don't mess it up.""My advice: If you are looking at this game for the first time, just go get the first one instead."

Then the game made us watch credits which i couldn't skip so i quit the game and my progress didn't save. The game is lacking any novelty, apart from several new recipes, dashing and throwing it's all the same, but easier. Almost no UI improvements were done, there's no quick way to restart levels, you have to come back to the centre of the map after each area to hear another boring part of the story. Don't get me wrong, the mechanics are still very fine, the core of the game is really fun, we enjoyed our playtrough, but we feel a lot of disappointment as well. In my opinion the game is not worth its price at the current level. I expected more from a sequel.Disclaimer: We  didn't play any online features of the game, just the main story."

Overcooked! was an incredible place to use teamplay and develop strategies to beat challenging levels. This one is all about chaotic running throughout maps full of dynamic motley things and getting 3 stars in the end even if you fail a lot.I don't understand how the same people, who created the incredible first game, could turn such a great gameplay into something like this. Taking into account the reviews on Steam, I'm not the only one, who is disappointed."
138,The Greater Sphinx,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198218582012/,16,1,1,52.8,February,"7,",559,0,1,"Overcooked 2 is a hectic co-op game where you play a chef, cooking a variety of recipes in a variety of crazy kitchens. You'll have to cooperate with your teammates to fill orders in time and collect enough points to pass through the levels. It's very similar to the first game, but there are a number of improvements to it, including online co-op and some small improvements in the controls.This game can be played with up to four players. I think you can play alone, but I can't imagine it being all that enjoyable. The fun really comes from playing the levels with your friends and figuring out the best way to run your kitchen efficiently. I've played the game with 2, 3, and 4 players before, and while some of the levels are best suited to one particular number of players, I think all of the levels are playable even with just two players.Story mode has a variety of levels to play through, although it really isn't very long. However, there are a variety of other goals to complete as well. There are 4 stars to collect on each level, there are a few other game modes to try, and there are a number of bonus levels as well which are still being added to. I also think the levels are incredibly fun to replay even without much new content.I love the art style and the music. It's all very cute and rounded. The chefs you can unlock are all very cute, with a variety of different people, animals, and other creatures to choose from. The background music is nice to listen to and well-suited to the game. The story in story mode is pretty bare bones, but it's fine, a game like this doesn't really need an amazing story.The DLC in the game is worth buying, but not necessary. There is a ton of content and replay value to the base game, especially with the occasional free updates, and the DLC is all self-contained. However, each DLC adds new recipes and level mechanics, and the DLC levels all have replay value of their own.Overall, Overcooked 2 is a great game to play with your friends. I've had a lot of fun playing the game with various friends and will probably continue to come back to the game over time. If you don't have people to play with (in-person or online with voice chat), you can probably skip it, but otherwise I'd highly recommend it. 10/10"

Bringing Online Play to the table, Overcooked 2 already is an immense improvement from Overcooked. The level designs are creative, diverse, challenging and great fun. The level requirements themselves or time constraints can be difficult at times, but overall a great experience, and I deeply enjoyed 100%ing this one with my friend. Didn't cause any rage or arguments or even general burnout for us, but I think that's largely because it's overexaggerated for comedy how difficult the game is. Mostly you'll be laughing or too focused on your tasks at hand to think of anything toxic. Tons of character options, tons of themes/levels/foods, and tons of DLC that only enhance the experience and are also very worthwhile to purchase. Additions to the game only need to be purchased by one person for the whole party to experience them as well. Along with the expected levels, the game also features tower-defense that breaks up the flow in a much needed way.I can see myself playing this game for dozens of more hours, and my only qualm is that I wish the online matchmaking was more active. However, if you're already have someone in mind, you've nothing to lose.:) I strongly recommend this one, full price or not."

In a way that's no problem, we loved the 1st one (yeah, I am another one of those that did play it with his girlfriend) and we couldn't way to play more of it, even if it didn't add much stuff.What falls short compared to the 1st one is level design and balancing. The 1st one was a gem in that sense, with each level absolutely well tuned and requiring to be played multiple failing times until -bam!- you could get 3 stars.Overcooked 2 levels tend to be far too easy in general (the surf'n'turf DLC is far better balanced), using map dangers more as an obstacle than as part of the complexity (e.g. the leves where you can fall).Then comes the 4th star, and it's close to unachievable in terms of difficulty.One really bad side of the new visuals, if you have multiple food items on a surface perpendicular to the screen surface (""vertical""), it's impossible to understand what's where and what spaces are free.All in all a pleasant game to play, but could have probably evolved much better than how it did. Still got a 75/100 in my books, and I do recommend playing the Surf'n'turf DLC."

If you play with family members or friends, I hope that your relationships will survive this game, as it will strain those relationships to the max.In this game, you must prepare food of different kinds for your customers.  You must grab ingredients, chop, cook, bake, steam, and plate them and deliver them timely in order to reach a certain amount of points.  Three stars is what you're aiming for, and while it may be easy on the early levels, it becomes vastly more difficult at the later levels and in the DLC add ons.You will prepare pies, pancakes, salads, hamburgers, hot dogs, smores, kabobs, pizza, and so much more.  For some you will use a BBQ or a firepit which requires you to use blowers to intensify the heat or add chopped wood in order to cook faster.  The worst part, and this is horrible, you also have to do dishes.  The amount of work required to get three stars in the amount of time given is not easy.  The more players you have the more points is expected that you will get.The storyline is forgettable, King Onion, or something like that, and his sidekick dog Kevin need you to save their butts of their kingdom, and cooking wonderful meals delivers the saving grace they need.  Ridiculous, but ultimately funny and forgettable.  In the main game, there are several worlds, I think 5 or 6 with 4 levels each typically.  Each world provides a different atmosphere or different scenery to move around in.  The DLCs offers three worlds each with 4 levels a piece.  Overall there is more than enough levels to keep you busy for a long time.I will admit, I've never played this single player other my experience of doing a two player versus.  You must click a button to switch between your two chefs making the need to get things done quickly rather more difficult.  Did I mention you can burn down your kitchen if you overcook something?  You can fry mixers or burn things, as a red exclamation with a loud alarm starts to sound to alert you that you need to hurry and save it before it's too late.  This adds to the stress of everything else that you are doing.  This will get you screaming, yelling, complaining, blaming, and shouting at your partners, and hopefully it's all for the good laughs of what this game does.  It is the most stressful multiplayer atmosphere ever and I loved it.There are many achievements, none too impossible to obtain, I have a few left, but I think I'll be able to unlock them all before I'm done with this game.  The game can be played 4 player couch co-op, versus (2 on 2) or can be played online as well.  I only played with controllers and the controls are great, nothing sloppy, but I'm not sure how this would play only using the keyboard.If you're looking for a laugh out loud exciting multiplayer game, this is definitely one of the best I've played.  This is originally a time management game, but they've never made them like this before.  They took these a to a whole new level, and it's very fun.  Pick this up if you haven't already."

More like a real restaurant where you have to sort out the dishes, figure out if you need the pan or the fryer. Organizing rooms and ingredients.But it's not like a huge issue."

I played with a friend on the same city and we would get a bit of lag sometimes but nothing terrible, however I can't speak for online friends playing on different countries/continents, hopefully another review covered that.I love all the challenges and the cute little chefs, I wish we could've gotten the calico cat chef for free thoughReview was made after completing all the worlds, levels and secret levels of the main game, we haven't tried the free DLC yet"

You can 3 star campaign levels solo pretty easily, but you'll need a decently skilled friend to get you to 4 star those levels, if that matters to you. Best feature of the game imo are the versus levels (couch doesn't have any issues, but online is stupidly buggy, esp cross-platform). There are only 6 versus levels that come with the base game, but the Surf n Turf DLC adds two of the best levels, and is well worth it for the price. My boyfriend and I have spent a good number of my hours on this game exclusively playing couch pvp and yelling at each other. Fun time, 10/10 would recommend."

220,Artibius,https://steamcommunity.com/id/artibius/,10,,1,52.9,July,"25,",640,0,1,"+ creative levels+ fun soundtrack+ plenty of stages (36+8 hidden)+ online co-op included+ new game plus+ FREE Seasonal Updates DLCs (32 stages)+ FREE All At Sea DLC (5 skins)+ your friendships/relationships might get stronger- cannot rebind gamepad buttons- your friendships/relationships will get stress testedMaybe seems easier than the previous game. But it definitely felt more fun than the first and for sure less stressful (at least the main campaign). But that doesn't mean it's totally easy. In reality, the difficulty seemed all over the place when you get stuck on some random level but the final one you can 3-star in two tries. So keep playing, it's possible to 3-star most of them with a bit of practice. Worth mentioning is the new game+ mode that unlocks after you get all stars. In this mode you need to be even faster and get 4-star ratings, effectively giving you and endgame goal after you would normally be done. This sequel looks just as good, maybe even better, than the previous game. Smoother UI means it is easier to see what is going on and what you are taking/placing. And overall they worked to improve the aesthetics & level design but kept the art-style. A nice addition are hidden (Kevin) levels although I would prefer if the requirements were visible somewhere outside of Steam guides. Included is the FREE Seasonal Updates DLCs which, as of time of writing, consists of 27 levels (5 + 5 - Winter Wonderland; 7 + 5 - Spring Festival; 5 - Suns Out, Buns Out!; 5 - Moon Harvest Festival). It's a mix of all previous DLCs (recipes, mechanics, tools) plus a couple of new ones, all coated with their unique art styles. This is dispersed between six areas accessible from a central hub. No story with the Onion King (and Kevin) this time. The difficulty is often higher, especially for two or three levels in Winter Wonderland. These levels might challenge you A LOT and are no joke even compared to some of the DLC campaigns. Overall 70+ levels to try out (including the free DLCs) in one of the best co-op games currently available. Playing solo isn't great but if you have someone to play with this game is a blast!------------------------------------------------------------------"

Lots of extra modes and additional chefs for cute cosmetics.Nothing beats pounding out the sashimi to a killer jam while playing as a raccoon in a wheelchair, ha ha!The nice thing about Overcooked 2 as opposed to the first one is if you're playing 2+ player they've added this handy 'throw' feature; where you can THROW each other ingredients which makes some stages hilariously work out. Hard to imagine playing without that button...work the extra few dollars on sale or off IMO.Thanks!"

259,Ganking is 300 Bucks,https://steamcommunity.com/id/secreteating/,8,1,1,24.2,August,"12,",147,0,1,"This game feels very rushed. The core gameplay is fine but there are a handful of quality of life changes that need to be made.1) Allow players to change chefs prior to starting the level, not at the main screen.2) Also, I have had the game lock to 'keyboard' when you have a gamepad and had to restart; I think the solution is just to avoid pressing keys prior to the main menu.3) Players that try to spam A to skip the opening screens are thrust into the level select screen and then have to back out back to the main menu; a minor issue that can be fixed by forcing the players to press START rather than A to open the main menu once the opening credits are finished.4) Game will occassionally freeze at the loading screen for levels.5) Netcode is inconsistent and desyncs are not uncommon.6) Difficulty for 2 and 3 players (I haven't played with 4 players total) is generally too easy, but also inconsistent: with the exception of 1 level, I was able to get 3 stars by an extra 50% or more. In particular, level 5-3 is very challenging, but 5-4 is at a difficulty that I would expect for the first world. In general, the numbers for the stars need to be tweaked. Overcooked 1 was challenging, perhaps a bit too difficult (I had to solo a few maps to get 3 stars, or 'cheese' them by playing with 2 players rather than e.g. 4), but this is too far in the other direction imo.7) The ending is incomplete. The final level hardly has any build-up and is very straightforward (also it seems a bit cramped), especially compared to the final boss of the first game. The end scene is a few lines of dialogue; I was expecting quite a bit more for the ending, even if it is just a short cinematic in the style of the opening scenes for the game.8) Throwing is inconsistent. It would be nice to see a highlight on the map of where your object will land once you throw it.In general, the levels seem to have fewer good gimmicks and are less inspired than in Overcooked 1. Even though the first game had some misses (e.g. the ice and lava levels), there was a lot of variety and I was willing to overlook a few bad levels. Overcooked 2 doesn't have many terrible levels (except maybe 5-3 or 6-2), but is definitely lacking in overall variety, particularly with the recipes. I'm surprised things such as the flame thrower from the holiday DLC didn't make it back to this game.All in all, the core game is still solid, but there are a number of QoL and polish issues that make this game closer to an 7/10 rather than the 9/10 I'd give the first. Fix the bugs and improve the netcode and I'd say the game is a 8.5/10. Not quite as good as the first but still worth a purchase."

New mechanics are introduced haphazardly and nothing differentiates the different chapters apart. Difficulty is also all over the place; one level takes us 2-3 tries to get 3-star rating, then the next level we get twice the score needed first try. It's as in no work whatsoever went into balancing the game.The first game had a much better progression of mechanics and balance. This sequel costs twice as much and is honestly half  as polished. Honestly the only thing it does better is online support. So unless you really need to play with a remote friend, I would just recommend playing the first one instead."

This is a classic 'spinning plates' type of play that's scales up and up and up.My only gripe with it is that some of the levels stop the 'flow' of the game, by putting obstacles in your way that prevent you from moving or performing an activity - I sort of think that at all points in time during a level, I should have to do 'something' even if its not the thing I wanted to do exactly - some levels miss this mark and you end up literally watching the clock tick away while you wait for a platform to appear. The best levels are the ones where its simple - nothing is moving around or floating - and its just you and your mates cooking against the clock, and the only reason why you fail is because your best simply isn't good enough, rather than you were blocked by a level script for 60 seconds."

277,Ricky Rat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRickyRatShow/,9,,1,138.8,May,"17,",816,0,1,"Overcooked 2 is a stellar sequel to Team17’s first co-op kitchen experience that builds on an already delightful formula and imbues it with even more flavors and features to keep the experience fresh.People will often say that they never knew they needed something until that something was announced, an observation that’s about at the point of triteness, but Overcooked 2 firmly fits that bill. Perfectly content with the first Overcooked after three-starring every level, the announcement for Overcooked 2 that came in June was welcome and exciting news. Knowing that a sequel for a much-loved game is in the works does conjure up some concerns about whether what made the original so successful would be built upon or pivoted to a worrying direction, but Team17 and Ghost Town Games knew exactly what made Overcooked click and brought more of that in the return to the Onion King’s domain.Bringing new recipes to the kitchen while old favorites return, Overcooked 2 presents players with more challenges than the first to diversify the food prep mayhem. From the new sushi dish to everything else players will encounter, the recipes are broken down at each initial encounter to keep new and old players on as level a playing field as possible. While you’re presented with different recipes at the start and throughout the rest of the game, you’ll find that the core mechanics and co-op antics that made the first so successful thankfully still permeate the game.Having played through the entire first Overcooked game while repeating levels to obtain better scores, it does seem that this one holds players’ hands less than the series’ debut. The difficulty quickly ramps up quickly, not to an unmanageable level, but certainly to one that seems to be at a steeper angle than Overcooked. It’s clear that the game expects players to be familiar with the first, and though it’s hard to speak from a new player’s perspective having experience the first, co-op gameplay with an Overcooked newbie suggested that the difficulty incline wasn’t just anecdotal. After retrying the beginning levels a few times to get the hang of it, everyone was on the same page, a necessity that hopefully won’t deter new players from enjoying Overcooked 2 without prior experience.The sequel has challenges in store for new players as well though with more dynamic levels that do their best to get in your way. One of the biggest examples of the level improvements that you’ll see early on is a sequence that throws you from one setting into another mid-level. A hot air balloon ride seemed like it’d ended when the balloon and the kitchen basket came crashing down to make it seem like we’d done something wrong, but it was actually a dramatic transition to a new kitchen below. There are even portals in some levels that players can either walk through or fling ingredients into to make them pop out somewhere else. If you thought the first Overcooked’s levels were creative with players eventually cooking in space (expect more intergalactic challenges here), you’ll find that Overcooked 2 provides a fresh set of memorable levels ranging from swamps to mine shafts, all with fireballs, moving structures, and other obstacles looking to delay your progress.The throwing mechanic is one of Overcooked 2’s most notable changes, the other contender being the online play that now connects chefs across the world, and it’s far from a gimmick. It’s a helpful tool when every second counts, but it’s also not option. Players will find that many levels force them to throw items to one another, if not to obtain a higher score than simply to get a passing one. Overcooked isn’t a game where you’d do something and think “that was a great play!” but Overcooked 2 allows for that feeling of success by tossing and catching ingredients in time to complete an order.Co-op is still core in the new Overcooked game, and that’s something that both helps and hinders it. While games shouldn’t necessitate that you play with friends for them to be enjoyable, Overcooked 2 is simply more enjoyable when played with others. Going solo is still a viable option, but the premise of having at least two controllable chefs in the kitchen will always mean that having more than one player is the intended way to play. It’s simply not as much to play solo when you feel like you’re sharing a controller with yourself while still somehow operating on two different wavelengths, but the online multiplayer at least gives everyone with Internet access the chance to experience Overcooked 2 alongside someone else. There’s a new emote system in place to assist with this, and while it’s enjoyable enough to do some goofy gestures at one another or inform teammates of basic actions, it’s hardly a replacement for the teamwork, frustration, and excitement that comes with voice comms or couch co-op.Overcooked 2 will at times make returning players wish that it could’ve done just a bit more with the sequel, but playing it safer is perhaps the preferred option to avoid a disappointing sophomore release. Like the first, it’s better with friends, but that also means that it’s got exceptional replayability with the experience being different depending on who you play with. Overcooked 2 – and the first Overcooked, for that matter – is a game that belongs in every co-op campaigner’s collection, and if Team17 ever decides to make a third, I’ll happily return to the kitchen once again."

The game uses a gameplay full of different challenges, eye-catching and attractive environments, and of course, music that will satisfy every player. Made by Team17 studio, the game is not without flaws.

(The whole idea of the rush and mayhem of making an order and serving it). So actually enjoying this game was a big unexpected surprise for me. Secondly, be prepared to play this either in real life together, or in a voice chat if it's online play. It's practically impossible to play otherwise, as communication is key. I initially fell in love with 'Overcooked 1!', however to be honest me and my friends probably got to level 10 and everything just went downhill. For such a fun game, each levels' difficulty is bazzaringly escalated like there is no tomorrow. One second your at level 1 playing the introduction, and the next you've lost your voice and your best friend. Unfortunately (or should I say fortunately) to say we never picked up from where we left off. This is where 'Overcooked 2!' comes into play.The progression in the difficulty of levels was just french kiss! The amount of times I have successfully pleaded for my friends to get this game should be a crime. Yet it did not fail to please anyone. So a happy crime :) The tutorial level is such an easy and great way to expose you of what is to be expected. It's so easy to learn and master the fundamentals of the game. All levels can be played repetitively without erasing previous data (duh), so engaging with this level for every newcomer is a positive must!!! Once you have mastered a great deal of levels and have progressed through a big chunk, I would recommend playing with 3-4 players. Not because it's impossible to pass the level, but rather because the maps do become fairly more spaced out, with different work stations a mile from the other. (of course not literally)In stating that, it's also great with playing with just an extra person or two, as the scores for the levels change and adapt accordingly. *If I can recall correctly*O Overall, don't let 'Overcooked 1!' fool you... just skip it and buy no.2! O Everyone could and should play this game! No matter how you would consider your level of gaming.O It really encourages you to learn how to communicate effectively and efficiently among your co-players.O Because who doesn't want to make a fake pizza, sushi, fish and chips, burger, dumplings, salad (questionable), etc. O Oh and you can throw food too. Ingenius. O Washing dishes? You got me in the first half not gonna lie. O Who let player 1 drive around on the map?

But after finishing it you unlock the posibility to earn 4 stars on each level, which adds a good level of difficulty to the game. Great to pass time with your friends on local or online multiplayer. The thing that is missing to be almost perfect is the capability of playing 4 people in separated computers, in ""two squads of two"" as online partying only allows the host to have more than 1 people in the same session, while the other teammates can only enter individualy.

Stick to the original outside of a deep special. = Intro = A big fan of the original, the wife and I have dozens of hours into it. Was extremely excited for the second one to the extent that we preordered it.= Gameplay =Make sure you have a gamepad. This is *not* keyboard friendly.The core mechanics are the same as the original. Lots of new gimmicks in each level compensated by a very low 3 star score required. This results in a game that is both more irritating and less challenging. I remember some levels in the original that took me and the wife upwards of a dozen tries and we still had a blast. There were perhaps 3 levels that took us more than one or two tries, and we were glad to be done with them as these levels felt like we were working against each other. One in particular had a purple shimmering background that physically hurt my eyes. A wildly inconsistant difficultly level. The game is mostly very easy compared to the original, aside from a few extremely annoying levels. The final boss was an extreme letdown - we 3 starred it on our first try.Tone and theme constantly waffled. Rather than having 'worlds' like the first game, you jump from theme to theme and back again on a per level basis at random. This makes the entire game feel samey, while the original had a unique theme and gimmick each world.The multiphase levels seen in the previews are cool, but there were about 3 of them the entire game and I felt a bit cheated. The vast majority are just one area.After finishing it, we are battling to even remember the levels that gave us difficulty.The hub is also bizarre, with no rhyme or reason - finding switches feels like needless busywork and padding on an already thin game. Constantly having to go back to the middle to progress the story became a chore. We blazed our way to act 6, beat the multiphase 'boss' level and were expecting a final epic act involving the zombies to unlock. The game then just...ended.= Graphics and Audio = Graphics are pleasant and bright and the variety of chefs is cool. Audio is solid with a few catchy themes. Nothing wrong here.= Story = Meh. Compared to the charm of the original, we now have a disjointed, random trip through a bunch of unconnected levels with an overarching but NEVER SEEN 'zombie' theme and then a 'final boss' where we don't even see the zombies! = Value = Poor. There is far less content and enjoyement here than the original game for about triple the price. This feels like a studio mandated product rather than the lovingly crafted masterpiece of the original.= Overall =+ Core gameplay is still fun+ Multiphase levels are cool+ Cute chef designs- Overly short- Gimmicky- Overpriced- Multiphase levels are rare- No consistency between levels and themes- Overly easy aside from a few irritatingly hard levels- Lame climax= Final verdict: This is a sad and disappointing followup to the amazing original game. It feels like something the developers didn't want to make. Wait for a deep special if you are interested, or better yet - just go through the original again."

It was way more challenging in Overcooked1, but was boring in this expansion.2. 4 star was almost impossible in 2 players mode, for most stages. My wife and I were able to achieve 4 stars in some stages, but most of the stages were basically impossible for only 2 player. This was funny because threshold for 4 stars are all same across 2p, 3p and 4p mode, which is not reasonable at all.3. Multiple bugs that affect player experience. One major bug is that when dropping a plate, it does not drop onto the table, but instead in a weird position that cannot be picked up again. Also in some scenario it could be dropped into a corner that cannot be reached. 4. I really like the sound of the onion king ""ba bi ba bi bu wa wa wa wu"", but it was missing in this expansion. Hopefully we could have it back. 5. Back to stage design, nothing about stars, but some stages was totally disgusting. I remember there was one stage that the in lava keep changing, which is so thin that we have to be so careful when delivering things. I guess it could be better when using keyboard to move, but for controller, a slight offset on sticker could cause a suicide in lava. This is not a good design at all. There was another stage that we control a platform in the middle to make burittos, but for 2p mode it was too much mess because one of us have to keep dropping, picking and control platform. However in 4p mode it was just as easy as nuts because one can just stay controlling the platform while others could just do their own thing. There were 3 sets of cooking material on each side(3 pots, 3 plates, 3 pans), so it was just one for each. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR1. Star requirement for 2p, 3p, 4p are same, which is ridiculous.2. Some kitchen were not well designed.3. Bugs4. No sound from NPC."

With the improvement of multiplayer mode, Overcooked 2 is an exciting, occasionally frustrating, and hilariously enjoyable co-op cooking game. The levels and themed and unique. There are many unlockable characters, a bunch of recipes to complete, and creative obstacles to make the job even more challenging. There is no combat in this game. Well, not in the traditional sense. Feel free to throw food at your friends or shove them into the water or off a cliff. The goal in this game is the race against the clock and to make as many orders as possible and send them out from the kitchen. Overcooked 2 is a huge improvement from Overcooked. The option of multiplayer was there in the first game, but the option for online multiplayer allows this game to be accessible by friends and family who may not live close enough to one another to play. [Or with the recent pandemic, where it may not be safe to play with other in close quarters.] The accessibility to play this game is there. The player can choose to use a controller or the keyboard and mouse and of course you can switch up the command layout any way you’d like.I simply adore this game. It’s good, wholesome fun where you and your friends will be tossed into some insane situations and laughter and screaming will ensue. The levels are beautifully crafted, and the music does not get old. I would recommend that if you buy the game, give a bit of a test drive and then maybe give the DLC a go if you find yourself really enjoying the game. The DLC is more challenging at times, but you gain access to new playable characters and new recipes. All in all, I found the game and the DLC it to be well worth it.

I do suggest people who enjoy this types of game to buy the seasonal pass which includes the three dlcs released in 2019 with a lower price than buy them separatly.Compare to Overcooked 1, Overcooked 2 adds online arcade feature which allows player to search for other players in same region to play with. This matchmaking system works well for players in same country, but for oversea connection it still depends on both player’s network.The versus map in Overcooked 2 are getting more competitive than Overcooked 1, instead of completely separate the two teams by barrier, players in Overcooked 2 versus game are able to reach the other team’s kitchen to either stealing their order or making trouble in their kitchen.Overall, I really enjoy this game and I believe you are going to learn lots of tips and tricks during your game play.

Immediately, I can tell that more attention had been put into how the game looks, functions, and feels. It looks and plays considerably better and smoother than the last one with animations, visuals, and overall performance getting improved. For me, the most noticeable and welcoming of these changes has to be the increase in numbers of level variations. The locations of which you'll be visiting are now much more varied and will be taking you to all manners of environments including underground, air, lakes, urban centers, and so much more. Some will even have level transition bringing you to multiple locations in the same game. It's awesome, and I wish the developers would've done more of them because of how fun they are to play. Aside from that, if you're a fan of verses and arcade mode, there's even more content to gorge down on and enjoy, all with their own beautiful and unique levels to experience long after you're done with the main campaign. There is simply a lot to love about Overcooked 2, and I highly recommend anyone who's in the market for a new fun co-op game to definitely check it out."

After how hard it was to get 3 stars on every level in the first overcooked, I am a little shocked and very disappointed that I was able to get 3 stars on all the levels, including the Kevin levels, first try for almost all of them and the boss fight was so easy.  The gameplay, I would say is definitely improved. The 'throw' button is very handy. I also like the online part, but with no voice communication, 4 random chefs in a hard level is very difficult.  Plus it is a little hard to find chefs to play with. I very much hope there is going to be a DLC soon with more levels. I was so excited for this game and waited months for it to come out.

Therefore, It's difficult to understand why on PCs with split keyboard control the multiplayer mode is not properly implemented. We are three local players at the same place and the only way to play together is to buy three versions of the game and play online via internet. This is because it's not possible to play with more than 2 local players and if additional online players are added all other local players are removed. That is nowhere stated in the game description and i guess only applies to pure split keyboard controls (but also to the Christmas update). Secondly, other online players (not personal friends) can only be found through steam discussion groups. There's no in-game player matching and search engine. For me this is a joke, in particular, for a multiplayer game.The game itself is great - it's just too expensive to play it with family."

Previously, you had to have a perfect or near perfect run to achieve three stars but now it's possible to clear the three star score by several hundred points each time. There were only a couple levels which took more than a few goes to get three stars and when we finished the final level with several minutes left on the clock, it was definitely more ""Oh, that's it?"" as opposed to the euphoria from finishing the first game. The charm of the original game was the frustration of missing the top score due to a seemingly insignificant error and toiling away for the elusive third star but that has been ungraciously taken away in Overcooked 2.So far the expansion is promising and has been much more challenging to get three stars for each level! Overall, it's a fun game but it seems like it was designed to please the masses rather than to present a challenging gaming experience."

It brings the multiplayer online which was not something I was looking for (couch coop is the way to play this game to me), but apart from that, zilch.The graphics are practically the same, the option to ""throw"" stuff is more confusing than anything else, and the mechanism around it are underwhelming, and, having played the complete game in less than ten hours, I can say with confidence that the game is boring.To players from the first one, the levels propose no challenge whatsoever (we gained 3 stars all the time with no coordination, and the addition of the fourth star is a bad attempt to offer more difficulty), no evolution nor main theme (on levels from the same group you will do burgers, then sushi, then pizza... and do it again on the next round), lowering even the bar in terms of immersion or at least lore.Some ideas just fall very short, like the ""new and improved"" map which brings... well nothing.The game is bugged at times (some items end up in the void of the inbetween two squares), which is not a very big issue but still, for a second opus, it's worth noticing.In fact I'm thinking the addition of the multiplayer is the root cause of the letdown that is to me this game, seeing as I'm assuming they lowered the difficulty to cater for the online multiplayer aspect of the game, and that the bugs must mainly come from there.I'm always bewildered by the praise made around second opus of games like this one. The first one deserved it, but this one gives no reason to be bought, and it needs to be acknowledged.Go buy the first one."

This does not require teamwork or effort at all...Only this reason makes me not want to play it.2. Playing Story mode online only gives achievements such as unblocking new characters to the host. Which is pretty bad. Makes me and my buddies not want to play online...well at all. It loses purpose.Other than that the game is good, but like I said before.

408,Washed Up Gamer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/de_pr1/,19,1,1,8.9,August,"15,",310,6,1,"Overcooked! 2 offers a unique arcade-like couch coop experience, adding innovative twists here and there to the age-old, screen-sharing fun when you'd invite your friends back from school to play videogames.  A colourful blend between a fun challenge, terrible food puns and adorable art style--Overcooked! 2 certainly serves up a succulent dish of friendly fun.  Sadly, like a game of Monopoly, it just isn't fun when you're the only one playing.Overcooked! 2 focuses on testing how well you and your team cooperate with each other.  Gameplay consists of orders rapidly being placed, which the team must complete and serve up to earn points which accumulate into a rating out of three stars.  When the whistle blows, you and your friends will be scrambling to meet order after order by preparing meals--mincing the beef; chopping fish; mixing aforementioned ingredients with flour into a mixing bowl... Whilst teams which function together too slowly will find themselves failing orders, overzealous teams will, on the flipside, fight against becoming overburdened as the food overcooks or equipment breaks.  The time-sensitive mechanics of the game gives weight to each player's actions and the game's creatively-designed levels prevent simple routine and muscle memory from diluting the difficulty of the levels.  One mistake after the other my sous chefs and I found ourselves in hilarity amidst a nightmare of problems we couldn't even hope to solve in time.  These moments, I find, are unique in games such as Overcooked! 2, whilst I would have been expected to be frustrated at minor screw-ups and mission failures with other more serious games; the inherent lighthearted music and art of Overcooked! 2 just makes you feel happier overall.  It's a difficult phenomenon to explain, but it's one which can surely be felt.  After all, comedic tension is rare in all forms of media nowadays, from videogames to films.  I certainly did not expect Overcooked! 2 to be so hilarious and so entertaining.However, the game is certainly not without flaw.  Whilst I understand the rationale behind the decision to allow players to instantaneously throw ingredients at maximum power, without any middle ground as to how far the ingredient should be thrown.  Personally, I enjoyed the additional lighthearted chaos that throwing items everywhere could wreak, though I'd imagine the lack of additional control over the palyer's character could cause some frustration among those more competitive than myself.  Furthermore, the detected area of activation for some in-game items can be deceptively long yet deceptively short at the same time.  Overcooked! 2's arcade-y and intentionally forgiving controls sometimes end up fighting with the player, as instead of dropping it through a shaft for the next player in the team to pick up, I found myself placing the bowl onto the nearby boxes and tables next to me instead--something which grew nervously frustrating at times, to the point where I would have lost my mind, had it not been for the game's soothing ukelele-based soundtrack.My initial impression of Overcooked! 2 on the PC was soured by the game's single-player.  It slowed some things down, giving the sole player two chefs which they could alternate between, straining my multitasking capabilities.  Though it seemed slightly innovative and interesting, it completely failed to captivate me with its charm like it did the second I hopped into a party with my friends.  I can't blame the developers for trying to at least make it work for singleplayer, though; unlike how many other couch-multiplayer games out there which can't even be played in singleplayer.  Thus, the effort is still there and I believe the developers should be commended for at least giving players the option to play alone, in a game marketed and designed entirely for couch-coop multiplayer with friends.  Lastly, need I mention that the game is quite a great port and works very well with the keyboard despite being designed with the controller in mind?  Great work across the board!Overcooked! 2 is a simplistic port from the console, and evidently was designed with a controller in mind.  I didn't expect any fancy graphics or shading like I do from triple-A titles, and even so I was impressed by how nicely Overcooked! 2 manages to pull of its art style.  The game doesn't look like anything much and that's a good thing.  Those of you out there with the simplest of laptops should find running this game a breeze thanks to its minimalistic and cartoonish approach, much like its predecessor.  The game looks great enough, without bells and whistles that overcomplicate its accessibility.Finally, there's that great, glorious lighthearted and fun soundtrack that numbs the frustration and anger.  The mixers may be broken, the customers may be getting feisty with their orders, the kitchen may even be on fire as well; but the genius with the ukelele strums away and everyone just laughs the troubles away.  Overcooked! 2 provides no shortage of these moments of juxtaposed havoc and serenity, leading to a very enjoyable experience for the whole party.Overcooked! 2 is simply the cutest party game I've ever played, combining simplicity with the complexity of teamwork, this game will test you and your friends.  It's just a shame that it, like all other party games, doesn't really shine as a singleplayer game.  But then again, why would you be getting it if you're the only one?Overcooked! 2 offers hours of fun for a reasonable price-tag, and is a must-have if you already have a group of friends who are planning to purchase, or have already purchased it.+Low system requirements+Reasonable price+Great fun with friends+Lighthearted and tongue-in-cheek design and atmosphere+Many levels+Great soundtrack-Singleplayer is a bit boring, but that's expected-Only truly shines if you manage to convince your friends to buy it with you"

418,Alphadoriest,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alphadoriest/,6,,1,5.3,August,"27,","2,078",0,1,"The original was pure un-feta-ed (is that how you do it?) fun that appeared unbeatable on co-op. It's back, confident and emboldened with much of the same antics of 2-4 player cheffing in the least practical kitchens you'll have ever seen. Only this time, the obstacles are more devil-licious, there's now a fourth star for the hardened, battle-scarred unicorn chefs out there, you can throw and catch ingredients to your heart's content, and online invite-only and public arcade sampling of levels is now finally available for the friendless of us out there. The main strength of Overcooked was always that its central puzzle was very much a human puzzle. Pure cooperation. Achieving the flow present in actual kitchens through allocating rolls (yep), synchronising your timing, ironing out inefficiencies, and becoming one mind, one machine. That's why I always thought the later levels of even the original, wonderful as they still were, actually worked to undermine in many ways the main function of the levels, the human puzzle as it were. They'd insert too many flow-stopping complications that would make a single dish hard to serve. Overcooked 2 doubles down on that with new mechanics like lever-controlled platforms and oldies and goodies like the slowly swaying platform - artificially eating into your efficiency. But if you were to remove such obstacles, what could designers do to ever mix things up? I think the key is to allow efficiency and flow to always be achieved. For instance, there can still be some optimisation around a swaying platform given there is enough for the two parties to do either side and its movement frequency is just right. Having everyone stuck on a massive single platform controlled by a lever, however, seems like opting to kill the machine and making the one mind just the guy operating the lever. It's telling also that such a level is nigh on impossible without voice communication in online arcade mode. Other levels have an instant, unspoken understanding of the division of labour. That said, a nifty addition for online is definitely the radial communication for a quick nudge - even if I find the only one I really use is 'washing up' over and over again. It's like being at home.The narrative premise in the rising of the unbread certainly earns its due laughs, but knows it's but narrative justification. Like the original, it's an abrupt end, and perhaps less climactic this time. Less explosion and more an onion telling you you've done a good job. It's not a big deal, but perhaps a little something to sweeten the deal at the end rather than evoking bad arcade game practice would've been better. I still love the overworld. Driving around is still a joy, and with additions like optional attainable levels, platforms, etc, it's only been improved.Completing the game would then grant access to the four stars new game plus, though. Something which should go some way to simmer down veterans with some extra challenge. As a recent update, it shows the devs are committed to delivering this dish well-cooked. I can only give them a full four stars in turn for that.The single biggest boon to my experience with the game is the addition of the arcade online mode. Since I haven't been able to get as much local play going as I would have wanted, this has been invaluable. It's well-populated and you can get a lot of sessions in. Instead of selecting from a menu of specific levels, you choose the themed chapters and have it randomised from there. It would be nice if there was some ability to request specific levels or even replay one you just botched. I assume there's no voice chat since I didn't encounter it. Despite my complaints that some levels seem like they demand it, I think this was the best option. It keeps play thoroughly uninterrupted by bellowing and frustration and preserves a non-toxic environment. It's an excellent time, but online drop-in of strangers to get through some of the campaign would have been doubly marvellous. I suppose I could seek out people through something like Discord if need be, or ask the girlfriend nicely one more time. Like its predecessor, this remains co-op in its purest form - largely because it still plays off people self-organising and optimising so perfectly. It carries over all the presentational joy and fun whilst adding many quality of life changes - the biggest of which, online arcade, is a game changer (this game, that is). The recent post-launch addition of new game plus means it will dominate your chosen party's time for even longer and should work to resolve difficulty concerns. The new more impeding level design elements and mechanics can seem like a downgrade in how they interrupt flow, but this is still the well-cooked experience you know and love."

433,Sushimon!,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lyrazal/,3,,1,12.1,July,"12,",554,0,1,"Overcooked 2 is a great game to play with friends which will probably end with everyone threatening to end friendships and cut each other's throats out. It's cute, it doesn't take too much time to clear, and there's a certain level of replayability  (i'll explain why it's only certain later) as there are other modes besides story that you can have fun with. It's the type of game you can pull out during a group sleepover and everyone will have a great time whether playing or watching (unless everyone has already played the game, then it'll probably be dull :/)Other than that, there are several problems I have with it. Read on if you want to find out what I feel are the cons of this game.Firstly, why the ♥♥♥♥ do I have to drive a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bus around the map to get to  the level I want to play? I don't get it. Then there's switches that you need to press to activate certain ramps to get to certain stages. Like just why? It's unnecessary and adds 0 value to the game.Secondly, why the heck is there a storyline? Nobody cares. It's poorly written (something about undead bread called unbread), and honestly having to drive all the way back to spend a few seconds rapidly hitting enter to skip through the onion king's speech is  a waste of time.Third, some level designs are HORRIBLE. I understand that they are trying to shake up the gameplay and introduce more chaotic moments but some of the elements added are just ridiculous. Its really just there to piss you off.Fourth, story mode feels really short. Thank god I bought this during Summer Sale on half price. There's only 6 words, each with 6 stages and 8 kevin levels which brings the total story mode stages to 44 levels. That took about 8 hours to clear. Of course, you can purchase the DLCs for more content, but judging from the reviews, it's pretty meh.Fifth, other than the stages the developers have included, and other modes such as versus, there's really nothing else to do once you have played the game for... lets' say 20 hours. The game will be fun for a while, but once you have tried everything multiple times? It will become dull. It would be nice if they could implement community created levels, but that would probably harm the DLC sales so... :') Overall, I still think Overcooked 2 is a decent game to have some chaotic fun. Just make sure you pull some of your friends in or set up Steam Remote Play for co-op. Singleplayer is hell. Oh and don't play it too much. It gets dull after a while."

Also versus mode 2 vs 1 is just bullying, opponents can steal stuff or squeeze and push your unused character.Around first dozen of stages are definitely easy to get 3 stars for solo as many claimed, tossing obviously makes it easier too instead of running back and forth in first game, the stages get harder and more complexed after that.If I have friends to play with locally I'd just get Overcooked 1 which sadly I don't (unless tossing and more recipes and chefs are good reasons for you), though I still think Overcooked 2 is pretty fun, and maybe get that on sale if you worry there's not enough content."

I find the lack of level differentiation a total let down because I was a big fan of the ice / space levels in Overcooked 1 (because, yes, sliding to your death is still a fun mix when you're hyperfocused on doing something). Difficulty has been generally toned down from something formidable to downright aggravating and thanks to the point multiplier, you can easily get (3) stars in one try. I expected more things happening on the main map since they introduced switched but things got repetitive too which is a bummer. But the biggest let down for me was the last few levels. The last boss of Overcooked 1 tooks us almost 5 hours trying to polish our teamwork, so I anticiapted that same exciting feeling. Sadly, the game blew it off with the most underwhelming finisher. It went like ""Oh. Wait? That's it?"".Overcooked 2 is still a nice co-op game that challenges you and your friends but the sequel is a half-baked comparison to its predecessor. If you're planning on getting this, I'd recommend that you buy the first game instead."

498,Silverdrone,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rtrind/,19,,0,14.4,September,"9,","1,085",0,1,"I hate to give a negative review for this game, but it's hard not to...First of all, hats to the devs in adding online multiplayer, it was a glaring missing option from the first and although I do not use it, it was a perfect fit for this game.Otherwise there are too much problems and omissions here to recomend it, specially if you played the first game:It is too easy to get 3 stars (at least with 2 players), most of the time we would get it at the first attempt, except for 3 or 4 levels which took one or two retries. I play with my SO and even without much strategy and adapting as we go, it was too easy. Now there is an update which include a 4th star on each level, but as soon as we fired the game, we though this was a mistake. See the progression for the 1-1 world: 20 - 160 - 300 - 2650, it's an incredible jump. Our first playthrough of the level was around 1400. We managed to reach 2165 after half hour of attemps, with an 'almost perfect' riskless execution, which for me is the fun way to play this game. This means dashing whenever possible, no downtime for either player and delivery of 43 dishes in order, so the tip bonus can stack as much as possible. Even so, it was impossible for us to even glimpse what we could do to reach it without using mechanics which require perfect execution. Is it possible? Probably, but this means we have to work in other ways to achieve it, which leads me to my next point.The controls are improved from the first version, but even so they still a little clumsy. The dash has an internal cooldown which is hard to time, you either spam the dash button or try to time it and don't dash sometimes (a little buffer for dashing would go miles in improving it's feeling). Grabbing and dropping items always leave something to be desired, since they are not precise enough most of the time. There is a distance which you can do the actions but sometimes the action does not fire. Other times, it does something you do not want to, like you are on top of a treadmill but it decides to drop your item on the table on the side of your character.With the imprecise commands, it's impossible to execute perfectly on your plans, which sucks the fun out of trying the challenging 4th star scores, specially with a non hardcore gamer like my SO.Tossing was a good idea and mechanically it works nicely, but it doesn't work properly with my next point.I don't like the physics being applied to the floor items instead of the locking to the table ones. To reach high scores, you are required to toss items, but then some rules about the item interaction change. For example, if a tomato is on the counter and you bring the plate to it, it will put the plate and the ingredient together. If the tomato is rolling on the floor and you try the same mechanic, you will drop the plate, then you have to pick up the tomato to be able to put it on the plate. It does not make sense for the mechanic to change because of the environment, it should be consistent if they expect you to reach such high scores.Unexcusable, it does not need to reach Mario Maker levels of sharing but the only thing I want is to be able to face different challenges endlessly (or really easy flows for an extended period of time). Creating custom levels would solve all the longevity issues of the title. The game has more levels than the first, but a lot of them lack personality. In two players, the first raft level (with the item tossing) is ridiculous. One player is on one raft with the cutters and... that's it, no access to the other side. The other player has to collect the ingredient, toss to the other side, receive the cut ingredient, put on the plate and serve. WHY does the game didn't put at least some of the ingredients on the other side is beyond me. Being able to toss the plate would also solve a lot of those limitations (so the delivery could be on that side) but the devs chose to allow only ingredient tossing (which is OK, but limits those kitchens).The map on the first game was charming (and useless). The map on the second one has a useless mechanic to activate some buttons to raise platforms. They are always obvious and add nothing to the game. So it's even more useless.I love the idea of the game, but I hate the implementation of the same problems of the first without all the charm which made it an instant classic at my home. If they reduce the complexity of the 4th star, I will gladly play it and the game goes from a NO to a Maybe.Overcooked 1 continues to be a more balanced game with more engaging kitchens and scores with are on the perfect sweet spot of difficult enough but never too far away to seem like it is impossible, so I recommend you play the first game instead."

Either way, I used Parsec to play with a friend so I cannot speak to the online multiplayer implemented inside the game itself. At it's core, the gameplay is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it. The game took me roughly 7 hours to complete with one friend and we both agreed that purchasing the DLC wouldn't be worth it for the price as it just adds new levels. Sure, there are more items to make but I've seen more content packed games for cheaper. However, I do hear only the host needs to purchase the DLC which is nice.No matter what, I would wait for the game to go on sale. No need to purchase at $25. I would probably put this game at no more than $10."

The story starts out with the Onion King as he has tasked you and a few other chefs if you have them to make food for everyone in the Onion kingdom and on your way you will come across new ways to make food and new challenges for you and your friends to over come.The gameplay is simple yet it can get crazy as you need to cook food, make sure the food is prepared in the correct order, deliver it to the hungry people, wash dishes, take out anything that catches on fire, and fight the time limit.  And having a friend does help out a ton and the game is more fun with friends as you get to yell at them for messing up and they just might do the same to you as well but that's the fun with Overcooked 2.  The graphics are cartoony and and wonderful and every area you go is different as you go into China Town, in the sky, in a mine, on the sea, you name it.  The characters are all cute and you feel bad for them as they are trying their hardest to cook and get the job done and the only thing they get is more orders to cook food but they get tips at the end of the day and that's your score so make sure to get the order right as you want to try and get 3 stars on the level.  Overcooked 2 even with it's simple gamplay is challenging but it is really fun to play with friends and it's best played that way, so grab a friend and get cooking as it's going to get crazy and rememeber, throwing food is this game is fun."

They have also adjusted the 3-star requirement for subsequent DLCs to be a bit more challenging.I really hope they eventually fix the freeze that happens whenever someone falls off the map for the first time after the game booted up. The issue has been reported, attempted to be resolved, but not fixed for a long time now.I LOVE THE FREE CHEF UPDATE (the girl pirate is so pretty)!!

Don't get me wrong, it's still a great game to have fun with your friends. The chaotic aspect of the game is largely improved with new mechanic and features.But for those who have played overcooked! the amount of excitement just isn't there. In my opinion the level design for overcooked 2 is TOO EASY for experienced players. Me and My friend only had around 10 retry to have all normal level 3 stars. With 10 hours in, the only achievement locked is the dish washing one. Yet I have't finish the story of Overcooked1 with 25 hours on the record. You just don't have the constant ""go back for more stars to unlock new level"" going on there.Maybe the game decided to work more towards the competing part, focused on the arcade and versus mode. But for me a causual game like this shouldn't give me the pressure of a PVP game.

One level had a road where you could get run over, with no lights to indicate when the cars were coming, the tables moved constantly and the wind would blow you away from whatever you were preparing and into the road for you to get run over - bearing in mind that if you 'die' with food you lose it permanently. Don't get me wrong, I'm down for challenging, but I would much prefer the challenge to make the cooking process more complex rather than introduce 5 different elements at once that make it near impossible to even do one part of the process of completing a dish. It's such a shame because we were really enjoying the game (and we liked to repeat levels in order to get 3 stars) but it got to the point where every single level was more frustrating than the last until we just stopped playing. I'm sure it would have been easier with more people but if a game supports 2 players it should be able to accommodate it.TLDR: Fun at first but later levels feel like theyre designed to make you tear your hair out"

Light colours, funny graphics look childish but you will see how it is sometimes hard to beat a “game for kids”.Here we have a sequel, in my opinion, of one of the best cooperative games – . I already reviewed the original game and you can check the review out here: The Onion Kingdom is in danger again and we must defend it by polishing our cooking skills! Hmm… Anyway as in the original , the story itself does not really matter here, as it is again just a background for all the fun which cooking in  provides.The game in technical aspects is almost perfect. It is not buggy, it runs really smoothly. One of the main features in  is multiplayer which works just fine: it is easy to connect and achievements are given to all the players. However only the game host can select levels/DLCs and moreover only the game host can drive the van to travel on the map :(Original  didn’t provide much in-game communication as it was intended for couch playing, however with added online multiplayer, the game provides something like that – 6 emotion animations – which you could use to show what you think about your companion’s action.  Unlike in  which contained only slap ability (and which was the best, I miss it so much), here the emotions are useless because you simply do not have time to use them if you are really tryharding as I did.The game provides the same joy and satisfaction of completing the kitchens.  also offers a free expansion and a few DLCs for additional price to continue the journey in the Onion Kingdom. In my experience, the game and some of the DLCs are a bit more challenging than the original  and in some ways it is not a good thing. As some levels are more frustrating and it is really easy to forget about the fun. Additionally there is a competitive mode to check who is the real professional chief among your friends and you.Speaking about gameplay, a new game-changing feature has been added – throwing. Now you can throw the items directly to your teammate or even to a pot/cutting desk/frying pan or anything else (but I guarantee 100% rage on the diagonal aiming if you use the keyboard, so I highly recommend using a gamepad). The ability is really cool and it allows you to save some time as the dishes themselves become a bit more complicated – in some recipes you would mix the ingredients before frying, baking or steaming. So I believe the game still remains balanced. is a great example of a perfect sequel which provides the same fun. There weren’t that many changes compared to the original game as  was a really really decent cooperative game by itself. So, whether you already played  or didn’t, it actually doesn’t matter, you can start your journey to the Onion Kingdom with either of the games :)"

Its so much fun playing it with friends and having everyone bumping in each other and making someone fall off the map and lose an order.Playing with four friends is the best if they are anything lke my friends you probably wont be able to get one star in the end but just because no one can stop laughing.When i finish the main campaing i played it with just one friend. Some maps are clearly easier with four players but that doesnt mean they are imposible. We were able to get three stars in almost every level, some requeried many retries and planning.If you are looking for a good time with friends i cant stop recommending overcooked"

I have bought the DLCs for the game which add a lot of content to the game. If you are just getting into overcooked now, I would recommend buying ""Overcooked: all you can eat"" which includes Overcooked 1 and 2.Can't wait for Overcooked 3"

NOPE, it goes harder, maybe when they discuss the game one of them questioning how to make this harder, just add more moving platforms don't just side to side make it up and down, raft in the river and even DRAGONS. well after all i think that this game is great despite never play the previous overcooked tho, the game mechanics itself is good yet not great either, and for the dlc the levels are quite few and after i buy season pass why i didnt get the surf and turf and must buy it again, i confused because they say its season pass. anyway 9/10 worth playing with friends or family, ya just don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up too much or maybe you'll have no more friends and family....kevin kills us"

667,SyMPh0Ny,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SyMPh0Ny/,14,,0,27.4,September,"1,",245,2,1,"To be honest, it's the first time I choose to not recommend a game. There are a lot of reasons behind it.I have played both Overcooked 1 and 2 for a quite long time. I have got most levels 3-star in Overcooked 1, and all the levels (including Kevin levels) 3-star in Overcooked 2. Right now I'm playing for the fourth star with my friend, and I really dislike the gameplay.According to the description of the update, the fourth star appears after finishing the story, which means you have to play all the levels at least twice to get all four stars. It is extremely boring, since the levels are unchanged in all aspects, except that the target score is ridiculously high. The gameplay really sucks. In the first several levels, all you need to do is to pre-chop everything and throw it on the ground, so that you can deliver dishes non-stop to get the score. It is not how a kitchen should work. A normal kitchen should not exploit the paused time. In my opinion, the four-star levels should add more elements (e.g. slippery roads and rats in Overcooked 1) to the map to further test the cooperation, rather than to test players to push the right button again and again.Also there are more problems other than the difficulty one. There are NO achievements relative to four stars, which seems really frustrating to me. It took me and my friend almost two hours to complete the 1-1 to 1-6 four stars, but there’re no rewards at all. The only new feature of Overcooked 2 is the action of throwing. It is fun, but it also has some bugs that can ruin your whole plan. I also wish there will be some additional conditions besides the target score to get the full star, such as not dying in dangerous levels, and not cooking the dishes until the last second. It can make the game more challenging, more reasonable and also more fun. Boldly increasing the target score shows that the designers really don’t understand the game. Difficulty doesn’t matter that much, fun matters. Finally, the single player experience does not change much. It is as boring as that in Overcooked 1. I would be glad if there is a separate story mode for single player. I see huge potential in the Overcooked series, but Overcooked 2 just miss most of the points. I hope I can pre-order Overcooked 3 with confidence."
668,2DKiri,https://steamcommunity.com/id/2dkiri/,3,,1,19.0,March,"10,",655,0,1,"I already enjoyed Overcooked and Overcooked 2 does not disappoint. It's again humorous and full of puns, fun levels AND it has multiplayer which was missing in the first one. The levels are not as challenging anymore - it's fairly easy to reach 3 stars - but after you've completed the story, you unlock the possibility to gain a fourth star in every level which seems impossible. I've seen videos of people doing it but you have to do everything perfect. I think it's a good compensation for the story being a bit too easy."

My chef would stop responding to my controls and appear at later point where I instructed him to be. This happened on occasions where I joined another game and when I was hosting one too. Single mode had lag as well. Something else to keep in mind is that the keyboard plays with awkward controls, as you can't remap the keys.

The level design in the first game had no online co op and everyone had a shared space-- meaning there needed to be communication on who was going to play what role. I didn't beat that game because I had a perfectionist attitude and the difficulty really rolled me over. People who beat that game will probably steamroll this game because the roles are often already separated for you and have already mastered the art of splitting roles. If they enjoyed the first game, they might as well get the second one. Overcooked is a one-of-a-kind game.2) New players who play soloThis is a very different game if you're playing solo. There's no communication. There's you switching bodies and doing the work of two people with one person. It's significantly harder this way, but the scoring system (and the chopping/cooking) has been adjusted to make it doable. I hate playing single player on this because it's a lot more work. I'm sure the three stars are much more rewarding, but you know, trying to synchronize your other self with maximum efficiency AND being prepared for the next menu item is a puzzle in itself. I might've enjoyed a little more if there just wasn't a ranking at all, but being a perfectionist ruined my fun as single player. Would not recommend it.3) Players with friends with compatible work schedulesThis is the target audience. If you fall in this category, you should know this game is a must-have.Cons--I hate the weather. I hate the pitfalls. I hate falling into the water. I hated the fact that the conveyor belts switched direction randomly. In fact, I hate when my storage ingredients move around. I especially hate the wind. I found a way to dodge cars at least. Pros--I'm amazed that we beat this game. We got into a rhythm after like the third or fourth try and god I never want to play those levels again. At least the ones with any of the hate I mentioned up there. So yeah, there's a feeling of wow. We actually made a good team. I have never really felt that in any of the Mario games I've played."

We thought to buy it since we saw some YouTubers play it and we thought it looked fun, and it is! I love the cartoonish art style, that's one of the reasons I bought this game. I personally I ain't into realistic graphics that much. Maybe that's because I'm a little bit into weird, funny stuff rather than serious stuff. Not that I don't like really serious games, but the funnier, the better in my opinion. Anyway, about Overcooked! 2; I didn't play the first game, so I can't really say either it's better or worse than it, but from watching YouTube, Overcooked! 2 looks more creative than Overcook! 'cause of the following reasons (for me): more creative locations, better graphics (if you're that kind of guy), and more stuff to cook. It's still the classic Overcooked! with a 2 slapped after it, with more stuff to cook really. Not much of a deal, but it's fun! So, if you have a controller (I'd recommend 2 controllers though, I find it better to play with a controller than a keyboard, but it depends on you) then give it to your friend/brother/sister/child etc. and play this game! It's awesome and fun for the whole family!NOTE: This game can be played online too, like 2 different people playing from 2 different PCs. I find it more fun to play localy though."

The short but intense rounds trying to cook up a dish encourage awareness and keeping track of multiple on-screen elements, while coordinating in an increasingly complex and changing enviornment.

The mechanics are good, and the graphic style is compelling.But, its just not worth the full price. This game really felt like a cash-grab after the first Overcooked. They didn't add too many new things. We completed the game within 5 hours which is quite short for this type of game at this price point.Seeing how simple this game is, I don't see why there isn't a map editor, with community workshop maps based on a grid system. Or at least, why isn't there different worlds with different biomes... Imagine a desert biome, where food would decay quickly if left unattended. Or an ice biome, where one of the hazards would be that you slip on ice. This game could have been so much more.

No big deal; if your squad beat it once, surely you can summon the cooperative fortitude required to do it again!That is all I can teach you. It is up to you now to defeat the Unbread. Bark."

I understand the frustration but I find it is not necessary to do so. It made me feel soooooo bad about it and quit the game immediately and I've encounter this so many times already. I don't understand why people can get very elitist and toxic in a game like this. Seriously chill the ♥♥♥ out? It's not a competitive game where you compete with other teams to get highest score smh.To the new players, I don't recommend going online public.

Sometimes I compete with my friends, and sometimes I work with them on levels. However, the only thing that makes me feel bad is that I feel that the operation is too complicated, and it is difficult for me to control these operations. In addition, at the back, the game rhythm will become very fast, so it means that there can be no mistakes, and the hand speed must be fast. However, playing with friends will not have such troubles, so I highly recommend playing this game with friends, you will feel the joy inside."

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

This game will totally stress you out, but in a fun way.There are three stars for every level, and the number of points required to get the stars goes up with the number of players. Very slight spoiler about the new game + mode:  I found  just as fun if not more fun than While you technically can, I wouldn't recommend playing alone. It's just hard because this game is really made for multiplayer, and especially four players. I've found two or four works best.Also, the DLC is great. It's just as fun as the main game and includes new elements and mechanics that made the base game great.If the game and DLC is on sale (it often goes for 50% off), it's absolutely worth it."

We were all really nervous, but he seemed like he was in a good mood and just wanted a quick meal. When his order came back to the kitchen we were shocked to see that he wanted eighteen live trout in a bowl of sake, and our best hammer. The order ticket wasn't in the handwriting of Carol our waitress either, so we think he wrote it himself. Anyway we're a seafood restaurant so we happened to be able to accommodate him. None of us went up to see what he was doing at first because we started getting really busy, until we heard customers screaming and our head chef Ronald ran into the back telling us to grab a knife. Turns out Chef Ramsay was nailing the fish to his arms and legs and smacking them together spraying fish stuff all over our guests. I've never seen a man's jaw open so wide in my life as he vomited out Carol, who I guess he had eaten like a snake, and then he crab-walked up our concrete wall and onto the ceiling where he dropped an egg sac on the maître d' melting the flesh from his bones. Gordon Ramsay’s eyes had gone red by this point and there were flames licking up from where his hair used to be. He uttered in a voice that seemed to come from every direction at once: ""WHERE IS THE LAMB SAUCE"" and then he grew to the size of the room, crushing everyone who wasn't lucky enough to get out of the way. We had to close the restaurant after that, and now I know why they call it kitchen nightmares.﻿"

I love the style of the game and it is absolutely fab to play with friends - definitely the more the merrier.  Got to say I'm not a huge fan of the solo mode as you have to switch between 2 chefs which is a hassle and a bit of a nuisance (I'd rather the levels were slightly easier but you just had one chef to control). Overall, however, it is a great game to play with friends and it's lots of fun (especially when you all end up shouting at each other!) I did buy this in the Steam Winter Sale as I do not know if it is worth the full £20 but if you've got a bit of spending money, then go for it!"

The graphics is also good, with many attractive recipes and kitchens.One advantage is that it supports local co-op with split control on the same keyboard, so no need to buy a controller if you only want to play it locally with your significant other. Otherwise, it also supports up to 4 players, locally or online but not both. Imho, the more players, the more joyous the gameplay is. However, it seems that nowadays few players are online so it is quite rare to gather 4 players.I recommend interested players to buy the Gourmet Edition to have access to both the main game and all its DLCs (which offer more cooks, more kitchens, more recipes and new enjoyable gameplay mechanics). It takes my wife and me around 50 hours to get all the achievements. After 100% achievements, if you still want to challenge yourself, there is a 4th star to get for each level. Beware though: some levels are frustratingly difficult to get the 4th star.A little complain though: this game is not very well optimised for MacOS. The fan runs fiercely when I play it on my mac with M1, even with only 1440*900 as resolution and the lowest graphics setting."

I had this big epiphany moment. I thought to myself, ""why am I wasting away at my office job, that I don't really love, when I now know my passion is making sushi and three, sometimes 4 ingredient pizzas?"". I knew then that I needed a career change. I cut off my entire family. I enrolled in a culinary arts program at my local college. I graduated with honours.

You really get the best results from playing with others and the challenges vary so it gets interesting between stages. You can just play casually or challenge yourselves in getting full stars. This isn't only limited to those with you physically. You can play online with others, now especially in these unprecedented times.

I love (almost) every bit of this game, and the game's online matchmaking makes it all worth it. Every single kitchen has some sort of gimmick to it, forcing the players to change up their strategy for each one. Dynamic kitchens, where the layout changes after some time, are always the best, but for some reason can't be played in the game's arcade mode. Either way, all kitchens are fun to play a round on. Except 5-3. Don't talk to me about 5-3. The game's soundtrack is amazing, the large amount of chefs you can pick from is great, and on top of it all, as of the time of writing, you get 5 free mini worlds, and can buy 4 great DLC worlds, adding even more of everything mentioned above.What I don't like about this game: Level 5-3.

It works both as a co-op multiplayer game, or a single-player game if you're up for the multitasking challenge.Overall, the game is fun to play with friends, but it is also playable on your own if you practice a bit. Patience is key, either way! Here are some extra detailed reviews about the game:•  This depends on how well your connection is to the host of a server. If you or the host has poor connection, the game would be unplayable for affected players. Also, there are a few glitches that may cause players to disconnect from the host.•  The game features some challenging obstacles and hazards that can sometimes be frustrating, but they can also yield to hilarious situations!•  If you care so much about your scores, you might want to keep in mind to use different save slots for your solo saves, co-op saves, etc.(I will mark this item as a spoiler because this involves a late-game mechanic)•"

Overall overcooked 2 is a bit expensive in my opinion (approx $35 nzd) however, it's still worth the money. Note; playing with a guy named Matthew267811 will give you a headache."

1519,The Goddamn Fatman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dinod8/,1,,1,61.8,July,"6,",498,0,1,"Overcooked 2 is an amazing local co-op game on PC, perfect for a game-night or dorm setting. The music is fine, and the art is cute but the gameplay is very tight and fun. You can play this game very simplistically, just running to do each thing one at a time and turning them in but where it really shines is when you go for a new high score and really try to optimize everything.Compared to Overcooked 1, I think 2's levels and difficulty are not as good. A lot of/more levels in 2 are very gimmick-y and barely about the core timing management aspect but rather avoiding death pits/navigating wind/etc. 1's ice levels (and lava levels to a lesser extent) were like this but 2 really doubles down. In addition to these chaotic maps, getting 3 stars is much easier in 2. In 1, my friend and I very rarely got a 3 star on our first try and we'd have to plan for that level. In 2, we often got it on our first try, making somewhat large mistakes and still beating it by a large margin. It's not as fun when you can play poorly and still do fine.The devs added a free NG+ like mode by adding a 4th star to every level but that swings the other way and is ludicrously challenging IMO. Still, OC2 is worth it if only because of online play and the addition of a new mechanic - throwing. Throwing is a fun, skill-based/rewarding way to cut corners and shave off seconds and it feels good to dunk the steak into the frying pan. It's just too bad it's often not even necessary."

Oh yes, anyway. If you can stand the screaming and yelling this game is pretty awesome and great with a group."

What you're really getting are 30+ new levels challenging players to run a kitchen amidst all the hilarious, zany, chaos. For those who felt getting 3 stars was easy, a free update added a 4 star difficulty challenge which requires excellent  teamwork from your fellow chefs, or coordnation if you're controlling two chefs by yourself. The 4 star challenges require near flawless playing and adds replayability to the game. Most importantly with the addition of online multiplayer, Team17 have really added to the awesome experience that was Overcooked; and though my time with the game was short, the days I've spent playing with the people on the game's official discord were very enjoyable.

While the constant practice and the ferocious pace can be very taxing, being able to create the perfect dish is a very rewarding experience.  With the initial success of the original ,  looks to build upon what has already been made to create a delicious second course to their meal. puts you and up to 3 other chefs back into the Onion Kingdom to fend off the next threat that terrorizes the land.   brings The Unbread, puns abound throughout, to stumble through and its up to our chefs' hands, and tools, to help satisfy The Unbread's hunger.  Don't expect a whole lot of plot in , as this is mainly a placeholder to give the chefs a paper-thin reason to be where they are.The name of the game is to make meals and make them fast.  The chefs take their stations in a vast amount of areas: from up in the clouds in hot air balloons, to rafts down swamps, to magical doors in a medieval castle.  Meals will need to be made for The Unbread, which they will constantly be pouring in orders during the 3-5 minute rounds. Completed meals will grant the chefs points, with a tip for a quick delivery, as well as deliveries in the correct order; get enough in the allotted time, and you can earn up to 3 stars in each level, which these will help you unlock new characters, as well as progress through the story.The Unbread are a hungry bunch, so chefs will be tasked with making all sorts of meals.  Starting with easy combinations as a tomato and cucumber salad, to more intricate dishes: meat lover's pizza, mushroom pasta, and seafood sushi to name a few.  Chefs will use frying pans, ovens, chopping boards, mixers, and much more to prep and cook.  Once a groove is set and chefs feel comfortable with the frantic pace,  will throw wrenches into the well-oiled machine.  Chefs will have to throw specific items across pits to other chefs who can only cook in a certain part of the level.  Some levels will have small fires pop up that will need to be put out, with some levels using rotating equipment to throw chefs off their game, and make sure to wash those dishes!After doing battle with The Unbread,  includes a Arcade and Versus mode for chefs looking to continue cooking.  Arcade allows players to play levels in the story and compete for the highest score, while Versus pits chefs against each other to see who can crank out the most meals in the allotted time.  If you're feeling a real challenge, beating Story mode grants a sort of New Game Plus addition by giving each stage a 4th star to earn.  These stars require the utmost concentration and communication from the team of chefs, and will require a lot of pre-prepping dishes and coordination in roles.While multiplayer is clearly the name of the game for , single-player feels a little lacking.  While you control multiple chefs, it's not quite the same feeling as being in the fast-paced gauntlet with friends, yelling at each other about orders, and celebrating 3-star victories.  The Story map requires the player to hit switches that are semi-hidden in the world in order to get towards the next level, and it's really confusing as to why these were put into the game in the first place.  They serve really no purpose other to temporarily halt the player from speeding onto the next level, and just feels unnecessary. has an amazing ability to not only bring up to 4 people together to work harmoniously in a hectic environment, but to have real laugh-out-loud fun for hours on end doing it.  The simple art style, addicting gameplay, and tactical levels really bring a joy to cooking, even if your friends don't think you can do it."

My friends and I progressed through the levels fairly quickly (although we haven't finished), but I'm not sure if that's more of a testament to us figuring out a system/good communication (my friends are especially articulate and aware of their surroundings). Game Mode+ was a nice addition, and I appreciate the developers' alacrity when it came to remapping keys (this was a big issue when four of us were sharing one controller and my laptop keyboard on OSx).My only request would be some kind of reward for getting to four stars in NG+; the achievement in it of itself is nice, but... *something* would be nice? Something simple; another unlockable cook, maybe? Otherwise I'd be more than happy with the addition of a couple of more formal Steam Achievements. It doesn't have to be an in-game thing."

On the other hand, I feel so frustrated when playing.It's one of the few games that made me feel like I failed hard, even when I get three starts in a level. This is really not good design.Playing on one of the later stages requires a lot of coordination, and it feels like some levels are really designed for three or four players, which is a bit troublesome if you play alone or only with one friend. Perhaps this is intentional, but still a bit frustrating.All in all, I would say my feelings for this game are mixed. It did have its moments, but it's very exhausting to play if you want to get three stars in each level."

So I was very happy hearing the second installment had online co-op! I've played through the game about 2.5 times now, once couch co-op.I thought it was a very fun and hectic game. Yelling at eachother, throwing tomatoes in eachothers face, really good. A lot of the levels are pretty easy, with some extremely hard ones. The game is quite short though, took probably 5-6 hours to complete. I really hope more levels, or a level builder, will be added free of charge since the price is a bit steep for what it is.There are some problems:When playing online only the host receives the new chefs and progresses in the story (however I read the chefs thing is a bug so I hope they fix soon, and they also said they are looking into changing the way online works).When we finished a world in one sitting the joined player would get achievements, otherwise did not.There is some other minor bugs, plates/pots getting stuck in countertops for instance, but didn't happen often enough for it to be a bother.What really was a bother was the lag that sometimes was experience during an online session, we've played for hours without issue but at some point there was a crazy lag which resulted in a lot of falling off platforms. Besides that the game crashed three times in an hour for the joined person (which was me, but didn't have issues when hosting). So yes, the game has issues, some major problems some minor. It was/is still a blast to play and I do really hope some more content is added, because it's a bit expensive for the current content.If you really want to play online and have the money, I would say get it. Otherwise get overcooked 1 (very good discount right now) and wait for the bug fixes and maybe a price drop."

I had a lot ot fun with my wife. It was much easier than the first game. I see the general improvements like online lobbies. But we had no difficulties in making the last boss fight at first glance. I am looking forward for a new game+ DLC or some online matches to fulfil the last achievements. So far I was too hyped for Overcooked 2 and got disappointed by the non existing challenges in comparison to the first game. Although I can recommend the game as it is a lot of fun.

Makes everything more challenging and definitely more fun! The throwing feature was something I didn't know I need and I love it when I throw a chopped piece of food right onto the pan. The online multiplayer is alright, I think there isn't as many players in South East Asia so I have to wait really really long to actually find someone to play with. Hopefully there will be more people in the coming weeks. I came from Overcooked 1 where my friends and I spent HOURS on each level just to get 3 stars. We even strategise before playing each level to maxmise our efficiency to get the 3rd star. The new one is too easy. We overshoot the 3 star points all the time and it doesn't feel like we 'worked hard enough' to earn those stars like in Overcooked 1. TL:DR Make the game more challenging to get 3 stars (I guess just change the scoring?) If you're thinking on getting whether O1 or O2, go with this one."
1721,sam,https://steamcommunity.com/id/prometheanvita/,2,,1,32.1,August,"9,",639,0,1,"This game is a welcome sequel to one of my favorite games--co-op or otherwise--of all time, Overcooked. This game takes the strong foundation of the original game and innovates in meaningful ways on gameplay, map design, and even level selection. They've refined the co-op experience to feel more fluid and organic, while levels don't seem to suffer the pitfalls of design that some of the more bothersome levels of the original have. With a cute cast of characters, smart writing, and clever little details interwoven in every facet of the game, this game is a winner.That being said, the best litmus test for whether or not you'll like this game is to honestly play the original. This game starts you off strong, teaching you a new recipe in every single level stage that I can easily imagine would be a bit overwhelming for players brand new to the Overcooked series. By all means it's not impossible to jump into this title without playing the first, but new players definitely might find some of the complexity a bit much right from the start.Overcooked 2 is well on its way to becoming as beloved a game in our household as the original, and for very good reason. Overcooked 1 + 2 offer fun, clever co-op couched in a cute style, snappy writing, and engaging gameplay."

You have to be a host to get all of them (tons of replayability but at what cost)- From time to time a lagspike happens. At one moment i'm running on the left to my friend but then I end up bumping into him in the next second (rarely happens though and it was with online multiplayer)PROS:- Brings tons of hours to play (even if we ignore the fact of unlockables) we can still play online with others, competitively, together, at home...etc- Very challenging levels! At some point we struggeled with my buddy but still had fun in the end.- Graphics and music are amazing alltogether!PERSONAL SUGGESTIONS:- Personally I was missing some of the old recipies (like fish and chips or soup) and stages (actual space not planet)- Listen to the community a little bit more perhaps... (online multiplayer was a good thing you listened to but theres so many possibilities we would go within the game that would bring more value to the game example: editable stages, unlimited survival...etc)SUMMARY:A great game to play for long hours while enjoying the game itself, even if it causes some frutrations at times due to online connections or 1-2 overly complicated levels (yes im looking at you ""cars and wind strike obstacle Kevin level"") but all in all with all the amazing features the game has the coomunity will be satisfied... for now...Until we meet again!

It's a good game to get if you're a fan of overcooked or if you're looking for a game to play with family and friendsUnlike the previous overcooked, this has much more mechanics which will really test your teamwork and without proper communication it will lead to a total disasterThe dev have done a really good job in enhancing the chefs model and the surrounding design.They also have a so called online system which allows you to play with friends online!Just like any other games, this as well has room for improvements which may or may not applies for everyone.  : I always feel that to obtain 3 stars in overcooked, everyone should do their part and play the mechanics properly and be punished for making mistakes. However it seems that even with bad gameplay it's easy to obtain 3stars which makes it feel that there's no incentive to perform well. : This can be applied in overcooked 1 at stage 5-4, 5-5 whereby it's a pain in the ass to complete. As you progress along in Overcooked 2 you will feel that some stage design were questionable in terms of complexity, like the devs wanted to create alot of chaos but they were not quite there. : As much as I hate to say this, if you played overcooked solo and then proceed to overcooked 2 solo, you would agree with me that the solo gameplay in overcooked 1 is much better than the latest series. However, it's the problem mention above and the new feature that kind of leads to this problem which is the reason why it's better to play this with friends. Getting 3stars in every stage with ease makes solo players feel that the game is too easy to play, Semi bad solo stage design makes solo plays very painful and some other things that I might missed out. : From what I've observed, their online feature is a Peer 2 Peer model which means if you have friends whom you wan to play with in lets say New York, he/she will have to play with about 200+ping or something like that and you know, casually hangs once in awhile. : This 1 I'm just being anal, I prefer overcooked 1 chopping sound effects compared to the 2nd series.

There were lots of improvements made to do with polishing up the movement and I liked the idea of being able to throw food, but this game lost something. In the original, every level eventually fell into complete chaos, and it struck a really good balance between chaotic and not being frustrating, but this one just didn't have that. The unpredictability felt very forced, and once we'd had one try at a level we knew what would happen, so it wasn't fun to try again.On top of that a lot of the new content (like the pvp stuff) was all locked behind another paywall, which I really didn't appreciate.

The pros:- really fun gameplay, especially for hotseat (which was why we bought it really)- lots of new dishes, although I wouldn't mind some more- no bugs worth mentioning- works like a charm with steam controllerCons:- We didn't encounter anyone in the online play, wonder what's up with that- It's a bit overpriced for what you get. If you're unsure, I'd recommend that you buy it on sale- Not really a con - the soundtrack of the first game was a bit more memorable and catchy than this one, though I like it reagrdless.*The gf says buy it anyway."

Incredibly simple mayhem.Overcooked 2 has tweaked the recipe (!) to make simple mayhem more complex. The addition of online multiplayer has bridged a problem i had with overcooked, which was that as a 40 year old, my friends don't really come round to play computer games with me anymore. They havent done for probably 15 years.So online multiplayer sounds amazing. And it is. BUT.Without chat support, a way to communicate more directly with players, the issue is it is damned hard without open comms. Which now brings it around to making it necessary to convinging your friends to buy it and play it with you. Atleast they can now play from the comfort of their own homes and countries.Problem is . . . How do you convince someone to buy a game about a cooking panda making sashimi and cakes? . . . In conclusion, a great little game, but how much longevity does it have? especially at 22 euros. Now if it was 10 or 11, i reckon I could convince quite a few people to buy it. But at full price, few will take a nibble."

The game is great & really fun but there is a big problem with the graphics. There's a million tiny pink & green dots all over the screen that makes it terrible to look at. Looking up solutions, apparently quite a few people have had this problem and the dev team's only solution was to have you send them your computer's info so they could basically tell you that your graphics card wasn't good enough. While I do have an admittedly older system, it can run any other, newer game just fine. My sister has a newer system and it too can't run the graphics correctly. I shouldn't have to buy a shiny new graphics card to play the game, so it would be great if the devs could fix this on their end instead of having the players do it. Other than that, like I said its a great game and really fun to cook with your friends. The art style (without the dots) is cute and the gameplay is unique. Definitely improved on the first Overcooked game (esp. with the better multiplayer connection). Definitely recommend esp. if your graphics card is good. :)"
1755,15x,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hrsitmolfm/,2,2,1,"1,056.0",December,"26,",62,0,1,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

An absolute buy for people who like food related games, adorable graphics and CHAOS! It's great to see that there were different free seasonal updates for players but also DLCs with new recipes and chefs for people who can't get enough. I ended up getting every single DLC for this game because it's just that much fun, especially since different DLCs adds new mechanics and themes! The game definitely has it's challenging components, especially when trying to get 4* for all the levels when you're playing as a duo even when you do everything perfectly so I wish there was a slight tweak in the scores required to achieve 4*. However, If you're not a completionist you'll definitely be able to get through the whole game pretty easily. Unfortunately if you're a single player person the game is probably not going to be as fun or achieveable. Definitely an upgrade with the game mechanics and playability than Overcooked 1.Eagerly awaiting for the upgrade scheme for ""Overcooked! All You Can Eat""Hope there will be a Overcooked 3 or new level updates in the future. :)"

BUT do not get this game if you intend on playing it with young children. I try to play this with my 5yo girls, and the learning curve is so steep when trying out new levels. Delegating tasks can be so stressful it stops being fun. Every time we want to play a new level there's tons of stuff we have no idea how to cook or assemble. It would be nice to have a more expansive tutorial, and maybe even an EZ Mode for parents like me that want to play this with their kids who also want to play the game with them. Maybe even a ""creative"" or ""free mode"" without a timer just so you can try to get the hang of learning the dishes (or even just an option to expand the timer a la Easy, Medium, Hard difficulties). Something less punishing so you can build up to the more intentional hectic pace. I still recommend this game as it IS a ton of fun and can see how fun it would be with competent friends playing together, and the game itself is made really well. I just wish I could play it with my kiddos more without us all stressin'. Might put this one on the back burner until they are a couple years older."

It was a mess. And I mean . Mouse was screaming for clean plates while Panda was dashing around and shrieking about how the kitchen should not be on fire. Shark had to pause the game because he was running out of air laughing.Later in the game, the three had to call in reinforcements because the levels are getting harder, and so, joins Cat. The training was hard and includes a lot of Cat falling into the void. Nonetheless, Cat's paws are definitely what they needed to achieve culinary greatness.Going through the game, the formerly goofy chefs continually learned on how to cooperate and finally became heroes that the Onion Kingdom needed.Seriously though, if you have some friends to play with, a couch, a device to play the game on, and some sort of interface to control your chefs, you HAVE to try this game. The price is worth it for the good times you're about to have. By the way, local co-op is more recommended since you can't beat up the person who throws the finished dish into the trash can in online.15/10"

That people encounter complications with this is a bummer, but not particularly word a non-recommedation.I have played a few worlds of this game locally with a friend, and we were happily surprised with the difficulty and improved visuals, animations and gameplay elements. Throwing is hilarious, especially if you manage to throw the cheese onto the pizza, and adds a new skill for the players to learn. In the world menu, the car changing shapes depending on the surface is traveling on is quite fun, as well as the switches you have to press.The game is literally an Overcooked 2.0.

The levels offer a variety of creative challenges that have often kept us on our toes. Generally, I'd say it's important to play this as a team of 4 people that can talk with each other (it's certainly the ideal), but if you fall a bit short of that, the game will scale down the score requirements of each level to account for your handicap.It's a good experience trying to 100% the game. Initially, you're only challenged to score well enough to earn 3 stars on each level, which will require you demonstrate an understanding of the workflow that a level demands of you. Not too hard to accomplish, but it requires a bit of thought and coordination. Once you've gotten through all the levels, they give you the real challenge of earning a 4th star on each level, which often demands a nearly perfect performance. You don't have to be insanely skilled to make it possible - our team has our share of bumbles and confusion along the way - but the goal is to get as close as you can manage to working like a well oiled machine as you blitz through orders.We've laughed, we've screamed, we've jumped off the ledges and drowned in our despair... Awesome group game.The only thing stopping me from saying this game is perfectly executed is the fact that the interactions can be fiddly sometimes. The game does it best to figure out what you're trying to pick up or put down based off of what direction you're vaguely facing in, and sometimes if you're in a rush you can end up struggling against that and/or being caught off guard by it. It's not a big enough deal to stop my group from earning 4 stars on every level, but it can cause some confusion in high pressure moments if you're trying to press buttons at the soonest POSSIBLE moments or have littered an area with too many items on the floor. So overall, that can be frustrating by I also think most of its interference goes back to user error to some extent. I'd rate the game as 9/10."

However, key-binding has since been introduced post-launch and I have been quite enjoying the game. Difficulty spikes of levels are left to be desired as at one level you can breeze through it no sweat yet the next you are busting your arse off trying to even reach 3 stars, and the game can be considerably short if you manage to 3 star every level in one go. Improvements that I can think the game can make the game better includes making the environment more detailed, such as customers actually receiving our food, and allowing us to use the money we earn to actually do something like upgrading equipment or placing decorations. I also love the constant seasonal free and paid updates the game have been getting, but I do want more achievements please. Also, the connection is horrible at times. The game would freeze for a few seconds at a time if you were to fall down. Lastly, one of the levels can be hard to play for people with motion sickness, so do be wary. Multiplayer mode exist but it’s just more of the same, either compete with each other to get the best score, or allow the system to randomly pick a level for you to play.

My friends got me to start playing it one random afternoon and I now own it on multiple platforms. Great for small groups of friends and is significantly more fast paced than I anticipated! The story mode is playable with up to 4-friends and I think that's really fun! I just wish it has more options for versus and arcade mode rather than what seems to be the 1st level of each ""world"" in the game. The DLC is also fun and challenging! Overall, this is a really enjoyable game despite the lack of versus variety. Would definitely recommend!"

Definitely worth getting !-----The first one was an amazing game and gave us tons of hours of fun. So I preordered this one without hesitation, and I was a tad disappointed.By absolute standards, this is an excellent game. But it feels more like a polished version of the previous title. Graphics and usability have been greatly improved, but it falls a bit short on content, especially given the price.The only real new gameplay mechanic is ingredient throwing. At the beginning, you may get the impression that the world map will add an exploration/navigation challenge and nonlinear progression, with a traditional color-coded key-and-door mechanism, but that turns out to be a red herring. I'm happy they removed the boring soup recipes, and the dumpling/pancake/cake recipes are interesting, but I expected more variety.Difficulty has been drastically lowered. I'm playing with my wife, Overcooked! 1 took us about 20 hours to finish and we had to retry many levels multiple times. We finished this one in half the time and got 3 stars on the first try on all but a few levels, sometimes racking up ridiculously high scores.It really should have been called Overcooked!: Redux. I hope DLCs will add more content at a reasonable priceEDIT: The NG+ mode may change the deal very much, thanks !"

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Can be super fun and addictive when you're having a couch co-op party over. But, playing it alone REALLY makes you feel lonely, though in this sequel the dev have addressed to that problem, this is still a best played in co-op game.So some advises to those who plan to buy this game:[1] If you plan to buy this and play it alone, you will definitely find it a lack luster. Although compared to the first series, this one actually put the solo players into consideration in design.[2] If you plan to use this game in a house party/play it with your family, this is definitely a great choice.[3] Unlike their other titles, this one actually have an online match maker. So you don't really have to play alone if you have no one to invite over for a coach play, especially during the Pandemic where everyone stays home and can't visit others easily. As long as you have a good internet connection, this game can provide long hours of fun.Gameplay itself, like the first series, is very exciting and the time rushed limit makes your heart beat almost as fast as those horror games. And it gets more and more difficult over stages. Definitely will give a good laugh when playing with friends or on this case, online co-op. The title menu is more easier to navigate than the first series, and it certainly provide ways of play style suitable for all needs, may you want to play the game solo and offline, you can. If you want to play it at home co-op during party or with family, you can too. If don't want to play alone but has no one to play with, you can try their online co-op play.If you are in for the fun, just avoid those serious players when you're playing online. They play the game for perfection, taking it more seriously than their jobs in real life. If you don't mind repeating the same thing over and over and over again until you perfect it, then yes, you are probably one of them. And the best of them perfect stuffs and guide those alongside them to perfection at the same time. But for a player that plays for the fun alone, you will probably call it off after repeating the same stages a few times and call it boring, just like any MMO games out there. Honestly speaking, couch play is more fun when played with jokes and laughter with someone you actually know and able to see their reaction real time."

1998,Jarago,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jarago/,2,,1,57.3,August,"21,",323,0,1,"Overcooked: All you can eat Edition Warning - Overcooked AYCE is literally the same game, that already contains all DLC's + devs are making more DLCs exclusively for Overcooked AYCE. Unfortunately those, who bought everything in overcooked 1 and 2 are left out as none of the new content is not included in this version. Therefore if you don't own any overcooked yet, AYCE is a better choice for you. Anyway, since it's still the same game, this review applies to AYCE as well.Overcooked is a game where your task is to prepare requested foods as fast as possible. Sort of similar to old browser or mobile games, but this time on PC and improved! A good one! There are two main features that make this game unique:- Cooperative nature of the game makes this perfect party game to play on couch or online. Game truly requires communication with coop partners for effective goal fulfilment of each level. - Dynamic level design. Levels often change the placement of ingredients on map in the middle of level, add some crazy condition like kitchen in the middle of car traffic or on air balloon and introduces new recipes every couple levels. Every level is unique.Each level can be completed with star rating - up to 3 stars as best results with also unlockable 4th star goal. Each level has a time limit during which players can work towards the goals. These star goals seem a bit imbalanced in the first half of the game, as it is quite easy to reach 3 stars on first try. Reaching 4th star is however quite the opposite and requires truly masterful performance/ Game also offers training mode without time limit and versus mode where players play against themselves for best score in mirrored kitchens. As game lifetime progressed, some free DLCs were released themed around xmas and chinese new year, which add couple more levels with new gameplay features. + Fun & enjoyable cooperative experience+ Dynamic and unique levels- Some environment mechanics may be a bit annoying, like random flame strikes and moving islands.- A bit too easy to earn 3 stars in first half of main campaign8/10Conclusion: Must buy for local parties and for fans of cooperative focused gamesDLC Reviews - as i don't want to write for each DLC separately, ill describe them here:Offers couple new levels (about half a lenght of main campaign). Star goals are significantly more difficult than main campaign, making is much more balanced; makes 3rd star quite difficult to achieve. Campfire features requires players to chop wood to light up campfires. Another new feature in couple levels is ingredient backpacks, which players carry around with them. Personally disliked backpacks as they only made a mess and were annoying to work with.+ Campfires+ More balanced star goals, also more difficult- Backpack featuresConclusion: If you enjoy main game, you wont be disappointed. Adds about 20 new levels featuring some new mechanics, one of the main ones being horde levels where you have to prepare meals for horde trying to break through to your kitchen. First half of the DLC is easier, late horde levels may get quite difficult and long. Hovewer when lot of things happen at once, you may go crazy from all the warning beepings. Other than horde mode, there is little number of minor new mechanics. Worthy addition for those who loved main story mode.+ Good addition; horde mode offers fresh take on game- Beeping on horde mode may get on your nervesConclusion: If you enjoy main game, you wont be disappointed. Latest addition to season pass brings once again nice amount of new recipes and gameplay mechanics like cannons. Star goals seem to be balanced nearly perfectly here and new levels are very enjoyable. + Fun new recipes, mechanics and levels! No negatives here!Conclusion: Would be first DLC on must buy list for overcooked.DLC once again brings couple extra fun levels to beat. Couple new recipes are introduced. Only negative i'd give this is this DLC not being part of season pass and has to be bought separately.+ fun new recipes and levels.- is not part of season pass and has to be bought separatelyConclusion: If you enjoy main game, you wont be disappointed. Personally don't own this one as they only add skins for chefs, but its nice way of showing support to devs."

There is probably no other game out there like this game if you think of a cooking arcade-genre game, full of fun and laughter, when you play with friends, family or anyone, and this game can be played co-op or versus. Doesn't matter if you win or fail. It will give you laugh when you fail, and satisfaction when you win the score. This game is casual but with its stage-based and score-based concept, it could be challenging to your hand-eye coordination if you want to get the highest score in the game. Cons is you'll probably get bored fast if you play solo. Here's a good news: you can play any DLC in online multiplayers, as long as the host own it. The other players don't have to own the DLC."

Great co-op game and gets harder just after tutorial ( good thing )CONS: Although the graphics are ok, and the maps have lots of detail, the playable area is too small compared with the rest of the map ( just decoration ). This means that in anything smaller than 22inch the game gets quite small to play. The screen zoom should be adjustable to account for this. Specially since its a co-op game and the area for each player is divided even further."
2128,mad cuz bad,https://steamcommunity.com/id/profide/,1,,1,55.2,June,"10,",155,0,1,"The Onion Kingdom, still ruled by the wise and competent Onion King, is in trouble yet again. The Onion King’s camping trip, beachside vacation and circus festival (which are parts of separately bought DLCs) are also a mess, which is surely a coincidence and has nothing to do with the royal person… Fortunately you are going to help, and you can be much better at it now than in the original Overcooked, for a few reasons.Overcooked 2 includes real online multiplayer apart from couch multiplayer and streaming via Remote Play Together. This is a very welcome improvement – of course the game can be played comfortably via streaming, and your team only needs one copy of the game that way, but online multiplayer provides the best latency and responsiveness. When you are chasing the highest scores, or when one or more participants don’t enjoy a fast and stable internet connection, this is invaluable.Game mechanics are vastly changed, because cooks can now throw raw ingredients. Throw things into pots, throw them to your teammate, throw them at your teammate or just throw in desperation – the possibilities will make you wonder how did you manage to play Overcooked without this skill. Throwing changes the dynamic of the game a lot, but mechanics are overall still easy to grasp and execute even for casual gamers.If you have a perfectionist streak, prepare for a harrowing experience. After beating the game you can replay kitchens for an attempt at reaching an even higher, 4-star score threshold. Even the 3-star thresholds are badly chosen on some levels played in a 2-person group, and some of the 4-stars seem to be straight up impossible. Luckily – if you buy the story-based DLCs – there are tons of new kitchens, ingredients and recipes to explore. That, plus an arcade mode which provides a ton of randomly chosen kitchens, make for a lot of replayability. A great portion of full priced AAA games are much shorter. I did not enjoy 2-person versus mode much: controlling two characters was a lot more troublesome to me (and it's the same when you play solo).I strongly recommend playing on a controller. Throwing at other than right angles is hard or impossible with keyboard and mouse; you can play and enjoy the game, but you won’t be a ."

I've gotten through majority of the story mode with just one section left, and so far I've enjoyed it. The game offers a challenging experience whether you play solo or with friends. Striving to achieve 3 stars for each level makes the game intense. Playing with friends puts your communication skills to the test. It's interesting to see how either goes.I love that the game is also online multiplayer. I've played with people online and communicating without speech is another interesting challenge. There's also a survival and practice mode, which is pretty neat. There's so much content for the game that I can't imagine getting bored with it. The multiplayer mode will make each game a different experience since you're playing with various people who also play in their own way.On top of the fun game play, the style of the game is also really cute. It's really polished compared to the older game. If you've never played Overcooked! 2, I definitely recommend it to anyone interested. Despite the game being a couple of years old, it's still very entertaining and a purchase I'd never regret."

I paid $25 for this game and wished for a good game but the gaming experiences are just not good. I bought this game because it has good graphics and it looks interesting. Then I played it, I realized that this game's single player mode is REALLY JUST YOURSELF. You can't have the option to play with a PC or something. Even though this mode gives you more time but it's just not fun to keep switching back and forth between characters. I wanted to play this game because it has an online multiplayer feature. I'm assuming that's one reason why most people bought it. The problem is that this mode isn't really stable yet. Sometimes I will see myself floating around, suddenly disappear in the game, failed to grab something, or transporting to different spots without my control (I'm pretty confused). My friend and I actually have to get a VPN to play the online multiplayer mode. When my friend isn't around, I thought about playing with others at the public center, but no one ever showed up. It almost made me feel like I'm the only person who plays this game. Another thing is that the game design is a bit too hard I would say. Probably because I keep getting bugged out, the game just became even more difficult for me. My friend and I can barely play the newer levels without helps from others. Anyways, I'm still supporting you all because I liked the concept and game design (even though it's hard, it's still creative ;)  ). I just bought the DLC from you guys to show my support. However, I would suggest you guys work on the online multiplayer mode more. Make sure it's stable. I want a fun and stable gaming experience. Thanks."
2159,CesarDaSalad,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cesarthesalad/,6,,1,41.9,August,"24,",476,0,1,"I think other people reviewing this game are missing a key aspect: Yes I know it shouldn't be the case when you can do up to 4 players, but that's just the way it is. People's negative reviews are about 3-4 player games. If you have 3 or 4 players in a game, the stages will seem too easy. Of course they are gonna be too easy when you have twice the people you need to get things done. That's just how the stages' obstacles and timing is designed. So you'll have a much more fun and challenging experience with a single partner. Anyway, this game is fantastic as the first one, but even more so thanks to online multiplayer (which I said was the main flaw of the first one, the lack of online). You can indeed try 3 or 4 players, but the fun exists in that sweet spot where 2 players have to tackle all the mayhem."

The fact that I am now in my midterm with tons of exams and deadlines but I spent almost 14 hours playing since I bought it. I COULD NOT control my life, I headed downhill and I found just a tiny bit sense of control. And it was honest hard work. Or I am just a natural cook. Anyways, the graphic work is adorable. The gameplay is super easy to catch up. My friend who does not play game that often can comfortably hop on and enjoy. SHE HAS A HIGHER SCREEN TIME THAN ME!!! The music is 10000/10, very relaxing, even though I muted it for better concentrating. In conclusion, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! but watch out for your life :( I would love to tell you how I first knew this game too, but it would showcase strongly that I have another set of issues.

The gameplay involves working together with other players to prepare and serve meals in a busy kitchen. The levels are varied and creative, and the tasks required to complete them are often hectic and fast-paced, which can make for a very enjoyable experience. The game's art style is colorful and whimsical, and the sound effects are well-done.One aspect that I didn't like is that the game can become quite difficult as players progress through the levels, which can be frustrating at times. Additionally, the game requires a lot of coordination with other players, which can be difficult to achieve if you are playing with people who are not familiar with the game or who are not communicating well.Overall, I would recommend Overcooked! 2 to others who enjoy fast-paced, cooperative gameplay and don't mind a bit of challenge. It's a great game to play with friends and family."

We beat the main campaign in about 6 hours total, 3 starring every level. For most of the levels, we were able to 3 star them on the first attempt. Only a couple of levels gave us any real trouble, and the one level that gave us the most trouble was only due to the fact that the netcode is very poor. We both have good connections in our place, and I would let her host so that she would get all the progress (before they patched that) and so I would lag quite often when I would bump into her character. This one particular level I would repeatedly fall off the narrow islands connecting the two bigger islands, despite not walking into the water hazard my character would rubber band constantly, and end up in the water. It was extremely frustrating, and I think the level in particular is 6-2 (but I could be wrong about that). After you get through world 6 the campaign is over. There is versus and arcade but we never really got into that. They say they are planning on adding a New Game + variation down the line, which will be great when it's added.For the price (almost $30 CAD) I cannot recommend this game. If the game ever goes on a 50% off sale, and you liked the first one, it's definitely worth it. If you're a fan of the first one, you will definitely enjoy this game but I think for the price, you don't get enough content to justify the full price tag. I think what would benefit this game, would be a level editor that would support the Steam Workshop, that would be pretty awesome and add more than 6 hours of replayability. For now, we're just hoping the New Game + will be a fun and challenging addition.[Update] After not playing this game for about a month, I see an update in my steam and see that they've added new content. My girlfriend was excited, until we found out that it's 6 bucks. Now that's not bad for DLC in some cases however the game itself was almost 30 bucks (CAD) and released as an unfinished mess. Now that they've added New Game + (which is literally only a new star of difficulty) and shared progress, I guess the base game wont get anymore love. It's a shame because the game didn't take longer than a few hours to complete with one other person, and we 3 starred the entire game (before the 4th star difficulty came out). 6 hours to complete the entire game is not worth 30 bucks.If this game ever goes on a 75% off sale, absolutely it's worth it. But for the amount of content you  get for the price you're paying, absolutely not worth it now as of October 3rd 2018."

Seriously, 7 hours for a $25 game? We didn't bother to get 3 stars on the absurd ""wait for platform"" stages, but all the other we did 3 stars. And still finished in this little amount of time. This is pathetic, im not paying more $6 on DLCs just to get 12 more stages, come on. A reasonable good game but overpriced.

Very fast paced gameplay and no real room for mistakes in the later levels. My biggest complaint and really the one that makes it hard to enjoy this game for me is the controls on keyboard. Adding in the ability to remap them at least on PC would be extraordinarily helpful and make the game far more manageable and fun.Otherwise I unfortunately have to stick with the rating above. Grab a controller when you pick this game up.  NOTE THAT WHILE I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME, IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF IT'S LEVEL OF FUN.

You knew exactly what you had to do and where to improve, if you wanted to get ""3 stars"". Mastering a level after a good amount of practice felt great. Overcooked 2, on the other hand, has 100 times more levels, 2% of which are awesome, but the other 98% look like you will absolutely hate playing them. We couldn't understand what was going on, and, what is worse, the game didn't expect we would. You are given 3 stars if you perform just a bit better than terribly. We found it impossible to finish more than 3 levels in a row without getting tired and quitting the game.Don't get me wrong, it's still a decent game. It does look much better than the first one, but certainly doesn't feel nearly as good to play. For us it was a disappointment."

The first one was so perfect, it really raised my expectations for this dev team to go above and beyond in their next installment. Annndddddd..... crash landing to Earth.It is abundantly clear this game was not balance tested. At all. The only reason you wouldn't get 200% of the 3 star mark is if you got screwed by the poor level design. And then you would get your 200% on your second try. The gimmicks for the stages do not add to the original purpose of the game: to cook your orders and serve them. They're there just to slow you down, make you wait for platforms to reappear, or otherwise just get in your way.They patched the game with NG+ by adding a 4th star. This is an ok attempt at saving this but you still need to finish the game with 3 stars before 4 stars is unlocked. The 4th star is hard. Like endgame Overcooked1 hard or even harder, which is fantastic, and really should be in the original playthrough.Overall, this game was a big disappointment. Game developers never balance tested the game, and tried to throw in too many gimmicks that detracted from what made the first Overcooked perfect. This is a classic case of being too worried about the ""could you"" that they never considered the ""should you"".Get this game if you have 10 year olds who can't take losing."

Learning a new recipe whilst dealing with an obtuse layout AND that layout can alter several times during a mission ... its too much. Let people get to grips with your recipes THEN go silly with the level design-While we're talking about level design - out of bound areas:If you are going to have sections where you can fall off the map, having the penalty set as losing everything you were holding AND having to wait 5 seconds to respawn is too harsh. Its a party game, not a rogue-like-certain hazards are poorly optimised for 2 playersIm looking at your hot air balloon with fire spouting everywhere-it isnt funny when things go badlyThere are plenty of games where doing badly is hilarious - broforce, helldive to name but a few.-the pause button obscures 1/2 the map so you cant even plan who does what during a pause.-the throwing mechanic is fun, but an aim laser pointer would be a welcome additionBasically the concept is good, but the finished product is lacking - there are more fun co-op games out there"

2328,The_Tressonado,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jayklink/,1,,1,9.5,April,"29,",177,0,1,"*I have played many hours on another console*This may be an unpopular opinion, but I feel that Overcooked (both original and this sequel) have a fatal flaw that is one of the reasons that so few people get seriously hooked:Overcooked does not know what it is trying to be. Is it a casual or strategy? At first glance it appears to be a casual game in a similar vein to the Diner Dash Series. Unfortunately the strict time limits and overly complex variations that each level brings cause it to drop out of that category - You cannot just sit and muck around. The moment you get into any sort of comfortable groove, the game throws a different recipe, a new transportation system, or at the very least starts re-arranging the work space mid-level. The game never allows you to become very good at it, until it says ""well that was good enough for 3 stars, now move on""!So what is the genre? Is it a strategy game that requires careful planning and coordination in order to master? Well, yes... no... kinda. Its just too chaotic to be master-able. You can get very good, but never master it. It's like dangling a carrot on a stick.The game even seems to recognise this fact. You can fail many orders and do quite poorly in some levels, but still get all 3 stars. This self-acknowledged un-master-ability creates a kind of depressing air to the whole experience. Knowing you can never truly achieve a clean run in a game is kinda like designing a level in Mario Bros. that has unreachable coins. It just torments you. This, coupled with the random generation of most orders, means it doesn't feel like a strategy game, you can't really plan. If the game allowed you to play a more career style campaign - playing rounds to purchase new equipment and recipes, actually allowing you to feel progression, or at the very least made the length of each level far, far longer, it would be possible to curb the frustration that comes with the Chaos that it tries to bring to the table.Unfortunately, in its current state, Overcooked is a ""I don't know what to do until we fail twice"", and then ""oh that wasn't great but somehow we got all the stars"" kinda experience. Only add conveyor belts, pits, flames, portals, and every form of annoyingness thrown in. Think, would the game suffer without those things?Overall I do *like* the game, but I can't love it. The chaos is fun for the first few hours, but ultimately takes away from the game play long-term. I can only play it as a social experience."
2329,DowJones,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wendpap/,2,,0,31.3,September,"10,",397,2,1,This game is not at his full potencial right now. I played the first one and it is 100% better than the second.Overcooked 1:The challenge in the first one is to think how you can do more with less effort. Each scenario was really different from eatch other.Really hard to get all the stars to get to the next level. (It was soo hard that it is not that of a good quality lol)Overcooked 2:The challenge is to walk through the stages and not to cook more with less effort and time. Now is about a plataform game and not about perfecting your game.All scenarios sort of repeat the mechanics of previous levels and are not inovative.It is soo easy to get points that make me think that they are shifting their public to first graders.

The levels seemed overly chaotic in a weird way from the very beginning, and I also didn't like the recipies.The thing that made the first Overcooked good is it's challenging enough with a simple level sometimes, and then they threw in some nice simple but big twists.  I found Overcooked 2 just went insane early on.Maybe it's because I play it with my wife and kids, but I just didn't like it.  I could see if you were a hardcore group of friends wanting a silly crazy challenge, then maybe it fits the bill? Still not sure."

I've played a number of ""new"" games over the past year that are still being updated and significantly altered by their developers. They span across a variety of completely different genres, so not much point in me recommending a first person shooter to someone looking for a cooking simulator, but playing those other games has shown me what a developer that cares about their game can do, and I would encourage anyone interested in this game to consider other options before pledging their allegiance here."

2412,YellowCellPhone,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yellowcellphone/,11,1,0,0.9,January,"3,",274,0,1,"I really enjoyed Overcooked 1. It was a legitimate challenge to three star every level, and toward the end we only passed with concentration, assigned roles, a game plan, and a bit of luck. Some levels took us legitimately over half an hour of attempts to get a three star, but it was a decent and satisfying challenge and full of hilarious dumb happenings the entire way. Losing was fun, and victory at the end was worth it.Now in Overcooked 2 we found ourselves having smashed the three star requirement in about two minutes, usually while barely paying attention. The last minute of every level was spent throwing food at each other in a half-hearted attempt at staving off boredom, because why bother trying when we're already 200+ points ahead? I legitimately believe that in a 4 player mode, you'd still be able to hit 3 stars if 2 of your players were afk. If we played 1 as lazily and unfocused as we were during 2, we would not even have gotten a one star rating.I'm aware there's a NG+ that asks for a fourth star with drastically higher point totals, but me and my group cannot force ourselves to march to the end of the campaign if we legitimately are not having fun the entire way there. If there was a difficulty mode at the start of each game that raised the point requirements, or an option to start in NG+, or an option to remove the tip multiplier, I have no doubt we'd be sucked back and grinding for those stars. But after we finished the first area, we ran out of patience and closed the game.There's nothing functionally wrong with the game, it is a lot more polished and full of content compared to 1, but the lack of immediate challenge really killed its vibe. This is why I really do not like games that lock harder difficulties behind beating the campaign. I would recommend it to people who found 1 too challenging or too lacking in features, but I would advise people who enjoyed 1 for the challenge to walk away."

The lag has been a known issue since the games release, but given how it has not been fixed for 2 years, it is possible this issue will not be fixed.I assume the game itself is great seeing how it looks like more of the first game, but this game should be avoided if you are hoping to play online with friends."

However, this is not going to sway my views. This review is based on the final game.I never played the original Overcooked! but I can see this is a fun game. It's one of those games where you can either play a quick game or two before work, or a longer session when relaxing in the evening! There are several arenas, each a bit unique with different challenges. This game is best played with 3 other people to get the most out of it! There is a couch mode where if you have your buddies over, you can all use the same PC. Also online modes too. When searching for public games, sometimes you only manage to get 1 other player - but it could be because it is new. However, it was really good fun. It would benefit from some form of in-game chat as opposed to using Discord or whatever for doing it, as we couldn't reallly communicate. If you are in a lobby with a guy and you play a few games, you do end up learning what works best for each other ie one of you does the chopping, plating etc the other puts out fires, washes dishes and brings ingredients to the chopping boards etcI only spent about 1.6hrs playing, but I really like these ""pick up and play"" games - this ports well to the PC, Xbox, PS and mobile platform well - as the controls are simple. In fact, I play with a gamepad on the PC.All in all... would I recommend? Yes! It's not expensive - worth a punt or wait for the sale if you are not sure. Either way, it's a good, fun game. Will it end up being a best seller ? Probably not - but the sales should be steady.If you see me in game, say hi!"

The porting is not terrible but not great, either.For single player, the game is playable for about 10~20 minutes and then the difficulty ramps up to unplayable level. For multiplayer, you have to be 4 players to get anywhere in the game; if you are 3, the game splits you in an almost-always-bad way across most split maps.The maps are boring, frustrating and lack gameplay options to make them any better.The recipes are ok except it would have been nice to have a sandbox mode where you select the family of recipes to play with any map.The most annoying part is the strict time limit, that's not exactly fun at least imo; there is another gameplay but you only unlock it after playing in standard gameplay first and even that one is then limited.Overall this is one of those game I wouldn't recommend at all, not even if it were free."

(I'll check soon)It also has a free expansion that is basically a small summary of what the DLC provides, with a lot of variety of kitchens and environments.It is not recommended to play it alone, the fun is undoubtedly more intense with another person, so the work is divided and more rewarding.10/10 without a doubt"

For instance, Worms Revolution still kills it's own process on your opponents PC's whenever you deploy a parachute during the free fall. Instant win which anyone can abuse. But why bother to support the game, when you can just release another one, right?Now, with Overcooked being re-released... For starter, the first edition didn't even had an online multiplayer. This second edition has numerous network issues, such as desync when people teleport back and forth, or major bugs when you suddenly get random teammates in a private match.This game is currently in the early access stage."
2606,Mosche Dajan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/arixgold/,2,,0,6.0,April,"23,",146,0,1,"While Overcooked was simply amazing, this game gets a little out of hand. The levels tend to become too absurd and thus easily frustrating. The actual cooking is neglected and you only have to figure out the level design. If you do, you outplay the necessary 3* points easily. This kind of challenge, for me, destroys the entertainment of the game.As I always want to have 3* before moving on to the next level, on Overcooked 1, we sometimes had to redo the map because we were just short. In this one, I either restart because it's not going well or I'm at 150% of the necessary points for a 3* rating, which doesn't imply a balanced level design.To top it all off, sometimes you have to look for the ramp switch on the menu map for a minute to even access a level, because it's hidden somewhere outside of the screen range (see lvl 6 or 7, red switch/ramp), which is absolutely unnecessary and dumb.It's sad, but luckily there is at least one competitor which focuses more on kitchen efficiency than absurd level design.Update: After playing it through (5h), there's a next star level unlocked that's hard to achieve, so there is more of a challenge for a higher rating. My problem with the game, however, is still there unfortunately."

It's a fun coach game and does get more interesting and challenging as the levels progress while always aiming for 3 stars. Local coop is what makes it quite fun for me. Would recommend for those that just want to chilli at the coach and play with others and very family friendly. However Online game play has a wait time to find another player that is longer than 10 mins. Some minor bugs when throw objects close to the sink or stove. Also, to be noted that the dev's are working on a new game+, which would be awesome for more replay-ability. I would love it if the devs would release a level editor for making steam workshop level, can be fun designing your own nightmare kitchen."

However unfortunately the game does not let players other than the host unlock chefs and achievements which is lame, and the game is relatively short (easy) to beat / 3 star with a couple of competent friends. It's too easy on a couple levels honestly, we'd blow out the 3 star score by double or higher. I remember the first one being more difficult than this one even.And lastly there's not much replay value past the campaign unless you like Versus, because there's no endless modes or level creator, so we get what the devs gave us, and that's it."

Then after launching the game at the first time, the controls were unclear. It did not gave the option of playing with the mouse instead of keyboard (despite the simplicity of the mechanics). Furthermore, the level design itself was at least frustrating. Having moving ramps that pushed u to the other side while trying to chop things, or placing the ingredients  on the other side of the ""map"", having to throw around stuff, was at least frustrating for me. To conclude, the idea of the game, the graphics etc. were excellent. However, the level design, and controls were really frustrating. Would not recommend for impatient people."

Anything over is not worth the price especially with all the DLC additional prices.However, while the game is good, it's really outclassed by the original as the original has far better stage design, there's never a dull moment in the original stages. The amount of time I've spent standing around already because I have to wait for a platform is ridiculous to say the least.5/10EDIT 10/20/2019: I got to World 3-6 (solo play) before I stopped playing because I couldn't handle how boring the game was because of how often I was forced to wait for things regardless of how fast I was.

I played through the story mode with another player and it felt like it was just the right amount of challenge, you end up splitting the work and zoning out until you perfect whatever you're working on and it's very satisfying to complete a level. The only issues I have would be that the controls could be tighter, too often you've to cycle through items dropped in close proximity or you select the wrong table because your character turned slightly less than 1 degree of where you wanted them to be, also corner tables are annoyingly useless as you can't reach them. The game is far too short for how fun it is so I'd definitely recommend getting some DLC with it to make it last longer."

2957,RockstarCRO,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/,6,3,0,1.3,January,"22,",436,0,1,"I saw the game on sale and pulled the trigger. The game looked like it was casual and easy for anyone to jump into. Upon playing it further, I wasn’t too pleased with the game. As an avid gamer I didn’t mind it, but found the challenges a little bleak and boring after a while. The real reason I bought it was to bring friends and family who weren’t avid gamers into the mix. They found the first few levels easy enough, but later levels required too much skill with the controllers. Besides not being able to play with casual gamers who don’t like the game due to its complexity, I simply don’t find the premise of the game engaging. Overcooked 2 is a game based around completing orders as fast as possible. You (and possibly friends) are cooks in a kitchen tasked with fulfilling food orders. As far as the game premise goes, that’s about it. The levels change and provide different obstacles, but the premise stays the same throughout. You may play the campaign with up to four friends which is a huge positive for the game. The  is simple to figure and follow for veteran gamers. For the newcomers, it will take a lot of thinking and skill to move the character efficiently. The biggest difference between Overcooked 1 and 2 is that in two you’re able to throw the food. I’m not sure how sanitary that is, but it’s completely possible. Basic controls include character movement, movement boost (momentarily), interact, and throw. Different foods will require different methods of preparation. For example, fish will have to be cut up while rice will be put in a pot to boil. This was an interesting attempt to make the game dynamic. New players will have to take their time adapting to sequences, meaning they will have to learn how to put the recipes together. You can’t just throw a whole fish on a plate and hope by adding seaweed it will magically turn into sushi. You’ll also need to be careful not to overcook things unless you’d like to start a fire in the kitchen. The  are suitable to the game’s premise. It is meant to be a little goofy and silly and the devs did deliver that with the visuals. Your kitchen may be between two air balloons, in the middle of a busy street, or simply in a regular kitchen. What I do like is that there will be random factors that potentially can interfere with your orders. During one level, there will be random civilians walking through your kitchen that’s interestingly situated in the middle of a walking path. I do like the goofyness of these situations. The  are okay for the most part, nothing too over the top in this realm. I do wish they changed the music or added dramatic sounds when the kitchen starts to light on fire. Overall, the game is alright. I’m not recommending it as it’s not my type of game. I was disappointed when a fewer older family members and friends found it difficult to get into. The controls were a little clunky (think counter tops on the corner that don’t release food properly) and the difficulty in some levels rose a little too quick. I would rather recommend buying another couch party game."
2958,frontman12,https://steamcommunity.com/id/frontman12/,1,1,1,9.6,November,"3,",623,1,1,"8.5/10Once I saw that Overcooked! 2 had online co-op, I was ready to dive in. Much praise has been rightly bestowed upon the first title in the series, but I don't have any pals close enough for local co-op play. Therefore, this is my first experience with the co-op cooking title.When we started the first level, I was overwhelmed. Where are the ingredients? How do I need to prepare each one? Oh, we have to wash the plates? What do I do with this burned food? However, soon afterwards we found a rhythm. Overcooked! 2's ability to induce that feeling of ""flow"" within the player is superb. You're constantly thinking about your next steps - for instance, as a general rule, if you are making dishes that require beef, you'll want to be cooking it constantly. As it is one of the slowest ingredients to prepare, it can bottleneck your orders. A lot has been said about Overcooked! 2's ability to force players to communicate with each other. I found this to be 100% the case. Not only is it prudent to create an efficient division of labor with your partner, but certain levels switch kitchen configurations in the middle, so you'll need to adapt or switch roles on the fly. Although apparently the previous game didn't allow players to throw ingredients, I found this to be a very exciting aspect of the gameplay. Sometimes, you'll be able to throw ingredients directly into preparation, such as throwing pasta across the map into boiling water. Although I recently played a similar game, No Heroes Here, Overcooked! 2 displays a bit more creativity in the tasks required of players and stays fresh much longer.Although I loved the gameplay, Overcooked! 2 still has a number of irritations. First of all, I felt that the overworld was completely extraneous. You and your co-op partner will drive around in a bus from level to level, and you may need to drive over switches in certain locations to raise a ramp to the next stage. I felt that this added nothing to the title, and would much rather the levels simply continue one after the other. However, perhaps driving the bus gives the players a break from the tension inherent in the co-op gameplay. The story itself was pretty silly as well, but I suppose it's difficult to devise a great reason for these two cooks to be creating dishes in hot air balloons and on rafts in river rapids.A few quality of life enhancements would be:1) The ability to choose when to begin a level once players are in the kitchen. Perhaps players could have a chat about where the ingredients are, and who will take which duties beforehand? Then, perhaps the level would begin once a player touches an ingredient or item in the map. We often restarted maps, especially when shooting for performance benchmarks, because the first few minutes of each run were spent getting oriented.2) The ability to restart a level from the results screen. Very often, we'd want to shoot for that third star, but then we'd need to load the overworld, select the level again, and then watch another loading screen before taking another shot.3) It would be nice to have a separate menu that explains how to unlock each of the Kevin bonus levels. We had to find a guide outside the game to figure out what we needed to do. The Kevin levels are often wilder and more creative than the main game kitchens, so it would be a pity for players to miss out on this content because they didn't know how to unlock it.Hopefully, none of this comes off as nit-picky - I had a wonderful time with this game, and my co-op partner and I picked up the ""Surf n' Turf"" DLC immediately after completing the main game. If you're looking for a true co-op game that demands communication and coordination, look no further."

We were disappointed.  I'll speak shortly about non-gameplay related issues.This game, like the first, should most definitely be played with a controller.  If you do not own a controller like myself, the game is nearly unplayable.  I found my character constantly dropping items immediately after I had picked them up, which is a big problem in such a time-oriented game.  The controls for keyboard in general also just feel less responsive and more ""sticky"" than the first game, which also had poor but mostly functional keyboard controls.  Dashing feels less responsive in particular, and while the throwing button is a nice addition, I feel like it is simply too obvious an addition to warrant much praise.The user interface and menus were of poor quality in the PC version of the first game, and although they received a slight visual upgrade they remain the same in functionality in the sequel.  Trying to navigate them is a bit of a mess, especially when adding multiple players.   This is only a slight annoyance and you will get used to the nonintuitive menus eventually.The audio for the game is similar to the first, and is appropriate for the setting.  No complaints here.The story was more of the same with the Onion King telling you what to do as you are his chefs at hand.  I never cared for the story as the writing was lackluster.  That may just be me though, I see that some other reviewers feel as if the story has improved.------------------GAMEPLAY-------------------Now, surely the developers had focused their efforts on the gameplay since the rest of the PC version of the game seemed so unpolished.  Unfortunately I found that this was not the case, and the laziness of the developers was clear here as well.  The first game had a very fun but simple mechanic for its core gameplay.  You take the ingredients, process them appropriately, then combine them on a plate for the customers.  This trend continues in Overcooked 2, and the simplicity of this system would be fine if the developers wanted to put their energy into thoughtful level design. Unfortunately, the most limiting factor for both games is the subpar level design.  Some levels in Overcooked 1 were terrible, and made me wonder if the developers played their own game.  There were also a decent quantity of wonderfully designed levels in Overcooked 1 that kept my attention for quite some time.  Unfortunately the core gameplay is so simple that even the well designed levels would entertain for only a short amount of time.  The game desperately needed a level editor, which I can not imagine would be hard to implement.  I'm not saying making a level editor is easy, but with the grid-based design of Overcooked it certainly seems more adaptable than many other games to that end.  Instead we got 2 overpriced DLCs, one of which was completely AWFUL and the other was barely acceptable.  Now it seems that the developer has no plans to add a level editor, perhaps because they are afraid people will make levels that blow theirs out of the water so no one will buy their DLC.  They could solve that issue by adding new mechanics with DLC, but that would require some actual work and thought.  Unfortunately I did not make it far enough to see all the levels in this game as I refunded it, but it seemed to be the same mix-mash quality of some good, some terrible.While I'm sad that I didn't make it far enough in this game to enjoy some of the more well-designed levels, the game simply did not grab me like the first did, even with its glaring issues.  The core gameplay is so basic that it makes the developers seem extremely lazy when the rest of the game is so trite.  To add to this point, the game is ridiculously easy and provides no challenge to moving through the campaign.  This gives the player absolutely no sense of reward/progression.  The developer has plans to address this with the NG+ update, but for the game to be of such poor quality on release in this regard as well as the other issues indicates the developer is not the be trusted.

2998,Electronic Toaster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ElectronicToaster/,No,,0,0.2,November,"11,","1,032",0,1,"My playtime is low, but I played longer with a friend on their computer local coop. It wasn’t a long time.Overcooked seems to place two layers of complexity over the game. There are the foods you must cook. And there are the kitchen environments themselves.Both of these things change rapidly between levels. This was our experience in the story mode.Perhaps I was wrong to think that the story mode would offer a tutorial. I think that it was a tutorial technically. But if that’s what the game is like when it is stripped down, I am not sure how complex it will be later on. The rate at which it introduced new elements was ridiculous.Local coop games are supposed to be fun because chaos is generated via the many players trying t o work together. It is supposed to come from the players trying to play the game. The game itself is not supposed to be completely chaotic. I played with one other player. Each level starts with you being thrown into a kitchen with all the ingredients and cooking stations you need to use just randomly placed around the space. The timer starts. So you spend the first minute or two trying to figure out where anything actually is. This could take longer. For example, we both sat there for minutes sometimes trying to figure out where the plates were. Then you need to start making meals that are at the top of the screen. Some of these will be completely new to you. Then, you need to start figuring out how to even walk around the environment, because you are locked into small spaces or passageways and with moving conveyor belts. Then you have to figure out what some of the implements do because you might not have seen one of them before. Then you need to figure out how to divide the tasks up between the two players to be in any way efficient. Time is up!You can make any game chaotic very easily. Why don’t you just have the controls all randomly change. That’s fun. And chaotic. Or maybe the screen turns black sometimes. Or you are now controlling a different character to before. Or maybe you controls stop working sometimes. Why don’t you have a friend slap you in the face randomly. Imagine playing a difficult game with those things happening. I honestly think dealing with those things might be easier than the type of chaos given to you in Overcooked. Because at least the vast majority of the game is stable. These interruptions are momentary interruptions occurring to a generally stable game. This isn’t all the elements of the game in random order like Overcooked 2.And that is the thing that is important. Stability. Repetition. Some element of the game needs to be somewhat similar to the earlier bit for improvement to occur. Not even improvement, just ability to play the game. There are limits to human concentration. It is not unlimited. A person cannot see every ingredient and station on the screen, organise a completely different plan in order to get to each station for each recipe, alter the plan to deal with the particular hazards of the stage, develop a way of breaking that workload into parts based on proximity for each player, and then execute that plan in the time limit given. Somebody might say ‘but isn’t that the fun part not being able to do it in time?’ Well then I ask you, what is the part that makes something beyond human concentration limits fun? Is it the fact that you gain a score? Is it the fact that you do it with another person. Is it the fact that you do in on a computer screen? Well let’s invent a fun game according to the parameters.Get together some friends and find a paragraph in a language none of you know how to speak. Post that paragraph in a chat window. You now have 3 minutes to decipher it.  For each second less than the three minutes it take you to decipher the paragraph you get 1 point. There, I invented a fun game. It doesn’t cost anything and anybody can play anywhere in the world, as long as they have a phone and an internet connection. If you actually manage to gain any knowledge in that time limit, it will even help you get better next time, which is more than seems likely for Overcooked 2.Maybe the game becomes more understandable later. But I honestly couldn’t cope with the early stuff.I don’t recommend this game, because the chaos is in the wrong place, and it is entirely too high to deal with using my human brain.(I looked up some videos on youtube, and I see some levels that were nowhere near as obnoxious as the ones in the story, so maybe story mode is an terrible choice for a beginner. Though I don't know where they got their levels from.)"
2999,Bloomy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/blomsy2708/,No,,0,256.4,May,"14,",31,0,1,"Ive had this game ever since 2019, and since then I've experienced trouble with playing with my friends. I often get kicked out of the game while playing with others or my friends get kicked out. Playing arcade public, the matchmaking takes at least 20 minutes.  I've contacted the devs and they've tried helping me resolve the issue several times, but the problem seems to be the game. Its not my internet, and its not my computer. All other games on Steam seems to work perfectly on my computer except overcooked 2. It seems as if the devs has abandoned Oc2 completely and now focuses entirely on ""All you can eat"" instead, because they know they did some major screw ups with OC2 that seems to be irreversible. Or else the problem would have been fixed by now. The game is best played with controller, its not PC friendly. Just the general scrolling through the menu and user experience is so laggy on PC and keyboard. It's very surprising that they haven't allowed voice coms in this game, considering its so dependent on teamwork. Not even a chat. Instead of making the original OC2 better, they developed ""All you can eat"" and enabled voice comms there, something that should have been in OC2 in the first place. They also charge handsomely for ""All you can eat"" for basic functions that were missing in OC2. Also they've a discord in which you can join to find someone to play with, because their normal in-game matchmaking system takes you nowhere :)"

Overcooked! 1 chefs should have been unlocked from the beginning of Overcooked! 2 with brand new chefs to unlock.Unlocking Kevin stages by doing specific things in specific levels, while those things aren't told to the player isn't fun. It makes the game a grindy chore, and we can just look up how to unlock them online. We replay the game over and over to have fun, not to get maybe/maybe not unlock the level we want to play.Bugs that can completely ruin what you're doing and force you to restart a level are not fun. I don't know how many times we've permanantly lost a plate or finished dish or ingredient several minutes into a long level.The Star score-system isn't fun -- it's too easy, but neither is a New Game+ mode that just gives you a 4th, unreasonably high score-star to beat. Getting 2650 in 1-1 is unreasonable and doesn't feel at all skill-based. 2000 should have been the original 3-Star."

See as how I cant but cant recommend this game, I have to give a negative review.I bought this game because my friends want to play with it. It is not my type of game simply for the controls. All I want to do is use my mouse to click on things. Far too often I find myself standing in front of an object and picking up the item next to it and it could easily be solved simply with a wads movement and letf/right clicking.That's my small nit pick though.I dont enjoy the game simply because it's not my type of game. That's all, I find the gameplay loop boring. It was fun for 30 mins or so but every round is combine X ingredients in Y ways to make Z with slight obstacles from the environment. It's one of those games if I picked it up for 5-10 dollars I would be alright with it but for 25 I cant justify the purchase.Like I said though, that's all me. This game wasn't designed for my tastes. I just wanted to throw in my two cents on the controls and the gameplay loop. If you have fun with it, which a lot seem to, then that's all that matters."

Now I can't get it back and I'm not about to play through the entire game once just to get to the actually interesting part - NG+.  Three stars is so easy to get on each level that you'd have to play blindfolded to get less than that. I emailed the dev team asking if there was a way to get a save game that has the first three stars already complete but I never got a response.  Guess I'm not gonna play this game again.

At first, I didn't appreciate this game and thought that it'd lost some of its charm from the first game. The first game encouraged multiple ways to solve a problem rather than lock players into a certain strategy, but the devs continually provide free DLC for this game and whenever anything's announced, my girlfriend and I eagerly await its release and then play the game to completion. I will say, the four star mode can be frustrating at times, but for the fun levels (which I'd say is about 70% of them), it's worthwhile and not too difficult if you've been playing for a while. I'd give this game a solid 10/10, and it makes for a good party game to play with beginners as well as a game that encourages and rewards mastery (when achieved with a partner)."

3178,Cheezabel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cheezabel/,No,,0,36.0,April,"25,",379,0,1,"I love Cooking Games.I love Co-op games.I enjoy both console & pc gaming for different reasons & the corresponding gameplay.The only reason I didn't buy the previous Overcooked was because it didn't have online co-op.So I was pretty excited to hear that OC2 had that feature.I was worried about mouse & keyboard controls but it turns out it's ok. What I didn't expect was that this game would have such terrible level design.The greatest sin for a game is to expose their players to having absolutely no fun at all.Conveyor belts, disappearing floor tiles, magic portals (seriously?) were apparently introduced in this opus to um, increase the challenge? You have a couple of minutes to prepare a seamingly neverending string of orders but most of the time you & your partner are just standing idle because well... you're just literally stuck & waiting for that floating tile to please be so kind as to let you resume your activities.Most of the time, you're only halfway through the timer and you know perfectly well that you'll fail that level, so you just restart or... well just go and play something else.So there you go, in Overcooked 2, you don't actually cook, there's no specific goal (always an infinite string of orders, doesn't really matter if you're chopping meat or potatoes) and so as a result there's absolutely no challenge at all, you're just left with the horrid obstacles.Strangely enough the Story Mode is exactly the same whereas you're alone controlling 2 characters or you are 2 players controlling each 1 character (played until stage 3-5). This should give you a hint as to how not very deeply the gameplay.This feels like a mini-game that got its own spin-off - a lot of features are just cosmetics & have zero game design value.The Chef you control is just a skin, recipes hare just skins of other recipes, there's no bonus powers, nothing to unlock apart from stages, the only variety you'll find is in where the floating tiles, moving stations and gaps on the floor are placed.Like I said, not recommended.Play a mobile game if you like cooking, play a Mario game if you like console co-op."

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

All sudden onion king comes, begin summoning his royal chiefs, they begin making toast YEAH TOAST!!, YEAH TOAST!!!. Then they celebrating with Toast.(giggles)Overcook 2 is a great little party game that you can play with four friends off or online in crazy work environment, It just a simple fun cute game that makes the best meal in a arcade style for the best high-score. It also haves remote-play together that if, someone have a bought it they can join for free. Some of the level layout is very challenging to complete to get 3 starts, but replay ability help home your skill to reach  top score. I say it really fun for the whole family and with great friends to boot.I hope the Developers continue to make more and add DLC in the future as it just a funny great game. One things I'd love to see if they add a level map layout for a community to create maps for everyone to try and win a prize to put their idea in a future game."

3473,Dayne,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035276767/,No,,1,34.2,January,22,171,0,1,"Cooking simulator for 1-4 players. Throughout the campaigns/maps you will get more recipes, tools and kitchens that are also available in the arcade mode.The achievements require finishing all of the campaigns, getting 3 stars and performing tasks x amount of times. It can become quite tedious if you're playing the game by yourself. Guides are available, expect about 30+ hours. DLC is required.This game shines when you are playing with your friends. Alone you control and switch between two characters, which can be both challenging and boring. If you're a fan of cooking simulators this might be the game for you, otherwise I strongly recommend that you play with your friend(s)."

This game has provided my friends and I with many hours of fun, laughs, frustration, panic, and gratification. When I'm playing Overcooked 2, I feel the push to be as efficient as possible in every single aspect of my play, and its deceptively simple mechanics allow you to improve your skills in a way that feels incredibly fun to me. My friends have taken to calling me the ""Michelin Star Chef"" because of my love for the strategy and speed that the game requires.I will say that one frustrating part of online play for my friends and I has been desyncing in the online multiplayer experience. It's hard to say whether or not it's because of our respective internet connections, as none of us were having any other internet issues outside of in game, but we all found significant issues with inputting commands accurately. Since the game is so fast paced, this can be a significant setback, especially when pursuing the four-star challenges which you unlock after beating the game. I haven't noticed these problems when playing offline.Overall, it's a great game. Play it with your friends, play it with your family, get mad at each other, give each other high fives when you do well. And above all, keep cheffin'."

I know there's a story mode but I like playing with other people so if your intent to buy this game is to play with others - than don't there's not many people playing.It's cute though, maybe one day when there's more hype and people are online I'll come back.It's also no single-player friendly with a keyboard. I highly recommend a controller (which I don't have one) because there's a lot of multitasking to do and I particularly couldn't play on my own. Despite my negative review, I would recommend it though if you have friends, solo, not so much."

I owned the first game and enjoyed it with friends, even though we were constant denied making any further progress because the game kept skill checking us. Figured the second game would be more of the same really. Don't fix what isn't broken and all that, but to Overcooked 2's credit, I didn't feel as challenged with needing perfect scores in every level to progress, which definitely helps the pacing of it. There was also quite a bit of variety with what there was to cook as well, so it never really felt stale to play either. Story and soundtrack are whatever.Recommended if you have the friends for it because solo, this game is a miserable bloody experience. Feels like with some levels that perfect 3 star scores aren't manageable without some mates helping you out, but I did manage to unlock the final level playing it solo without having to replay too many levels, which is something I couldn't be bothered to do with the first game admittedly. Probably never gonna pick up the DLC though, base game is enough mileage as is."

In plate up if you run out of time, you're done, which gets really old really fast. Not only that, but the restaurant layout changes every time so you can't even practice to get better. Plate up is better in that you can move everything else around though rather than relying on the counter setup designed by the devs. Plate up also lets you chop on any counter too which is a huge plus.Overall I definitely recommend this game to anyone who's into this genre."

I've tried it out with different groups of people and the dynamics are different every time. I love thinking of ways to make the process more efficient, and the constant problem solving scratches a specific itch in my brain. I have way more hours of this game spread across different friend accounts when we play on their version instead of mine (I'm probably at 200 hours cumulatively), and it's been a blast every time. The concept is fairly simple and it's easy to get the hang of. I can't recommend it enough!Just make sure your friends are all at around the same gamer skill level, otherwise things get frustrating really fast if you're in it to win it. Keeping multiple tabs open in your brain is very important while playing!The story aspect is a little meh but I don't mind at all because the gameplay more than makes up for it. I got this game in a bundle, and although I adore this game, I would definitely wait for a sale to get it OR get it with a bundle with its DLCs (Season Pass for sure).Rating the game modes:-Main story: Classic, lots of variety in both dishes and difficulty level to shake things up as you progress through the game-Free update: Amazing, great addition and also a lot of variety-Carnival of Chaos: It's alright, but nothing to snuff at. Similar to the above-Night of the Hangry Horde: Be prepared for the long haul, and one little mistake can ruin the whole thing. Personally not a big fan because the pastries are right in your face and there's much more panicking than the original gameplay, but I'll play it with the right people-Campfire Cook-Off: I am not a fan of this one. I know you're using ingredients found in a typical camp setup, but the ingredients do not look good which throws off the whole vibe of the game, and the backpack concept, while interesting, sucks so much in practice.I do not own any other DLCs, but I heard Surf 'n Turf was not a big fan favorite either. Overall, it's super great and I've had an amazing time with it!"

I wanna preface that this review will only be about base Overcooked 2 and not include any of the DLC, but I am including the seasonal update as it was free added content. I'll also preface that we haven't played one so the story wasn't the main focus, but are interested in picking it up. This is also a 3 player co-op experience and merely from my perspective.Base Game CampaignThe game eases you in with some easy levels, where the main focus is learning to communicate/cooperate with the other players and throwing out some kitchen layouts that are the basis for the evolving kitchens and situations you'll be working with. Each level section focuses on learning one recipe and mastering how to best assemble and complete that order as fast and convenient as possible. Towards the end of section 1, dish washing is introduced as well as some of my favorite levels, evolving levels. I describe evolving levels as kitchens where over time the kitchen layout completely transforms like a phase change. At times even changing what foods and recipes are requested by guests. As the game advances, kitchens get more creative and diverse, challenging your groups ability to communicate and get the job done. I will say we also forced ourselves to get 3 stars on all levels our first go through and oh man, that was tense at times. A lot of fun though, lots of moments of just breaking out into hysterical laughter because we chopped a tomato and then yeet it accidentally into the ether for no reason. As well as the honored tradition when possible at the end of a level of sending your cute little chef off the map to an untimely death. And the final level is a real great playback of everything you've learned throughout the game. And as of now we are going back for 4 stars on all the main story levels and no idea if we'll reach that, but it'll definitely be a good time.Seasonal UpdatesThe season updates were the 2nd or 3rd extra content that we tried and they were overall enjoyable, if not at that point a little too simple at times. The added recipes are for the most part fun, I find Ramen to be one of the more satisfying recipes, Hot Chocolate is different and fun, but then you get fruit cakes and fruit platters which are literally reduxed cake and salad. But for free content and an extra 6 or so mini campaigns it's definitely a nice addition to an already tons of fun game.KevinOh boy. Kevin levels are....ok I guess? All Kevin levels are the same recipe. And its geared to be harder, which makes sense because they're hidden bonus levels right? Well, maybe I'd feel different if my group had one more person at the time, but 3 person co-op Kevin levels mean 1 player is left alone with a majority of work to do. And while i'm sure it was intended for 4players, it is sooooo rough in a 3 man at times. One person frustrated and having to do everything, while the other two are stuck watching someone else play while the have the monotonous task of taking turns chucking ingredients or serving. Not really fun for anyone involved.Arcade/SingleplayerOvercooked 2 is not a single player game. However with that said, you need something satisfying to do for 30 mins, singleplayer is fine and can be alright. But not for the main game experience. Arcade can be done solo or with friends. It's also ok, randomly picks a campaign map. Nothing special but it can break up monotony. In ConclusionOvercooked 2 is a great multiplayer experience that even if you've beaten, its fun going through with a new party. The maps are really creative, the star scores are a real decent challenge but not too frustratingly hard. And the dozens of fun chef characters you unlock along the way make the game really charming and a good time to be had by all. The game is definitely best with at least 2 or more people. 4 player being the best set up. So if your group is looking for a new party game challenge, pick up Overcooked 2. It'll be worth the purchase! Not to mention, it's almost always on sale!"

With the addition of remote play, everyone can join in the fun and compete against or cooperate with each other. Extremely recommended to play with friends and family, although solo playing is supported. Recipes are fun and fair. With the controls fixed (you can now edit the controls. Some old comments complained that the controls are awkward and you're unable to customize them), it becomes instantaneously better. The music is a banger, and I would give this game a total of 5/5.

I saw some reviews that said that people were having trouble playing single player... I found it to be super easy and I was able to beat the game in about 10 or 12 hours. I think that it is easy enough if you are ambidextrous or split brained, and can divide tasks so that each chef is active at all times when the other is running around. It does take some alternating, and you can't expect to stay in one place the whole time. I really enjoyed this game and still pick it up to play solo or online multiplayer. The multiplayer community can either be really nice (sharing gestures to encourage each other) and other times the online community can be kinda rude and rage quit if they don't think you're keeping the pace. It really depends, and I think that can be somewhat discouraging to newer or less skilled players who might not have a friend to play with. Overall, I love the variety of the levels and the bite sized challenges. It was well worth the money I had paid when it was at a slight discount."

Trying to get used to the mechanic and the challenges are challenging enough to be fun even after having to do it over 20 times.  I can tell that all the mechanics in the game are operable and the Developers did a great job all around.  Even down to just the right balance of sound volumes and ambiance.  From the sound of the bus low idle, and roaming hum to the background music.  Too many games over do it and background music volumes are too loud from the start, even though they have adjustments for the sounds, the importance of getting this right from the start is crucial.  Overcooked! 2 is really well made, so a big thanks and congratulations are in order for making a game I enjoy with my family."

We screamed, we yelled, we even cried a time or two, but now we go through the levels like we're back in chapter 1 of the main scenario. Overcooked 2 is that special kind of game that either makes or breaks your teamwork, coordination, and persistence to complete the goal no matter how insane the path. I for one love playing this game with my buddies and IMO for most levels 4 people is best. If at first you don't succeed retry and retry again. My best advice, whenever you can yeet a loaf of bread and dome your buddy off a precarious path, DO IT. ♥"

This game has a lot going for it and I want to love it but I can't. The main problem with overcooked 2 (and the original) is that it feels too gimmicky, often taking away from the quite solid main gameloop of efficiently managing a kitchen - sometimes it wants to be a platformer, sometimes a sports game, sometimes a puzzle, all of which feel too random and distracting. A natural way to raise the difficulty might be to have more complex dishes. Instead, dishes aren't varied enough to keep it interesting and the challenge is working with a specific map layout, which will be completely unrelated to the next. When I get three stars on a level, my reaction is relief at not having to play again. Case in point: The level selection shouldn't be practically a game of its own, the gimmick here is more annoying than immersive. I just want to see all the missing stars quickly and pick a level."

Me and my bf play together and it's the most grating game but it leaves you all triumphant when you get the 3 stars. When you aim to get 3 starts for all of them you tend to get the hang of how to cook one thing properly, then another thing gets thrown into the mix and it throws you off. COOK THE RICE FIRST and STOP BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER. Even when you establish one person to chop and serve and the other person to cook and plate up you end up doing a mix because of the DAMN SLIDING PLATFORMS THAT STOP YOU FROM DOING ANYTHING YOU'RE JUST STOOD THERE LIKE A LIMP LETTUCE AND PORTALS THAT YOU KEEP ACCIDENTALLY GOING IIIN AND OOUT OF JUST AS YOU HAVE A PLATE READY TO SERVE AND THE CLOCKS RUNNING OUT AND THOSE FREAKIN DISAPPEARING STAIRS THAT END YOUR DISAPPOINTING LIFE JUST AS THE MEATS ABOUT TO START BURNING AND IT SCREWS THE REST OF IT UP. And why can't the customers just walk that lil extra step to get their damn food?! IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU! This game makes me sympathetic to the Lord Ramsey.Overall, highly recommend.

It plays simple but it takes a lot of team planning/organising to pull through the harder levels and getting a level right is deeply satisfying. Later levels can be overwhelming at first but finding the groove of each level comes with practice, but not in a tedious way. Figuring out the best strategy for a level is a bit of a puzzle, but the good kind where the solution becomes increasingly obvious the more you play a level (save perhaps getting 4* on harder levels, but by the time you reach that point it's not going to be an issue).Don't play this one alone (besides perhaps the tutorial). It's more tedious than anything else. 2-4 players is where it's at. Thankfully this game has online and local co-op.Overcooked 2 is a particularly stimulating game, so you will get fired up playing this. This is not a bad thing unless you're intending to go to sleep, nap or relax soon."

My disappointment was soon overcome as I had purchased the gourmet edition and the extra levels really make up for the quick main game. This is way easier than overcooked one and has some really fun recipes, the themes are fun and the quirks that make a level challenging. Its a go to game for casual short gaming with friends, the co-op mode here is awesome and really does work.

Smooth controls and throw feature adds an extra skill ceiling that is rewarding. Story is eh, but the game is about the cooking not the story. The cooking is fun and there are many dishes. The satisfaction comes from rapidly completing orders and getting a hot streak point bonus on turned in dishes. The game can be frustrating at times when the levels gimmick hasn't been fully understood and a plan hasn't been made. I would have appreciated more levels with dedicated stations for each player before ramping up the cooperation difficulty. Overall 9/10"

Look, it is possible that you can beat this game on your own but unfortunately i don't have very fast hand reflexes when it comes to switching between the two identical characters.Communication and teamwork is key. Like Uno, this game can test/ruin friendships. This game also has a side dish of Rage Quitting. (I have dealt with it one too many times where that didn't have to be the case.)Let's talk about the game: -  Quality & gameplay is super smooth. - I'm someone who relies on a controller and Gamepad play-ability was nice compared to the first Overcooked game. - There was a variety of levels and characters to choose from in various modes and were decently priced.  - Also why does this game make me hungry? The food looks so good in this game!!!A couple of minor con's; The DLC levels, I wish there are incorporated in the story mode because they were very hard to find. Also, the plot for the story mode was pointless. Felt it need to have more context or not be there at all.This is a game where you will either like it or hate it. Overall, a very solid game. When I purchased this game, I didn't know that there was combined version of the first two games. The controls on the controller in the first game was difficult for me. I'm wondering with ""Overcooked: All You Can Eat"", if the gamepad controls would be consistent throughout? If a update could be made for this enquiry, the first game would be more enjoyable since I purchased the games individually."

Single player mode is pretty boring though. The way the developers designed single player mode is really not any fun. I can't blame them too much though, I don't know how single player mode could be done better. I just think this game is meant for multiple players. Lots of great content in this game, the DLCs are worth it for more content. This version is also much smoother and better designed than the first overcooked. I would strongly recommend Overcooked 2 instead of Overcooked 1"
