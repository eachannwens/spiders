5,Psichofox,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047614088/,548,23,1,19.9,February,25,142,0,1,"Definitely not what I expected. I thought this was gonna be some serious sci-fi hardcore survivor game based around a story, but instead got a sci-fi fever dream. Atomic Heart seems to take inspiration from a lot of familiar titles like Fallout for it's world design, a mix of Bioshock and Dead Island for its game play and freaking Looney Tunes for it's story.  This game's story is probably the most psychotic thing I've had to experience in the past 10 years. The gameplay is a tier above basic FPS, allowing you to use as many weapons as you can carry with 3 alternate special powers that try to work in tandem with one another. The games default difficulty could be hard enough to justify all that, I typically just used my best one and had so much ammo for every gun I settled for just blasting. My biggest gripe with this game overall was it's dialogue in English. Specifically in English, cause there are parts of this game where the translation feels like it was totally 1 to 1 with its original language, creating these very rushed feeling cut scenes with dialogue cutting itself off, almost as if 2 people couldn't talk at the same time. It was just awkward overall. As for the dialogue content, I think a lot of people will be split on this but the main character in English and some other characters are very colorful I'd say. A lot of what the main character says or does is very wacky and his glove companion don't really seem to mesh well with him. It's like if a high ranking officer in the military acted like a neurodivergent teen that watches My Little Pony on his adventures with his milquetoast robot butler. On the other hand, I think the main character made more fun, he's just largely immature. Also the PC version was insanely smooth for a Denuvo user, only thing that was suspicious was how long the loading elevators were. But I kept 144 in the open world very consistently with no stuttering. I even tried to get a whole village to attack me and it barely dropped.8/10 - Would let NORA kill me"

8,Tamaster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tho545454/,633,9,1,33.8,March,13,917,23,1,"In an alternate timeline, the USSR has become a technological powerhouse after WW2, with breakthroughs in fields such as nanotechnology, AI and energy manipulation that far surpass those of our present-day world. Affirming itself as the leading world power, it builds the utopian symbol-city of Chelomey, and nears the launch of Kollektiv 2.0, a worldwide neural network merging man and machine to an unprecedented degree. Agent P-3, the protagonist, attends the ceremony, but things take a horribly wrong turn.The narrative shines the most in its indirect form, through the visual clues and remains from events transpired before, while it proves mediocre in both lore files, dialogues and cutscenes. The worst offender is your musclehead alter-ego, which not only has the intellectual capacity of a broken treadmill, but is also a ceaseless discharge of cringe, with puns and lines that make Leon from RE4 seem like Socrates. The events are predictable, moral dilemmas get sidetracked, and the classic rushed exposition dump near the end comes as the last nail in this atomic coffin.The world is divided between linear and open-world areas, the latter becoming available only several hours later. The sprawl of facilities, complexes and residential areas comprising the freely roamed, although a few may be inaccessible until a specific story point is reached. In both instances, minutely exploring with the aid of your Scanner tool to highlight loot and other important things, will be paramount to accumulate crafting supplies, blueprints and useful consumables, while also discovering files and secret areas from time to time. It’s satisfying and enjoyable to traverse the world by foot or car - no fast travel so make sure you search accurately. Save points are placed regularly, allowing you to use them unlimited times. The main difference between closed and open-world areas is the enemy presence, much more massive outside, featuring reinforcements and an alarm level system, although your foes can be temporarily disabled by destroying a certain facility.With firearms, improvised melee tools and polymer-based powers at his disposal, P-3 is a living arsenal. Your limited, upgradable inventory can hold a generous amount of ammo, weapons and consumables to keep you alive in a fight, while powers and abilities only have cooldowns, no other resource than time is required. Energy is used instead to power certain weapons, and is gained passively, with consumables or by striking foes in melee. A dodge system allows you to avoid melee and ranged hits, while defensive upgrades and medkits do the rest. Enemies range from simple humanoid bots to mechanical horrors with many weapons and moves, and dangerous mutants worthy of STALKER’s Zone. Mini and proper bosses are uncommon sights, giving you fights that won’t prove too tough especially later on, due to your arsenal becoming way too powerful, same for your skills, granting you simply too many advantages for these fights to be as ‘epic’ as they should be. Unless you get caught in an insta-kill QTE - those are crap.AI-powered fridges, sometimes considerably more horny than expected, will be at your service to craft all sorts of consumables, ammo and upgrade both your weapons and P-3’s abilities -provided you have the needed materials, blueprints and XP, all looted from the world and enemies. These upgrades will add secondary fire modes to guns, improve their stats, specialize them to damage other robots or organics, and upgrade all of your abilities to be stronger, faster, and last longer.In general, provided you loot thoroughly, you will never run out of anything and be in far excess of materials to make all the ammo, health kits and other stuff you may need. It has to be noted that scrapping weapons or abilities returns 100% of their materials, so that you can try different ones and spice up the gameplay, a good choice that however hinders the replay value, since you can “have it all” in the same playthrough this way.Both linear and open sections feature a generous quantity of puzzles, that range from logic-based locks, to timing sequences, beam redirections, and more than a few unique ones with their own mechanics. None of them is very complex, and they’re accessible even to those who aren’t familiar with the puzzle genre. Testing Grounds (dungeons) are the main secondary content, awarding unique upgrades for weapons and requiring some extra effort to unlock."

You take this exact script and read it in english and think ""wow the lame protagonist is an insufferable jackass who swears every chance he gets and has the maturity of a 16 year old boy, how is he even in the military?""I get it, I see where you're coming from. It's jarring and removes you from the experience, kinda cringe too.Here's the fix for this exact problem. Go to the main menu and change the in game voice language to Russian. BOOM. The constant swearing is now perfectly acceptable because swearing at everything that moves and even completely inanimate objects that you dislike is an essential part of everyday Russian life. Whole game makes sense now, you're welcome. You may now experience an authentic story through the eyes of a true comrade."

19,ROGNAM,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ROGNAM/,463,8,1,21.6,February,23,618,20,1,"Atomic Heart is a FPS with action-RPG elements taking place in a technologically advanced alternative Soviet Union, in the 1950's where robots will start killing humans.The game has an ultra immersive universe, the intro will immediately immerse you in the game with its incredible artistic direction and its more than convincing graphics. The music is excellent, it's a mix of Russian music, electro and metal making the universe even more immersive in this world full of technology and robots.The story is also very good, you will want to go on to understand what is going on, there is a lot of lore on terminals that you will find throughout the adventure. The cinematics are also very good despite a rather average lip-sync if you don't play in Russian. The character is also very pleasant to play with a humor similar to that of Wolfenstein/Fallout.As for the gameplay, the fights are pretty cool, your glove gives you access to different powers in addition to your weapons. You will be able to modify all your weaponry as well as these powers throughout the adventure in secure areas by finding loot. The bosses are also very pleasant to face, with excellent music made by Mick Gordon (Doom, Wolfenstein..). There are also the puzzles that I personally loved to do, they are not numerous and are renewed in each zone which makes them all very enjoyable.One of the only negative point for me is the ""open world"" which could have been avoided. You will be at some point in the game in quite open areas (like in metro exodus) where you can find plans of sights or magazines to improve your weapons. The problem is that the driving of the vehicles is quite bad and that there are too many enemies in my opinion, fortunately this represents 15% of the game which is not too disturbing.In conclusion, Atomic heart is a very good FPS like we haven't had in a long time, it knows how to innovate in its universe as well as in its gameplay and has its own identity. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a very good single player FPS with a good story and an excellent universe, you will spend a very cool twenty hours. And yes for once the game is well optimized."

Very repetitive, a lot of highs, a lot of lows, messy pacing, but enough interesting things to keep you going. Paints both communism and capitalism as bad if you cared about that. There's actually quite a bit of robot girls.Beat the game on normal in a little over 13 hours. See literally no reason to replay unless I want to just look at stuff. You can easily extend this time by really exploring the overworld. If you find value or enjoyment in the overworld gameplay loop, then you'll probably enjoy going through it. I however, did not find value.The good:- The music is definitely the highlight. At its best its really good and exciting, at its worst its still interesting. Which is better than forgettable imo- Very well optimized. I had very steady frames and only encountered a single glitch that required a restart. But that only happened once and I was jumping in a spot I wan't meant to.- Great setting and visuals- Story is decent, nothing mindblowing. There are a few things that don't make sense, but there is still setup and payoff within the narrative- I felt the difficulty was fine throughout. I was never on autopilot when in combat and would still find myself making mistakes and dying. There are certain perks that are a must have and you definitely feel the progression. I found myself wanting to avoid combat near the start, but not at all near the end.- I liked every side character/robot. There was a certain red robot that I wish had more screen time. It was fun whenever I saw it. I've seen that some people HATED this character, but I personally like it. - There is a mission/dungeon with what I thought was a 10/10 subplot in the readable records and audio recordings.- Very small and isolated moments throughout the I absolutely loved. Like some character interaction or world building moments. The bad:- Probably the biggest issue: pacing pacing pacing. It made no sense. They tried to do what Bioshock Infinite did with seeing columbia all nice and pretty and happy before things go wrong, except not as well both thematically and in execution. You sit through what is basically an interactive cut scene with really on-the-nose exposition and a lot of NPCs going ""wow, it sure is amazing that we have such amazing science in [city name] thanks to [name] and their [invention] that recently came out."" After this you, you arrive in the open world to go to the first mission/dungeon. I then spent 4 hours on this first mission. Then back to the open world for 10 minutes to get to the next story mission. Then another 2-3 hours on that. Then everything gets shorter on average afterwards. The first half of the game has so many puzzles that you would think it was a puzzle game first before a FPS, but then the last half of the game has literally no puzzles so idk. Its a mess.- The game has an ""open world"" tag, but is only ""open world"" in that there is an overworld that you can explore (kinda). However, there isn't really anything to do other than collect weapon blueprints and kill robots. The overworld only stands as a set piece to get from story mission to story mission. I spent maybe an 1.5 hours total in the overworld, and I was really trying to find interesting things to do. There was a point in which I wanted to travel to get an upgrade for a weapon only to find that the entire section of the map was cut off and I had to progress through the story to open it. There wasn't even any indication that it opened when it did. And by the time it did, I didn't need the upgrade. The combat cycle for the overworld can just be ignored. There are sometimes just too many enemies in a given location. Like, you will scan the area and there's 30 things on your screen with lines connecting them and then they just keep adding more and more as you progress through the story. - There are lines of dialog that are just bad. Not even like ""oh that could have been better"". More like ""I wish i didn't have to listen to that"". You kinda get used to it though. Or maybe it just improved a bit over the course of the game- Voice acting is good, but the direction is often terrible. The MC will say a line and deliver it well, but in a tone and inflection that does not fit the situation at all. I found this happening a lot. I'm told the Russian VA is the best option.- Unbelievably repetitive. Very little enemy variety. Only (one)? dead soldier model. You will spend hours collecting things to put into other things to open doors and then open some variation of three lock types on a door to again collect things to open another door and then talk to an unmoving dead body. Each time you fight some amount of the 6 or so enemy types. (eidt:I looked this up, there are 9 normal types. 3 have variants. The rest are boss types. You see one type way more than the rest). The game also tries to be cute with it by having the MC say something sarcastic like ""Wow, another lock on the door. Who would have seen that coming?"", or ""Yeah, of course I have to go collect more capsules. What else could it have possibly been?"". As though that makes this type of game design excusable. - The first boss fight blew my mind away. Like probably the best moment of the game. Then all other boss fights are boring.EDIT:lmao people got heated in the comments, which is fine. At the end of the day, it is a negative review for something they may have enjoyed. In regards to my point on the price of the game; It's not a matter of being able to afford it, but rather that the game is simply not worth full price. If you are ok with paying $60 for 10-12 hours of content, go for it. If you can find it cheaper, you should probably do that instead. If the asking price was lower, it would arguably decrease quality expectations and the game's issues would be more excusable. But instead, they want a AAA price so I will expect AAA quality and will judge it so. My other criticisms still stand, regardless of the price. I don't hate the game, I just don't recommend it as it currently is. Also I've never bought any COD of FIFA games. I don't know where that point's coming form. Cheers"

38,MrWoodenSheep,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/,714,15,1,22.1,February,21,"4,566",45,1,"Atomic Heart feels like it's in the Bioshock Universe, only we get to see what's happening in the USSR. In the same way Bioshock Infinite made commentary with the star-eyed patriotic citizens of Columbia, all of the civilians here loves communism and its leaders that do no wrong.The USSR leads the technological race with wonderful advancements that will never go south. Until they do.Then the game's other similarities shine. There's exploration, audio diaries, frantic combat with an array of weaponry, left handed magic/plasmid/tech stuff, a story of intrigue and so on.Atomic heart wears its inspirations on its sleeve, but it definitely brings new things to the table too.Primarily, the number one selling point in my opinion, the absolutely unnerving robots and machines.It's a lovely conglomeration of soviet-era amusement park aesthetics with 50s sci-fi tech, and I loved seeing all of the creative designs as I progressed throughout the game. All of the designs feel authentic, and are animated beautifully. And once enemies start attacking, their sheer speed and weight is genuinely scary to go up against.Combat feels really good. Not only do enemy attacks get my adrenaline going, but the weapons you use, feel and sound so meaty. The core combat loop will also have you dodging frequently as you fight. You are not that mobile, and can’t sprint, so you need to time your dodges well. Additionally, you’ve got your glove that can cast certain abilities that will hinder your enemies. I didn’t find them as interesting as the plasmids in Bioshock, but they do give you a few more tools to spice things up overall.Your weapons and glove all have plenty of upgrades you can choose from as well, which allow you to play around with different playstyles. It’s nice that you can also get refunds for everything you upgrade, which encourages experimentation even further.Exploration is slightly weaker in my opinion. I did enjoy the quick-looting gimmick the game has, where you can just hold the interact button to suck up everything in front of you to speed up the process. But some of the environments aren’t that interesting to look at. And I enjoyed the outdoors areas less. Although the atmosphere is nice, I found that trudging around got a bit tedious at times, especially because of the horribly annoying camera system.There are tons of these things littered outside, and if you get caught by one, it will raise the alarm and spawn an enemy. If you’re seen fighting that enemy on the camera, even more enemies will be spawned. You kill them, or the camera, and then these little annoying drones come out and repair the camera and enemies. And sometimes it feels like an endless cycle.Even if you don’t get detected by any cameras, it gets tiresome to make your way forward and have to constantly stop and shoot all of these cameras and drones. I found the game way more enjoyable in the semi-linear indoors sections. But overall, I love the overtly patriotic setting the game takes place in.Let’s talk about the story. I enjoyed the overarching story and lore, but the main character is a bit insufferable.First off, he’s definitely the character that’s voiced the worst in the game. He's good and bad depending on the scene, which leads me to believe it’s more of a problem with the direction the actor got. Either way, his emotions and intonations are all over the place. Sometimes he’s cheerful when talking to a dead body, and other times he’s perplexed by the simplest concept explained to him. In general his dialogue pacing is off. Sometimes he rambles, sometimes he talks too quickly, and he’s just a bit of a weirdo in general.The worst part of all though, is he’s just a bit of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It’s like the writers wanted him to be a cool 90s first person shooter protagonist like Duke Nukem, but without any of the likeable characteristics. No funny puns or one liners, just pure… bitchiness. He’s just always being a ♥♥♥♥♥ to everyone, even though he at the same time, tries to act like a tough soldier. It really annoyed me throughout my playthrough.Well actually, I lied, he’s got one one-liner. For some weird reason, he loves repeating the most bizarre catch-phrase I’ve ever heard in my life. “Crispy critters”. It’s his go-to exclamation for any situation he’s in, and feels quite forced.Also, everyone including the protagonist sound American or British, for some reason, which I found very strange.A frequent annoyance I ran into, was that I found myself progressing too fast for the game many times, which would then interrupt the dialogue I was listening to. It happened so much that I had to end up stopping in my tracks everytime exposition cropped up, which I’m sure you can understand broke the flow.In conclusion, the game’s dialogue & protagonist are a bit of a weak point for me, but the world’s story is intriguing enough to keep going. That goes without even mentioning the fantastic enemy designs, great combat and kick-ass soundtrack. If you enjoy games like Bioshock, Prey, Half-Life, Wolfenstein New Order and so on, then I’m sure you will enjoy your time in Atomic Heart. As a nice bonus, it runs butter smooth! A rarity in modern times."

43,Oi,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198275281641/,76,4,1,33.7,February,28,275,9,1,"Atomic Heart is a stunning-looking game in atompunk art style mixed with Soviet Aesthetic. It is quite fun, but as the studio’s debut title, it is flawed and has some utterly weird design choices that do no good to the experience, hence I have mixed feeling.People refer this game as Russian Bioshock, but their gameplay similarity stops at both can shoot and use abilities. Atomic Heart is not an immersive sim either, where players are given various tools and means to approach objectives as they like. It is an RPG shooter like Fallout and STALKER but with a tuned down open world, featuring resource gathering, puzzle solving and half-melee-half-shooting combat. Looting for upgrades feels satisfying, with one of the best looting mechanics and animations in gaming history, and the puzzles are innovative making it my favorite part of the game. Combat, however, has something desired to be improved.As melee charges up powerful energy weapons, players are motivated to mix melee and shooting as well as abilities to gain leeway in combat. These three are well integrated together, creating a fun and relatively innovative combat loop. But on the downside, while shooting feels crispy and it is good that melee weapons offer different heavy attack modes, melee just feels average. The lack of FOV slider also makes melee disoriented sometimes, as default FOV is uncomfortable. Besides, elemental attack is applicable to weapons, but I really don’t see the use of it as weapons are already powerful enough without it (perhaps more useful at hard difficulty). With it being unnecessary, Polymer Jet (shoot out substance that enhances elemental effects) also becomes a useless ability.The open sequence is the worst part of the game (from underground facility to getting out of the village). It is extremely overwhelming, throwing lots of stuff at you without properly explaining, while MC and the AI (Charles) keep talking and talking in your ears nonstop. It exposes lots of problems the game has:Furthermore, as frequently as the game needs you to use scanning vision, it is very cumbersome that objects don’t stay highlighted for a while after exiting the vision, to the point it actually affects the gameplay flow. I also think it is inappropriate to put nonlinear session at the start because players can easily get overwhelmed, whereas the ending session is mostly linear and straightforward when it was supposed to be more challenging. The two should be switched.The biggest issue I have with the game is the open world. After players are first introduced to the open world, it is natural to explore around. However, this starting place has the highest enemy density of the whole game, and at this point of the game, players are underpowered. As a result, this little exploration turns into players getting slaughtered over and over, like the game gives you a massive middle finger for not following the waypoint.But it doesn’t stop there. Hyper-aggressive enemies are everywhere throughout the world, despite not being as dense as the starting village. Gun blazing or stealth won’t work, as crouch walking is so slow that stealth is completely situational, and fighting them is basically fighting a losing battle. Since repair drones come in no time to revive fallen enemies, fighting just gets you more and more enemies. Therefore, your best approach is to run past everything, or deactivate robots in one area using a set approach, which the game only tells you how after you somehow do it once. This design (the more you fight, the more you fight against) is definitely realistic, but it is quite bizarre for gameplay to implement such a mechanic, as it severely disincentives players from exploring the world, whereas the game was supposed to encourage players to do so. The poorly designed map system won’t help either.This also brings an issue to difficulty setting. I originally played the game at hard, but in the open world it is easy to get killed by accident losing all the loot and progress, so I switched to normal difficulty. But at normal, combat is way too easy using adrenaline, as I walked over every boss fight without a scratch. The experience is pretty broken and I really think the game should do some rebalancing.For the story, due to cultural differences and lost-in-translation problems, I don’t think it conveys exactly what the writers intended. Still, I am not a fan of the story, since it is predictable and just a matter to see how. It also has an obnoxious plot twist so that players can share hatred towards antagonist with MC. The main casts are very underwhelming as well. Charles is probably the best of the bunch as the collected one, and MC sounds like a stupid 15-year-old cringe lord whose edginess is off the chart. Though it has a story reason and his character develops as the story goes, it doesn’t make him likeable. The story was also supposed to show how MC and Charles form a bond through fighting together, but you won’t feel it at all (but it is important for the plot). Additionally, English voice acting is not good, and cinematics have scene connection issues. In several scenes, some characters just jump in or out quite abruptly without proper transition. The final cutscene also has a plot twist caused by MC’s strange action, which I find very bizarre and unbelievable.What I do really like are things outside the main story. Nora the Repair Shop and Tereshkora at the museum are funny and interesting characters. Sub-plots show lots of issues this supposed-to utopia has, as sarcasm, alarm and revelation to many social problems in real life. I also enjoy the world they built. It is believable, detailed and full of backstory. Plus, though many tracks are too heavy metal for me, it is applaudable that the game has such a big selection of music. It is very unfortunate that some design choices are not mainline and many execution details did not get smoothed out, making the game not as good as it could.Overall, I don’t think Atomic Heart is bad, but it definitely can feel like a mess sometimes. There are things to enjoy but also things that are rough and infuriating, but I do recommend giving it a try (or later, 4 DLCs are coming) if you don’t mind imperfection and love to dip your toe in new thing."

Feel free to scroll down to the conclusion and score given to the game! :)Have you ever been dropkicked by a robot? Well, search no more because that is an everyday occurrence in the glorious future of Atomic Heart. A new IP that oozes personality with its art direction set in the futuristic Soviet Union, the title has been a project I have been looking forward to for a long time. Games like Fallout have not been magical in a while, and Bioshock is a distant memory of the past. Still, Atomic Heart is here to rectify the lack of a utopia gone wrong.The title is entertaining; enemies create pressure by being incredibly dangerous when they spot you. They can cut, burn, melt, and even kick you in the face. The player will get familiar with the foes quickly as it takes knowing them to take them down effectively. The guns all pack a punch and are fun to shoot; you can mix them with cartridges that give them elements such as fire or electricity and tinker them to your taste. The game allows you to refund all weapons and abilities you purchase so that you can explore and change your build whenever you please by giving you 100% of your resources back.There are also abilities one can obtain and use. Still, these were more valuable trinkets, such as levitating enemies temporarily or freezing them in ice. Only the guns will open your way into the depths of robotic hell. Some firearms, such as railguns or bazookas, are comedically giant. There is a tactical aspect to Atomic Heart, as some enemies will take meager damage unless a specific element hurts them, and your arsenal will dictate how well you do against certain foes.The main protagonist of the game,  Sergei Nechaev, is a war veteran that serves professor Sechenov as they try to avoid a catastrophe. The character controls could be more precise, with Platforming being the most prominent issue. Sometimes the jump input won't register on some sections. At other times, the objects one needs to use to advance seem in battle, with the controls requiring precise movement but failing. In addition, enemies can overwhelm the player if they are on the ground after an attack. It becomes frustrating as you die with no escape.On a more positive note, the map design is out of a dream in this title. The open world is full of facilities to explore in search of effective weapons blueprints; there are dungeons to discover with exciting mechanics, platforming challenges, and much more! The whole thing is a beautiful craft that begs to be scoured. The only bad point is that some environments could have been more convenient. Sometimes you can grab a shortcut over some clifts or rocks and find yourself stuck, but that is a rare occurrence. I only suffered three times in the whole 14 hours of experience.The visuals are crisp; a lot of detail and care are delivered to how the enemies and locations look. From terrible morgues to colorful hills and futuristic installations, the landscape players will gaze upon varies. Enemies are given another layer of importance in terms of ammunition and weapons. Not fighting enemies will save you ammo, but destroying them will allow you to upgrade your weapons as you take their components. It stops the player in their tracks as they ask themselves if they should not avoid the confrontation but take it for future gain and rewards stealth with some extra bullets!The sound design is boom static with loud explosions, guns that pack a punch, and enemies going feral on the screen. They can howl like an animal or greet you before attempting to terminate you. The music reminded me of DOOM music in some areas of the game, and it just edges you to unleash your rage and destroy these robots! (Mick Gordon from DOOM did some of the soundtrack pieces!)In terms of replayability, Atomic Heart only offers a little. You can still explore the open world after the story, but I didn't notice a new game plus option, nor is there any reason to revisit the story. A run and done deal unless you fancy yourself a completionist.The game suffers from bugs, particularly ones that forced me to return to the main menu and redo some game sections. While it was rare, it broke the pacing, and one can tell the title could have used some more patches to help fix the stability of the experience. leaves a bittersweet taste in my mouth; it is a game with many little problems that bug me as I play, but in the end, it is an experience I enjoy. Clunky character control and some bugs that ruin the pacing a bit cannot come closer to a title that is charismatic in its personality and originality. A vibrant FPS with great gameplay, big guns to blow robots with, and strategic options in approaching foes with the correct arsenal, it follows a daring devil style in which you go all out in every fight! Is it worth picking up? Only a few games have such an art direction, and Atomic Heart certainly brings something new.9/10  AMAZINGIf you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck!"
47,Kidomaro,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kidomaro/,127,4,1,18.1,February,26,"1,981",10,1,"Atomic Heart is a bold and ambitious first-person shooter that ultimately can be described as a ""two steps forward, one step back"" experience. Set in a clever and immersive alternative-history world that is brought to life by its exquisite visuals and an outstanding soundtrack that enhances the already entertaining combat. However, exploration lacks excitement and feels tedious at times, and the narrative often becomes incoherent while also being plagued by inconsistency in game design choices. Despite these setbacks, Atomic Heart is still undoubtedly thrilling and enjoyable. It remains a game that shows the developer's creative vision and passion for the project. If you can look past its flaws and inconsistencies, you will find an engaging and challenging experience that offers a unique blend of genres and gameplay mechanics.Set in an alternate reality in the 1950s, where the Soviet Union has developed advanced technology and lives in a utopian world where humans and robots coexist. A new robot-control system is about to launch, but a tragic accident occurs and disrupts it. Mutants, terrifying machines, and powerful robots suddenly rebel and kill everyone in sight. Only P-3 and his experimental power glove Charles can stop them while uncovering the truth behind the disastrous launch and whatever else they might unveil on the way.While the concept and setting of the story are intriguing and have a lot of potential, it, unfortunately, falls short in execution. It starts strong with an engaging and tense atmosphere, but as the story progresses, it becomes increasingly silly and nonsensical. Certain characters have unique moments but are not well-written enough to be truly memorable and often rely on exaggerated actions or quirks to stand out. Nevertheless, the story definitely has its moments, and the witty humor can occasionally land. However, it requires a lot of suspension of disbelief to remotely enjoy it becauseit can be stupid.At its core, Atomic Heart is a first-person shooter that blends aspects of action, horror, puzzles, and exploration into a wacky and flawed but fun experience. Gunplay is intense and dynamic, with a visceral and explosive feel that keeps you engaged. Combat is fast-paced and frenetic, keeping you on your toes as you face a range of unique opponents, from giant machines to mutants and superpowered robots each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It has a diverse selection of weapons and abilities, each providing a satisfying experience with unique playstyles and strategies. Additionally, you can upgrade and add modifiers to weapons for additional elemental effects, allowing for even more customization and adaptability in combat.With the help of your experimental power glove, you can scan the area for loot and examine enemies to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy in question.Rest areas are scattered throughout the environments and serve as places you save and craft weapons, ammo, and consumables. They also provide opportunities to upgrade abilities and weaponry. Looting is crucial as it is required to unlock recipes, craft, and upgrade. Collect items from enemies, chests, and the environment using telekinesis. This intuitive mechanic makes looting a surprisingly enjoyable aspect of the game. Despite looting being satisfying, the exploration aspect of Atomic Heart is not due to the bland open world with repetitive enemy types scattered all over it and frustrating repair robots, making it a tedious chore to traverse between hubs. However, exploration within the four hubs is much more enjoyable and rewarding.Puzzles are surprisingly enjoyable, offering challenges varying in style and complexity, especially the hidden dungeons. Puzzles not only add an extra layer of excitement and accomplishment, but they usually feel creative and fun while not slowing you down too much to feel like a drag which is much appreciated.Atomic Heart boasts an artistic and stunning take on Cold War-era architecture with a futuristic spin that is a fresh breath of air. Whether you explore a run-down industrial building or a modern, high-tech lab, each location always presents a unique visual treat, bringing the game world to life, be it because of a sense of dread or awe that it creates.The attention to detail in the character models truly is impressive. They are beautifully rendered, with realistic facial expressions, while equipped with neat steam-punk-inspired equipment. The robots and various other enemies have detailed designs that are excellently animated and remarkably designed as well.The weaponry is as deadly as visually stunning because of excellent designs ranging from futuristic firearms, gadgets, and various superb abilities that the experimental power glove offers. Not only are the weapons impressive, but they also evolve with each upgrade, resulting in increasingly stylish designs.While the sound effects of weapons and enemies are impactful and audibly sound great, the dialogue can be hit or miss. The voice actors themselves do justice to their roles. It is just that the script they are working with is incredibly inconsistent and often nonsensical, which can detract from the overall immersion. However, if you find humor in the quirky dialogue and do not mind a bit of absurdity, this might not be an issue for you, and you may even find the game's unique writing style entertaining.The soundtrack composed by Mick Gordon is incredible. It features a mix of classic Soviet-era songs and modern tracks that blend phonk, rock, and techno influences. Whether it is during an intense boss fight or a stroll through the environment, the well-made score always enhances the moment.Atomic Heart on a PC with an i7-9700K, 24GB of RAM, RTX 2080 Ti, and through an ultrawide monitor, with high-maximum settings, resulted in consistent 60 FPS, and I did not encounter any significant framerate or optimization issues except the horrible FOV because of ultrawide.It is important to note that there is a lack of accessibility settings, promised features such as Ray-Tracing, and basic features such as a FOV slider, separate languages for subtitles, achievements not tracking properly, and various other things. Mundfish has stated that they are actively listening and plan to continue updating Atomic Heart and fixing it.As for the experience on the Steam Deck, it honestly is astonishing how well it runs. At 800p and low presets settings (make sure to set ""Hard Drive Speed"" to SSD), it can maintain 60 FPS relatively consistently, but with dips in open-world sections. However, with Refresh Rate and Frame Limit set to 45 results in an incredibly consistent and smooth experience that allows for ~2.6 hours of continuous playing and draws ~12-21W while sitting at ~66-79C degrees. Subtitles are, however, hard to read but not impossible. Atomic Heart's imperfections aside, it offers a refreshing and thrilling experience, setting it apart from other games in the genre with its unique approach. It has excellent visuals, frenetic fun action, and enjoyable puzzles backed by an astonishing soundtrack. While it may not be perfect, it is still worth playing for its creative vision and ambition."
48,Preator,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000207900/,58,1,1,27.9,March,4,"1,973",6,1,"A first-person shooter set in the USSR in the years following World War 2, Russia has become a technological dystopia where advanced machines are completing a wide range of tasks for humans. Atomic Heart attempts to reinvent what games like Prey and Bioshock did in a new environment and setting. But did their formula start the reaction they were hoping for or did the experiment blow up in their faces?You play as Agent P-3, a special operations soldier, in the employ of an influential scientist in the USSR, Dr Dimitry Sechenov. Having just arrived in Chelomey, the capital city of this fictional region of floating islands in Russia, things quickly get out of hand when the robots everyone relies on get switched to combat mode and begin to kill indiscriminately.Agent P-3 gets ordered to bring the man who has done this heinous deed to heel by any means necessary, and thus his journey across this newly war-torn region begins. Fighting both organic monsters and deadly machines, P-3 will have to master a series of weapons and abilities to come out alive and hopefully find an answer to why this all started in the first place.For the most part, Atomic Heart has the potential to be a pretty decent story experience. The bones of something substantial and remarkable are there just beneath the surface. Unfortunately, however, this is never acknowledged and rapidly stagnates in its cumbersome dialogue and tedious event cycles. If you push through the seemingly endless sexual innuendos, and corny one-liners, you will discover there is very little else to experience here. The pacing is terrible, and the amount of missing context is confusing. If you were hoping this to be your story-driven experience of the year, you're probably best skipping this one.The best part of this title, hands down, is the combat. There are very few feelings more intoxicating than bringing a giant mace down on the head of a robot enemy and having their shell cave in before your eyes. There is a minor variety of weapons to choose from, such as maces and axes, both one and two-handed. In addition to the melee weapons, we have the more common implements of warfare, such as the Kalash, Makarov and the tantamount bringer of destruction, the Shotgun.With all that said, the unfortunate downfall of this paradigm is that the ""powers"" P-3 unlocks throughout his development remain underwhelming until they have a substantial investment from the player. The ""Shok"" skill at the beginning of the game is extremely weak and provides little reason to use it beyond taking down the miscreant flying robot before a reload.As I mentioned above, Atomic Heart is technically an open-world experience, and it could be the interpretation based on map scale. However, from a player's perspective, you will begin to notice red laser barricades all over the place that bar you from freely exploring. So, essentially you will have the illusion of open-world exploration from the safety of a linear experience.While we are speaking of maps, the one implemented here, while visually detailed and impressive to scroll over, is fundamentally useless as you can't set waypoints or zoom in enough to use it when exploring towns.The puzzles in Atomic Heart are pretty fun! They test your aptitude, ability to think under pressure, and how you process information in your environment. The ""testing grounds"" are particularly entertaining situations as they are built purely to do this to you and act, for the most part, as puzzle dungeons for you to complete. Easily one of the best parts of the Atomic Heart journey.My last point is more of a peeve than anything else, and while it is an annoying bug, it doesn't fundamentally change the gameplay experience. The achievements for Atomic Heart are fundamentally ""broken"" as many will not tally their objectives, and others will be impossible due to missing or poorly designed mechanics.From a purely visual standpoint, Atomic Heart is above many in design and presentation, and it stands as one of the most breathtaking gaming experiences I've ever had the opportunity to enjoy. The general ambience with how the trees sway and the subtle way the grass ripples with each gust of wind is sublime. It's also true of the finer textures, old and worn rails have visible paint peeling away, the makeshift guns you create have scratches and scuffs on their surface, and cables are frayed and worn. The attention to detail is immense.The audio doesn't quite hit the same mark., The voice acting is pretty subpar, the general audio ambience feels generic, and dialogue is interrupted by things and doesn't continue afterwards, which leaves plenty of conversational blanks.With Atomic Heart set to Ultra settings and running at 2560 x 1440, I had minimal framerate drops below 60 FPS. There was a substantial quantity of bugs in the game, such as; textural and gameplay issues.🟧 Achievements are broken and are impossible to 100% complete at this stage.🟨 Visual quality drops greatly in the latter portion of the game, and the number of graphical tears and missing textures increases exorbitantly.RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 42%)CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 21%)GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 47%)I wanted to love this game so much. I gave it many chances to impress me, and the experience failed to meet my expectations every time. The game isn't bad, it's just bland in nearly every facet of its creation, and that's why it will be unmemorable. The voice acting is poor, the jokes are crude and dry, and the overall gameplay loop is unsatisfying. If you are still keen to play Atomic Heart, wait for a steep enough sale to negate the sting of the purchase."

56,Fitz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fleethalls/,486,14,0,31.5,February,26,161,0,1,"TLDR; It's not a bad game, but it's not worth the hype nor the full price. The story execution is mid at best, the english voice acting is rough and the gameplay is repetitive. Outside of its premise and visuals, there's nothing special to it. Get it on sale if you really want it. If you really want to get this game, get it on sale because it's definitely not worth the full price. The score and the art direction is nice, but it falls short on everything else. While the premise is interesting, the story is poorly executed and there's no feeling of resolution to either endings (if anything, the endings, for me, knocked the game down to a 4/10 at best). The game entirely relies on near incessant info dumping to convey its story and its world, and it does very little to make Atomic Heart's universe feel more alive or immersive. It gets tiring fast both on account of the amount of information being thrown at you and the english voice acting. Said voice acting is  middle of the road. Conversations feel stiff and unnatural, which I guess does go with the characters— they all feel rather bland. The main character only stands out because of how annoying he comes off across. Outside of that, he very much just feels like your generic action shooter protagonist. The gameplay gets boring and repetitive fast. Most of the game involves searching and retrieving something, with a few different puzzles and some combat in-between. There's very little variation in the puzzles and while they do show up here and there, it's definitely not enough for this game to have the puzzle tag attached to it. The combat is fairly alright, but again, very run of the mill at best. At worst, it gets annoying when there are repair robots in the area, and even worse when facing the Plyush type enemies, which become repetitive bosses in a few sections. There are few boss fights in the game, but none of them feel particularly fun or rewarding. And for a game claiming to be open world, exploring doesn't feel rewarding either. Outside of the testing grounds, there's no real incentive to explore, except maybe a few computers where you can read some emails. All in all, Atomic Heart had a lot of potential, but it fell short on too many aspects for me to recommend the game at that price point (or frankly, at all). Once the novelty of its visuals wear off, it very quickly starts feeling exhausting. It's especially disappointing, for me. I don't usually write reviews, but this was one of the games I was most looking forward to. My mistake was coming in with high expectations, something that felt justified with all the positive reviews. I should have lowered said expectations, because for a full-priced game, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. While it has its highs, it also has a lot of lows which, for me, really outweighed the good. Again, for a game selling at an AAA game price, its quality doesn't reflect that. If you're willing to buy the game at full price, all the more power to you, but nothing in Atomic Heart justifies that price point."

The game is solid runs great and i only got a 1070 haven't run into a single bug combat is fun lots of different combinations of skills and weapons you can use story is nothing crazy but its certainly not terrible voice acting is great not sure what the negative reviews are talking about but if you look most of them didn't last a hour so that tells you everything you need to know. im  12 hours in at the time of this review and im loving it i will say the beginning can be a bit tedious at times but i never felt like it was dragging if anything my need to collect every box that required problem solving and some jumping around made it take a little longer but im into that. i found the comedy written in with some of the robots and other things i won't spoil were funny. i think people are just quick to judge things these days not going in with a open mind. also its not Russian propaganda your not funding any wars by buying this its just honest people who put a lot of hard work into this game and it shows.negatives would be FOV slider needs to be added but they may have just wanted that up close and personal feel when your fighting
59,SludgeKidd,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002254968/,"2,254",144,0,27.8,February,21,447,211,1,"TLDR: Turns out its an okay game with wacky gameplay design decisions along with a insufferable Protagonist and his talking hand. Wait for a sale if you dont have gamepass. Game is worth on a surface level. This is a prime example of an awesome vision with not so great execution. Unfortunately you will see a lot of the reviews praising it for having robot mommies and nothing else... The game has an awesome atmosphere that is CONSTANTLY cut into with the annoying protagonist with the atrocious writing. the first two hours are non stop unlocking doors  and doing very simple but tedious puzzles ( all while the protagonist makes duke nukem jokes to nintendo power glove ) eventually when you finish what seems like a 2 hour tutorial you are let ""free"" in what seems to be an open world. That is where the game immediately died for me. You soon realize the game is going to be just frustrating to play to the point that you can not explore the mysterious and creative world, for example; there are cameras that will spot you. If spotted you now have to run and hide or kill robots. the robots are all extremely frustrating to fight and jump all around the screen which you cant even keep track of due to no FOV slider in the game. Then, If you kill robots during this there is a GTA wanted level that spawns more robots. THEN, if you shoot the camera a robot will come and repair it. So there is no clearing out the area to explore, there will ALWAYS be enemies which sounds cool until almost every enemy is really irritating to deal with ( especially with 55 POV ). This game would of been incredible if they leaned into the mysterious and extremely unique atmosphere but instead they added dialogue that was just really a bummer to hear. Its not even to the point where it can be ignored. the protagonist and the glove talk SO much that while im doing something the dialogue would get cut off by OTHER dialogue because i started doing something else that they had to talk about. The worst part is there are moments where you go, ""wow this is cool"" only to have to deal with almost everything about the game being irritating. EDIT 15 HOURS IN:Used another program to Fix my FOV problem and tried the Russian voice actor.FOV slider made the game Much MUCH more enjoyable for me but it was another software i had to downloadRussian voice actor was way better. (less anime effect) but they talk so much and very quickly while the subtitles are small and out of the way that i could not keep up with it while solving puzzles or hectic combat. I know I'm a Boomer and, learn to READ ect. But its actually a skill issue for me i guess.The game has warmed up to me in a lot of ways. I've been going around and collecting blueprints and exploring while dipping in and out of the main story, but there is still glaring issues. As I've been playing i continually  have moment where i go WOW that is cool. unfortunately I ask ""why?"" even more. the WORST offender is the repair bots and cameras still. No they are not everywhere and, yes they can be disabled but once disabled they get repaired AGAIN. There are moments of combat on the over world, where i have to tell myself to just stop shooting the robots because they will just send more of these little repair bots over to repair what i just killed. its not hard, just frustrating and irritating more so than fun. But man when it is fun it kinda kicks ass. Its unfortunate that i really only find myself thinking that occasionally. Exploration is actually cool and there are some neat things to figure out and I've found myself enjoying it quite a bit. A very odd way of explaining it so far is the game seems over designed. It seems like its not sure what it wants its core gameplay Wants to be. i feel like the devs had something really awesome a while ago and kept adding more and more unneeded structure. If you actually pay attention to what is happening, you realize that you are running around solving Creative but mundane puzzles. See a few enemies. Dispatch them Them and repeat...But then there is the off chance where you are BLASTING robots and flinging them into the air, while you get dropkicked and the music is POPPING TF OFF. You are absolutely grooving to it while SPLOOGING HOT ELECTRIC GOO from your Nintendo power glove. Then it ends and you ask why there isn't more of that in the game. Will add more maybe when im done if i care still"
60,SPecTRo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/someone_behind_you/,78,13,1,31.1,February,24,359,0,1,"Horny refrigerator made my day xDThe game perfectly transfers the atmosphere, the graphics look just amazing (you'll have a chance to enjoy them, once you get into the streets, though the game is quite demanding on your GPU, you should keep that in mind). Overall really enjoyed the game (I haven't completed it fully while writing the review, but I have received enough of gameplay experience and emotions) and the combat mechanics. You are allowed to reset your skills/disassemble weapons, that gives you chance to test out different builds. I'm playing on medium difficulty, the game might seem a bit tough in the very beginning, when you meet your first enemies, but you quickly get used to controling and start feeling the charecter and damage you deal/get.However, there's one disadvantage worth mentioning: bad parkour mechanics. Even the ability to quickly dash in the direction of your movement doesn't really help climbing certain locations you'd like to get to. Despite the fact, the main hero is quite strong man with military background, at times it's ridiculous, how you can't grab on the edge of that box 1,5 meters high and climb on it. Another possible disadvantage (not for me though, I like this kinda stuff) might be necessity for looting (you need materials for upgrading and crafting), while constantly spamming your scanner to see whether your left something behind or not.Even though, the game was just released (at the time of this review only 3 days passed, no big patches were released), it runs quite smoothly on ultra settings (at least on my RTX 3070Ti), only random lags and drops of FPS may occur at 0,1% lows. I'd recommend this game, but you may need to wait for a while, once all possible glitches/visual bugs/lags will be fixed and the promised DLCs will be finally out. Not all people may think that the price is fair, therefore you better wait for a discount, however, I didn't really regret any cent I've spent on this game (I bought Gold Edition)."

72,Bearsonal,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bearsonal/,121,5,0,19.8,February,27,"1,291",20,1,"As you may know, I often dislike games, but I get disappointed by them very rarely, since I have low expectations most of the time. But to be frank, Atomic Heart looked absolutely insanely good in the trailers, so I have been waiting for it to come out for years. In the end, you can all guess that Atomic Heart was unfortunately a huge letdown. Poor me, he had no idea what was coming in the next 20 hours. The first hour of the game was amazing. I thought I was playing a Game of the Year contender; the atmosphere, reminiscent of Bioshock Infinite's Columbia, was even better in Atomic Heart's prologue. The art direction and attention to detail were all top-notch and I really enjoyed it.This is the part where things start going downhill. After that impressive 1 hour introductory section, we are sent to an underground bunker. In this bunker, we are given 4 hours of fetch quest style missions. We are asked to collect 4 canisters each from the far side of this bunker. Throughout this mission, we are sent to 4 distinct lab-style places which have great art direction, but they are so drastically different from each other that it is a little bit immersion-breaking. This also applies to the enemy visual design, tons of robots everywhere, and 2 minutes later, clickers from The Last of Us. What? This part of the game also has ridiculously terrible pacing and level design. You fight the same 2 enemies all the time. There are tons of mandatory badly placed and designed puzzles. It all feels so weird, I can't explain it any further, you have to experience it for yourselves. These ""puzzles"" are only put there to take your time and are so tedious that even the developer team acknowledges it and thus the character complains about these puzzles several times. Dear Mundfish, just so you know, accepting your poor level design does not let you get away with it. I will criticize it nevertheless. After that, the player is given access to the open world, where you are expected to travel through point A to point B up until the finale. There are some dungeons to explore but they are not even comparable to the well designed ones in Botw or Elden Ring either. So, to get to point B, you can hop into a car. This car explodes after 1 minor hit, so the most convenient way to travel is to walk. Wait until you get spotted by one of the many cameras. To shut down the cameras, you have to climb these Far Cry style towers and turn them off. Even If you don't get spotted by a camera, there are so many robots patrolling around, one of them surely will see you. These enemies have terrible AI. Sometimes they will notice you from miles away, and sometimes they won't see you when you are just in front of them. Stealth system also does not work because of this AI issue. Regardless of how, you will get noticed, and then they will send endless waves of the same group of enemies rushing at you to deplete all your inventory. Which makes engaging them pointless. Their behavior during combat is also strangely stupid. Sometimes they won't telegraph their attacks but just rush on you in a second. You don't get accurate feedback on when you are hit and from where you got the hit. All of these issues with the open world combat balance and enemy placement issues and simply the fact that it is not fun to play, led me to do something I have never done in an open-world game before. Skip the fights and rush to the next mission. It's truly saddening that they have forced me to do that. The map system is horrendous. There are no minimap markers, so you can't mark the next mission and follow a trail, or place a marker and expect it to appear on your compass. This will result in you having to view the minimap every 30 seconds to check if you are on the right track. Another horrible design choice. The enemy variety is also extremely low. They literally showed us all enemy types and almost all bosses in the trailers (even though I only watched one or two trailers on purpose to not spoil it). So do not expect to be shocked by anything in this game. The boss fights themselves are mediocre (by FPS standards maybe a bit better). Still very similar bosses with their attack patterns and how they feel in terms of encouraging you to change your playstyle.Do you remember when I praised the huge art effort inside dungeons, in the overworld it is the opposite. The outdoors have little character and are full of reused assets. You are not motivated by the game to explore because there are no points of interest in the map, also exploring the map does not fit within the narrative, because each minute you spend exploring the map, people will continue to be murdered by the attack. For example in Hogwarts Legacy, they handled this situation way better. In that game, lets say you went on a main mission with Professor Fig. After that, he says that he needs time to investigate on what you had just found about, then, he advices you to focus on your classes and spend time around until he has come back. Things should have been similar here in Atomic Heart. Terrible storytelling with a pretty easy to guess scenario, combined with cliche characters and cringe dialogue full of Marvel jokes. Everything is overly sexualized. It becomes annoying at some point. I can honestly say that I hated the narrative.I think the gameplay mechanics are bland and generic. Who thought that it would be fun to play with standard World War II weapons in a futuristic technological utopia? The only weapon that differs slightly is the energy weapon, which feels like a water gun. The hit reaction of the weapons is okay, but the enemies are too bullet spongy, it is not fun after some time. Melee combat works better since there are some aesthetically pleasing dismemberment physics and animations. The abilites feel okay, but all these mechanics combined do not result into a good game feel due to the many issues I have explained earlier.There are issues with sound design as well. Too many sound effects are missing. I feel like the game is lacking a layer of sound. The music in Atomic Heart is just okay. I liked one or two Russian songs, but the rest are meh. They fall far below Mick Gordon's DOOM music, even though he is the composer for Atomic Heart as well. Atomic Heart was a game that had infinite potential, but was ruined by extremely flawed execution in level design, pacing, writing, balance, open world design, repetitive and simply not fun gameplay and almost in every other category that I mentioned above. It will remain as my greatest disappointment for some time.Follow My Curator Page:"

In the process, you can watch.- Beautifully designed sci-fi robots - Never before has a vending machine been so friendly to me xo xo- Grinding is possible and can help when you are stuckCon:- Open world rather unnecessary than worth exploring- Collectibles and upgrades are scattered all over the world, which is not very accessible- No quick travel points- You can't use waymarkers.- Always a huge pile of enemies in front of some paths.Conclusion:In my opinion a very good shooter that Mundfish has delivered, it can join the Bioshock games 1 to 1, no matter if it's design or music everything goes in the same gloomy/dystopian direction. For me an absolute feast. It's challenging but not overwhelming, at times you feel more on the run than fighting, once the enemies have sounded the alarm you have to take your feet in your hands. Which was always fun for me. As for the story, I can only say (without spoiling) that it's about the Soviet Union planning the next ""big"" leap with the help of new technology, and then everything turns out differently than you would expect. From my side a clear recommendation for this game, for every Bioshock fan a must!"

The game also boasts impressive graphics, with realistic lighting effects and detailed character models. The combat system in the game is based on a mix of melee and ranged attacks, with a variety of weapons available to the player.Another unique aspect of Atomic Heart is its story, which is heavily influenced by Soviet-era science fiction and horror. The game's plot is filled with mystery and intrigue, as you will uncover the secrets of the research facility and the strange creatures that inhabit it. The game also features a variety of side quests and NPCs, which add depth and complexity to the game's world.Overall, Atomic Heart is great game with a lot of unique features and interesting gameplay mechanics. While it may not be the best game for everyone, it certainly has a lot to offer and is worth checking out for fans of science fiction and retro-futuristic aesthetics.

I really wanted to like this one, but there were a few major issues that prevented it from shining. The world feels shallow, very limited enemy variety and samey environments. The endlessly respawning enemies in the open world make exploration more of a stressful chore than something to enjoy. Multitudes of small bugs, from enemies spawning inside objects to the player getting stuck on walls. Still, it might be fun to just beeline it through the more linear main story bits, if not for the protagonist.  More specifically, his dialog. Swearing in no way shape or form bothers me, but this guy just doesn't stop. It's like listening to a eight year old who just heard someone say ""♥♥♥♥"" for the first time trying to sound cool by shotgunning it into their sentences with no regard as to whether or not it makes sense. And even without the random cursing the guy just comes across as an unlikable moron. All that said the game does feel like it had some genuinely good ideas put into it, they just didn't end up working them into a functioning whole. If you can pick it up on sale and are willing to play with it set to Russian language to avoid listening to your character constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ and whine it may well be worth it, otherwise pass."

84,Diabolic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dblc/,179,10,0,23.8,March,1,"3,188",0,1,"Wish I could recommend this wholeheartedly.First of all, this is not the ""Soviet Bioshock"" game you are looking for, sure it has lots of similarities with the Bioshock franchise but it's not even close 90% of the time.The ambiance is there, the graphics are the music is there but everything else is simply bland.There are tons of gameplay mechanics either half-assed or never realized enough within the game. You can climb, grab, and vault but apart from a few areas where you absolutely need it you never want to depend on it because for some reason it works on some specially marked areas and some random edges of the random stuff on the map. Not every ledge is a ledge you can grab.You can drive cars in this game but it's the exact same car everywhere and there are only a few paths to drive it. You can use your elemental abilities to electrocute or freeze stuff but it's mostly unnecessary or totally coincidental because the game never lets you do anything with it the elements -again apart from a few areas where you absolutely need it-.Training grounds are just a good idea repeated but randomized each time again and again 8 times.The open world is there for some reason but there is almost nothing about it is fun. I'm not talking about endless respawns or something that triggered me within the open world. There is absolutely nothing to do in the open world other than looting some containers scattered around.  The game introduces you to tons of mechanics about the open world and almost never does anything about it. The save system is just bad, it's obvious that the developers wanted the game to feel more like ""Bioshock-y"" but the first Bioshock game was released 16 years ago. I never had any issues with the save system at all but the requirement to find a spot to save your game feels very very dated today.The story is plain bad, I'm not talking about the cheesy/cringe-ass protagonist, I'm talking about the story itself. I'm extremely done with this story, I've played, watched, and read the almost exact story within different settings more than 10 times each. I wasn't exactly expecting a mind-blowing story or anything.Weapons were just meh. I played the entire game almost exclusively with Shotgun and Melee weapons and upgraded Mass Telekinesis to the max. Almost every combat was a cakewalk for trash mobs and bosses just took some time. There are many ranged weapons but almost everything rushes to your face and there is almost no reason to use ranged weapons.I leveled up almost all abilities to some extent but never actually needed them.The entire game feels like some ideas stitched together and thrown out before us to play.Testing grounds feel like shrines from Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild but badly done.Open World feels like pulled straight out of the Far Cry / Assassin's Creed series but badly done.Gameplay feels like the mishmash of Bioshock and Doom 2016 but quite badly done.Above all else the soundtrack is phenomenal.This is definitely not a 60$ game, if you are interested wait for a 50% or at least for a minimum 33% discount if you ask me."
85,DRACER,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IDRACERI/,30,3,1,63.7,February,25,622,0,1,Well the game that has been anticipated for years is out. From the moment this game starts it honestly has Bioshock Infinite vibes. The setting is on a floating Russian city with even an Andrew Ryan esque figure running the show. Which makes sense since the devs literally said Bioshock was a heavy inspiration. Graphically this game is gorgeous in motion. So long as you can ignore the same two soldier models which are constantly recycled. That being said the machines are where this game shines. Each machine is honestly entrancing in the way they move. Almost like living works breathing works of art. Its almost a shame to blow them up....but you gotta do what you gotta do to survive.....crispy critters.Gameplay wise this game struggles a bit. From the get go I had to turn down the sensitivity and the screen motion as honestly it was making me sick. Melee combat feels good and I like the abilities you can use as they mirror plasmids to a degree. Though gunplay feels off slightly and aiming down sights feels weird. Not sure if im the only one who feels this way. The puzzles are interesting but frequently left me scratching my head....inevitably Id figure them out but sometimes frustration took me out of the experience. The weapon crafting/upgrade system is fine...though alot of the weapons feel....well not good. I feel I relied heavily on my abilities and a shotgun. Because literally everything else felt useless. Story wise this game shines as well. Its weird....its campy at times....I love it. Each character you run into is at some level of insanity which sells the plot. I also loved how you could delve into the lore of the game just to add extra info to how everything went down. All in all I really enjoyed the game. I felt like it took its inspiration of Bioshock and literally made it its own. The gameplay could use a little refining but all in all its solid. I felt this game was overly ambitious at times. Like the developers had alot of really cool ideas but just werent able to implement them properly. Closing this game is a bizarre thrill ride through a Russian utopia gone wrong. If you like Bioshock you'll feel right at home. Ill give this crispy critter a solid 8/10. I look forward to Mundfish games in the future.

I would heavily suggest waiting for a sale as the current quality of the game is not worth 60 bucks. -Horrible English voice acting. I don't know where or how they chose their English voice actors, but my god its terrible. Most of the dialogue is extremely cringy with overused 1 liners like, ""crispy critters"". -Powers are subpar and extremely underwhelming in effectiveness-Enemies are basic bullet sponges-Movement is extremely clunky. Repeatedly get stuck on objects in game for no reason with some items having invisible walls that extend past the actual objects visual boundaries. The design of the fixed FOV and speed of some enemy attacks (some of which have horrible framerates) make for a jarring experience where it is hard to keep track of the position of multiple attacking enemies. Either they need to speed up the player speed and/or add in sprint, or they need to drastically reduce the dash cooldown with more dash uses stored. The player freedom regarding movement just does not match the flow of the game. -Upgrade paths are okay, The 3 basic guns you get at the beginning offer all that is really needed and there's no real incentive to really craft new weapons. -Puzzles are a big letdown. My god are they extremely simple and tedious. Most of the time the shoddy UI and design of the puzzles make for annoying experience rather than an interesting one. -Story is okay. Nothing mindblowing. All in all, its just okay. I really stress that this game is NOT WORTH 60 BUCKS. I really hate it when the community leaves positive reviews as if a game really deserves the full price it is charging. People really need to take the time to understand that recommending a game should include whether or not the price tag is justified. A game can still be serviceable without deserving price tag that comes along with it. This game is a perfect example of that."

91,{kTp}Dr.Thraxx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MM-HVH/,91,1,0,14.8,February,21,533,0,1,"Let me preface this with I really wanted to like this game. This game has let me down so much. You find yourself doing ""Find the key"" fetch quests over and over while doing tedious puzzles that are not a challenge just there to take your time. It becomes insulting when after playing this game over 12 hours I am hard pressed to think of anything i have done that was not just trying to open a damn door! On top of that when it isn't open a door it is find the parts of something so that then you can go open a door! The character in game even spends 40% of all dialogue he has complaining and joking with his glove about these damn locks and puzzles. I kept playing this because I was waiting for it to get better only to find that it was just tedious to play. The voice lines are just weird and go from cursing non stop to saying crispy critters as an exclamation only to then say and i quote ""Crispy ♥♥♥♥♥♥'... where's the ♥♥♥♥-ass way out of here?! Underground or something?!"" Voice lines seem hard scripted to areas so if you are talking to your glove and keep walking sometimes you just stop talking mid sentence. Other times if you do the same thing twice the voice lines will start over like you never said them before. Some of the things in the game look cool but quickly start to just run together. enemies just all feel the same with slight variation and they added a mechanic to the mix of everything you kill causes repair bots to swarm the area and build it back over and over and over. I care about that much less but it still just makes even exploring the world feel like a chore. If you have to have this game wait until it is 75% off"

The mimicry of Bioshock's world-building and weaponry I can handle, but they somehow haven't elaborated at all on the game design that was common in 2012 AAA games.- No FOV slider. Guys. Developer comment: ""It doesn't need one because the default FOV of 85 is higher than most games"". Have the developers played an FPS game on a PC in the last 8 years? Or do they just play on their 80 inch Samsungs from 15 feet away? It just makes no sense and the developer comment doesn't clear anything up.- Forced mouse acceleration. - Some animations are locked at less than 60fps and it's super distracting, which is a shame because the animations are really nice.- There are voice logs everywhere. ""Press G to listen"". This was stupid 10 years ago and it's even more stupid now. The main characters are talking non-stop at the beginning, and you pick up a 30-second audio log every couple of rooms. There's no time to listen to them unless you just stand and stare at a wall! This is the sort of thing you pick up on and fix  in early development of the level layout. Do they think their customers will walk extremely slowly through their game with their jaw on the floor in admiration of the art and graphics? Is that how they instructed their QA playtesters to play the game???- The dialogue is just bad. I'm reminded of a proverb that warns against swearing unnecessarily, because there's always a better word or phrase to express a strong emotion. Well, get ready to hear every character - ESPECIALLY the protagonist - screaming ""f*ck!"" every time their heart rate goes over 80bpm because I guess the writers didn't have anything better for them to say.- The protagonist speaks like a side character in a Ubisoft open-world sport game. If you know what I'm talking about then you know.- The kind of combat in this game doesn't appeal to me to start with, but on top of that, it's one of the worst examples of its kind. It plays like an immersive sim, with awkward melee combat and no way to move quickly (except for an awful dash that takes 3 seconds to cooldown with no indicator when it's ready), but is really determined to be an action FPS like Bioshock. If Prey (2017) does a better job at combat than your action FPS then you have a serious problem.Great art and a good looking environment. I was surprisied by the Royksopp music during the intro, I love that band and I thought it was neat. 1 point for the Mick Gordon music that I didn't get to listen to but I'm sure is really excellent. 0 points for everything else. Bit of a waste of time. Play Bioshock Infinite or Prey 2017 instead."

98,Yossarian the Assyrian,https://steamcommunity.com/id/raidingvirus/,20,,1,23.2,March,9,225,0,1,"Atomic Heart is what you'd call a AA game - unlike a modern AAA game that tries to incorporate tons of elements into a single title, Atomic Heart maintains a narrower focus that allows it to refine its main mechanics. The result is a strange, endearing, and mostly well-made atompunk FPS with RPG and exploration elements. Some aspects are clunkier than others, but the game generally succeeds in what it sets out to accomplish.In Atomic Heart, the Soviet Union has revolutionized transportation, robotics, and communication using an organic technology called ""polymer."" On the day that the USSR's ""Collective"" initiative is set to launch, the worker robots in its main scientific facility go berserk and begin killing lab personnel and other civilians. As Major P-3, a close assistant to the facility's lead scientist, you're tasked with ending the robots' rampage and uncovering the source of their altered behaviors. Along the way, P-3 battles against plant mutants, numerous kinds of robots, and other bizarre creatures made by the facility. Investigating the attacks uncovers hard truths behind the ""utopia"" created by the USSR, from sleazy political maneuvering to dark secrets that threaten the future of Soviet science.Combat in Atomic Heart reminds me of a mix of Bioshock Infinite and Resident Evil: Village, which is admittedly a strange comparison. Your backpack allows you to carry a limited number of supplies and weapons, but you can decide what to put in it, whether it's a ton of medical supplies or some guns/ammo/vodka bottles. While your right hand uses guns and melee weapons, your left hand can use special abilities given by CHAR-LES, the AI assistant within P-3's glove. You can continue to shoot or attack while creating a polymer shield or levitating objects, which hampers speed/accuracy but allows you to stay on the offensive. Broken robots, dead mutants, and storage units can be scavenged for supplies - some of which can be used to upgrade your abilities or build new items/weapons. Enemies are pretty ruthless and will put up a serious fight, especially in the early game. They will alternate between ranged and close-range attacks, use telegraphed special attacks to knock you down, or even fly out of your attacks ranges. Without the right abilities to soften up enemies or exploit their weaknesses, they will end up being tanky and shrugging off a lot of initial attacks. Fortunately, the game paces itself slowly at first, only throwing one or two robots at a time. The first complex you explore sets up the robot and mutant enemies while showcasing mechanics like customization, electronic lockpicking, ability upgrades, and scanning the environment for supplies.When you're introduced to the exploration elements 3-4 hours in, though, there is a sharp difficulty spike. Enemies are much more frequent in the ""open world"" segments, and robots will be reinforced by repair drones that will bring them back to life, albeit without any parts to scavenge. Picking fights in this state can be disastrous, especially since you can never stop the repair drones from coming to help other robots. Mutants can be permanently killed, though, making them a much more satisfying enemy to fight in the open sections. My advice would be upgrade the SHOK ability to the ""chain lightening"" power as soon as possible, since it stuns robots and is effective at downing repair drones.Robot enemies have a ton of variety when it comes to their designs and tactics, from the usual humanoid robots to stumpy lumberjack robots with sawblades for heads. The damage you deal is reflected on their models, like scorch marks from SHOK attacks and paint being chipped off from repeated gunshots and melee strikes. It's satisfying to go ham and absolutely tear them apart with explosives, full-power axe swings, and point-blank shotgun blasts. The game's arsenal is limited to 12 weapons, but each one stands out with its own strengths. I enjoyed how melee weapons remained relevant throughout the game, since they restore energy weapons' batteries on hits and can punch through energy shields.The mutants are also a fun faction to fight, even if they aren't as prominent as the robots. Their behavior and tactics are much more animalistic, rushing you without regard for their safety or launching disgusting projectiles at you. Defeating them hinges on tracking down and destroying their hives, followed by eliminating the infected humans and plant mutants still active in the area. They don't take damage as visibly as the robots, but they still can explode and get gibbed on death. Both factions are used exclusively in some areas, keeping you from getting too used to them or bored with one or the other.I enjoyed Atomic Heart, but it has some notable flaws that should be brought up. Some of the robot enemies are downright frustrating to fight, especially when they've been rebuilt and no longer offer any scavenging rewards. The sawblade robots and artillery ones have small hitboxes and spam knockdown attacks too frequently. The game is too generous with the repair drones in the open world areas, where you'll feel like no progress is made after a squad of robots gets rebuilt moments after you leave them. You can drive around in marked cars in these areas, but I didn't really enjoy the controls for driving and just ran around on foot (to be fair, this also gave me more chances to scrounge up resources, and the destinations aren't too far apart in-game). A few bosses have Quick Time Events that will instantly kill you regardless of your health or their health, and this as unsatisfying and frustrating as it sounds.Some mechanics in Atomic Heart also seem unrefined, pointless, or unused after a certain point. The game teaches you about opening certain doors with SHOK...which you never do after leaving the first complex. There's a parkour system for climbing around obstacles and platforming, but it is only used in 4 or 5 sequences throughout the game. Bonus ""testing grounds"" scattered throughout the map offer exclusive weapon parts and rewards for completing their puzzles, but I made it through the story and stomped most late-game threats without ever visiting a single one. NORA, the red upgrade station that's unhealthily attracted to P-3, rarely talks between the first open-world segment and the buildup to the final boss battle. It feels like there were some changes in the game's main features during development, and these earlier parts of it weren't altered to reflect the new priorities.It took me around 23 hours to beat Atomic Heart, and that includes some grinding I did to heavily upgrade my SHOK ability before the hedgehog robot boss. The game lasts long enough to hold your interest, but it also bows out before it overstays its welcome. The two endings leave room for a sequel or DLC expansion, but they are mostly satisfying and wrap up the events of the storyline. The game will take a pretty good PC to run, but you can squeeze out some more frames per second by going to Atomic Heart's AppData folder and cranking its settings down. It's a shame the game doesn't let you lower its resolution...Atomic Heart is a wild, chaotic ride of an FPS game. It's not perfect, but it's fun and tells a story that will keep you on your toes with each new development. The length is also appropriate without feeling bloated. I would recommend it, but I would recommend making sure your computer can run it before buying it. I had to do a lot of adjustments on my end to make it semi-playable, and I still faced lag spikes at times. The overall concept is novel and the soundtrack has some standout tracks like ""Starry Summer."" In the end, I was willing to look past its flaws and enjoy what the game had to offer."

The Russo-Ukrainian war however, beginning in 2014. - Not all Citizens reflect the political thoughts of government of the country they're from.- Yes, the shady backing of the game by GEM Capital & Tencent should be noted.- AND yes, Mundfish did not comment  on the war but did comment on their stance.With this knowledge in mind, we have to remember the developers cannot speak out against the war directly because of the consequences that come with doing so. If they aren't affected by it directly, their families will likely be next.The majority of American Companies do not want to invest in a Russian company at this time. And those who have have previously done so are curtaining their operations leaving a Russian company to receive investment from another Russian company (GEM / ex-Gazprom) & international companies (Gaijin / Tencent) not based in America. They have been left with no choice.People have been waiting to play this game since 2017 when the teaser for this game first dropped. We as consumers of this should not harass or try to condemn citizens for things out of their control.Still with all of this information included, there is no definitive information that says, funds from this game are going to fund the war.====================Now let me offer a possible solution  funding a war is the uttermost concern but you still want to play this game: OR .And if you already bought the game and heard about the controversy after racking up a few hours past the refund window, support Ukrainian developers. Buy one of their games. Donate to Ukrainian fund. I already bought S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 as a result. If I am completely wrong with what have observed / concluded from doing my research, then do what you can do make things right. I'll be doing the same.=====================With this being said, I'm having fun with the game. I'm not 100% satisfied but I am at least enjoying it. The protagonist and his glove do talk a lot though... and I mean, A LOT."
108,TheTornEye,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheTornEye/,147,14,0,17.8,February,22,363,0,1,"First, I'm gonna put, I'm one of the ""Founder"" pre-orderers you might have heard about. So I already have a chip on my shoulder about that mess, but I'll stick with factual game issues. Also, I've beaten the game, took me 17.5 hours and about 2-5 hours was me wandering around to see the sights. Or farming components.1. Storyline- It was mehh at best. You didn't have to pay attention to know what was going on, and the twists could be seen a mile away. Was it different? A little, but not by much. It's a story old as time, and I'll leave it at that.2. Combat- It was prevalent, sure, but it was lackluster. You can swap out any of the firearms, and not notice the difference. For example, I used the shotgun and pistol almost the entire game. The only time I swapped was because I had more ammo for one gun than the other. And I didn't notice a difference in combat. The melee weapons were almost the same. They all had about the same swing speed, approximate damage, and upgrades. The only difference were the ""special"" attacks, which you had to unlock in optional ""Proving Grounds"". Dodge was useful, but janky, sometimes it works, sometimes you get hit anyway. It's not quite ""polished"" to use their own phrase.  Side Note- Use a controller, Keyboard/Mouse is hard sometimes in combat.3. Sexualization- Where do I start? Ignoring the massive amounts of ""Twins"" lust, the game feels like it's shoving it in your face without reason. The door lock shapes? Come on. The BDSM crafting station? Really? It feels like it was unneeded. Like I get, use sex to sell, but this just felt tacky instead of the ""subtlety"" they were shooting for.4. Stealth- There isn't any. They say you can stealth the game, and if you have nothing else to do that day, maybe you can. But spending 30 mins, to approach a location, to be spotted by a camera behind a house across the street, just makes it useless. The bots constantly replenish themselves, so it's a slog sometimes, and there's no silenced weapons in the game. So shooting out the camera alerts the bots nearby, making it kind of useless.Also, as a founder, I have to point out, there should be almost no graphical errors, or physics issues, after literally 3 years of ""polishing"". That's all I'll say about founder gripes, but I know I'm not alone in that frustration.Overall it's a 5/10. Not bad, but not ground breaking. A good way to kill a dozen hours, but not for 60$. Maybe wait for a sale."
109,Global Warming,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978109526/,36,,0,12.0,February,28,464,0,1,"When your character complains multiple times that the amount of puzzles blocking progress is getting really annoying, maybe it's actually annoying for the player as well? Combat feels weird, easy mode is freeze everything and axe spin, but it makes combat boring. Stealth is way too slow to be really engaging and determining line of sight of enemies is difficult as they don't have clear line of sight. Sometimes things can be hidden behind, and other things can't, but then you can be out in the open and not agro nearby enemies. It feels extremely inconsistent, dodging is the same way. Dodging seems to give you some either randomly left or right directional impulse that may have to do with floor slant, but it never feels like you dodge straight forward.Platforming is a little off, it's close to good, but not quite there, lots and LOTS of invisible walls, especially once you get outside. Jumping feels a bit anemic, and the telekinesis control is annoyingly short ranged and rather finicky for the amount of puzzles that require it. Loot collecting is fun, walk into a room and proceed to hoover tons of gear, quite satisfying and lots of upgrades and sidegrades to a decent variety of weapons. Though I literally haven't needed to craft anything beyond the mandatory progression pieces. Axe, shotgun, and electro pistol are carrying quite well with shok and frostbite, and goo spray being a rarely used third option.The game does look pretty and runs well on my computer which I built a couple years ago, the setting is really, really cool, though sometimes a bit absurd, and there is some forced comedy in the writing. I'm just glad not every damn crafting station is as lusty as a select few. The character calls this out too, seriously, you're calling out flaws in the game, in the game, that doesn't mean it's good or funny, it means it's flawed and instead of making it better, you called it out and played it for laughs instead of engagement.Lastly bugs. Had one crash, got stuck floating between a table and chair and couldn't progress, and softlocked hedgie on my second go at him with freeze which caused him to slowdown by a factor of about 100, but because of that, he wouldn't progress to the damage phase, chip damaged him with the electro pistol to 50%, and got then it locked at the scripted midpoint event.TL;DRInteresting and cool world to explore, but exploration and gameplay loses fun after you're looping through the same puzzles multiple times, just to achieve a tiny bit of progress to get locked multiple repeating puzzles again.Update:This is now three times where the character has complained about the annoyance of puzzles."

I bought this game because of two reasons. I was interested about the world that the developers have created and what kind of story it would tell me. In regards to the  it is something else, it's different and I love it. Atomic Heart's world is full of bizarre things and occurrences and it doesn't shy away from subjects that are considered somewhat taboo. For example the sexually (under)toned robots. When it comes to the art style and the visual design of said world, it is simultaneously grandiose and pragmatic. Grandiose as any totalitarian government tends to orient, and pragmatic in the little villages where you can see cows and pigs herding. There is a lot of attention to detail. My first playthrough took me about 35 hours just because of the sheer amount of interesting things to see, and the dialogue. In regards to dialogue there is a lot of it, and I refuse to listen poorly dubbed pretend to be Russian. Only way to play this game is with original audio and subtitles. So that led me to stand still and focusing on the dialogue every time the characters had a conversation. As I'm writing this, the subtitles need some work, sometimes disappearing way too fast or not appearing at all. This is somewhat rare and I don't feel like I've missed anything.  itself is good and entertaining and the plot surprised me and that is a big plus. It feels exiting every time I'm wrong with my presumptions about the characters and their motives. P-3 (main character) on the other hand felt like a broken record, but when I thought about it so he should be. He is supposed to be loyal to the man who saved him. Only problem is that I didn't see that happening, I don't know how good of a father figure Sechenov is to P-3, so I just have to try to keep in mind that this is a father and son relationship. All and all I enjoyed most of the conversations and did my best to talk to as many ""NPCs"" as possible.  is solid. It is fun and engaging. Melee weapons have the oomph, guns are fun to use, ammo is readily available. It is so well balanced that I feel like this is the first game ever, where i don't have to choose between minmaxing either guns or melee. Both are just as viable. Progression is standard, you upgrade your weapons and character's abilities. In order to do that you need resources which are gained by looting. Looting itself is created in a way that isn't tedious but satisfying. There are a lot of puzzles and they are good ones. Sometimes they are bit easier, with couple of ones I had to use my head. There are testing facilities, which are optional and mainly consist of puzzles, but by solving these you unlock nice upgrades for your weapons.  is wide ranged and awesome. From Mick Gordon's metal riffs to classical, from russian schlager to east european club tunes. It all fits in and has even an explanation, why it is there.   are few. The subtitle problem which was mentioned before. Achievement's are somewhat buggy and cars break down way too easily in my opinion. Also if you are trying to ram something with a car that is about to charge you, the car loses... Sometimes P-3 gets stuck in the geometry. It was annoying at launch, but got fixed fast. As a final verdict, I could easily recommend this game. Play with native voice overs, since they sound a lot better."

117,commando219,https://steamcommunity.com/id/commando219/,9,,1,29.9,March,11,250,0,1,"(SPOILER FREE REVIEW)Allow me to explain how an extremely bizarre game I initially hated grew to be my favorite game of this year (so far). I'm well acquainted with slav jank. I love games like Pathologic and S.T.A.L.K.E.R., both of which are buggy barely finished messes that are still in my top 10 favorite games of all time. Why? Because they have heart, like this game. Pun intended. Also, like those games, this one was clearly far too ambitious for a first time dev studio which explains the bizarre design decisions and jank. Don't be fooled. This is a AA game being sold as a AAA game. I've had the game crash once. I've gotten stuck on geometry multiple times. The map will suddenly stop working. Atomic Heart is simultaneously a technical achievement and a technical mess. The performance, at launch, was shockingly smooth at max settings 4K resolution. No hitches and my frame rate stayed above 90. Given AAA releases like Hogwarts Legacy still have horrendous performance with awfully implemented ray tracing, that's impressive. The game is beautiful. Easily one of the best looking games to ever come out on a technical and especially artistic level. It's a Soviet nightmare brought to life with some of the smoothest animations I've ever seen. I put it above Machine Games' Wolfenstein titles in art design. Speaking of, this game reminds me most of Wolfenstein instead of Bioshock. They even have Mick Gordon going hard on the fantastic soundtrack. Don't be deceived. This is NOT an ""immersive sim"" despite the obvious ""451"" reference in the boring, linear intro sequence that felt ripped right out of Bioshock Infinite. This game has a poor start, but gets going when you get into your first underground complex.I started loving the game once I dropped the Bioshock expectations and looked at it as more of a boomer shooter like Wolfenstein. Think about it. It heavily emphasizes stealth. Instead of an advanced Nazi society, it's Soviet. The tone is extremely campy with a B-movie action hero dropping catch phrases like ""crispy critters"". There's no weapon limit. There are numerous AWESOME bosses and the combat is high octane and fast paced. This game doesn't take itself seriously at all and I love it. Major Comrade's voice acting is as corny as can be and it worked for me. Charles is genuinely well voice acted and bounces off of our hero's no-bs attitude really well with his professional attitude. The dialogue between them is compelling. The world building is the highlight of the game's writing even if the main story is nothing special. Reading emails on terminals, listening to audio logs, and literally conversing with corpses all flesh out the world in a more substantive manner than constant cutscenes ever could.The gameplay is a huge mix of styles that make for a mixed bag that's more fun than frustrating. The gunplay is damn good. All of the reload animations look incredible and the weapons sound and handle extremely well. There aren't a ton of guns, but the deep customization that modifies the look and feel of each gun with numerous customizable melee weapons AND abilities like telekinesis, shock, frostbite, etc. AND elemental cartridges for every weapon, give the combat a lot of depth. The platforming sections were honestly really fun. It's no Mirror's Edge, but it works. The puzzles could be challenging at times and I liked the creativity of them. Each underground level was very well designed and I must give praise to the awesome enemy variety. Each design is distinct and extremely well animated. When you're getting swarmed, combat can get intense. Unlike 90% of other self-proclaimed ""RPG's"", this game's skill trees do make a massive difference and get me excited to unlock a new skill whenever I visit NORA, the horny vending machine. I'm not joking.However, the open world is pointless and full of undercooked ideas. The camera system has so much potential for Deus Ex style hacking, but all you ever do is open a door sometimes to access this game's take on dungeons called Testing Grounds. There are cars and by cars, I mean that one red model you barely come across that handles like melted ass and breaks fast af. There was very little thought put into the design of the sandbox. They should've focused on just having more levels instead. Also, the stealth is about as basic as can be and is arguably worse than Wolfenstein. Cameras can be easily shocked or outright destroyed with little consequence. Yes, they can get repaired, along with every other enemy, but you'll be long gone before that happens. Escaping high alert status is extremely easy. On top of all of that, the loot in this game is waaaaaaay too plentiful. There's no reason my storage should have dozens of healing items. Either decrease the amount of loot or add more enemies to levels. For whatever reason, you will go through 75% of one of the Testing Grounds doing puzzles, looting, and platforming and not come across a single enemy. Why? This is an FPS isn't it? Also, the save system is hot trash. If you're just going to put a save room every 3 steps, why even have it? Just give us a basic save feature we can access from the pause menu.That really is the core issue with Atomic Heart. It tries to do too much with too little. If they honed in on their strengths, we could be looking at an instant classic, but like S.T.A.L.K.E.R., instead we have a cult classic. This is a game I love, IN SPITE of its issues, NOT because of them. There's just nothing else like it out right now and hopefully, it can escape from Bioshock's shadow. As it stands, I had a great time with this strange, addictive, funny game and I look forward to whatever they make next. While I do recommend it, I say it's best to get it at $50 instead where it should've been priced. Like I said, this isn't a AAA game. It doesn't have that level of polish.My final arbitrary score: 7.5/10"

119,flaming chicken,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LewisDawson/,22,1,0,17.0,February,25,211,0,1,"Contains Spoilers.Pre-ordered when it was announced and waited a good 4-ish years, and couldn't have been more excited for its launch. This review is based up game progress shortly following the defeat of Hedgie.The game is unique in a number of ways. The art style is great. The idea of AI controlled Soviet Union is fascinating to me and the game does a fantastic job of presenting this visually. The graphics are stunning, from the Soviet-era design of the robots to the environmental settings which facilitate them. The blend of art direction, visuals and unique take on music forms a great immersive experience, at least initially. The game runs like a dream and evidently a lot of work as gone into this specifically. No game in the last 5 years comes close to its combination of visual fidelity and performance. It's apparent a lot of passion has been poured into the game, but not equally into all areas, which is this games shortfall.You're dropped into the world of Atomic Heart where AI is portrayed as a positive influence in an advanced bustling world of soviet tech. The game does a good job of portraying a vision of what could be a promising story line which is ultimately, never explored. A couple hours in and the facade of a friendly AI ecosystem is revealed - everything goes to ♥♥♥♥ and the AI is against you. In this period of the game, there are mechanics to learn, an environment to explore and the excitement of the game is maintained well. However, after that, things start to die off rather rapidly.After the first 8 or so hours, you start to realise a story doesn't really exist - more of a mash up of a series of events which barely relate to one another. The game becomes quite repetitive. You sense something is out of place with the game when you encounter Zina - a cool and strangely different take on a ""Hero"" NPC, though doesn't fit well into the game (a British OAP masterful in CQC, high up in a Russian robot masterplan). The game doesn't elaborate on her role or story enough to want to learn more. Another NPC you meet is NORA. I didn't expect my first proper interaction with a robot to involve being touched inappropriately by robot tentacles for a solid minute, especially not from a vending machine, but here we are. She is immediately infatuated with your character (P-3) and from that point on, serves you as a Store and Upgrade station for your characters weapons and abilities. Although, an interesting take on robot portrayal, a sexualised encounter wasn't really needed, just to facilitate the introduction of a game mechanic. The encounter felt completely out of place and signalled a worrying lack of game design direction.In terms of mechanics, the game does a bad to mediocre job. Combat flows OK (excluding the harshly timed dodge QTE's window) in the first few hours of the game where the number of enemies fought at once is minimal (around 3 max). Later the combo of more enemy types and larger encounters show the combat systems weaknesses - Grouped enemies aren't coordinated and larger fights are overwhelming. Dodge QTE's are constant and the timing is unaccounted for (You'll succeed in a dodge QTE, but take a hit afterwards as another dodge QTE started from another enemy before you can respond). A minimal amount of puzzles are present in the game but are required to be completed to progress further. Due to this, they feel very limited in terms of scope and depth and give no sense of accomplishment. The same applies to linear exploration mechanics such as looting and lock picking - they provide no meaningful incentive for the player to pursue them as little to no loot or collectable items are present in the game.Exploration and its related mechanics such as stealth and AI NPC behaviours don't blend well. Stealth does not exist - You're either being hunted down by all robots in the area, or none know of your presence with no inbetween. More frustratingly, you have no idea whether you're about to be spotted or are perfectly hidden - the absence of feedback loops here really ruins gameplay. AI also have an overly complex management system and the game does a terrible job at explaining this. The games movement system for the player is bad at best - You have no control of in-air movement, which feels necessary given the restricted field of view. Working out which objects in the world are traversable feels like guesswork, most of the time. The whole process of fighting enemies in open world scenarios is both tedious and frustrating in such a way, I'd rather edge crawl areas to bypass enemy encounters. This combined with a lack of incentives to explore the world was a killer for me - No secondary objectives, no side-story or side-quests, interactable NPC's and no functional environments except those present for the linear story. Then only positive takeaway here is good job at showing soviet AI tech experiments, forcible injected into the worlds landscape.One of the last sections of the game I played was the Hog 7 Hedgie Boss fight. The whole fight would have been an overwhelmingly positive experience, but felt ruined by the games movement system. The lack of a sprint mechanic effectively ruins the encounter experience, as you can't escape the close-combat swipes which tears down health. Ironically, dodging it's ranged attack was easy. It felt like I had zero control of my survivability in the fight with the exception of spamming healing items to survive. At this stage in the game I stopped playing as the world became uninteresting with little direction of story and meaning and the break down of mechanics was clear. The game at this point no longer felt fun. Ultimately, the game struggles to decide if it wants to be linear or open-world and consequently does a bad job at both, with the mechanics and story being a clear demonstration of this. At times it feels either overly ambitious or under-developed with to much effort went into making things look pretty (which they undoubtedly are). Given the enjoyment in the first few hours, it feels like a linear world would fit this game best. It feels like the world of Atomic Heart has a lot to give in terms of story and it's characters, but this is never developed upon or explored on an interesting level. In the wider view of this being a Studios first game, it's a solid attempt, but falls short in to many areas."

Being a huge Bioshock fan, this game instantly got my attention, and for a few months i've been eagerly waiting for its release, preordering and everything, only to be met with respawning, bullet sponge enemies, incredibly poor dialogue, boring puzzles that the game makes fun of itself (that doesn't make it endearing, you just acknowledge your own poor level design) and horndog npcs. The gameplay was lackluster and the only few things I found entertaining was the beautiful environments, animations, and enemy design. Game peaked at the Hedgie boss imo, that was actually really fun and was a huge step in the right direction. I never found the mouse acceleration to be a huge issue, actually didnt even notice it was on until I read other negative reviews. Kinda worth it if you pick it up on sale 80% off, otherwise a waste of my hard earned 60$.edit: I just want to clarify that I absolutely think that this game studio could make a killer game.

Powers do little to nothing, robots constantly respawn, enemies are bullet sponges and the boss fights are super repetitive. The story is all over the place, the main character and glove are insufferable and talk entirely too much, the open world is very narrow and annoying to traverse. Right when the story begins to pick up, and we learn the backstory of the main character, the game leaves us with two terrible endings that make the entire journey feel meaningless. The premise and world were so well designed, its such a shame everything else just failed to prop it up.

Melee in particular felt clunky, with how long it takes to charge up a heavy hit only to deal a minuscule amounts of extra damage in fights where robots zoom around and shoot homing missiles etc at you.Bosses were pretty fun though and to me the highlights of my playthrough, though i noticed compared to the first major boss in the big arena, the rest seemed pretty easy by comparison and didn't pose nearly as much of a threat.Do i recommend the game? Eeeh, again the bosses were pretty fun and some of the soundtrack is going to stick with me for a while, certain areas were also genuinely pretty to look at and experience, but those alone didn't stop the game from feeling like a bit of the same ol slog by the end, especially when i got hit with the endings.

That’s what Atomic Heart is.This is such a weird game that will leave you constantly impressed and disappointed at the same time. It’s a game that I’m going to play through to the end because I have to know what is around the next corner, but I’m also going to be rushing from one objective to the next because the actual gameplay is so unsatisfying. I’m a completionist and I never do that, but I’m making an exception with this game because I don’t enjoy tedium.Also the story is nonsensical and the dialogue is often quite cringey.

AH is a  lengthy, tough, and awesome looking shooter that has the player facing off with elaborate 1950’s inspired enemies both biological and robotic. However, after reading some other reviews, I can agree that AH has a lot of different ideas that developers tried to cram into one game that did not meld completely. PROS: * The soundtrack and music is awesome. Russian pop/techno interjected into big battles seemed strange at first but works well. *Art style of the robots and island was fantastic and showed the “1950’s era edge” well.  Boss fights were challenging and fair. * The story was nothing new to the genre, but added a little twist in the end that I thought was clever.CONS: * I like some puzzles, but this game has a OVER ABUNDANCE of door, floor rotation, and magnet-gravity puzzles. The game had a habit of building up battle momentum and then slamming a puzzle in front of you. It killed the adrenaline and momentum. The puzzles involving moving the “ball keys” with telekinesis was brain numbing and time wasting. *The protagonist of the story has NO RUSSIAN ACCENT AT ALL. He’s just a loudmouth that sounds like he came from mid-west US. I was confused as to why he could not have had SOME resemblance of an accent in an all-Russian game. Metro did it well. Why couldn’t AH? * The addition of more special abilities may have added a bit more to the combat. As is, there is only a shock, freeze, telekinetic ability. Telekinesis felt sloppy and unreliable.  I found myself forgetting I had these and focused on using mainly guns and shock."

148,Harry101UK,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Harry101UK/,7,,1,19.9,February,25,812,0,1,"I was incredibly sceptical going into this after the troubled development, but it's actually fantastic. A little jank here and there, with some bizarrely bad writing and acting in places, but wow, the visuals, art style, lore, satisfying combat and sense of progression are great. Performance on PC is also unbelievably smooth.Every area feels unique, and seeing new environments with amazing art and lighting is a treat. The game plays kinda like Bioshock; taking place in a deteriorating retro-futuristic utopia - the period art-deco environments, with lots of underwater and sky-floating definitely evoke a lot of Rapture / Columbia vibes. In terms of gameplay, you have elements / plasmids on your left hand and can use guns with the right. There are larger 'miniboss' enemies like Big Daddies that have specific weaknesses and resistances, and you can loot all corpses and containers in the environments for a ton of crafting materials and supplies. If you like exploring alternate-history worlds with sci-fi elements, this is gold.Scavenging the environment and defeated enemies will yield crafting components that you can use to upgrade your skill tree, which has things like extra health, chain lighting for your shock-glove, more inventory capacity, etc. Then there's also weapon upgrades which can alter how the weapon handles and also change the visuals considerably. You can spec weapons so they deal more damage to robots, or organic enemies, etc. There are also 'element' capsules that you can screw into the weapons to add extra fire / electric damage, etc. Plenty to play and experiment with.The first 4-5 hours are pretty linear and introductory, and then the game opens up quite a bit, with lots of optional side areas (with decent challenges and puzzles) The 'challenge' / testing facilities all have unique puzzles and encounters, which lead to weapon upgrades. Finding and completing these has been very fun and rewarding.The boss fights are really cool and intense - and the soundtrack is extremely good. Mick Gordon (of DOOM fame) knocks it out of the park with very heart-pounding tracks. The music also smoothly changes as you enter combat and clear areas of enemies.Animation quality is absolutely stellar. All the robots and characters move so smoothly that they're a joy to watch. The cutscenes and other in-game interactions your character has with the environment are exceptionally detailed and cinematic. Performance is smooth as butter, even on my ageing PC (i7 6700K which is 8 years old) and a 2080 Super with 32gb DDR4 RAM. I have the game maxed out on Ultra at 2560x1440 and in most areas it's a solid 144fps (with some dips down to the 80's in the open-world areas.) It also has ZERO shader stuttering, unlike every other Unreal Engine 4 game I've played in the last few years. I'm shocked at how well made this is. There's a quick 1-2 minute shader compile while you fiddle with the settings menu, and then it's smooth-sailing.There are some negatives, which I can kinda look past, since things overall get better after the intro. At launch, there is no FOV slider, and it's very limited at around 70 degrees. Thankfully there's a 'Flawless Widescreen' mod that fixes it instantly and makes it adjustable, and makes the gameplay and environments so much nicer to explore.There are unfortunately are a lot of very slow parts, like the intro which is basically an unskippable 1 hour auto-scroller that really shows you the world. The intro is filled with walking / talking sections where you slowly ride a boat, slowly ride an elevator, slowly ride a car, slowly converse with several plot characters, etc. And some missions involve some tedious fetch-quest stuff. Though thankfully the action between these is great.The first few hours feature some  cringe dialogue. Over-bearing sexual innuendos, tons of unneccessary inflammatory dialogue that makes the main character unlikeable, and some very odd voice direction at times. Though the wackiness of it has made it an entertaining curiosity so far. I never know what's going to happen next, or how characters will react! In fairness, there's also a lot of good dialogue, and some has genuinely made me laugh, with some fun meta commentary on the world of gaming.Overall, if you can look past some of the writing and occasional bugs, there's a lot to like here. As a huge fan of Prey, Bioshock and Half Life, I'm having a blast with this."
149,Gods Tulpa,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199064922951/,11,,1,39.3,March,3,36,0,1,"So, a couple of points. Game runs well although given its recent release there some bugs. nothing Major or game breaking or that cant be solved with a simple restart. However especially toward the end some very minor textures would turn into clown vomit and prompt a restart. Game-play wise the game felt EXTREMELY fun to play especially as you progressed in the upgrade tree and EARNED an OP feel. One of my favorite things to do was to use TK and destroy everything nearby. On the flip side, there was one aspect I'm still not sure of how I feel about and that is the enemy respawn. I mean sure you can disable it by overloading, but once you do so you trapped in that area as lasers lock you in and sometimes don't turn back off after the 15 mins it takes to come back up. Apart from all that, I will dare say that through and through playing this felt like the first time I ever played BIOSHOCK while still being different enough that it would be remembered as its own game with unique mechanics instead of a clone. The game was very forgiving and encouraging of you switching up or trying new play-styles too which should be given massive kudos for.Story wise, it was pretty thorough and straight forward so I can't complain. Plenty of witty lines and caught myself chuckling rather than rolling my eyes. Was kind of worried if the game was just going to turn into communist propaganda and was rather glad it did no such thing and highlighted the flaws of ideology mostly without bias. In summary, to anyone who wished Bioshock had a straightforward plot and more of a fun approach instead of serious, you'll have enjoy playing this. I'd pay 60-70 for this but given Inflation rates and the attempt of a reset by the WEF and the Brandon administration, I wholeheartedly vibe with those who would wait until it comes down to a solid $45"

The fights are what gets me. The combat feels so damn squishy and unfun so far. Super-slow wind-up attacks against fairly fast bots. It teaches you a dodge mechanic, but that  works in the short ""robot-red power attack"" window. Aside from that, it's just keep moving and poking. But, really!? Quick-time events as the main combat mechanic!? STOP WITH THE QUICK-TIME EVENTS!The combat gets less squishy through upgrades... then the game changes mechanics on you and makes it squishy again. It's almost worth it to just mash the attack key, tank the damage, and consume your health-packs. (No matter what you do, you're going to spend every fight running away while drinking health potions). Despite all that, I was really starting to enjoy the game, and the upgrades when... WHAM! Ultra-squishy combat with quick-time events added in! That's right, once you're finally upgraded enough to start using skill in fights, the game throws a whole new enemy at you... One that's faster than you, with repeated heavy-attacks (so you  avoid getting 1/2 health hits and being knocked down), and a special attack... an unavoidable grab attack. This isn't just any grab attack... this is one you can't avoid or escape, except by completing a series of four rapid and random quick-time events. One fail = instant death. You have to pass two sets of these special quick-time attacks to defeat this enemy. ...and just like that, you lost me. Bye. Not coming back. ♥♥♥♥ you, your quick-time laziness, and your forgetting the rule of fun.P.S.: This one is especially painful for me, because it is  then effed up the combat mechanics. And that's it, that's really the only problem with the game. Very few bugs, smooth gameplay, great world and story... but quick-time and squishyness everywhere."

158,Brugster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Brugster/,8,,1,27.8,February,21,411,0,1,"So far this game has been incredibly fun with smooth gameplay, satisfying combat, and a decently enough interesting story. It may be missing some features in terms of customizability for the ""PC version"" which you may need to third party routes to obtain. (FOV being one of them) its refreshing to have a game finally launch and actually be playable without any major issues whatsoever. At worst you may experience a minor hiccup during a transitional cutscene which arguably doesn't detract from the overall gameplay. Mostly everyone is saying this is Soviet Bioshock, and that's in the absolute best way possible. With plenty of customization options for builds and weaponry. Thankfully enough you can experiment however you choose as you are free to re-spec your ability points when you want to without restriction. Pros +- Graphically solid- Fun Combat- Varying areas- Multiple Types of Enemies- Multiple Powers/Weapons- Fairly good Story (Thus far its been good)- Phenomenal world building from the start (advisable to read the lore if that interests you.)Cons -- English VO can be a bit off in terms on inflection and delivery. - Fairly Linear, much like Bioshock 1. (This isn't the worst thing by far and the pace has been held well. I would have liked more of this world to explore in each area)- Strafing is particularly slow. It feels clunky due to this in the movement department, but you are supplemented with a quick charging dodge. So this was probably by design. This has so far been such a solid recommend and it feels so close to bioshock that it might as well exist in the same universe."

160,NotAbsolutelySure,https://steamcommunity.com/id/notabsolutelysure/,35,2,0,9.5,February,27,918,12,1,"For a first time developer that was handed an extremely large budget, and with the very first gameplay trailers having astronomical expectations put on their shoulders, the fact that they didn't fall flat on their faces is impressive enough.That being said, the highlights of Atomic Heart do not outweigh the glaring faults, at least for me. I do realize that this game has a fairly mixed response, but the majority of the top reviews for this game are along the lines of ""Awooga, commie mommy robo dommy yes please step on me"", which doesn't really say very much about the game.The robot asses, excuse me, assets, are great, and I can definitely appreciate that the dev team was horny for robots and let it show. That being said, the game that you have to play to see those sexy robots is pretty lacking in some areas. I will be the first to admit that I tend to focus rather hard on one or two systems in a game and try to push those to the limits of their effectiveness, so in games where you are presented with a large menu of options for tackling obstacles, I usually end up lacking in combat effectiveness by the end of the game. In Atomic Heart, I tried to pay a lot of attention to the weapon and upgrade system, and I constantly felt like I was behind the ball in terms of combat power. It always felt like I didn't have enough resources, or that I wasn't stretching those resources effectively. One caveat to that is that I did consistently forget to upgrade my character, however the character upgrades for the most part did not seem to be giving me the large jumps in power that one might expect. I got most of the health upgrades, and still felt like the enemies were chewing through my life bar, mainly because one of the ways that Atomic Heart tries to ""challenge"" the player is by sheer numbers. I could try to just write my frustration out here, but instead I think an anecdote will work better. Towards the end of what I played of the game I had just beaten a boss that had drained my resources rather significantly. I was pretty low on heals and ammo, and I had just gotten the item I needed to bring back to the hub of that zone. At this point, I had to backtrack to the hub, where they spawned 5 of the white shirt robots, 2 of the black shirt robots and 3 of the flying enemies, not even 5 seconds after I had finished a boss fight with no real opportunity to recharge, save or acquire any kind of replenishing of my resources. Keep in mind that these enemies were spawned in an area I had also previously cleared. Twice.So I died there, and then had to redo both the boss fight, as well as the fight after it with the same amount of limited resources. Beating my head against the wall got me through it, but just barely, and I was very close to having screwed myself with a bad checkpoint. There were a lot of areas like this where I felt as though I was hamstrung between either spending my materials to craft the ammo and heals that I wasn't finding out in the world (not for lack of trying) or upgrading my weapons to be more effective and use less ammo and heals. Here is where I will fully admit that it is entirely possible that I wasn't engaging with the systems as much as I could have, or possibly that I wasn't doing it properly, but I definitely was making the most of what I did find, using the deconstruct menu to get rid of things I wasn't using, to acquire as much as I could towards making and upgrading the weapons to be effective. Beyond the general frustration with the gameplay, I do think that a majority of the time spent not fighting is not great in this game either. The extraordinarily strong setting with the dystopian world that you are dropped into can only do so much heavy lifting, and even though everything looked great, and was stylistically appropriate for the setting, I ran into a lot of issues with readability as a game. The enemies tend to blend into the environment anytime that you are outside. A lot of the puzzle elements blend into the floors or walls. I am colorblind so take this with a grain of salt, but it is an issue I ran into.Also while moving around the world, the same problem appears with the game just throwing boatloads of enemies at you. There are cameras that can see you and send out an alert to spawn more enemies, these cameras are white and blend in with the background the same as enemies do, so basically every time you are walking around, unless you spend the whole time in the environment scanning mode, you are bound to set off one of the cameras and waste a bunch of time and ammo.Now, the story. Initially I thought the dialogue had to be making fun of how video game protagonists never shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, the script and dialogue seemed to be self aware. However.I think there were 2 separate teams writing this game, though. The team that took the time to write out genuinely funny, interesting sections that left me wanting to sit there listening to the dialogue more, and the team that was responsible for annoying the ♥♥♥♥ out of the player. It was really impressive the sheer volume of dialogue in the game, but all of those words written out and recorded are a waste because most of them are conveyed to you as you are doing other things you have to focus on. The dialogue comes mostly while you are doing platforming or puzzles or even during combat.  Imagine in GOW 2018, if Mimir was explaining very important lore to you while you were in the middle of fighting off hordes of enemies. That is what happens in this game. The glove that your main character talks to so much has whole conversations with you during the middle of events that require your full attention. By the almost 10th hour I played where I finally quit, it occurred to me that I didn't really know the main characters name, or any of the names for that matter. The plot in general might have been very interesting if I could actually follow what they were saying all of the time, but most of the plot important information was at points where I had to choose to continue playing the game, or stop moving completely to sit there and listen for 3 minutes to what they're saying THEN keep playing the game. There was no good balance struck for this at any point, and in general, I as well as most of the people watching me stream the game couldn't really get much of a handle on what was going on at any given point in time. I feel that if given time and money again, this dev team most definitely has the capability of making a genuinely good game. There was so many elements of this that were great, but the parts of the game that left me feeling unsatisfied added up to be more than the parts that were impressive, and the overall package of Atomic Heart ended up being a disappointment. The shine on the first few hours of the game wore off rather quickly once you get out of the beginning area. In their next project, I hope that they maintain their creativity, both in stylistic choice and world building, and please god hire Mick Gordon to do the soundtrack again because he absolutely killed it.There was one or two genuinely jaw dropping moments to this game, and I hope that Mundfish takes the genuine criticism that they are receiving and puts its all towards their next game, they are on the cusp of something fantastic. Also keep the hot robots, I think everyone can agree, we all love the hot robots. Edit: I just wanna add something here at the end that I think says more than anything else I said in the review. After I quit out of Atomic Heart I decided to keep streaming and just play something else, so I started up Hitman 3 and was messing around in their Freelancer mode. I was immediately in a better mood and having fun. That's the important part that I didn't mention in this review. It just wasn't that fun. Thanks for reading."

NPCs just need something to hate for whatever reason. Back in the days they burned books, now they try to cancel anything that doesn't fit into their narratives.With this being said, the actual review:This game is a masterfully crafted story filled with few, but well-developed characters backed by rich retro-futuristic setting which somewhat reminds of Strugatsky's Noon Universe and has tons of nostalgic content for those who were born in USSR or spent their childhood in post-soviet countries in 90's. I love Mick Gordon's take on the iconic songs from that era.I won't get into details about the story, but Some aspects of game design are questionable, such as open world mechanics (or their absence) and clunky inventory system. Endless streams of enemies, ""special"" car physics and damage model, and lack of fast travel make open-world exploration rather tedious.As of now, there are some bugs, but nothing game-breaking:Upgrades sometimes disappear when you move weapons to stash and back, some achievements that are based on Steam statistics are getting reset (counters for found collectibles, completed polygons, etc.), occasional crashes and the car that gets launched into space when you pass over the bump."
164,TwoScoopsOfD,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028034985/,144,6,0,1.8,February,21,304,30,1,"This game is terrible and I don't understand how so many people are giving it positive reviews. The positive reviews I see are something to the effect of ""Wow Bioshock Infinite meets Wolfenstein!"" or ""SovietShock!"" and ignore anything about the actual game it self. Cons: - The first thing I noticed during the opening cutscenes was that when I panned to either side as far as I could go it would push my camera back to the center an inch, or so, if I wasn't actively pushing it that direction. Why? Let me look at my surroundings. - The voice acting is trash. It has no emotion and doesn't match what's going on in the actual scene or moment in the game. It has some Tommy Wiseau in The Room level editing where voice lines are almost on top of each other before the other character has really even finished speaking. Along with the bad voice acting/editing is the bad sound design. There were often times where there was sound just straight up missing or mismatched. The part where Granny fires the rocket launcher the sound was basically just not there.. Felt like an alpha build of the game which is sad considering this part took place in under the first hour of the game. I thought maybe the voice acting would take a back seat to the other features of the game but no. The main character and his sentient glove talk nonstop. The dialogue is real  - It's buggy. One of the very first enemies comes through a door which I attacked, and then he got stuck behind the door. I could attack and kill him, but I couldn't loot him. The door never opened again. Some enemies flash on screen before actually showing up and are attackable.  - The looting. The looting is the most tedious thing about this game. It's marketed as an easy ""continue to hold F and and you vacuum everything up"" when in reality you have to hold F in very specific spots, and for long enough, or it doesn't count if you've looted it entirely and you miss items. There's also entirely too many objects to loot which adds to the tediousness.  - Batman detective mode. The radar mode helps slightly with making sure you loot everything but it's super inconsistent. Certain items are visible super far away and some not; some visible around corners and some not. Felt like I was constantly pulling it up, and when I didn't I would pull it up to find I missed a single metal crouton in a single pencil drawer in a room full of 50 different lootable filing cabinets. - Combat isn't great. The responsiveness of the dodge and light attack seem to work well. But the first upgrade you get is a whirlwind heavy attack. Takes a long time to complete, spins your vision, and you can be hit while finishing the long attack time. I'm sure it works ok with upgraded versions of the freeze and shield, but why bother when you can light attack, dodge without getting dizzy.  - Platforming. Feels like the most tacked on aspect of the game. The game doesn't explain at all how to move while climbing walls and pipes. I just moved my mouse and character around until eventually my character awkwardly put out his arm and then I knew ""oh ok now its time for me to jump"". A lot of the time you jump and miss. Instead of falling all the way down you get caught on an weird part of the geometry like a crack in the cement wall that clearly isn't meant to be stood upon. - Horny fridge? Why? Just why? I guess it fits with the terrible writing. Pros: Runs well, looks nice, and the environments are well done. That's it. That's literally all of it.Normally don't write reviews but this is genuinely one of the worst games I've played to date. Felt worth saying something against all of the ""positive"" reviews that don't actually say anything about the game. All of this in under two hours of game play. Refunded it."

Visually the game can look pretty good, I like the artistic direction, otherwise? Not so much.Voice acting is awful, god I don't think I've hated a protag from any game more than I hate P3. Sound effects are.. Not that great either, sometimes they're extremely muffled and the general quality is pretty bland.Gameplay wise combat is relatively basic, it's not very interesting and for the most part I just start leaning on the guns more, which are.. Okay. Feels like there's no reason to use anything but the shotgun, I get either one shell, one handgun bullet, or one assault rifle round? I think I know who's the winner of that contest. They talk about Stealth/Sneaking about, but that's not really something they put any care into. There's no perks or a lot of benefit to crouching around, most enemies will still see you from their normal distances and you can still sneak kill by just walking up to them. Bug riddled, even after the hotfixes there are still quite a few that are either downright annoying or at times game breaking. I was trying to progress through a facility, only to find that the door was bugged and refused to open until I reloaded a save. Hotfixes have helped with some other issues like certain resources not dropping but there's still some obvious ones. Enemies get this.. Blob-like appearance when you're in scanning mode, and sometimes that sticks after you leave it, feels like you're getting chased by some stop-motion playdough monster. Sometimes I see enemies in the distance T-posing as well.They also found it ideal to have climbing and jumping puzzles/mechanics but also made them EXTREMELY slow and inconsistent at times. A lot of times I slide off of things I should mantle, other times it takes me ages to climb a pipe and jump to a ledge just to very slowly shimmy a centimetre or a two at a time. This goes for a lot of the movement, you're not very fast, and the game opens up eventually where you can cross a lot of space and you can take cars but the footwork you put in for exploration is.. A lot with NO SPRINT available to you.So many issues with this game I was hoping would be a great addition, my boyfriend does enjoy it so.. At least there's that? Not a complete waste."
167,JohnnyRadman,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049503402/,8,,1,31.1,March,22,464,0,1,"Atomic Heart probably had one of the best launches in recent memory for an AAA quality game. It was actually optimized and I experienced only a few crashes. Of course, it was also missing raytracing, achievements were bugged, and it had *no* FOV slider, but whatever - that's a minor detail (note: that was sarcasm). Despite missing an integral QoL feature, it actually worked on launch and didn't otherwise play like a beta. Or worse, an alpha. The core experience was well polished, even if it was missing some bells and whistles, which is more than some other AAA games can say. Given that this was the first game from a startup studio, and the tail end of development occurred during an impressive sanction regime against the host country, I'm of the opinion that AAA studios are now out of excuses.Visuals are rock solid. I thought I'd have to make it ugly to run on my 1080ti. I was wrong. It's still on fairly high settings, and it looks AND runs great.Music is solid. The remixes of old soviet songs are nice, and of course they snagged Mick Gordon, so naturally all his tracks are amazing. I'm stoked for the next portion of the soundtrack.The gameplay isn't super innovative, but if you like Bioshock or Prey (2017), and you like scrounging, you'll definitely like what this game brings to the table. It's in the same vein as the Shock series, but with better gunplay. Being honest, I barely used the abilities, and I feel they could do more interesting things with them. Hopefully in the DLC they'll add some neat new  . I will add that the Zvezdochka is probably the most viscerally satisfying weapon in the entire game. I never knew that I wanted to watch my enemies be torn to shreds by angry flying buzz saws. The only real criticism I have is that I wish there was a way to disable Hives for at least like 5 minutes or something, so I could comfortably scrounge around. I understand the desire to keep the pressure up on the player, but dispatching an endless stream of Pchelas is both easy and tedious to deal with, and if you want to do anything on the surface, it's necessary. I never felt afraid of them, and I never felt like I ought to escape an area because I drew too much heat. Then again, I was also playing on normal difficulty. Oh, and also, the puzzles eventually became kinda tedious. Especially the ones where you just drag a ball through a tube.And now for a long winded analysis of a story which nobody cares about.I'm really not sure what to make of the story, but I'll say that it does some things well and other things not so well. It actually managed to surprise me, which doesn't happen often, and it provided adequate foreshadowing for the surprise (provided you read the logs), so that's neat. The voice acting in English is hit or miss. The overall message is kinda hard to suss out. It doesn't glorify communism or the USSR  - I mean, you're exploring evil science labs, you're killing the horrible machines/abominations which were built/birthed there, you're learning about ghoulish experiments done to prisoners, and everyone has a social credit score which is tabulated using data from insane levels of state surveillance. The Major has pretty understandable misgivings about what he sees, and slowly finds it indefensible. If I had to try and extract a message from this story, it would probably go something like this. It doesn't matter how miraculous your technology is, or how noble your ambitions are. At the end of the day, your dream of utopia will be reduced to a nightmare by the callous, misanthropic, self serving nature of humans. You can try to build people heaven and they will turn it into hell, and you may very well help them do it. All that being said, the Major is very much a caricature of the Soviet Man, and while later in the game he had a moment where he grasped some nuance during a discussion of international relations, he's very much a fan of both communism and the Soviets. While I am of the general opinion that communists do not have human rights, this is a videogame and I do not care about an imaginary person's opinions.Honestly, I think that the regime is more like an aesthetic, story wise, because no real critique is made on it nor is a case made for it. Think about how Bioshock went after Objectivism, how it pointed out the unique ways Rand's philosophy would incentivize systemic dysfunction. Atomic Heart *didn't* do that with communism. It also didn't *advocate* for communism. Paranoia, opacity, poor delegation of authority, conniving backstabbing nonsense, leaders whose power is inversely proportional to their empathy - those are human failings, not failings which emerge from systemic incentives. What I see in the game is yet another soulless authoritarian bureaucracy, but with communist trappings. It wouldn't feel out of place in a cyberpunk setting, provided you gave it corporate trappings. I think there's a missed opportunity for something insightful, but I doubt *real* political analysis would fly given the current political climate in the Russian federation. So I'll let it slide.Despite this analysis taking up the longest part of my review, I'd say I've encountered much worse stories, and much better. It's decidedly mid."

But it has it's quirks.The Good:- It's USSR Bioshock- It's absurdly well optimized for a game that's from an indie dev on day 1.- It's beautiful- The story has me captivated. - 9 hours in and I haven't ran into a bug as of yet. Not even graphical.- The music is 10/10The Bad:- I actually like the combat but I can see why some people dont.- The english dub is so cheesy I see why people hate it (but I love it)- The map is confusing, making finding crafting blueprints more of a chore than I'd like (could be skill issue) The Ugly- The puzzles are repetitive and everywhere, seems like they're intended to prolong playtime.- The ""Open world"" section is hindered by a GTA style wanted system that is triggered by cameras making it a pain to exploreIf they make a sequel I'd like less puzzles or at least a greater diversity of puzzles. Also I'd like to be able to actually explore the gorgeous map. Overall rating 7/10 - Worth the wait, and the money to me."

The voice acting really pushes me away from this game. Characters don't seem to interact as if they are actually there. It's easy to tell which lines were recorded separately. I wish I could learn more about the story through the world, but I have to listen to so much talking and banter and it's exhausting. The worst of this is the first encounter with the weapon upgrade terminal. While I'm trying to learn how to upgrade my stuff, the characters just won't stop talking! I actually quit the game because I couldn't stand having a ""horny fridge"" endlessly go on about ""shoving my sword"" into it. But alas, I came back, switched the voice acting to Russian, and kept playing, but it's then when I figured it out: the game just isn't fun. The visuals are beautiful, but it's too much. There's so much detail that it's distracting and this must have an effect on the animations because enemies are moving at 10 frames from 20 ft away with the highest animation settings settings (everything else was on medium). Plus the obvious saturation of fetch quests in the earliest bit of game, I think I have a good idea what this game is going to be like going forward. The combat is fine. I was excited for this (since 2018), but it seems like they really missed the mark on a lot of things. I'll keep trying to play it, but it's exhausting. This game is just exhausting."

Overall great game with great combat engaging story and awe inspiring visuals. Runs well too.some of my other thoughts:The open world is cool and interesting but don't expect it to be too sophisticated. It mostly serves as a way to transition between different parts of the story. Its fun just to drive between locations in a moskvich while listening to the radio. Although you can always walk too.I felt the game was heavily inspired by the tomb raider reboots and how they approach open worlds and dungeons. Combat I felt was influenced by souls style games. The abilities were inspired by rage 2. Melee combat feels very satisfying and rewarding. The game gives you enough room to experiment with whatever style you want to do. You can easily respec your character in whatever way you want.I just wish there was a new game plus mode, I guess they'll add that later though.Story is good and feels engaging, characters are intriguing, talking to dead people gets old quick though.Soundtrack really enhances the gameplay and visuals, very good.I only had one crash in my entire play time.

The whole segment needed to end hours earlier and I ended up running through the final 2 hours I was down there as fast as I could. Potentially missing things but just wanting to move on. The re-intro to the outside world was also a big letdown. I took two steps outside, got spotted and bodied constantly until rushing into the woods to hide and progress the story. While the high surveillance in the world makes sense from a story perspective, it was not a fun re-entry to the world. Enemies also seemed to spot me with no line of sight. In a large bush, completely covered? Too bad, enemy see's you, level 2 threat acquired. Foliage seems to not cover you at all to most enemies. Which just sucks in comparison to many other games on the market that seem to have that system nailed down with no issues. Do the robot's see with heat vision? When did they tell me that? Did they ever?The game seems to have a lot going for it! The story was super interesting during the first 2 hours but it just took too long to keep it going. Art direction is fantastic, I loved looking at the game. Atmosphere is on-point. I was anxious and definitely got a Bioshock feel in some area's.Overall, I just don't have the time to suffer through this game to wait for it to get better."

Spent most of the game accidentally handicapping myself and forgot about backpack upgrade. I was like they really need bigger inventory space and its there like an idiot but made it almost to the end on limited meds and equipped weapons. Only bug I found was after the fight with Left, I missed the elevator (didn't know it was moving) and walked underneath and fell through the map and lived but was wayyyyyyyy outside the regular game. Medium difficulty was just right but maybe could have been harder in some spots. Ending was nuts too. Great game, I'd say 8.5/10 easy maybe more."

First of, don't try to venture outside of the main paths (roads), or you'll likely run into a terrain bug that will get your character stuck, with now way of getting out of it except loading the last save. This kills the exploration. Then, speaking of saves, the area where you save are not safe zones and enemies can attack/clip though walls and stun lock you until you die. This means that you can litteraly brike your entire playthrough if you save at the wrong moment. Lastly, I had minibosses chase me accross multiple areas, go back out of the map and litterally spawn back on top of me a few minutes later. If you combine all of this, it just makes you wonder why you are wasting your time."
213,[     ],https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZelDevan/,7,,0,28.0,February,26,333,0,1,"First of let me say this world, music and the graphics are beautiful. A world that engulf's you into its past and makes you curious on what there is in it. But I would also like to share that I became very disappointed in their story telling..--- Overall a decent game, don't go into this thinking it's the best of the best. Keep your bar at an average level and with an open mind. You will find it interesting. If you plan to give the game a shot then please do buy the base version as the premiums are not worth it in my opinion, or see if it goes on sale. ---If I could give this review a mixed yes/no I would, but sadly there isn't an option for that. This game can be beaten in the story very quickly if you do not spend time with the little things or stop to read information. The design of the robots and the level of detail graphically are amazing, the scenery, the locations are as well. Story wise is where things get complicated. I see the dream they wished to achieve, I just wish they would have played more into their story.--- Spoiler warning!!! If you do not care about spoilers read on ahead! ---I am very disappointing with the story when it comes to choice. There were only two times ""choice"" really ""mattered"" in this game or even appeared. Honestly the ""choices"" didn't even let you choose. The story starts to fall into place as the option of choice and free will are now under control of another and no longer your own later in the game. It is a nice story that can portray a villain who thinks they see the greater good and are doing good for everyone around them. And although some of the plot twists in the ending were nice, I felt the lack of ""choice"" to be out of place. With a game that claims there are two endings, there is sadly only one. And while I appreciate playing on the illusion of ""choice"", if they could have portrayed that more and played more into the illusion of it instead of just at the end, I would be ok with the game's endings, or I should say, ending. In the morality of the choices, there is a spot for your own sake if what you did was right, but it doesn't matter. I would have rather played a linear story than giving the option of the two choice that play to the same one. If you were curious if there is a good ending, there isn't. It's bad or bad, which in turn story wise, become the same ending regardless. Either let the villain get the desired goal sooner, or delay it a short while till he get's it. All the same, he gets it regardless. While I do like the typical twist of the hero losing and the villain wins as our ending, please don't claim there is a choice or make one if you aren't going to play into it more. One choice at the end that lead to the same linear one feels like all my previous game play didn't matter. If you cut the price in half for this game, as well as just making it all facilities and none of the open world exploration, then made the gameplay even shorter, it would have had a better taste in everyone's mouth in my opinion. Please don't get me wrong, the amazing battle music, the robots in size, the puzzles were all in great fun. I would just have rather cut out most if not all the walking nonsense and surface exploration for more facilities, harder puzzles, and a richer story. Still an experience of a game that I partially enjoyed none the less, just see some wasted potential in a game that could have been even more amazing."

But this game is actually a very mixed bags of eurojank, terrible and even off-putting writing and overall just bad game structure and design. From the beginning you can tell that the game doesn't have anywhere near the finess, the maturity and the class of Bioshock: all NPCs female models have the same face, there are 3 NPCs with neurodevice exactly the same, audio lines are messy and super-imposed, set-dressing and decoration is really inegal, and will the city in the beginning is a nice sight which makes you realize there's no FOV slider whatsoever, you start realizing how terrible writing is really terrible and unfortunately is everything I dislike about modern Russian culture: outdated bad tasted couch potato bros. The fridge scene could've been fun but instead they weren't with a very tasteless lines, and that's where I actually starting disliking the game and seeing for what it is: a badly designed, redundant, janky, unsophisticated mess in one of the most promising, interesting world building since Bioshock, but nowhere near and I mean miles below the latter.In fact passed the intro, the game started to bore me and feel repetitive very quickly, so I don't recommend buying the game and instead waiting for it to be really cheap to play the first tencile of the game after which point it falls to all it's shortcoming and dialogues continue to become annoying."

Over the past ten years, not many beautiful, interesting, exciting games have come out. But this game is one of that list.Atomic Heart about smart heads and cold hearts.I'm already waiting for the DLC and the sequel :) It's especially cool if the story of the twins is revealed there, who has completed the game knows what I'm talking about.Pros:+ Beautiful visual, very nice picture and beautiful characters.+ Quality sound, ambient sounds, soundtracks and voice acting, especially Russian voice acting. Yes, yes, the voice for babushka Zina is actually suitable.+ An interesting story, the plot is passed in one breath. *SPOILER* thought out to such trifles as music from the future.+ Hardcore game, or rather the strength of even simple ""Vovchick"" makes casual players cry.+ Large variation of weapons and skills.+ Quite interesting ""side quests"" that help the game interact with the game world, although it may seem to someone that it is bring - give it. This is an RPG game.+ Twin robots.+ There are no stupid Western agendas of the 21st century in this game.+ There is humor with different overtones. 18+ game.Cons:- The main character has a hairstyle that is not typical for 1955 in the USSR - this makes the look at the character not entirely authentic.- Bosses are actually quite easy.- **** Pie"" - the protagonist's redundancy.- Manual saves are already too much, sometimes they can roll back the game progress by 30 minutes back, due to the oversight of the player who *died*.For Mundfish's first game, this is a very good result.

225,Durg,https://steamcommunity.com/id/britdragon/,3,,1,13.3,February,22,352,0,1,"is a very rare and surprising exception to a recent rule of long term in-development projects coming to fruition and actually measuring up to what it's trying to do. If what you want from this game is to enjoy a world with stellar visual presentation, fantastic animation work, a well optimised PC version with very few bugs, and gameplay that is actually close to what the trailers all implied, then you will find it in the final game. However,  other aspects in its narrative and some general gameplay design choices only mean I can recommend it once the game is heavily on sale. It's an enjoyable game, but not without problems that come close to spoiling the experience.As most can tell you,  is visually incredible and a setting that I haven't been as keen to explore since the days of . The details of the world as you explore the 50s inspired aesthetic colliding with impossible technology that borders on supernatural with the monsters and mutants of the Facility seem like they would clash, but they actually meld together to create something believable. All of the robot designs (and yes, of course the Twins) are really imaginative and cool, especially with some of them harking back to decades-old thinking about what the future could look like in a way that's almost nostalgic.What's even more impressive is that  visuals are actually comparable and sometimes nearly identical to what we saw in pre-release materials. Usually in games like this, the visual quality will always suffer heavy cuts and downgrades, but  appears to have compromised barely any of it in both art direction and graphical fidelity. It also helps that the game can be run on maximum settings on systems well below the minimum specs and still push really high framerates.The actual gameplay when exploring the different complexes within the Facility is also solid, if a bit formulaic. Following on from the earlier  example, the game wears this sort of gameplay loop proudly on its sleeve. You'll be fighting waves of different enemies and utilising numerous abilities to take them down while scouring the environments for upgrade materials, ammo, and lore with logs and computer terminals, all of which function satisfyingly. Looting things is streamlined with a simple button press to harvest all of the components available and the melee combat in particular is appropriately heavy and enjoyable. The gunplay is a little more clunky, with the speed of the enemies and low FOV making it hard to keep track of more than a few at a time, and the stealth feels like its too difficult to really make builds around, but it gets the job done.The sound design of the game is also top notch. Even putting aside the musical genius of Mick Gordon and the clever use of Soviet-era music both in original and remixed form, all of the created sounds for the technology of  is astounding. Each robotic movement, machinery input, weapon and glove ability, all of it comes together to really enhance the immersion of the world no matter what current complex you're exploring.However, while  is a breath of fresh air in high-profile games where the presentation, stability and art direction are actually intact, functioning and high quality, the game still suffers from some quite drastic problems in other areas.By now, I think many players can agree that while the setting and premise of  is compelling and intriguing, the story behind it is  lacklustre and not very well told. Much of the exposition of the world is very awkward and clunky, usually boiling down to P-3 asking a question and then Charles responding with a very lengthy explanation rather than allowing us to discover these answers more organically with environmental design, other NPCs, or even just more concise logs that can't easily be missed. The story's pacing is also very poor, with long stretches of the game not pushing the narrative forward in the uninteresting open world and then suddenly dumping a ton of important details all at once to nearly be overwhelming. The story tries to keep up intrigue by throwing in curveballs of who to trust and the nature of allegiances to different people and systems, but interactions between characters in these moments feel incredibly rushed and somehow edited down to be too short with the dialogue.The dialogue itself is almost wince-inducing in multiple ways. The English voice acting itself is fine for what the script is giving the actors, but some of these lines don't even feel like they were revised in terms of placement before being recorded. The speed that words are spoken at almost come across like two unrelated takes were hurriedly stitched together in audio editing software without any natural pauses for almost every single character in the game, and some of the placement of important details (such as  ) just lose all their importance as a result.Of particular note, P-3 is a deeply unlikable protagonist, switching nearly maniacally between states of angry, brooding, caring, heroic, insulting or rude, but never settling on any one thing for more than 10 seconds. His constant need to swear in nearly every line makes him feel like he's trying too hard to be edgy and serious, as if this is what the developers think game characters should be, and this is unfortunately a problem with the rest of the cast too. It got to a point of being so obnoxious, that I experimented playing with Russian audio to match the setting, only switching back when it became clear I was reading more than taking in the details.The gameplay itself also has some massive pitfalls, mostly in the nature of the open world, the upgrade systems and the enemy difficulty. The open world feels like an afterthought. There's not much really in it except the robots roaming the world (of which the reward to fight them isn't worth the cost) and there's nothing to compel me to explore the optional areas apart from gun mods. The upgrade system itself is also way too strict and costly, to the point where I was only really using two abilities and 3 weapons at any given time because the investment to get more and experiment was just too steep combined with the cost of replenishing supplies for what I had. And even despite how you can beat the game using that little in your inventory, the enemies themselves are nothing but massive bullet sponges that move at speeds that are hard to track with the low FOV, sometimes to an unfair degree. It doesn't feel like I'm utilising the game's systems to overcome a challenge because no matter what I used, they all still took forever to die no matter the firepower. presentation and world is the main saving grace of the game and the gameplay itself when in the complexes and  the open world make it a mostly enjoyable experience. Although the story is very poorly written in both dialogue and structure, and there are some quirks to some of the systems that only get more egregious over time, the game still feels like it was a fun time because of how strong the good parts were. This is a game of very high highs and rather disappointing lows that come together in a package that is worth your time, but only when the asking price lowers a fair amount. Overall, pretty decent."

The first time I booted the game up and started playing I played for almost 6 hours. There are some minor issues with the game I must admit, there is the odd game play bug, there's no FOV adjustment and some of the main character's voice lines aren't the greatest. However, despite these minor issues, the game is terrific! It reminds me of a Half-Life, Doom cross over maybe that's a bad comparison, but that's just me. If you enjoy excellent music, good weapons customization, difficult enemies with a wide variety of ways to take them down, and puzzles that are genuinely fun to solve.

Definitely a linear progression type of game. Gameplay is very Bioshock-esque. Pros:-- Gameplay is definitely well done in this game, the weapon shooting and melee abilities are very satisfying. You have special abilities that are pretty standard but are implemented well. Once I got this weapon and fully upgraded it, I was pretty much on easy mode for the rest of the game. The Zvezdochka is so ♥♥♥♥ OP, I was finishing the boss fights in less than 4 mins. By far the best weapon in the game.-- Music and sound in this game is for the most part, exceptional. The gun sounds are well done and I just honestly wish they used the incredible soundtrack more often, when the beat drops on these classical Russian songs it just really fires you up.-- Graphics are very good, and the game is super optimized and runs smooth as butter. Was very surprised I could handle running this game in 4k (RTX 2070).-- Only encountered a few bugs, nothing that was too infuriating.-- Some of the enemy designs are pretty wicked, just wish they had more enemy types. The boss fights are definitely the most enjoyable fights. Cons:-- The dialogue in this game is subpar, the voice acting was alright I guess but the dialogue just ruins anything they say. Especially the main character and his glove, nonstop talking about useless stuff that I honestly never paid attention to. The worst one is the main characters signature ""phrase"". I finish the game and at the very end the only thing this guy can say is his classic catch phrase: . This guy is a Soviet military agent, why is he saying ?? Was the really the final choice?-- Story was meh. Pretty standard plot, the ""twist"" was pretty predictable and the endings left a bad taste in my mouth.-- Some of the non-combat mechanics can be funky (climbing and driving).Overall it was enjoyable. Gameplay and sound design definitely make this game. If you like Bioshock or Dishonored, you would most likely enjoy this game."

The game is difficult, the game is fun and the game has something a very few people may understand, which is... it reminds me of my own childhood that never actually happened. music from the childhood movies and comedies i watched, curiously familiar architecture that was never built, robots looking like soviet dolls, food reminding of pancakes... it is an experience of something that was never there and it feels like you were there. for some reason.

No crashes, no performance issues, max settings, 1440p and getting well over 80+ FPS.- Graphically pleasing.- Music is absolutely amazing - The pacing felt off. Too many sections where I'm walking/listening to conversation for well over 40 minutes before I was able to start fighting again.- As a ADHD enjoyer, the amount of times there would be several lines of dialog overlapping were too high. - Enemy variety gets stale around the half way point. Boss fights are easy with very few mechanics outside of dodging left or right. - Combat abilities are a bit limited. - Getting stuck on the environment a lot."

There are dead bodies all around the first level of dead soldiers, and they only have 2 models, so its the same dead soldier repeated over and over again often in the same room. The worst part is the main character is insufferable, which wouldn't be a problem if he didn't talk so much, constant bad jokes, stupid observations and quips. Could be a fun weekend game on a steep discount."
239,Telos,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198122678556/,3,,1,78.3,March,2,57,0,1,"After having played through this game twice now, I can say that I strongly recommend it if you're looking for a great single player RPG. Here's my pros and cons after nearly 80 hours.Pros:1. Polish - Man, it feels good to play a game in 2023 that releases complete and polished from the start that I don't have to wait months for it to be finished. While the game shouldn't necessarily be receiving praise for this (Since it should be the expected minimum when buying a $60 title) I think that, in today's standard, it should be recognized among all of the crap we typically get.2. The world - I haven't played many games that manage to blow me away with the beauty of their environment design, but this game really hit the nail on the head.3. Optimization - With how beautiful this game is, I was fully expecting it to torch my relatively mid level PC build. I was utterly blown away to find I can run this game on Ultra settings and still pull nearly typically 70-90fps while using a GTX 1080 and an AMD Ryzen 5 3600. Without a doubt, this is the most optimized game I think I've ever played to run such a beautiful game so smoothly. Hat's off to them for this one.4. The story - I'll talk about some of the cons of the story (without spoilers of course) in the cons section, but I still think, overall, that the story was largely interesting, had some great plot twists, and was well paced. I was more than intrigued to find out how it ended and I was more than pleased with the initial ending I played. All in all, as far as video game stories go, I'd give the story a solid 8.5/105. The crafting/progression - They have a simple, yet effective way of fathering resources that you then use to craft unique weapons, ammo, consumables, and upgrades for your character's glove abilities and weapons. Blue prints can be found for specific upgrades in sites located all around the map. These sites typically are giant spacial puzzles that get harder in difficulty as you progress through them.6. Puzzles - When I came into this game I wasn't expecting it to be a very prevalent portion of the game, and while it's not anything comparable to something like Portal, it still does have a good amount of spacial puzzles to be solved. The beginning few are just to introduce you to the concept of they work, but they do become a bit more challenging later in the game. I never felt like I wasn't able to not figure them out though. The complexity level is what I would describe as beginner friendly to intermediate.7. Combat - The gun play is smooth and feels good. Utilizing your dash to dodge incoming attacks is a must and enemies are pinged with a red pulse when they are about to do a major attack that needs to be dodged or you will be knocked to the ground. It's a big step up from the mundane combat typically found in most FPS RPGs.Cons:1. Dialogue/Story - While I largely enjoyed the story of the game, and I thought that a vast majority of the voice acting was actually superb for a game being translated from its native language, I just can't get over the translation of the main protagonist's dialogue. It can grow to be a bit tiresome and predictable over the course of the game. I'm not sure if this is due to a bad casting for the lead protagonist's English version, or if it's simply the product of translating the game from Russian to English. I can only Hear ""Crispy Critters"" or him complain about nearly everything in an impatient manner so many times. The story beats can often feel a bit forced to try and tie narrative together, using a lot of exposition to try and help make sure that the player isn't completely lost in the slightly more cerebral parts of the narrative.2. Endings (no spoilers) - There are two endings in this game depending on a final major decision you make. One of them  was superb (luckily for me the initial one I played) and was executed in a manner that truly made the game shine. The other ends the game rather abruptly, doesn't answer many question the player might have at the moment, and largely isn't rewarding in the slightest. It blows my mind how drastically different the payoff of this decision they give 10 seconds to make is. (Option #2 is good, Option #1 was disappointing). I honestly can't believe they were okay with a large portion of players selecting that first option and thinking that's all there was to the game. I don't think it's hard to imagine a player completely despising the story if that's their first and only play through of the ending of the game.3. Traveling - It's a good thing the world is beautiful, because that saves traversing the open world. Cars are frustratingly useless since there is more often than not, something blocking the path that your car will hit. THERE IS NO SPRINTING IN THIS GAME!!! I genuinely believe that this game could have benefited from a dedicated sprint action ontop of the quick dash. Luckily, most of the game is spent underground in the facilities rather than running around the open world, but still... Travelling wasn't the most engaging part of the game.4. Look but don't touch - While the game is breathtakingly beautiful, it does have a bit of a feeling that you're not allowed to interact with it in a manner that you would likely come to expect in a modern RPG. Most of the buildings spread out throughout the open world simply have the same desks/trunks/cabinets to quickly loot through and I feel like they missed a bit of an opportunity to really fill the environment with interesting things like they do with the spacial puzzles in the facilities and testing grounds.5. Repair drones - These little guys just get annoying after a while in the open world. Everything that you kill only stays dead for so long because repair drones will infinitely spawn over and over again to come and repair what you've recently killed. There are some ways to disable the spawning of them in specific areas, however it's usually more work than it's worth. It just becomes tiresome after a while.Personal Cons: These aren't a big deal, just things I found strange that I think are largely fine.1. Saving - I'm personally more of a fan of saving my game anywhere at any time like in a standard Bethesda title, however, they opted for saving checkpoints that you use in game. I found a few times while playing, I wanted to get off at that moment but had to keep playing for another 3-5 minutes to get to a save checkpoint.2. This one's not a big deal at all really, but I found myself struggling as an American to remember a lot of character names throughout the beginning of the game because Russian names are all similar sounding to me. They really do throw a lot of names at you I forgot who was who for a good portion of the game. Luckily the game really begins to hone in on a select few characters in the latter half of the narrative.Final score: 8.5/10 - Great FPS RPG"

There are allot of other $60 games out there that are not half of what this game is.

248,Kaernak,https://steamcommunity.com/id/YouNeedToApple-lyYourself/,13,3,0,5.9,March,1,552,0,1,"I actually plan on playing this game more and wish I could leave a neutral review, but I'm just giving it a thumbs down for now for 2 personal opinions. 1. If you're like me, I need a high FOV for my games or I'll actually feel sick. I have a bit of motion sickness. Right now, the game doesn't have an FOV slider. The game is way too zoomed in for me so I actually can't continue playing it until they patch it in (which I think they are in the future)2. The dialogue for the protagonist is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad that it's really taking me out of the game world. Every 5 seconds it's just him cursing or making some unfunny quip or joke or being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or saying how awesome technology and russia is. I like the dialogue for everyone else though (except the fridge which actually makes me cringe). I tried setting the game's audio to Russian audio, and I do believe it helped a little. However, I don't know if this is intended but the characters sometime talk super fast and can begin speaking the literal microsecond another's dialogue stops. It's really weird.  The reason I set my language back to English is because during a lock-picking minigame I was learning for the first time (which is also timed), the protag and the glove just ♥♥♥♥ out dialogue to eachother in Russian. I couldn't read the subtitles because I was trying to focus on the lockpicking minigame in front of my face so I don't know what they really said. I assume this will happen a couple of times throughout my playthrough so I changed it back to English after that.I think the gameplay is pretty good and the graphics/artstyle are stellar. If you ignore my 2 points above then you'll likely enjoy this game. I'll be returning to it after an FOV slider is patched in to give an honest review of the game itself"
249,RomaVictor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/romavictor/,5,,0,26.7,March,5,344,0,1,"This game is overstaying its welcome. After a healthy 20 hours of gameplay, I'm done with it. My biggest problem with the game is without a doubt the detection system, where if you are spotted on a security camera in the open world, robots spawn on your position and overwhelm you. It feels like an unnecessary punishment in a game that encourages exploration and resource collection. And then, on top of that, when you kill a robot, it doesn't stay dead because a repair robot comes along and fixes it right up. So fights never feel WON. You're always running away from fights instead of winning them. And then there's the puzzles. This game is filled with far too many puzzles. Why, in a game that features traditional Skyrim-style lockpicking are there ALSO doors that have complicated locking mechanisms on them? Just pick one and stick with it. It's completely unnecessary, and makes me not want to explore entire levels because of the hassle of getting from point A to B. Finally, there's the dialogue and the story, which is so wordy (with clumsy, awkward, bad words too) and techno-babbly, it's completely unengaging. And the protagonist is just a complete jerk, all the time, everywhere. I've never liked a protagonist less. I wish he would just shut up. I really wanted to like this game. And I gave it a good run. But I'm just checked out."

252,Larz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/larzko/,26,1,0,39.5,February,25,"1,152",0,1,Well this is a negetive rating on two major aspects.The writing. And communication from mundfish over all this years of waiting.As a founder (early backer basically) from the first preorder window of 2018 it became a game of what diden't it go through on. And years of just nothing. and even now it's a chase over minimal aspects and even the promise of getting a key for the right platform can't be delivered either.If you have to play it then get it on gamepass at most and not pay up to 60 or 100. Luckly i only paid 60 for my early bird backer thing that's basically the full package. What a comical world to have to be early bird backer to get the full game.Well let's go in to writingThe well talked about aspect between P3 and charles is no joke just really dull and the strange catch phrase of crispy critters or the russian dub ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pies. Well if you can stand star wars movies or super hero movies then you are gonna love atomic heart. And well that ending. I just have to say this have you played bioshock 1 and infinite.. you will see things from a mile away. They basically took certain parts and just swapped it. But biggest credit i have to give is thisThe game launched in a more playable state then most AAA/AA games of today. (Not bugless though)The hand vaccum aspect is just oddly satisfying and fun to do when you need to loot places and houses fast.That you can refund ability points spent to change up is a god send but at the same time it goes between 2 abilitys that can carry you. one that's middle of the road and shield that's more useless then useful.So this is the best example of waiting for a sale and kind of dlc they will deliver on.As they already have a trackrecord when it was gathering backers that they coulden't deliver on those promises. So who knows what they will do dlc wise. They coulden't even deliver the mick gordon tracks for the soundtrack yet but they will update eventuelly. and on normal without doing these mini quests of exploring these puzzle rooms it's might be 20 at most. But i took extra time and explore things bit more. So you can call it Atomic waiting6/10 but it has moments that leans it to a 7 from time to time.First buyers beware review.

They don't make ambitious solo shooters like this anymore.Imagine Bioshock and Wolfenstein in 1950's ""Atom-punk"" Soviet Russia, with clear inspirations and elements from Half-Life 2, Portal, Dishonored 2, and Prey. Enemy designs and environmental visuals are top notch. The game is also very optimized for how stunning it looks: 160-220fps the entire time max settings at 1440p. And to top it off, the soundtrack has Mick Gordon and Geoffrey Day behind the guitars remixing classic famous Russian songs and they're so damn good. Your arsenal consists of iconic 1950's Russian military legacy weapons that you can upgrade with retro-future sci-fi tech that makes your AKM, KS-23, and Makarov look like it came directly from the movie Elysium. Big fan of the aesthetics of mixing advanced tech with old Russian hardware. And your offhand has a glove that is an AI companion named Charles that acts as a ""Bioshock plasmid + HL2 Gravity Gun + Prey Glue Gun"" and is also used for looting containers (shop vac on steroids), throwing objects, solving physics-based puzzles, hacking, and navigating. And I have to say the ""Hedgie"" boss fight was the most visually impressive and intimidating boss fight I've experienced in years and it had no business having the hardest boss soundtrack I've heard since Doom2016. I was laughing at how good it was. My wife even sat down and watched captivated by it. The animation work and design is a spectacle. I am craving to see more of it. Also, the unique series of scientific test chamber areas that had gravity-based Portal-like puzzles and interchangeable rooms and walls like in Dishonored 2's famous Clockwork Mansion were also Chef's Kiss. I did them all and didn't want them to end.However, the game needs a FOV slider (edit: they added 80-110 FOV, and it's the good kind where the weapon viewmodel changes with it), a way to disable the HUD or make it limited/fade away, and improve the timing of the English dialogue. But I understand the game has been fully voiced in like 10 different languages so I forgive it. Overall, the game felt super polished and I'm looking forward to more content and DLC.If you're a Bioshock/Wolfenstein fan, it's a real treat and an easy must play for you. So many unapologetic cheeky callbacks to the Bioshock series, especially near the end. You'll know it when you see it/hear it.Also, NORA > The Twins."

The world does feel as lived in as a game world canThough once you push past the first tutorial area you're left with a game that feels massively under baked for  something also trying at the ""open world"" exploration, the only way points are the story beats(which wouldn't be bad if you could *also* pin your own like most other generic open world games) It honestly feels at ends with itself. And like I mentioned earlier the story falls off so quick, and no amount of self referential character dialogue and Easter eggs hides the large failings going on. I won't go into spoilers for those still wishing to play but I honestly can't suggest it on anything but for sale at whatever half or more the retail price in your areaAt the time of writing I beat this in about 7-8 hours which I wouldn't mind if it felt more complete or at least more gripping in story. I'm sure more folks who get to the end will have complaints on the expected ""cannon"" ending. which again I wouldn't mind if it felt more completeIt truthfully feels like that rising trend in movies where they leave everything to the next one in hope you'll blindly take it in because of the pomp and flashTLDR; robot game has no real choices for you to make and is a 50% finished game, though Gamers™️ will say its 11/10 because of robot twin wife.

Its combat has a great feel to it. For me, melee weapons feel heavy as i like that. the stealth seems to be there but i have not been in a place yet where it is heavenly used or needs to be used. it has skills and abilities you can unlock and you can pretty much choose how you want to unlock them. other than some mandatory skills but it cost you nothing to unlock those.crafting is the same as you progress you collect resources you can use to make some new unlockable weapons or upgrade the ones you already have something i like in games. So far what i have played it is fun and i’m not even anywhere near the start-up of the game like i still feel like i learn new things that you can do.But as i say with most games it's best to play them yourself.

Gameplay and combat isn't by any stretch revolutionary, but it's also a situation of if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Exceedingly well polished for a day 1 release. Puts to shame the other developers in terms of their rushed releases. I remember it being one of the first games to even showcase itself as an RTX compatible game with its rudimentary tech demos.

Some other just bugs or poor playtesting (hello to ballet code room, and ""go to the second floor"" submarine room) 2 good things - fighting is quite nice and design!

No stuttering, no hitching it runs perfectly, just let it build the shader cache 1st before you press play. Also, it's cool that it has an independent SSD optimisation option that you can turn on, damn it loads fast.I am going to keep it real Atomic Heart looks better than most RT games so those complaining it has no RT at launch need a reality check, who cares. When so many are giving Dead Space 2023 a 10/10 review when they don't even mention it's trash performance, random FPS drops, stuttering, hitching and that it is backed by billions, unlimited resources, it's own graphics engine department yet want to point the finger at a small indie shop for not having RT at launch. All I can say is... really dude?????Ignore any hate this is an incredible next gen BioShock game with the most insane visuals and art design that I have seen in a while and the performance is a 10/10. If you like that sort of thing this is 100% the ticket, for the FOV fix just get Flawless Widescreen it already has a profile, so we are all good to go!Update 1 : ok, I have played more.... this is incredible basically it blows any expectations I had and it is starting to feel like a Elden Ring of BioShock in the way Elden Ring blew your mind the first time you played it and the more you played.The game is massively polished, complaining about the RT or HDR makes you look like a clown or you just don't love or appreciate video games any more and that makes me depressed. This is mega high quality and super fresh. The looting like in BioShock is amazing, the game does this insane effect with a sort of force pull, the animation is sort of crazy in the game. Another thing is the sound design, man is it good and easily on the level of Dead Space 2023 which is amazing.I am sort of blown away right now, the first hour is pretty insane and there are so many art peaces and moments that like OMG! The SSD code is insanely fast, and legit optimised unlike other games. Atomic Heart is only a UE4 game and it really is a crazy show case and makes me wonder what UE5.1+ games will be like. The last batch of UE4 have been amazing this is easily right there at the very top.Gameplay feels very smooth and responsive, the melee combat feel perfect and you do have a dodge for combat. That part feels really nice, I know early vids people where concerned, don't be it's ACE.Just go try the game out for your self, I guaranteed you will love it and go OMG! This is a crazy high quality SP FPS and and it totally feels like a mega next gen BioShock which I love so very much!I need to play more, 0 regrets on a 2018 pre order before anyone cared about the game, they did an amazing job!"

273,[☭]-Soviet-Triumph-,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sovetskiysoyuz/,5,1,1,65.2,March,5,"5,949",1,1,"Combat is very good, it's not at the level of exceptional that was DOOM 2016, but it is still very fluid and reminiscent of Bioshock. weapons feel great to use and well animated(my best one is the single-hand pump action of KS-23, well done, devs!)and the enemies are diverse enough, it will feel acceptable at the very least to most people, but it doesn't come without its flaws. in the beginning, I found the enemies a bit too bullet spongey, the seemingly endless number of repair bots is annoying at times, stealth across the game is almost nonexistent as silencers are simply not a thing and they will be on alert once they catch a glimpse of you and the mechanic of weak points are present but they are not weak enough to guarantee you a kill of the most basic robot with a single well placed shot from a Makarov or an AK(but this is somewhat understandable since you're fighting robots not humans in this game). plus I felt the leap distance of some enemies is a bit too much, I've seen some basic low tier enemies rushing 6 or 7 meters within seconds. navigating is fine, but oftentimes the ingame map doesn't provide enough information. map design, just alright, they managed to utilize the limited indoor space fairly well for first timers and driving around outdoor spaces full of robots, dead people and communist monuments felt okay so I have no complaints. training facility puzzles are somewhat janky. sometimes you'll find yourself wondering, ""was that the solution?"" after solving the platforming puzzle because a lot of platforming stuff involves using your dash ability and in some cases, it's possible to skip an entire section with the proper use of it. doorlock ones are much better and I enjoyed every second of me solving those puzzles. The artstyle of this game is relatively coherent, while not completely so. and that is okay, since the facility is not made of one man's work. it's rather the work of multiple geniuses from multiple design bureaus and it makes sense. in contrast to the usual video game portrayal of (post)soviet settings-abandoned villages, decaying machines, rust ridden symbols-Atomic Heart's retrofuturistic style that looks straight out from Technika Molodezhi is very fresh and unique. one slightly disappointing thing is that some of the elements, namely automobiles, are anachronistic for an ingame setting of 1955, but in a world where rapid technological advancement is a thing, I can also give this a pass. I personally think it would be more appropriate to set this game in 60s or even 70s, but developers may have thought that this scale of innovation and changes were only possible in Khrushchev's era, not Brehznev's when its represented by stagnation and hiatus. some of character/weapon design is also done to appeal to modern standards (and possibly, to western audiences) and barely fits to its era. Now I'll be blunt, it's bad. probably the weakest part of this game. Protagonist unironically repeating the same idea across the game from start to end is tiresome, and a large portion of important cutscenes end in a way of either you losing your target or fading out and it gets old. now you will soon learn that he belongs in the special... forces in both ways for a reason but this Major Nachaev, P-3, is certainly not a likable person to deal with, or to play as. ever heard of 5 stages of grief? well this guy only can go through the first two stages before back to square one. but unfortunately protagonist isn't the only problem, and other characters also have similar issues like some characters turning batwhat crazy at the pettiest thing imaginable, other ones dumping every information to the player only at the end. it is simply not paced well and not planned well, it's almost as if when they took notes from the Bioshock Infinite they overdone it, and even took inspiration from the weakest elements of that game and executed it more poorly. in short: don't expect much of a story, the game prioritizes gameplay and visuals if you still haven't noticed.most of the music that's present in the game is already existing classical music or soviet pop songs, often remixed in modern taste. to talk about modern rearranged tracks, ones with the metal vibes on them, Mick's and Geoffrey's, are tastefully done, it feels great when you're listening them in combat, which is times when you'll hear them the most, some of the other synth-y ones such as Biokonstruktor/Olga Voskonyan's song seemed a bit too out of place even for a retro synth fan such as myself. all of the licensed pop songs are anachronistic, developers were aware of this and there is an ingame explanation of these 'futuristic' notes, however. though, I found it not convincing enough.Despite criticized by some people for being a pro-soviet propaganda piece, The game's promotion of the opposite idea will get more evident as the game progresses. problems that were known to be prevalent in the soviet system, such as extreme suppression of individualism, elitization of the CPSU, devaluation of human lives and false promises that were made to the working class are shown directly from ingame dialogue and computer logs and the grand concept of soviet utopia is only relevant during the first 30 or so minutes, after that everything turns to hell and the filth that was hidden under the pretty facade will begin to make its appearance.There were bugs regarding achievements, but they are mostly fixed, mostly. still you'll need to reload your save once or twice in some instances to trigger the cheevos. and if you spam your rushing ability on some tilted surfaces you might find yourself stuck with no way to un-stuck yourself, and there were bugs of world map not displaying due to me still being indoors even though I was already outside, which I solved with save reloading. I experienced 4 crashes(Yes, I counted, throughout the playthrough of approx. thirty hours). when using an english voiceover with russian subtitles, some of them are not synced right and couple of dialogues are impossible to read because they disappear too fast or sometimes don't appear at all. some of the log files remain untranslated and are still in Russian. some animations will be in noticeably lower framerate when playing at a high refresh rate(120Hz/144Hz).Some sections can not be visited again, if you're a completionist then search for every collectible in the area before you progress.Do not scrap the early weapons (Axe/KS-23) and let them rest in your storage if you feel like don't need them, there are reports of early weapons' blueprints not spawning at all even in the late game.While automatic checkpoints are a thing, you shouldn't rely on them since they don't happen that frequently especially when you're doing some side objectives such as the training facilities, save often.Some of the english subtitles favor the Ukrainian spellings over Russian ones, for example 'chicken Kiyv'. I suspect devs, or translators, CTRL+F'd at the last minute and changed some words given the incorrect capitalization.Some of the images shown in the game seems to be generated using the AI image generation tech, I believe this is one of the first instances of the tech directly used in video game development.Despite its weaknesses, this game plays well and runs well, and I definitely had my fun. and considering its Mundfish's first game, and its troubled development history, it's a miracle that this game turned out to be this good. there are four additional DLCs planned in the future, but from the sounds of it they'll be just another minor map expansion with few extra enemies and weapons, consider this game pretty much completed. expect a 20-something hours long experience.8.5/10."

277,VictimofScience,https://steamcommunity.com/id/VictimofScience/,4,1,1,12.1,February,23,"1,026",0,1,"Atomic Heart takes place in an alternate timeline where the USSR won the war against the USA and became a technological superpower, inventing robots and fantastical technology to make their soviet lives easier. It has a distinct art style that stands out, mixing a nice soviet brutalism with some art deco style. It is a valiant attempt at the formula that made Bioshock great, although it falls short.Combat is this game is pretty ok. There are roughly about 8 or so enemies you fight a lot of, with a few unique ones scatted here and there for bosses or minibosses. Its pretty standard of attack/shoot and then dodge the enemy's attack. Its a neat idea, although can get pretty jank when the terrain gets involves. Its a little rough to get used to but after a while its pretty easy to learn.Gameplay is basically following quest objectives as you go. Enemies body block you and push you into corners and keep you stuck which is super frustrating. Bosses are pretty fun to fight, although some of them move  too fast. The flying repair bots are super annoying with how many there are. They keep coming until their supply is gone and you can't disable their dispenser even when prompted with you ability to do so, so you have to babysit the bots you killed for 5+ min to make sure the repair bots don't just revive them. (Imo they need a way to disable the way the bots dispense or change how they can respawn enemies.) There are also  enemies that can spread and keep making more enemies ala  that are frustratingly strong and annoying to kill before they can make any more.Story is basic and uninspired. They lore dump you every other area and spoonfeed story elements in case you are a simpleton and can't follow causality to an action. Overall it's incredibly predictable and flat, and the lack of cutscenes that flow coherently just drags it down.Dialog is hilariously bad. The writing and the voice acting is atrocious. The character says his ' catchphrase in every scene it feels like he's trying to advertise a cookie brand or something. The delivery on well over half the lines is disjointed and sloppy and it feels like the VA had no direction or context to the situation so it just comes off as bored and uninterested.Weapons and powers are fun to use, although they feel very underpowered when un-upgraded. It seems to take a few upgrades to make a weapon viable. I ended up using the starting Axe most of the time as one upgraded with the heavy charge attack, it would kill most bots in 1-2 hits, and whittle down bosses fairly quickly. Performance is actually pretty good for me. I played on High and got a consistent 100+ FPS the whole game with a 2080TI.  There seems to be a bug or wonky design choice where characters will talk before they're supposed to, so they interrupt who they're talking to or just talk over them. Not sure if this is a residual part of translation but its pretty jarring.Overall its an alright game. Its pretty pricey right now so I suggest waiting for a sale to get the money's worth. It didn't live up to the hope I had for it but it wasn't the worst game I've played. A NG+ playthrough could be fun if they added it.-Gameplay 7/10Soundtrack 7/10Sound Design 5/10Story 4/10Dialog 2/10UI 8/10Performance 10/10-Overall I'd give it a 7/10 Its fairly average all around. A lot of talent and heart went into it and it shows, although its missing that spark that makes a game fun.Hope I never have to hear Crispy Critters again."

The story is meh, the gunplay is meh, the 'puzzles' aren't really hard mentally, but the platforming is annoying.The final nail in the coffin was the combination of console-style 'only save at save points' coupled with fequently getting stuck on things (crates, edges of pools, etc.) and sometimes long run ups to boss set-piece encounters only for death to make you retrace the last 3-5 minutes before you get to the boss.

I finished the story with no closure at all, and dull ""oh that's the twist"" turn-about.  The combat is boring and glitches are extensive....and forget about choices.

I've been hyping up this game for a long time now, and when I saw there were reviews saying the game was disappointing and plaint bad, I just got scared. Then there were the good reviews which still gave me hope for the product I was purchasing. Let me tell you this, I am almost 5 hours into the game and it is pretty amazing! I love it, and the fighting mechanics are great. Besides that the exploration, powers, sub systems within the game's mechanics, art direction and music, everything is just incredible, you're in for a treat!. If I have to point out a few not-so-polished things of the game, these would be that in some moments the audio from the cutscenes lacks a bit of energy or it doesn't sound as big and punchy as you might be anticipating. I think is the mixing, but maybe they can patch it. This, however, is not very prominent and actually really bad, I'm just nitpicking for the sake of doing it. It won't throw you off the game's world and ambience, it's just that I would've wished it was a bit better executed. The only other thing that I found to not be very good is that sometimes if an enemy corners you on anything, like a shelf or a desk or a wall, you might get stuck and unable to move, so you're basically dead. Yes, I know many will say that being this a shooter and melee based combat game that is pretty bad and concerning, but trust me, it really doesn't happen often, at least not to me, the devs can actually patch it, and finally, I don't think this is enough reason to actually draw from the awesomeness of this game and it's beautiful world. I think I am right to predict that this game will become a modern cult classic and a masterpiece of the genre. Please give this game an opportunity, not many games come out so original and well crafted like this one nowadays, so I fell that we should support the devs."
288,ExileCast,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198101233182/,3,1,1,16.7,February,27,808,0,1,"You can read my other reviews The feeling I had when I finished Atomic Heart was… mixed. Between happiness, for finally having finished the game and laughter for the way in which his story effectively culminated. The first contact you have is undoubtedly impactful, the clash between a vintage aesthetic and a futuristic world full of robotic carcasses, mixed with vibrant colors and surprisingly strong situations is fascinating, to say the least.Atomic Hearts takes inspiration from other titles like Bioshock, Fallout, or even Wolfenstein and mixes moments where even the world of Super Mario is present? Yes, it is definitely strange. The story begins after the Second World War, when the forces of the Soviet Union were victorious, and with that power, they developed a very advanced robotic technology, which consists of the concept of controlling a robot with the human mind, in order to control the entire world. However, something did not go as expected and the plan went down the drain. It turns out that all the robots created so far began to indiscriminately attack all the humans they found along the way. The player will enter the troubled mind of P-3, an elite soldier tasked with investigating the mysterious cause of this robotic problem.Equipped with an arsenal of creative weapons, P-3 thus holds the fate of humanity in its hands. I confess that my favorite weapons were the Zvezdochka Axe and the Electro pistol, which shoots a kind of electric shots, without the need to use bullets, since it uses energy. The player will also have a glove that is much more than just a decorative element. The glove holds powers, such as magnetic fields that raise enemies, the possibility of creating a shield around you, among others. Without wanting to reveal too much, the glove plays a tremendously important role in the outcome of the story, since in addition to everything I mentioned earlier, it also features its own artificial intelligence and it is with which P-3 will have most of the interactions. Another important mechanic is the possibility that the glove has, when scanning enemies, to present the strengths and weaknesses of each one, thus allowing the player to have a different approach at each moment of action.Although all the weapons have a retro look, their animations are quite catchy and mixed with P-3’s agility and his quick dodges with the simple press of a button, it gives the player a superhero aura. Still, nothing that has not already been seen in other titles.Although the gameplay is one of the main features of this adventure, it can become repetitive and tremendously frustrating. There are times when the character gets trapped between enemies and a wall or an element on the floor, and the premise of having small robots that are always reviving other downed robots over and over again, makes the exploration aspect a somewhat complicated task. There are ways around the situation, such as applying an electrical discharge to the spawners of this specific enemy or waiting for the spawner to effectively stop producing them. The problem is that each spawner scattered across the map can send the robot even over great distances. In this sense, it is not only important to keep an eye on what is happening on the ground, but also to destroy these flying enemies.I confess that I didn’t explore the map more precisely for this reason, which did not allow me to acquire all the available weapons throughout the 17 hours of gameplay. To produce each weapon, apart from the initials, it is necessary to find a blueprint. Later it is possible to assemble, if you have all the necessary elements, in a machine. Regarding upgrades, I felt that putting points on the character was the right option since each weapon upgrade did not present a significant change compared to the other option.The confrontation against Bosses are quite satisfying and sometimes even complicated. The important thing will be to learn the attack pattern and wait for the right moments. Despite my need to replay some combat, there were no behavior changes for movement patterns or random attacks.Unfortunately, the way the dialogue plays out is pretty weak. The way the character interacts with everything around him, the constant repetition of phrases when something bad happens, leaves much to be desired. Even the machine where it’s possible to upgrade the arsenal, named Nora, is a very different machine. It presents itself as a very “excited” machine with a carnal desire, for lack of a better term. At first, it was fun, I even managed to let out a laugh or two, but over time, it becomes an old joke. To make things even more difficult, the presence of elements against Ukraine, records that compare the population of Ukraine to pigs, among others, is at least deplorable…Atomic Heart isn’t necessarily a bad title. It’s as full of positive things as it is of bad things. Combat is fun but becomes frustrating, as are the platforming sections, and so is its entire narrative. The end result for me was a mixed bag of experiences that I still haven’t been able to discern. Even so, it is important to mention that this is the first title from this studio."

You get a lot of ammo, but not unlimited.-Enemies are bullet sponges. even when combining abilities to make enemies more vulnerable they still eat a lot of ammo from most firearms.-Old fashioned save system can cause large amounts of lost progress. There are no warnings about points of no return or when they will re-open.-world is very bland and copy paste. The intro is unique but it seems all the art assets are spent there."

310,Omnezia,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Omnezia/,5,,0,24.8,February,28,414,0,1,"Right, so i decided to wait with writing a review until i completed the game, so here goes:I've followed this game for a while, from before it ""changed"", whether for better or for worse, i don't know.but one thing is for certain, the game isn't bad for this companies first game, far from it. I've seen game coming from 3A companies that doesn't even work half as good as this, so props to them.(General Conclusion at the bottom)A ""few"" Side notes:Combat:Combat is a lil bit wonky at times, and becomes very stale and samey after a while, its fun enough at the start, as your trying to learn and stuff. but nothing new is really added later on:if you get ganged up upon by a handful of enemies, or if a powerful enemy gets you into a corner, you might as well just reload a save, as you are dead at that point. which i cant say is ""bad game design"" but def not an optimal one.Weapons:as stated above the weapons gets stale after a while, as there aint a ""great"" quantity of weapons to choose from, and most are OK to good at most stuff, but nothing amazing. most require a lot of resources to compete with the others, which i can understand from a RPG perspective, but the amount of resources needed is a bit over the top from what you acquire from playing the game. i see my self as a loot-goblin and tend to search every nook and cranny for loot (which is y it took me nearly 25 hours to complete the game).Story:The story is relatively well written, with a few hick-ups here and there, but that's to be expected. the dialogue is a bit... dry to say at best, some stuff ain't really explained properly most of the time and doesn't give the fulfilment of completing somethingSPOILERS AHEAD:the game has two endings, one ""good/joke"" and one ""bad/main"", both come as a prompt out of nowhere and if your too slow it just picks for you, so be ready. now im not happy about the endings at all, and one makes sense which is the ""Bad/Main"" ending, that one fits in to the narrative and suites the games play-style as well as general lore and feel. the second one is.... as i stated a ""joke"" or at least that's how i see it, as it doesn't fit in at all, and just leaves you looking at your screen in disbelief and wondering where the F*** did that come from. Now i wont divulge the content of the Endings, as that's a bit too much of a spoiler in my opinion. END OF SPOILERMechanics:Mechanics wise the game is well balanced in good and bad decisions. as some work really well and others leave you questioning why it even gave you the option in the first place.in the game your given a power-set not too dissimilar from the Bioshock series, which i think was the point. these work rather well, and give off some funny if not sometimes stupid solutions to some fights or puzzles. the melee mechanics leave a bit to be desired, as it only leads you down one path, as its the only one that works properly at the moment. which is ""power attack"" or ""heavy swing"", which is just as the name implies. I've tried most of the melee weapons except for the ""Snowball"", and most have a pretty even playing field, some have good Speed but low attack and vice versa. but that's sadly all there is too it. as the melee selection is rather small there ain't much.The gun mechanics work much like other games, you aim at something, you shoot a few times, and it dies.Upgrades:You can upgrade both your melee weapons, Guns as well as yourself (that both implying to abilities and general HP and the likes). the upgrades for Guns and Melee are much the same, upgrade damage, Heavy damage, speed, Heavy speed as well as some capsule upgrades allowing you to infuse your current attacks with attributes like fire, ice, electric etc.in terms of Self upgrades, there exists a larger variety than the weapons. you can upgrade your own abilities to match your play-style to a degree. there are the general HP, armour as well as some minor ones like ""laser immunity"" or ""more dodge charges"", your abilities also gets a few upgrades, but ill talk about that in the ""Ability"" section.Abilities:Your given a few choices of abilities, like Low grade telekinesis that lifts enemies allowing you to shoot them unimpeded which with an upgrade crushes them and flings them to the ground, a Frost ray that freezes an enemy in place, allowing you to get that ""perfect"" headshot you always wanted, as well as stuff like Chemical goop that takes on the property of the element you shoot at it, electrify it to stun any enemy stepping into it, freeze it to make enemies slowed down or hit it with some fire to make it burn enemies instead. I've tired most of the abilities, and I've got to say, most are pretty fun. but in the end, all i used was the Frost ray as well as the standard ""Shock"".all abilities can be upgraded with stuff like more damage, wider range, longer duration, lower energy cost and the likes.Map and ascetics:In my opinion the game looks quite pretty, with good graphics, that doesn't ""completely"" tank my PC. the enemies are well designed with attention to detail (in most areas, a few areas on some enemies have no textures, as in its see-though). there are cars in the game, but only 1 red car is actually drive-able, which is a little sad, but not a massive downside, as the map isn't that big, and most of your time is spent in what i call ""dungeons"". the Map layout also makes good sense and leads you in a straight path to follow if your only interested in the story.Enemies:we've got robots in all shapes and sizes, but i don't think and/or feel like there is enough of them in terms of variety. 3 of the main bots in the game is just a repainted, slightly buffed version of one another, but with the same general fighting scheme. the Bosses good and display enough difference to make them challenging, but not enough to make them impossible. However, in my opinion its not a good idea to put the same ""unique"" boss in separate areas with different stats. i enjoyed the bosses i had to think about before fighting, but adding another that's WEAKER than the previous makes it feel like a bore. a good example is the one nicknamed ""Ivy"", after your first boss battle with it(?), you practically find around 3-4 of them in each ""dungeon"" and one is difficult enough with random QTEs and an odd hitbox on top. (there is a bridge where 3-4 of these spawn in rather close proximity, making it VERY hard to pass, unless you lower the difficulty, i just ran past them and prayed for my life)General Conclusion:Question: can i recommend people to buy it?i have two answers, a long and a short one.Short: no, i don't see this game as being worth the money i spent on it.Long: I cant with the right consciousness recommend the game thus far, as there just isn't enough in the game to warrant the 59.99 Euro price tag, i could probably complete the game in less than 3-4 hours if i skipped all the menial stuff and just went for the story (which some people do mind you). as i said, i only took around 25 hours to complete it, while also going around the map and exploring. if the games 4 Upcoming DLCs add enough stuff, or if they update the game with enough content, i might change my review, but as it stands now i cannot recommend spending 59.99 Euro on this game, if your looking for a game like this you can buy ""Biochock: The collection"" for the same price, and get more than 5x the amount of playtime this offers (at time of writing), its also worth a note, that Bioshock VERY often goes on sale its a good buy if you like these kinds of games (just a little recommendation from me :) )You are free to ask in the Comments about stuff if your curious (Though i dont think ill be answering them if you ask a Year from now, as the game might have changed by then)"

Can't do both because ♥♥♥♥ that's why.- at the release day there was (and still isn't) change the size of the conversation fonts- no RTX at launch- - before creating a new weapon you can't compare it with an existing one.- in the inventory you have to put stuff into your global inventory in order to disassemble them.(For those who say ""the dev team is not big enough"" I say these problems could have been solved by experienced game designers. Or just take a look at Fallout 4 and The Witcher 3 loot and scanning system.)I could go on and on about these bad design and quality control choices BUT afaik the devs are not really watch the forums.Buy the game at a sale!"

The protagonist is so incredibly unlikable I felt like it was a chore to finish this game. Everything else about this gorgeous game was overshadowed by his constant pissy attitude.He wasn't even negative for any reason. He's just naturally a prick. The story includes telling the player that the main character lost all of his memories prior to his recent surgery. At the beginning of the game he's a blank slate and instantly the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Why?Who made the decision to write the character this way? It makes no sense. I was wondering if all of the main character's dialog could be rewritten to be likable or sympathetic, but then there's a cutscene where he picks something up and flips it callously into someone's face. This just doesn't make any sense. People act and react to the main character like he's a normal person. They don't react like people would if a jerk was acting badly in front of them. It's just so stupid."

At this point the non-existent FoV slider is a crime, and makes the otherwise pretty fun combat truly awful. Also, quick-dodging mechanics in a 1st person with low FoV = ridiculous.- Another infuriating offender is slowing down movement when you strafe, which you need to do to look around because you're locked into the low FoV. And running itself is already slow, so what the f...?- This game also has a pretty bad controller layout by the way.Now in combination with those fun-gameplay-limiting factors and the story, When I entered the open world, I found myself rushing to every main objective because dealing with enemies or areas isn't enjoyable. And 90% of the story so far has been: door is locked, go get the door engine opener, oh no the door engine opener has short circuited go get the canister of oil juice in the break room, oh no the break room is infested by anti-fun objectives...And yea I know its supposed to be part puzzle game, but the puzzles itself are almost always very simple, boring, long for no reason or copy paste, and the way the story blends into them is just kinda lame.TL:DR, in my opinion not worth full price, needs some very important but basic patches, and would love to try to enjoy this game again."
328,involuntary chad,https://steamcommunity.com/id/autowolfbeast/,4,,1,53.3,February,28,205,0,1,"Started playing on release and only encountered two glitches that were purely visual (a low quality texture of a building poster and also saw enemies before they were actually spawned during a cutscene) so far, that's really good in my book. The game looks gorgeous and runs pretty good on my Lenovo Legion 5 (RTX 2060) too, the right settings can get rid of hiccups and provide a smooth experience. I had no game breaking experience so far, at all. The visuals in this game are breathtaking and are a huge reason why I find this so fun, the gameplay works pretty well, I can enjoy it as a person who got here from games like Deathloop and Dishonored. At moments there can be a steep learning curve (my experience was with medium), but so far not too frustrating. The miniboss fights pull me straight into Doom with their soundtrack, though the game still stands well on its own and doesn't really scream Bethesda imitation, which I appreciate.I just want to say that I'll be playing this a second time later on, but with Russian audio. Maybe this won't be a popular opinion but I would have preferred Russian accents in English to American ones, for better immersion. Though I personally don't find the voices that annoying as some other people do. Character writing is probably the weakest suit of this game, but given that this is Mundfish's first game and the team seems to be pretty small, I can see some improvement in this department in the future. I really want to like the protagonist, it's already a daring endeavor to not write another silent type, which I honestly expected Major Nechaev to be before the game released. The chemistry between him and the glove can be pretty entertaining at times, even though we've probably seen it before. I would classify Atomic Heart as a good game, and I do not regret breaking my many years streak of never preordering games."

The open world aspect seems forced, there's a whole lot to like, but there's a distance to go between those things and it just feels like the majority of the time i'm trying to get to the next place to advance the story or get an upgrade and there's just no interest for me between that game-play loop, or the gameplay itself....I want to say straight out it isn't a bad game in any aspect, there actually is a lot of redeeming qualities it has, i waited with anticipation for it since it was first announced. Its just the gap in between the meaningful parts of the game that has put me off of it, for example, go from A, to B slug it out with the same bots, fight them the same way then collect an item with no story telling value unless its a part of the main quest. I struggled to enjoy the game after i got to the free roam section of the map as it feels like there is too great a pause between the meaningful events in the game and everything is just a collect fest where you just get items too upgrade, but even that felt like a chore. I really, really wanted to like this game, but the 80 bucks i spent i could have brought multiple other games and had more fun, in fact i haven't actually ""wanted"" to play this game again since i last played it which was about a week from ago from this post.This review isn't me just having a ♥♥♥♥♥ as much as it is me telling other people that if you expected this game to be a bio shock/ metro/ stalker hybrid, you'd be very dissatisfied as its no where near those games,Its basically Russian far cry"

332,Tricus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tricus/,4,,1,17.4,February,22,542,1,1,"I never thought I'd get a boner from a fridge.The actual game is unique and refreshing. The less you know about it the better, although you should be aware of its pitfalls before buying it. So here's your run-of-the-mill pros and cons list for your pleasure (based on my time with the New Zealand Game Pass): Enemies react to your hits. This has been one of the biggest highlights for me ever since the first gameplay snippet was released. The atmosphere and art direction are amazing. Gunplay is good, although the first guns are a tad bit iffy (lack ""oomph!""). Combat is very reaction-heavy. JuSt LiKe DaRk SoULs (no but seriously it do be like that on higher difficulties). Got a kickass soundtrack by Mick Gordon. You can vault over obstacles. Not much of a plus but it took me a while to figure out so thought I'd mention it. It's got some hysterical dialogue once in a while. The dialogue also becomes stale and annoying at times. It's a 60% bad, 40% good scenario. Either the MC and the glove are being dumb and annoying or hilarious. It's not on a Forspoken level but still enough to make it a negative. X-Ray wallhacks. For loot and puzzles it's fine, just not for enemies as it ruins the whole surprise element. Use with caution. No FOV slider. The FOV is too low for my comfort. Some of the abilities lack a bit of ""oomph!"". A lot of the objects such as bottles can't be destroyed. Important dialogue between the MC and the glove can get cut off if you trigger another dialogue. The game has some crude jokes, e.g. a n@zi joke and the above-mentioned sex fridge. It's not gonna resonate with everyone, but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be. I personally find it hilarious. You'll either love it or hate it, which is reflected in the mixed reviews online. Some enjoy it a lot, others don't. If you're still unsure, watch the reviews by Worth A Buy, ACG, Gman, Skill Up, The Escapist, and GamingBolt to get a better idea of how the game is. You'll see a lot of different opinions.Have fun! :)"

Personally, P3's Russian voice just fits him better and the game feels so much more immersive, and it fixes any VO pacing issues in English.Finally, how's the story? It's crazy, it's over the top, and it's weird...which honestly is perfectly fine and fits the insane atmosphere of the game. The game knows exactly what it is, and it's not trying to be something it isn't. So c'mon, crack open a bottle of vodka, give this game a shot, and get ready to make sweet love to a refrigerator!"

After finishing it, you might be left with a few moments to remember, but nothing worth replaying.The plot is grossly simple, and relied on a very predictable plot twist for surprise and engagement. It was to the point of wondering where the story was actually going while playing, since the characters seemed to be led along by just whoever was speaking at the moment.I had to play with Russian dialogue to make it bearable, although the Russian voice actors did a pretty good job.The combat gets repetitive quick, and there are a few mechanics that are never properly explained and require experimentation to understand despite not being necessary or significantly helpful to advance through the enemies.The guided ""open"" world either acted like eye candy for the background or an obstacle in actually continuing the story.There's also a strange focus on sexual themes in the game that are never really explored past their surface level. It borders on just being eye candy for coomers, I personally didn't really care for it.Regarding the plot, it's distinctively anti-Soviet, as it uses the dialogue and overall plot to explicitly show the downsides of the USSR and its regimes. Although this does clear the air about the game being a Russian propaganda piece, there were a couple moments where the dialogue was so focused on being anti-Soviet that it completely shifted the focus away from the conversation itself and made some sentences stick out like a sore thumb from the conversation.In summary, I wouldn't recommend buying this anywhere near its full price. I feel it would be more appropriate at $20 or $30."

365,1ch0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/1ch0/,2,1,1,40.3,March,4,157,0,1,"I did finish the game today and I give 9/10. The game totally reminds you of bioshock, prey and dishonored. It's fun in combat, let's you explore the world and has puzzles that are not too hard but make you think a bit. The weaponry is fun and can be combined in cool ways with your powers if you upgrade your powers enough.The Leveldesign is really well done and provides enough variety to keep you exploring while good soundtracks are playing when you are in heavy combat or exploring an area. This goes from heavy metal, over funky russian 60s pop music to classical opera. Texturequality is top notch and the game looks beautifully. Requirements for the game are not problematic and the game should run on pretty much everything and still look good. Very optimized. I had no issues and bugs. On 4K and max details I had rarely 9 GB VRAM utilized. Missing:- A real fullscreenmode. You can only switch to resolutions higher than your screen (4k in my case) by changing resolution in windows desktop, because the game uses a borderless windowmode, although its called fullscreen ingame. - FSR2. The game only offers DLSS, even including Framegeneration, but only FSR1. Since I played on an AMD RX6900XT, I disabled FSR altogether and played on native 3840x2160. Every setting was on max and I had 95% of the gametime solid 60 fps where I lock my fps anyway. If the FPS went lower in some areas for unknown reasons, which was mostly some few rooms in buildings outside and on the surface, it went to 45 fps for short wile. But those where rare moments and you barely notice them if you have ""Antilag"" enabled in the driver. I did not like: - Glove and Char starting to talk about something storyrelevant when you reach a certain location in a level, which I can't skip. You have to make sure you save at the right spot or you will have to listen to it again and again. Gladly the game offers a lot of locations where you can save and work on your equipment. My settings in the game:Everything on max and 3840x2160 resolution. No FSR.

366,JGerrity,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197986813772/,10,,0,26.2,February,24,527,0,1,"***EDITED***Firstly, I want to say I think this game has a lot of promise. Overall I am enjoying the game, but there are things that need to be addressed to make it... playable. My chief complaints at this time (with consideration to the game having been freshly released and pre-patches):1)  Map seems to decide to work/not work selectively after going indoors. Exiting the game and booting it up again seems to resolve the issue but is only a temporary fix. 2) Platforming/Parkour seemed to be an afterthought. It is clunky at best when it does work, but unfortunately is bugged out in several sections at its worst.  Seems to be selective; worked fine in  but does not work in some other silly areas like hopping cars/fences, climbing roofs, etc.  3) Achievements are bugged (I've certainly spoken to more than 10/46 dead people towards the Necromancer achievement, and though I have completed 6/8 of the Secret Training Grounds, I am showing that I have only discovered 3/8 of them, etc.). 4) Puzzle-solving is pretty pedestrian, though the game seems to take a tongue-in-cheek approach to this so that may be deliberate (shaped blocks/shaped holes puzzles, etc). 5) SHOK/Freeze/Telekinesis/etc. pays homage to BIoshock's plasmids and the like, but just seems lacking (being able to reallocate skill points between the different Charles abilities without penalty is an appreciated touch though). 6) Combat is nothing noteworthy. Easy-to-learn attack patterns, vulnerability/resistance system, etc. 7) Weapon creation/upgrading is a bit grindy but nothing outrageous.Most of these can easily be forgiven for what the game is but the map thing really needs to be addressed, the platforming should be revamped to be properly functional, and if you are going to include achievements that require tracking a number of kills, locations discovered, etc. that they should work properly. I will gladly recommend the game to others if I see these resolved."

369,R4IN,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordvader9911/,12,,1,19.1,February,27,519,13,1,"Well crispy critters! This is a tough one to review, but before we start, I wanna make it sparklingly clear - NO politics. I don't endorse such political drama in gaming and never will, and as such, this review will completely ignore all your political mumbo jumbo and just focus on the game at hand, alright let's go.I am very very mixed on this game. On one hand, it does a lot of things right, on the other, there are a TON of very rookie game-design mistakes and oversights, and also a lot of things are just plainly bad or stupid.Let's get the good out of the way, as it's fairly simple to go over:Performance - surprisingly, game runs butterly smooth, on medium-high settings I easily maintained 100+fps at most times. There are some bugs present, mainly related to interface and geometry, but nothing too insane.Visuals - phenomenal, all the artwork and art design is crazy, it's bizarre and chaotic. If you're a fan of constantly shifting moods and environments, the world itself is definitely for you. Though, there's also a drawback that we'll get to later.Animations - beyond stellar, I didn't confirm this, but I heard somewhere that Mundfish used to be an animation studio, and it shows, the animations are smooth and feel great. Movement is fun and weighty, guns feel good (though some sound effects and muzzle flashes are a tad weak) and all the robots and enemies have various unique animations and interactions, it's very fun the first time you see it.Soundtrack - obviously great, Mick Gordon helped create it and you can definitely feel it. Geoffrey Day is also plenty in this, and he's been an amazing addition too!Progression - I feel that one is also quite fun once you get the gears going, it takes a while (4 hours or so) to really get into it, but once you do, the progression is definitely felt and the skills are fun (though rather one-dimensional and/or overpowered).Resource Management - I played it on the hardest difficulty - Armageddon, and it was definitely a struggle at times, I had to think about my resources a lot and scavenge, it was fun and it never felt like I had *too* much.---- THE BAD ----Now that's over, let's get to the nitty-gritty, there's a lot of things I DIDN'T like about the game, and it's a shame because a lot of it are very rookie mistakes that could be easily fixed. Unfortunately, there are also a lot of things that flat-out CANNOT be fixed, it's just how the core of the game is.The protagonist - awful, just plain awful writing. I don't like his design much either, but that wouldn't play much of a role in an FPS, what does is the voice lines, and oh boy he's an all-around ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Always complains, says ""I don't care"" to most things even if the player might've cared... just terrible, switch your audio to russian or some language you don't understand and just read the subs when you want, solves this issue.The open world - gosh I HATE the open world in this game. It *looks* great, but it plays awful. The enemies are everywhere, they INFINITELY RESPAWN right in front of your face and they just keep coming and coming, Later on, I just didn't have the patience anymore to explore and just rushed from story mission to story mission. They don't give you any time to breathe, really a shame when you have such a beautiful world..Enemy variety - the designs that *are* there are generally great, all the robots have their unique attacks and behaviours, unfortunately, there's not that many of them and they all just kinda boil down to ""shoot it until it dies"", there's not much depth to the fights.Pacing - it's terrible, plain terrible. You start the game very slow, about 4 hours are spent in the beginning levels alone, with so many little puzzles and lockpicks that you might even think it's a puzzle game, then you spend about solid 15 minutes in the open world before you move to another 1-hour long story mission, rince and repeat and then towards the end the game (the Med Lab level) becomes an insane shooting parade with so many enemies that you'd wanna grab an ability to just explode and delete them off-screen (gosh there's so many, and they RESPAWN CONSTANTLY!!). Pacing is just awful.Weird mistakes/oversights rapid fire: No sprint? why? Dismantling and moving your inventory is torment, the interface always slides up when you move items and you can only move/dismantle one by one, why? Some vendor and save point places are right next to each other, and it's rather common. No waypoints for the map? Map being generally awful. No FOV slider? Why? Especially the boss fights and high intensity encounters are a bit hard to read because of the limited view...A big lack of human game assets, there's like one(?) dead soldier model, and like two or three ""specimen"" human models scattered around the world, kinda breaks the immersion when you notice it. A little quirk I also hate - there are certain crate/chest models that are usually lootable, but sometimes they just aren't, you walk up to a chest that *should* be lootable, but it just ain't, for no reason. Make different models for locked and unlocked containers please. Vehicle is useless, it dies almost instantly in any higher-intensity robot encounter in the world (which is like every single one).-----------There's even more I could talk about, but that would warrant an hour-long video review, and not just a text block, so Ima leave it at this. Overall, I think I'm gonna contribute to the positive side here and leave it a thumbs up, especially because this is Mundfish's first big title, and as a stepping stone for future projects, this is very very solid. If they improve their general game design for their future project, and keep the creativity and smoothness of it as is, their next game could be phenomenal.As it stands right now, Atomic Heart *could* be fun for you. It has a lot of quirks you might hate, but it also has a lot of things you might love. So take this as a MIXED review. Game is solid, has a lot of bizarre uniqueness to it and I think it is worth trying out. Just beware that there's a *lot* of jank in here, if you don't like jank and some plain-stupid game design, you won't enjoy this one."

Although it wasn't until I saw that the Ukrainian government was calling for it to be banned off digital storefronts that I made up my mind to buy it upon release rather than wait for it to be discounted in a Steam sale. And now after putting a couple hours into it I can safely say that I made the right decision. It's been a  time since I've played a game that is as well optimized as this, let alone one that released on day 1 that way. It's quite refreshing, honestly. The English voice acting on the other hand is quite atrocious... but that turned out to be a blessing in disguise because once I switched the dialogue language under the audio settings to Russian the game instantly became a lot more immersive than it would have been if I had persisted & experienced a Soviet world where everybody spoke English."

389,Dɪᴠɪsɪoɴ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Divis10n/,5,1,1,263.6,February,22,328,0,1,"Graphics: 5/5 - It is a good looking game for sure and even at the lowest settings it is still good looking. The only downside is how the water is barebones it never reacts to your movement.Optimization: 4/5 - It is surprisingly optimized despite their first game but the issues come as soon as you stutter and lag I think it has to do with switching tabs etc.Gameplay: 3/5 - Gameplay is there, it's serviceable but it is also basic and nothing special you would not get any kind of combat similar to games with good combat from Platinum's but it is okay. Challenge is non existent you can play on Armageddon, tediously explore and find almost the same area and that is all you can just complete the game with little use of your weapons (likely melee is your best option if upgraded).Story: 2/5 - Story is not the strongest point on this game, there is no choices that affect the ending and not much to talk about other.Replayability: 2/5 - All achievements, the way the world is presented and a lot of content are there. There is only dungeons you can do (8 of them), linear parts of chapters in story so you can only move forward and follow objectives.Variety: 2/5 - The game lacks what the old game had (Hammer, revolver, few enemies shown since 2017), they are cut but no hope for DLC until they reveal it but otherwise you get only 12 weapons, not a lot of enemy variety other than basics such as mutant (poison, fire, regular).Verdict: Average- Because while the game is likely completed, however the contents from the 2017 version being cut, the god awful story and an average combat that would not take a challenge to learn. However, I would prefer a sale on this game or a discount if you can. There seems to be controversy not from the censored Soviet clip but those are kinds of people who never owned this game or at least not being civil about this game but overall the game is fun. Almost a shame but then again I had anticipated for this since 2017.I would likely give this game a mixed verdict but Steam lacks that feature so I will imagine this as it is.Pros:Art style is superbFirst game from this studio that is almost better than soulless triple a games in the WestFun to playMid:Combat is not the strongestCons:Story is all over the placeAchievements bugStutteringCrashesBy the way this game uses Denuvo"

Я пропустил часть трупов и прочих предметов, не скрафтил все пушки и не прокачал хоть одну на максимум, ну да ладно, после выхода DLC доделаю)В игру было весело играть. Неплохая боевка, которую можно комбинировать со способностями, отличный саундтрек (правда, я так и не понял, где композиции Мика Гордона). Сюжет простой, и подается странно - но интересный. Свой кайф от него я получил. Графоний не хватает звезд с неба, но приятный глазу. Играл на Атомных настройках, в QHD. Сам геймплей нельзя назвать шедевром - но в целом тоже довольно неплохо. Подземные локации исследовать было интересно, Визуальный стиль, проработка лора игры и мира в целом - шикарны. Все наполнено мелкими деталями и кучей отсылок.Бои с боссами кстати тоже очень неплохо сделаны. Играл на максимальном уровне. - Открытый мир - он странный. Сражаться с роботами в нем - бесполезно. Особенно на волнах. Потратишь больше ресурсов чем получишь. Там, где нет поселений - в открытом мире нет вообще ничего. И это печально. Осознав это, я просто пробегал его между точками, ничего не исследуя.- Управление транспортом. К нему надо привыкнуть. Мне оно показалось немного деревянным.- Баги с достижениями. Не все работает корректно. Иногда они не засчитывались.Ну и были еще мелкие недоработки, думаю поправят патчами  Игра - очень хорошая. Я буду ждать DLC, буду в числе первых, кто купит предзаказ сиквела (если он будет)Игру делали с любовь и душой. Да, есть недочеты, есть ошибки, но они были и есть у всех. Но очень немногие студии вкладывают любовь и душу в разработку AAA-игр. Потому я не капли не жалею ни денег потраченных на нее, ни времени. И обязательно вернусь в этот мир - позже."

Bioshock, Portal, Prey, Fallout and Wolfenstein are just a few of the elements I notice on my first playthough. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The story is very oddly paced and very derivative but still entertaining. I found the protagonist to be very annoying, rude and poorly voice acted. I have heard that this is due to poor translation so maybe if you play try the game in Russian language with subtitles you might get more mileage with him than I did. The game did have a few bugs for me but these were mostly non game breaking.  6/10 - Pick it up on sale."
400,S3apancake,https://steamcommunity.com/id/S3apancake/,5,,0,20.5,March,14,72,0,1,"I suspected this would be a style over substance kind of game, and it was.  That's not to say it's a bad game, I enjoyed playing it even if the most fun I had was when I stopped taking it seriously.  Visually, stylistically, I loved it; the style is what got me interested in the game to begin with.  Mechanically, I don't have many complaints.  The combat was fun and the movement never really got boring—save for the climbing sections.  I got tired of the looting almost immediately, however.  Every weapon upgrade requires loot, either from killing enemies or looting boxes and drawers and cabinets and desks, and while the process is simple, it feels like I spent a third of my time staring at desks.  The plot is where all of my complaints really come from.  It feels like the plot doesn't start until halfway through the game, so it feels rushed and not very well put together.  The plot isn't BAD, really, I actually found myself interested somewhere between the disappointment of the game's beginning and the disappointment of the game's end, but it isn't a sound narrative.  It often felt like I was missing details, or that the player character had LESS knowledge of the world than I did, which most times was followed up by the game outright TELLING you what the plot was doing.  Take all that and add an ending that had little to no reasonable, logical buildup or foreshadowing and what you get is a disappointing conclusion that doesn't feel good.  There is no way to finish the game in a way that feels like a good, fitting conclusion to the game. Tl;dr  The beginning and end of the game are disappointing, and the plot feels like an afterthought, but it is a visually interesting game.  If you want hot robots and enjoyable combat, it's a decent enough game for that, but if you want an interesting story, I wouldn't spend the money.  Watch someone play it on youtube or something."

The whole game is incredibly satirical in its nature and mechanically plays like a Bio-Shock game. with cool 'magical' abilities and resource management mixed in with gank-like combat.The only downside is that the protagonist is annoying. However, that its very intentional. Our character is supposed to be unlikable as possible and they designed him perfectly so.But the Art direction and design of everything is so beautiful, it is the only game in which an opening rail-road pseudo-cut-scene felt like it was deserved. It is a very pretty game that runs very well.Its not a Bio-shock replacement, but its a pretty damn good love letter to it."

I wish I could leave a positive review for this, but the game also is full of bugs, and they can get very annoying, specially in the hardest difficulty. I had to write some of them down during my playtrough, because there are so many...- Tips popping up in the middle of jumps, messing with your timing;- Getting stuck in the terrain/props (this happens A LOT, there is a whole 'secret' location where I had to keep mashing buttons to get unstuck every 10 seconds);- Clipping through elevators;- Character animation frozen, preventing me from shooting enemies;- Enemies teleporting/disappearing/flickering on screen;- Alarm stuck on triggering state, even after being destroyed or leaving from the area (far far away);- Flickering crosshair stuck in firing animation;- 30+ minute-long segment filled with dialogues where there is no save machine;I'll come back to play this game in a few updates, and hopefully change my review"
405,Qayin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/maiconslavieiro/,2,,1,31.0,February,28,261,1,1,"When I saw the first trailer for Atomic Heart, I was excited. I saw certain mechanics and sensations from games and franchises that I really like, such as Far Cry, Dying Light, Bioshock, and even some Valve games like Half Life and Portal. In short, it seemed like a game made by someone who truly loves games. But the final experience was a bit disappointing. Here are some points about it:The atmospheric construction of Atomic Heart is very good, the world is beautiful, and it arouses curiosity, but there are few mechanics to interact with it, which gives a sense of unfinished business. In addition, the map is limited, generating some almost semi-open areas, which also causes some frustration.The combat in Atomic Heart is challenging, but it can become frustrating since it takes a long time to get sufficiently good weapons to face enemies in a satisfying way. The combat music, which is a highlight of the game, only plays in advanced moments, which is also a bit disappointing. To enjoy a more dynamic and rewarding combat experience, a significant time investment in the game is required.The weapon improvement mechanic is well done but demands a great deal of effort and game time. If it were a little easier to obtain the necessary components, it would be better appreciated. On the other hand, the skill mechanic is interesting, but I think it could be less limited by allowing the use of more skills at the same time to make the combat less challenging.The story of Atomic Heart is interesting, but not particularly genius. The dialogues, especially between the protagonist and the glove, are very poor and forced, making everything overly simplified for the player. Additionally, some dialogues between them in the map do not take into account the progression of the story.The puzzle parts with electromagnets are somewhat boring, even though I generally like puzzle games, this one did not live up to my expectations.Despite this, the game seems to be well optimized, even on the first day of release. However, the ray tracing is not well utilized.In summary, Atomic Heart had a lot of potential, but it may have needed a few more years of development and polishing. It is not a bad experience, but it fell short of the expectations created by the trailers. I would rate it a 7/10."

420,CosmicD,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CosmicD/,2,1,1,127.0,March,3,415,0,1,"The game has many layers. At first sight there's the hyperorganized and roboticized communism 2.0 arc  in an alternate universe Russia which won WW2. Wacky oversexualized crafting machines, talking gloves, a passive agressive protagonist and strange bedfellows and a GrandMother-I-DONT-Want-To-♥♥♥♥-With. But underneath lies a more sinister and esoterical narrative of experimental scientific breakthroughs that grew over the creators's heads and became transcendent, leading to a quite stimulating open end ripe for many theories of how our main protagonist will deal with his own afflictions vs the interests of 'the motherland'.The versatility in this game is astounding. Not only does it provide gameplay elements ranging from frantic Doom--like action mixed with beefed-up BioShock abilities, to portal-style puzzle solving and ""watch dogs"" hacking and scanning, the game also allows you to prepare yourself for big bos fights on a semi open world big floating island with aperture-science-style puzzle centres that provide breaks from the fast paced action. There you'll be able to acquire enough ""lustful abandon"" to upgrade many aspects of your character skills and passive abilities.The soundtrack treats you to a goofy Russian schlager and contemporary music remixfest in dubstep / progressive house / metal and more. The art style might be remeniscent of Bioshock but the semi open world and not in the least the story are unique and quirky enough to give it it's own distinctive vibe."

The melee combat is strange to get used to, but quite fun and responsive once you get a handle on it. The abilities Charles gives you are few in number, but all of them are viable and fun to use, some more than others( Mass Telekinesis is OP). The story is long enough to really sell the world and the environment, but not so long that it drags on and becomes unenjoyable. Story is quite nice, and has some interesting moral implications.Enemy design is fantastic, both visually and from a gameplay standpoint. Some boss fights are fantastic, while some are lackluster. For example, Hedgie, the Twins, and Dewdrop are very fun bosses. However, Belyash and Natasha fall short. Plyusch is fun but overused, by the 3rd or even 4th time fighting it you will be sick and tired of seeing it.The puzzles in the game are brilliant, and perfect for my room-temperature IQ. Some are difficult, but none difficult enough to require me to look up the solution. All are fun and don't last longer than they are welcome, something I quite appreciate as someone who typically isn't very good at puzzles.Admittedly, the game suffers from some pretty bad issues that I feel I should list here. For one, you will get stuck. I got stuck on random bits of environment and was forced to reload at least a dozen separate times. For two, and this could just be a personal issue, but towards the end of the game( Last 3-4 hours), the game would just lock up every now and then, freezing for 10-20 seconds before it fixed itself. I also had a quite annoying bug that made me have to restart an entire save file 7 hours in due to a door not opening when it should have.In summary, Atomic Heart is a fantastic game that I would give a 9/10. It shines in its world design, storytelling, and enemy design. It has its drawbacks, such as lack of weapon/ability choices, and some bad bugs, but I think the gameplay overcomes all the shortcomings there. Worth a pickup, especially since the Devs have plans for 4 DLC in the future."

The game is sadly a bit heavy on the looting mechanic where you are expected to constantly scavenge rooms and fallen enemies just to get a random set of items to be able to make your weapons usable. This downside is luckily countered by the other aspects of the game. Good music and sound design with plenty of variety in level design and enemies. The story wasn't ground breaking but I think the execution was good enough to not be bothered by it.

Combat feels good like a classic FPS similar to a typical ID Software game or even Bioshock. But with all that being said, the game isn’t without it flaws.  Movement speed can be tweaked to be more fluid at times.  The game lack some QoL things including the game map not being streamlined well with a legend or way to set waypoints and the open world exploration can be a little bland and lacking content.But the positive outweigh all of the negatives imo.  The OST is also dope af."

The mechanics can seem a tad odd but once you get a handle on things its fine, my biggest complaint is all the talking with the glove and the protagonist! I really feel like the game is ruined by the amount of talking, it interrupts moments when youre trying to save and with stuff thats really not important as the story is explained many times over like youre a thick head. I would definitely like to see more voice volume options, for the subtitles option to function correctly, its a shame these things taint what is a truly atmospheric experience. For the gameplay though, its very worth it!"

455,vol,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040833301/,2,,1,15.3,February,23,240,0,1,"Atomic Heart looks great graphically but after playing through it you can see how incredibly unpolished and often sloppy it is in its execution. The game has what is commonly referred to as an ""Ubisoft open-world"" design but without many of the basic features that make that low effort design less tedious to explore. The combat feels disjointed and clumsy largely due to every enemy having a straight line dash attack where the end point is far behind you. Stealth might as well not exist. Your character moves so ridiculously slow and enemies can detect you from render distance and once they have they follow you to the ends of the earth. It is better in literally every scenario to either run past or simply melee stunlock them to death. Another problem with combat is that guns/powers all feel more or less identical making any upgrade or change feel meaningless. The plot is awkwardly shambled together as evidenced by the strange jerky transitions during cutscenes, the unnatural dialogues and responses that would often overlap even while fighting enemies, and how it wears its influences so heavily on its sleeve to the point where your character hamfists the word ""rapture"" when describing an underwater view. There's also the problem that many actions are just unnecessarily slow such as climbing, lockpicking, or the excessive strings of QTEs but those are much simpler to fix than many of the larger problems with this game. All of that said, the game isn't bad. It's just incredibly disappointing. I hope the developers can create something much better with what they've started here. In short, get it on sale."

Everyone hates the main character apparently, I personally don't mind him, but I guess everyone was expecting someone a little more serious but I don't mind it.

I know that might be an overly complex and nuanced viewpoint for our modern society and I risk being burned at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stake but game good damn it!I will say though that the 2nd half of the game gets pretty tedious due to them just throwing an absurd number of enemies at you to artificially raise the difficulty.

From its beautiful graphics to its intense combat, this game is a great way to start off 2023. It has a couple of bugs I've noticed throughout my playthrough, but it was an otherwise pleasant experience with a compelling setting and eccentric characters which at certain points made me laugh out loud.""Begone demon!"" Was such a good way to set the mood and the extensive dialogue may be much for some to digest, but I think it added greatly to the characters and the setting. I always was invested in the conversations and small side stories going on throughout the facilities various terminals. Some were deep whereas others were simply people having fun in the workplace. I played in the original Russian audio with English subtitles and highly suggest others to do so as well, the deliveries certainly have more gravitas and it makes certain points in the game more memorable.Overall I think it's worth the buy and one that I recommend to anyone looking for a new setting to venture into and explore."

This is one of the most unique games I've had the pleasure of playing. AAA game that actually lives up to it's promise? Game that looks like the trailer? I can't even remember the last time that happened. The setting is a breath of fresh air, the sound design is spot on, well optimized, interesting lore, and a world you actually want to explore. As others have said, the voice acting is a bit over the top, in a bad way. The main character is unlikable, but nearly everything else is. The studio deserves all the praise it deserves. 9.5/10"
469,Salt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SALTYSPOON27/,7,,0,1.3,February,23,239,0,1,"Honestly, I don't think this is a bad game, it just has some major issues (and a fundamental lack of settings)There is obviously the DRM thing, which is crappy both because the DRM is notorious for causing you issues of convenience and performance in other games, which can to some degree also be seen in AH.The lack of settings: FOV, RTX (Which it's honestly fine without imo), options for voices in another language while subtitled in english or another language, etc.Also the voice acting for english is... bad. So it doubly hurts that you can't change the VA to russian while keeping english subtitles, especially since the game does a good job of having a sort of in game translation of all the russian text in the environment that I think works very well.Gameplay/Story wise, I think it starts off WAY too fast and WAY too convenient. You go from fighting (or stealthing past) a few robots and then get immediately and conveniently thrusted into cutscenes that feel way too snappy and way too quick. The lack of FOV combined with the first area's setting makes the game feel clunky and very claustrophobic. The combat is alright and the setting is nice, but it just isn't for me I suppose.I guess overall I'd say its and alright game that falls into the category of mediocre but beautiful looking."
470,Is that fuckin' BLUE?!,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Reanimosity/,9,,0,6.8,February,24,454,0,1,"This game has a lot going for it. The graphics are amazing, it really made me feel immersed in the world. However, the gameplay isn't anything special. The combat system is alright but it gets boring quickly. There's a stealth mechanic but it isn't very meaningful. The story is mediocre and repetitive, to the point where even the game makes fun of itself for the repeated use of the same slow mechanics required to progress through the storyline. The inventory system is absolutely terrible and is hands down the worst part of the game. The game encourages you to loot everything in sight, but if you do that, you'll find yourself having to go back and forth between your storage, putting in stuff you didn't want to pick up in the first place, and grabbing things you actually did want out of it that were automatically put there because you were out of inventory space. This doesn't sound so bad until you realize that healing items that you pick up will be put into storage if you're out of space, which, if you're low on health and need them right then and there... you're out of luck! There's a perk that increases the inventory space but that doesn't really help. All these issues make for a game that's hard to really enjoy, at least, for long periods of time. I'm only a few hours in and I'm already exhausted from the game.In the end, the game isn't bad. I just don't think it's worth 60 dollars. I'd say 40 dollars at best."

473,tigerbomb,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997842664/,2,,1,18.3,February,23,219,0,1,"***This review is apolitical and spoiler-free.***This was a release I anticipated for a long time, ticking multiple thematic boxes that caught my interest. If you enjoy Bioshock, Prey, Dishonoured, Farcry, or other ""open world"" shooter/RPGs you will probably enjoy this game. Completed playthrough in 18ish hours, exploring maybe 75-80% of the game.THE GOOD:-The graphics are AMAZING, and the engine is well optimised: I am running a mid-range gaming PC (2070 super) and am running it on ULTRA at 60fps.-The world is beautiful: the art direction is absolutely spectacular. The soviet iconography is well designed, the landscape captivating, character models look amazing and are well animated.- The sound design and music are fantastic: Mick Gordon works some of his magic (don't expect DOOM level soundtrack), while real world influence comes in the form of Soviet marches, synth-pop, and classical pieces. Big part of the world-building.-Game-play is a standard RPG-shooter, with some platforming, as well as some interesting puzzles. They are not mind-blowing, nor particularly difficult, but the game felt fresh.-In my entire playthrough (from release day) I encountered NO BUGS, and only had to re-load once, as a result of getting stuck while crouched and getting hung up on the environment (frustrating, but minor).THE BAD:-The voice acting and lines are ATROCIOUS. I started playing the game with native English audio, and it was so bad it detracted from the game. Specifically the acting of  the protagonist. His quips are so bad that I switched the dialogue to Russian halfway through the game, while keeping English subtitles/text, in an effort to stop him from distracting me from the rest of the game. Having the Russian voice audio helped with immersion imo.-Combat isn't particularly difficult, nor engaging (normal difficulty). Many enemies are slower than you, making it easy to kill them from afar, or while backing away. The faster enemies are easily beaten by circle strafing. You are never in short supply of healing, making it easy to win by attrition. Scanning enemies to reveal their weaknesses is slow, and difficult to to do in the fights where it really counts.-Besides crouching to move up behind enemies, there is no stealth system, despite there being a system for stealth kills.-Re-playability isn't great: it is an ""open world"" that you are railroaded through, with multiple endings. I did not see a reason to replay it for the ending I did not get, as it does not add anything additional in terms of game-play-The endings are anti-climatic, and left me feeling disappointed.THE UGLY:-The crafting system is rather banal. Collect loot by killing enemies, or by running around the environment and holding F to loot. It is not inspired, and looting is a chore. Modified weapons look like they're cobbled from trash (technically are), and are out of place in the world.-Weapons don't *feel* good. Some of the melee weapons are nice, but the firearms have no real oomph. The AK in particular sounds nothing like one. Sad.-The ""open world"" is a pain in the ass most of the time. Travel through it is slow, and enemies are an annoyance more than a danger.-The story is meandering and not well fleshed out. It is told through character interactions, as well as found data (recordings and emails). Other games, such as Prey, did this perfectly. Atomic Heart, not so much-Most characters have the personality of a rock.-The menus are quirky, and need refinement. Mousing over something does not display any information about that item.TLDR:A beautiful game that is well-optimised, with an amazing world, game-play that isn't particularly challenging, an interesting story that suffers from poor story telling, terrible voice acting, and some quality of life features that are missing/could be improved on. I would recommend it if you enjoy the games mentioned at the beginning of the review. 8/10"

Unfortunately, the endless puzzles get in the way of the story and action, preventing that rare feeling of adrenaline felt from similar FPS games like Bioshock or Prey. In addition, there are so many cameras with countless repair bots that the accomplishment of destroying a legion of enemies becomes almost pointless because they all come back to life in a matter of seconds. Do you need to run all the time? Do you need to stay hidden like a stealth assassin all the time? This is supposed to be an explosive action game but with the mechanics it's not.

The developers did a fantastic job with the resources they had. Weapon and upgrade variety is in depth but not crazy, enemy variety is a healthy amount imo, the scenery/level design is gorgeous, and honestly the writing grew on me about halfway through (which means yes i do like the main character way more now than at the beginning).

Best game i have played since witcher 3. although, i didnt play many till the end.Mostly because its more or less compressed - there are no distractions, only a couple non-mandatory puzzle dungeons you get in for better equipment. on middle difficulty or lower, i think you can manage without getting into these. the amount of puzzles surpised me, but they are not hard to do, although there is no handholding in these either.

However, this gets better the more you play and even has some explanations in-game. You end up finding its charm and some dialogues are quite hilarious, not everything has to be serious!

508,Tullovis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tullovis/,3,,1,39.9,February,23,214,0,1,"Im not gonna lie, I initially thought this game was gonna have loads of jank just like any other large scale open world rpg thats come out in the last 5 years, but boy was I wrong. I was met with beautiful visuals, an extraordinary soundtrack, some of the best first person combat and boss fights I've seen in a while and a very well written and cryptic story. I loved this game from start to finish and will probably be playing it over and over again and even getting all the achievements (which is not something I normally do). However, I do have a few small gripes, and I mean small. For one, as great as the combat is, I found myself getting stuck and pinned against walls a handful of times but even with that I was able to use my mass telekinesis to get the enemies out of my face so I could move to more open space, but it did get pretty annoying and stressful sometimes. As far as ""janky gameplay"" goes thats about it, everything else I have to say is just pure opinion and quality of life changes I'd love to see added to the game. 1) Please add the ability to place waypoints on the map, its not that big of a deal but it would make things a lot more simple so that I'm not opening and closing the map 50 times before I reach my destination so that I know I'm going the right way :)2) I'd love to see this game get a New Game + added in, especially if each ng+ had more and or buffed enemies to spice things up and keep the game infinitely replayable, I can't tell you how much time I'd spend on the game if something like that was added.3) Another mode I'd be hyped for is a boss rush of some kind. The boss fights in this game are absolutely amazing and being able to fight each of them one after the other or even at the same time would be insane and totally awesome. Even something like boss fight time trials would be sweet. This game has so much to offer and such a rich and unforgiving world to throw its players into, and the devs really seem to care about their players. I'm absolutely in love with this game and can't wait to see where Mundfish takes us. Thank you so much for giving me this experience. <3"

Every time he opens his mouth the game loses a little bit of charm.Which is what i thought until i got to the end of the game and realized it was intentional. If you can ignore the protagonist the rest is absolute gold. A worthy world that ranks with Bioshock and Prey in creating an immersive sim worth experiencing.

I absolutely want to experience everything this game has to offer, and can't wait to do so...however, for PC gamers, this game desperately needs a patch to fix the keybinds. As it is, pushing W for forward causes the player to permanently sprint. There is no jog speed, and definitely no Walk key. Cyberpunk 2077 devs patched a walk key bind in and it absolutely makes strolling through the eye candy of that game a badly needed want for the eye candy of this one.Also needs a proper Sprint key bind ability, and ability to remap the End Conversation key (which is hard-bound to Q).Until the devs release a patch to fix this, I will not be playing the game any further, as it forces me to rush through quiet, slow ambient areas, and unless I'm fighting robots, I def do not want to rush through this beautiful game. (I played to the very first Save Room you find, and stopped there.)But for console gamers who have the stick ability to slow walk...Get this game now! It completely sucked me into it's world just from experiencing the hour long intro level!

But in the end of a day, I did enjoy the game a lot.So why the negative review? Frankly speaking, it doesn't give a good first impression. The opening segment is too damn long, it drags you around for God knows how much time just to show you the worldbuilding. I admit, it's amazing, the graphics of it are amazing but guys, I've bought the game to shoot things not to watch an interactive benchmark.And speaking of shooting things, I feel like Mundfish tried their best to make the ""shooting"" part at the beginning unfun as hard as they could.First of all in my opinion, weapons and abilities are a bit too nerfed at the beginning, hitting 1 mob robot with a hammer like a million times to destroy it sucks fun out of the game for me. Maybe I'm picky here but honestly there are more creative ways to make the game more challenging in this aspect than just making your enemies bullet (hammer?) sponges, especially when you have all those cool robots around that could show their abilities in more various ways.The game has also a weird fetish for lackluster puzzles and platform segments. Some of those are creative but most of them are a boring chore that just slow your progress down.The open world segments were also just bad. They lacked content to keep me interested in it as a player, I wouldn't mind if they didn't even exist.Voice directing sucks. I've played in both of my languages and in both of versions it felt like the voice actors (talented imo) had to think up how they should perform just from the lines they were reading.Phew that's a lot of complaints, so lemme get to the positives real quickly.As I stated before, graphics and worldbuilding are amazing. In connection with the soundtrack (that absolutely slaps and nails it) they create a great atmosphere of alternative Soviet reality.The story is decent and that is enough to make me interested to finish the game.If you improve your weapons, the shooting is actually fun. It has been too long since I've played a decent slow-paced FPS singleplayer game, so thank you for that. So in short, the game didn't really lift the potential it had but was enjoyable netherless. I have faith that Mundfish will address the issues in (hopefully) next production, with all the love they've poured into this game I'm sure they will make something even better next time.PS.

530,winterfreezer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rayneofblood/,4,,1,27.0,February,21,286,0,1,"Atomic Heart must be one of the coolest games i played in recent memory. A solid first person action RPG that delivers a weird and dangerous soviet era playground full of deadly robots & mutants and comparing it to games like BioShock is something one will naturally do. I’ve been following the game’s development for years now and at one point i even doubted it would see the light of day at all but here we are. It’s not a perfect product and there are some issues but after a rather slow start and once you crafted some nice weapons and have upgraded them you start to have fun very quickly in my opinion. This is the first game by Mundfish and from the second the opening prologue starts you can see the love and details they put into this world immediately. One of the highlights is definitely the upgrade machine „Nora“ who want’s to have sex with you for some reason and seems to be horny all the time. And yes, the twins are….nice too haha. It’s a fantastic game and was worth the price for me. It took me a little over 27 hours to complete the story on normal difficulty. The side content in it's open world next to the main missions consist of testing grounds that are underground puzzle laboratories  where you can find blueprints to unlock upgrades for your arsenal of weapons. And yes there’s a talking glove that kind of never shuts up but that’s ok, and i admit i kind of liked it. He can also be upgraded at „Nora“ to give your elemental powers that extra kick. I’m not going to talk about everything you can do and see in Atomic Heart but i do highly recommend this game not only for the love that was put into it but also for the outstanding collection of licensed music and composed tracks by legends like Mick Gordon which make some of the Boss fights and combat scenes absolutely kick ass. 9/10"

A smaller studio comes in and does everything the mainstream are trying to do with singleplayer FPS but far better and somehow the critics are saying it's an average game.This game oozes originality; from the story, the setting, the game-play mechanics, the puzzle features and it's overall style, it's just so unique but still feels familiar enough for any casual FPS player to feel comfortable. There is truly no other game like this on the market. This game has definite influences of Prey, Bioshock and many others, but it manages to take influence from others whilst still be incredibly original. I'd recommend this game at full price. Just buy it and see for yourself."
534,Jimmy Lee Rawhide,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimmyleerawhide/,6,,1,34.8,February,22,80,0,1,"After watching initial reviews of Atomic Heart, I was highly skeptical of it. For context, I'm a huge fan of immersive sims like Bioshock and Prey and games that allow a lot of variation in play styles. I am currently about 5 hours into this game and I am so glad that I took the leap and bought it. The world feels super unique and interesting despite resembling the games that inspired it. It feels like a continuation of the retro tech vibe of games like Bioshock or Fallout, but with its own unique spin. The gameplay is nothing groundbreaking, but the level of customization of weapons and abilities makes it work just enough to accommodate exploring this awesome, detailed world. It's best to go into it understanding that it is not a AAA game, which makes it a little rough around the edges at times, however, it doesn't detract from the overall experience. It lands shockingly well for how ambitious this game is. The main downside is that the protagonist is quippy and completely insufferable. With that said, if you have any curiosity about this game, I recommend giving it a try."

539,Jowjack,https://steamcommunity.com/id/furtehlulz/,2,,1,34.3,March,2,90,0,1,A very good game in my opinion. It opens with a very scenic opening that shows you the kind of culture of the world your character is in and allows you to walk around and explore it... at least up until the robots destroy everything in which case at that point everyone's dead so yeah.... make sure you look around before that happens.There's multiple enemies and various ways to combat those enemies as well as a selection of weapons to pick and choose from and pick your choices well because each enemy has it's own weakness. There are some stealth options allowing you to crouch walk behind an enemy and preform a sneak attack which brings up a prompt where you have to mash a certain key on your keyboard in order to be successful in a take down which is annoying to deal with since nobody likes abusing their keyboard. The graphics are very good and I have only encountered two glitches/bugs and one crash during my entire play through of the game which is very good.The game has overcome the problem of never having anything to shoot at in an area you're returning to because you've already killed all the enemies by implementing a repair system that allows drones to repair destroyed robots which adds a more challenging level to the player particularly if you have an objective to complete in the area. There are a number of ways to deal with this by either figuring out how to disable the HAWK rendering all robots in that area to be put in stand by mode for a time or by destroying all robots and all drones to the point where it would take some time to reconstruct the drones and for the drones to then repair all the robots you've destroyed.One thing I really like is how they've put a lot of thought into their puzzles and how they not all the same. There are different locks and different puzzles and they continue to change throughout the game so that they remain interesting instead of becoming a bore to deal with. The developers came up with funny dialogue about the character hating locks that plays though out the game obviously trolling players that hate puzzles and such things.The developers have also obviously thought about how big the map is and as such put in cars so that you don't have to walk everywhere and put in optional testing grounds that you can complete to receive different blueprints and attachments for your various guns.The pros: The game delivered what it promised (Minimum of 30 hours of game play)Good graphicsDiverse ways to play and range of weaponsVery few bugs/glitchesDifferent puzzles that continue to challenge you throughout the gameThe cons:I'm not really a fan of mashing a key on my keyboard repeatedly in rapid succession in order to disable a robot that I've already gone to the bother to sneak up on.Score: 90/100

548,Yandere Snake,https://steamcommunity.com/id/YandereSnakeZero/,3,,1,19.5,March,5,"2,613",1,1,"Atomic Heart, a game that's been developed and conceptualised as far back as 2010 with earliest concept materials, set in a soviet atom-punk-like retro-futuristic setting where Soviet Union became a world leader in robotics. Premise good on paper, in-line with soviet science-fiction works of the time, and a pretty cool and underused setting in general. And we finally have a game in it. So, where do we begin?The plot is there, and it is very reminiscent of original Bioshock (as is the entire game, but we'll get to that). But the most important things is - robotics are amazing, until they aren't and things go awry. The main problem with the plot is its delivery, and the way it is delivered. Sometimes it looks like the developers had huge ambitions that had to be cut down more or less obvious reasons like gameplay pacing. The game tries to make up for that with opening up the world, and giving you a  chatty companion and almost too much dialogue that sometimes can get cut off if you walk through an area too quickly or happen to have an encounter. But if you can live with that (I know I can, it was kinda hilarious at times though) then you still get terminals in the game world that give you way more background to the events. Overall, it was pretty good and a solid ride, but not without its own issues.I have to give it a separate paragraph, because the world is full of sounds and music for your ears to enjoy, provided you stop and listen for a while instead of bum-rushing through the entire thing like ""I just wanna get it out of my backlog already"". The whirring of the machines, the ambient music in more or less desolate places, the sounds of machinery, the impact sounds - they're carefully done and very enjoyable. Don't feel too powerful, I'd say perfectly accurately depicting their power...maybe except for the KS-23. It's like dev team spent actual time on making sure things sound as they should. And then topped it off with music that will give a huge nostalgia trip for anyone growing up in former Soviet Bloc countries during and after the collapse of USSR, hitting you with likes of Alla Pugacheva and Zemlyane, which might not vibe with younger audiences, but for people born during and right after the collapse would feel like grandma's home during a summer vacation. However there's also entire remixed soundtrack with some of those songs being brought more...up to date, let's call it. And they sound stupid good. It's hard to go back to originals after you hear how good of a job Geoffrey Day did. Same goes for combat pieces done by Mick Gordon, you feel like you absolutely slap. Zero complaints here....until we get to the English dubbing. It's , if not a bit cringe to hear at times. So unless you're a masochist like me and/or want to hear random bits of dialogue around you, be it announcements or dead corpses talking, do yourself a favour and switch to either your own language since dubbing quality is generally good, or play it in line with the setting. Because English dub feels like the developers tried to end this spectacle of audiovisual goodness with a front flip and ended up smacking their face against the floor.The game looks gorgeous, even without RTX (which will be added in a later update), and runs way better than you'd expect out of something looking like that. DLSS is there to help your performance at higher resolutions, but me and my rig managed to run it at 4K, max settings, DLSS set to Quality, and rarely get dips below 80 FPS, let alone 60. It's a smooth and great looking experience, even with the infamous Denuvo being implemented.Facility 3826 is a rather massive location...with most interesting bits of it being underground. Most of the time spent outside will be either random looting for resources or looking for a way to go underground to reach another objective or a testing ground to get your weapon upgrades. It's basically a lot of room you're led around in a linear manner until the end, and only serves as means of commute with no fast travel. This game suffers from the same issue Metro Exodus had, as the closest example - huge open world stuffed into a game with a linear progression, and underdelivering in terms of things to do in said world. You don't even get back to locations once visited, nor game gives you any incentive too. Just get everything done, move on, rinse and repeat until the end of the game.Let's get to the meat and veggies - gameplay. I have to make a comparison to Bioshock here again, because it's that, but with more resource management in terms of upgrading yourself and your weapons (provided you craft them first). Though honestly I can't see the reason why crafting of weapons exists in the game in the first place, it feels like such an afterthought to give players incentive to look around and loot things, but it feels so half-baked that it could be totally cut out. Upgrading itself is fine, but I can hardly warrant having this many kinds of resources for all these weapons and upgrades in order to fulfill basic requirements. I feel like the game would do fine without that, or even cutting it down a bit to just include upgrades and ammo crafting. The biggest saving grace however is the fact that any resources you pour into a certain upgrade path are fully refunded to you, should you pick a different upgrade for the same part of the weapon.The gameplay loop - it's good. Gunplay seems fine, it's not Call of Duty or Battlefield and it's not a main focus, so I can say it is decent, even if weapons fall flat in terms of damage department at first (especially KS-23 shotgun), but as you progress they will get better. Your main tools of trade will be melee weapons, and you've got a decent variety of them - so you'll find your favourite. The enemies even suffer visual damage as fighting, they can be frozen in place with your Polymer mods, slowed down with a shock, and you can combine your skills to deal additional damage. All of them have strong spots and weaknesses that warrant using different weapons or approaches on them. But gameplay itself often boils down to kill ♥♥♥♥, move to new area, kill ♥♥♥♥, rinse and repeat, broken up by occasional lock to bypass with a simple logic game, or an environmental puzzle to solve. These are actually fun and don't overstay their welcome, unlike your slutty upgrade vendor that you have to deal with for the entirety of starting area - it's a fun joke that should be ended sooner, but thankfully it doesn't last too long.But to get to that gameplay you have to get between the zones on the map, and you won't do that on foot, right? Too bad the implementation of cars in this game sucks ass. They feel like cardboard boxes on wheels, break way too easily, their physics seem quirky at best, and you can get randomly launched in the air upon driving over certain enemies, bringing me all the way back to the seesaw glitch in GTA4.Atomic Heart is a game, one surrounded by controversies which I don't want to go into in this review, and is a game of some problems. But it's decent. It's something I recommend playing if you're a Bioshock fan and can deal with a few shortcomings and treat it primarily as a linear experience. Because it's an experience alright. I personally enjoyed this game, and if you want a numerical rating from me..."

I'll conditionally change it to thumbs up, but the taste is still sour about still unfixed kb/m issues and their pathetic groveling at the altar of SJWs. I had lots of fun and I might consider DLCs in the future, so it feels wrong to give it a negative review.Anyway, the good things:- IMHO excellent engine optimization overall; the game could in most areas cap 120hz and 144hz easily, even without DLSS; with DLSS you can take it for granted; also plenty of options to adjust the performance for owners of weaker GPUs- absolutely badass OST- superb stylization, attention to details good logical progress across the game, wtf world- decent amount weapons and ""powers"" to use; you can melee enjoyably most/all of the game as well- sexy robots (later)- bdsm horny fridge, pity not so many lines from herthe mediocre:- game is too easy, even on the ""armageddon"" difficulty- related to the above - game pacing is out of whack - MC becomes overpowered too fast too quickly - especially if you diligently loot stuff- some ""powers"" really need a nerfstick (or rather a nerfMACE)- people are experiencing a lot of bugs; achievements are still somewhat brokenthe ugly:- developers (whether themselves or forced by the publisher) sacrificed themselves on the alter of SJW ""muh rassissmuss"" censorship only because few imbeciles from retardera/twatter/pcgamer complained about few frames in one of Nu Pogodi episodes- KB/M support - for a fps - is a catastrophe ; a lot of keys are hardcoded (menu/inventory, iteraction, QTE, swim up/down, cartridge swapping, car left/right), some other are both hardcoded and bugged (rebinding doesn't work - weapon cycling, car forward/backward) - hardware-level rebindable keyboard recommended/mandatory- Filatova - a blatant western AAA-like product - hair colored side shaved androgynous wahmen:  ; makes you wonder if it was Mundfish's original vision or FI's pressure at some point in development- ""crispy critters"" ? what the ♥♥♥♥ ? just say ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hell"" or something similar- what is this ludicrous censorship and another androgynous ESG score-boosting catastrophe ?"

I like that they let you disassemble weapons and refund your polymer glove upgrades so you can experiment with other builds. I don't like the main character. He complains nonstop and every other word out of his mouth is ♥♥♥♥ or ♥♥♥♥. Having your protagonist complain about having to do fetch quests isn't really clever.

Though the protagonists dialogue isn't for everyone, I find it quite funny at times. The action is quite fun, and the weapons though limited are still fun and entertaining. The skills are quite interesting and the abilities the player can use have applications. There is a lot that can be done in the game and I'm interested in finishing the game. The enemies are not too tough but still provide a good challenge and the first boss I came across (the HOG 7 if I recall) took me a bit to figure out how to handle it properly.The writing isn't the best but it is still passable and interesting, with the dialogue sometimes not being the best. But that is really my only complaint with the game so far, with everything else being quite enjoyable. Some of the human characters are interesting and the conflict seems interesting as well. To me my favorite part is the atmosphere of and the environment with it being science fiction and soviet. A lot of little details were crammed in there and it really adds to the aesthetic of the world. The worldbuilding, though not perfect, is still good.  So far, with 8 hours in the game, I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10. I want to finish the game first and will update my review after I finish it, but for right now, this game surpasses what I was expecting when I started following the game back in 2017"
576,Silentguy_99,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Silentguy_99/,4,,1,42.1,February,21,95,0,1,"So far having a great time. Taking it slow and exploring every nook and cranny. Totally feels like the successor to Bioshock and it captures that hyper-advanced, yet old and surrealist 1950s sci-fi vibe. Weapons feel balanced and responsive, but I never felt like an unstoppable monster. I can't speak for late-game yet, but despite scrounging for resources and upgrades, I never felt like combat became trivial but it was never so overwhelmingly hard that I became frustrated. All in all I would recommend this game and I look forward to playing it more.Also (and it sucks that I even have to state this today) a big pro that I've noticed so far is that despite playing this on day 1, there are very few bugs/glitches that I've run into and none of them are so egregious as to make the game unplayable. I also haven't noticed any major framerate dips. Everything has managed to stay 60FPS+ at 1440p"

Appreciate the design choice that recycling items and switching skills give 100% resources back, to allow for experimentation without losing resources. My one complaint is the key binds. If you're not a standard WASD player you're screwed when it comes to driving since not all the functions change when changing the keybinds (like left and right turn). Also cannot have move forward and accelerate as they same key unless its the default W key. Had to find the local settings files and change it there, instead of in-game settings. Hopefully something that'll get patched. 4.7 out 5 for me."

The game has a known and persistent issue with you getting stuck in the terrain and having to reload. I just completed one of the games most annoying open world passages (a long bridge) which takes a long ass time and involves a whole lot of enemies, without a single save point - only to get stuck by a bug in the end and have to reload from the beginning. Which I won't - uninstalled it instead because it's just not worth it."

Soundtrack is great, they nailed the atmosphere with a really interesting world as well. Weapons and powers feel fun to use, and the controls/game itself are well optimized. The only complaints I have would be that the story feels a bit weak, and the main character is not very likable. I suspect maybe his dialogue seems a bit off, as it may directly translated? I don't know unfortunately. I've seen lots of people also complain about the low FOV but it doesn't bother me too much, and Mundfish already announced that they are working on a hotfix for it by adding an option. All in all, decent game."

Largest problem is that the side content you can do tells what completing it will unlock and I saw absolutely nothing I would value or use AND I was justified since I maxed out character upgrades and 3 ability trees while only playing the main story.I saw side content as worthless when compared to side content in other games. Why are there thermal scopes? You're usually in melee range of everything that attacks you and it's always daytime."

So much dense worldbuilding, enemy design, and playstyle creativity in this game. Extremely unapologetic about its grittiness and dark tones. The only wrinkle is that the characters have little-to-no-depth but that never takes from the absolutely grand scale of the world as a whole. I'm blown away by the quality and scales in all other aspects (from music, to frenetic gameplay, depth of the levels, and all the various puzzles too.)"
608,Vindaxius,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091684090/,2,,1,28.2,February,23,292,0,1,"Full disclosure - I originally only bought this game because Mick Gordon made the music and I want that man synthesized into liquid sound and hooked up directly to my veins.That said, this is a really great game!  It's clear from every little detail of the game (gorgeous backdrops/scenery, gritty dystopian destruction, sharp combat, unique and interesting characters) that the developers really cared about shipping their exact vision for the game.  It mixes lighthearted, funny, and irreverent scenes into the gameplay to even out the pacing of the game without detracting from the darkness of the dystopian story or the danger that every enemy presents to the player.The behavior of all the characters just feels very believable.  A lot of games will accidentally break immersion by having all the members of the cast be just a little too obsessed with the protagonist.  Atomic Heart doesn't fall into that trap.  Instead, the only people that know who you are are the ones who obviously would (direct supervisor etc).Everyone else treats you as just another passer-by in their lives until you build a rapport with them.  This isn't even something that I typically look for in a game but it was just so... refreshingly immersive.Gameplay-wise I'm loving it.  Every enemy can absolutely knock your teeth out if you're not careful, so each encounter becomes a dance of combat.  You have a quick-dash move to dodge out of the way and enemies will distinctly telegraph their attacks so, once you're familiar, you can quickly read the room and know where you don't want to be in the next half-second.The weapons follow a scavenge-to-upgrade/craft path with an array of melee and ranged weapons, plus a unique twist on scavenging: using your gizmos to vacuum useful items out of every nearby cupboard, corpse, and shelf so you can scratch that itch to fish for every little secret/useful item without pulling you out of the immersion of the game.  Just one of many great little details that show how much thought went into the pacing and feel of this game."

Dialogue is extremely poorly paced, overlaps with Audio/Voice logs, and feels very out of place coming from the main character. The world is interesting, but the restrictively low F.O.V. doesn't actually let you take a good look at anything. It's like this game (within the first two hours I've played) heard the tried-and-true design philosophy of, ""Show, don't tell,"" and decided to do the complete polar opposite.I will keep on playing it (and may come back and redo this review afterward), but you might be able to enjoy this game more by just watching a stream of it instead of buying and playing it yourself."

Graphics were amazing at 4k and ran really smooth on a 2080ti. Some issues with getting stuck in the environment but nothing too frustrating. Story was super interesting and the puzzles were a fun break from the gun portions. Hoping for a sequel for sure."
618,ALL CAPS,https://steamcommunity.com/id/chancetofreeze/,4,,0,15.1,March,24,310,0,1,"A 5/10 at the absolute highest.  Generally speaking the game feels very good to play. The experience of piloting your character is tight and responsive (minus a few times I got stuck in an object by jumping too much), the art direction and level design are very creative and super tight, and the sound (both diegetic and non) does an excellent job building immersion and setting the mood of the scene appropriately -- also the soundtrack slaps, worth listening to on its own.  An example of where the game did things correctly can be found in the horror sections. In many of these very tense, slow, and methodical areas (with little or no combat) the devs demonstrate true mastery of the tenets of horror by perfectly combining the elements I mentioned previously together with excellent pacing to create some very tense dark and even scary environments and gameplay. These sections are so good in fact that I can't help but wonder whether this used to be a genuine horror game before the Atomic Heart you see now was created. Amazingly, the rest of the game is so bad it manages to ruin this base; a few things stand out as particularly egregious: the main character, the ending, and the open world.  Without giving spoilers I can say that the ending does not resolve a single plot point and feels very tacked on which together with the relatively weak plot leaves the strong central concept of the game feeling wasted on such mediocrity. The plot itself is also very predictable and cliché. Next, the open world. Let me just be clear: this game does not need to be open world. It works far better as a linear horror/immersive sim. The addition of open world sections just makes the game feel more tedious and adds hours for no payoff. This is not Talos I lobby style open world this is an attempt to be Far Cry and it fails horrendously. There are way too many enemies, travel time is slow and boring on foot and clunky in a car, and other than hunting for weapon mods the open world areas don't actually serve any purpose and don't impact the story progression at all. The only explanation I can come up with for those sections being in the game is some kind of focus group requirement: ""must have open world.""  Finally, the worst thing of all: the main character. He is the most unlikable, idiotic, and obnoxious character I have ever seen in any piece of media bar none; that he's so stupid is insulting to the audience, and to make things worse he has a talking glove that drops massive exposition bombs on you periodically -- completely destroying any chance that the you have to think for yourself even a single time. Every puzzle is explained to you in detail, every chance they get the talking glove explains what the current objective is and how to do it and where to go and ""oh, don't forget to do X and Y and Z."" It's infuriating! The game wants to be an immersive sim so badly but it's not possible to immerse yourself in a character written this poorly, and especially not one that talks as much as he does. Imagine if the hacker in System Shock narrated the entire game to you while you played: ya, it's really that bad. Overall, I do not recommend this game -- at least not at full price."
619,HattedSandwich,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CtrlAltDstry/,2,,1,27.1,February,23,268,0,1,"I'm almost twenty hours in and still enjoying the game alot. One thing I want to commend is the attention to detail with weapons. Round in the chamber with a partially full magazine? Protagonist conducts a tactical reload and retains the partial magazine instead of dropping it! Weapon is dry? Protagonist inserts a full magazine and racks the slide or charging handle. Want to have a round in the chamber and a full magazine? Reload an AK with a full magazine a second time, and you'll get 31 rounds (1 chambered) instead of just 30. Excellent, excellent attention to detail. Someone clearly knew what they were doing and I love it. That kind of autistic artistic attention is everywhere in this gameFew hours in so far, loving the game. It has that unique kind of European weirdness that you get in games like Cryostasis, STALKER, and Darkwood. Having said that, the gameplay is incredibly smooth and the engine is very stable. I'm impressed with the day-one performance, especially considering some of the garbage that's come out lately.The game does remind me of Bioshock in that your character gets thrust into a utopian-dystopic world, and has to adjust to a very strange and weird society. There are RPG systems integrated into a first person shooter format. The world is fascinating, with audio logs and great environmental storytelling that flesh out the plot and the lore. The combat has some great meat and heft to it, with great animations and dismemberment. The dodge and melee are engaging, and I usually am not a fan of first person cleaver simulators (though I really liked Darktide, too).Two suggestions I have for anyone wanting to get the most out of their experience: goto the game's start menu and navigate to audio. Turn on english subtitles. Goto the gameplay menu and choose Russian audio for the spoken language. The immersion is greatly helped by this change.I also suggest downloading Flawless Widescreen for 21:9 users. Makes adjusting the FOV in real time a cinch. Devs should have included a FOV slider from the get go, but oh well.I personally don't care about the political gripes some people have with the game. Games, like film, can be works of art even when they come from places where the governing body is AIDS."

The only downsides I'd say it had as the melee combat and some of the bugs that I encountered within the game. The bugs weren't gamebreaking, so they weren't that terrible to play with. The Melee Combat I feel needs to have a better hit scan as well as depending on the weapon you should have more distance to fight from. The special abilities for the melee weapons were nicely done. I really enjoyed the lore and how you could slowly piece together the lore just by listening to dialogue. Overall I'd rate the game 9/10 and I can't wait to see what the DLCs are going to be like."

Together with his  robotic glove/ full time nurse they go on a magical adventure fighting robots in a tour of the local science institute where unfortunately, due to the abundance of never ending robots P-3 experiences sensory overload which make him big mad. This I thought was particularly effective as a plot device as I began to feel rage to at the sheer amount of enemies I had to fight at once and to add even more realism, as I was playing a handicapped person, could not fight back properly and was constantly pushed over by the robots and other assorted bullies. I felt completely powerless in these situations and could only relate even more with P-3 when he could only cry ''crispy critters!'' in response to the bullying. As for the story it felt realistic to my character as P-3 could not keep up with events as they were unfolding, rather, P-3 would figure it out long after I, the player, had (like 3 or 4 hours after, maybe more). Yet, this only served to flesh out P-3 ever more as because he could not match the intellect of his peers I estimate this is why he feels he needs to constantly belittle his glove, the few friendly robots in the science and the people closest to him. Overall Atomic Heart is a realistic and grounded tale of the struggles mentally handicapped soldiers with rage issues must persevere every day."

Prey (2017) was really good, and better than this in some areas, but the PC version of that game is a mess, and for whatever reason, Arkane never went back and fixed its major issues.During a pretty rough time for PC gamers wanting good performance out of their games, we've been hit with a lot of poorly optimized releases:Thankfully, Atomic Heart runs really well, and the only real issue I've found with its settings is that there's no FoV slider, and the default FoV is a measly 80° horizontal. If you want to change this, you'll have to use , but it's very easy to set up.The main character is probably the game's weakest point. Most of the time he's rude to everybody for seemingly no reason, but at other points, especially later into the game, he actually becomes somewhat likable for brief moments. It's really weird.The other weak point is that combat encounters honestly don't last long enough. The enemies are very easy to deal, and not enough waves of them are thrown at you at a time.

I've already finished it in 20 hours, some bugs, including one that kept me out of a dungeon. Game is kind of predictable, the acting is real cheesy, the 'propoganda' is so over the top its comical, and I think thats the point. A great example is ""EVERYONE WILL BE HAPPIER AND LIVE IN LUXURY, NOW THAT THE USSR IS ON TOP"". The joke being of course that the USSR collapsed, and was horrible for its people, but if it HAD succeeded, well then... Ya know. But the music is a 10/10, its perfect, if only the rest of the game was a bit better. And there's nothing WRONG with it, it just.. was kinda Okay.

I want to say I like it more than Prey but will hold out. Atmosphere is very Bioshock. Which I love. It has a lot of good things going for it. I hardly use guns because the melee is actually quite good. Similar to Dying Light/Dead Island and the FPS game play feels great. No crashes, runs very well.Audio mixing could be better."

The combat is great, the story so far is intriguing and the world is beautiful. There is a wide variety of enemies to fight with many different attacks to dodge and weapon customisation is in depth and fantastic. A small amount of almost unnoticeable bugs are rarely present that do not hinder the game experience. I highly recommend this game to many people who enjoy fast pace games with strategy involved."

Did you hire the Writers from ""Velma"" to craft banter!? I swear protagonists these days directed by boomer CEOs who are so priveledged and out of touch that they think their ignorant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ world view on what younger people are like is reality - Like they legit think this soft, knuckledragging ♥♥♥♥♥ of a protagonist is someone we want to emulate. THE DIALOGUE IN THIS MAKES THE PROTAGONIST FROM FORSPOKEN LOOK LIKE MR. RODGERS. None of it furthers the world, character, or aesthetic. Everything he says is negative and degrading. He's a prick to your ai companion, and the babbling between the two of you NEVER ends. Most of his dialogue is just nasty for the sake of being nasty, as if it's likeable. I even changed it to Russian to hopefully take the edge off of him but now I just hear angry Russian whining in my ears while trying to play a videogame, that even in a foreign language can't hide the unmistakable flavor of cringey voice acting and unneeded dialogue.The combat was dull. It tried to teach me to avoid special attacks with a dash, but all you have to do is walk in circles and the robots keep turning at you instead of attacking. Robots all have the same head- that's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lazy. The giant robot cinematics are all in 20fps while the rest of the game around it runs full frames. Abilities feel unimpactful and tedious to use.Look I really want to go into more detail about the lack of soul in this game - the shoddy aesthetic propped up by cherrypicked clips in their advertising that make it look more cohesive and fleshed out than it is - the endless, incessant dialogue seemingly written to mimic angsty, spoiled rich kids - The linear, basic gameplay wrapped in a half-assed attempt at worldbuilding. The wholly PUNCHABLE protagonist... but the taste of this ♥♥♥♥ isn't out of my mouth yet. Honestly, I just want my money back - I don't want to spend another second of my life on this game. This game is hot garbage.(Steam says I played 90min, but claims 2hr of gametime on the refund page. Lets see if they decide to round up 1.5hrs to 2 and keep my money. Would NOT surprise me.)"
659,Kael,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kaelthai/,2,,1,21.6,February,27,539,0,1,Atomic Heart is an interesting game. The setting is nicely fleshed out and very different from other dystopian games. There are some fairly large cons however. See summary below!Pros - Combat is fun - Puzzle areas were good for the most part- Very good graphics and ran well on my machine.- Free respecs to try any weapon/skill buildCons- English VA is terrible- Open world was not that fun. I found myself skipping all open world combat just to get to the next story or puzzle area in the mid to late game.Still worth recommending if you know about these downsides. If you're a Bioshock fan I'd definitely give this a shot.

Ignoring all the stupid politics and cancel culture calling for this game to be removed- I LOVE the gameplay! Its like dying light crossed with fallout, bioshock, and cyberpunk!

I have no run into any game breaking bugs (or any for that matter).

Especially if you have grown up in a former soviet country, there is much nostalgia to be experienced here. The OST pretty much always achieves its goal in what it sets out to do. Eerie tracks for lonely laboratory halls. Arguably half of the excitement you feel fighting a boss in this game can be solely put on the music and its dynamic transitions.The art direction is downright inspired. It easily carves out it's own unique look and despite being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy it somehow appears realistic and low key. It's like a soviet industrial solarpunk nightmare in all the best ways you could imagine. I have only prase for the art direction.The gameplay is fun and especially as you reach lategame allows you to unlock your inner tech god and feel incredibly powerful. I have to say I played this game on normal and it was really easy for the most part. I would even go so far as to say that the combat while being above average isn't anything too exciting or even worth mentioning. It isn't where the game is its strongest.. I had to really hold back during the boss fights to not make them end almost instantly. But what it lacks in difficulty it makes up in style and excitement easily. I especially want to praise the well designed bosses. Yes they are too easy in a world where people love to measure boss fights to games like dark souls but I really think looking at it that way is doing the game a disservice. Overall I think it absolutely achieves what it tries to do.The weakest area of this game to me is without question the english localization. In my honest opinion it is just wrong. The biggest problem to me is how it ruins the games tone. Yes the game obviously doesnt take itself completely seriously. But the english dub just goes too far into the b movie science fiction shlock direction for me personally. I played switched to russian audio and i cannot underline how much this game improves using the russian audio. I understand that there is probably a majority of people who would see this as a dealbreaker, but I really recommend even the skeptics among you to try playing it with russian audio and your preferred subtitles.I am probably not great when it comes to judging stories so I won't. If you really care about an intricative narrative with layered characters you will probably be disappointed. But if you are up for a more casual roller coaster ride with fun characters. You are gonna get that. (provided you go with the russian audio imo)Lastly I want to mention what I think this games biggest strength is. It is the meme word ATMOSPHERE. Yes I felt aboslutely absorbed in this world and it was an audio visual marble. I especially want to praise the catchy  dancetracks that played during puzzles in the polygons. The game does stand out especially among many Western games and that makes it worth a visit to me."

If you focus just on the literal 4 story locations, you can probably beat it in around 15 hours, where 5 of those will be just the intro and first facility before you can explore. All of the dungeons were pretty much a joke. you get inside and immediately you find 1/3 chests, then you just have to do two puzzles for the other two and you're done. only a few had combat in them. But they're necessary if you want to mod your guns. Speaking of guns, all of the attachments actually changed your gun visually which was pretty nice, ""faster reload"" wasnt just an animation speedup either, it was a whole new animation.As for the story. Holy ♥♥♥♥ i slept so hard up until the end.Basically. It's doing a Bioshock 1. Utopian society with science powers and all this futuristic tech and nothing absolutely will ever go wrong, what are ""human rights violations"" and ""consequences of my actions""? You're constantly being manipulated by your boss and only the main character is dense enough to not notice that, only being able to speak the same catchphrase and yell expletives at his glove for no reason. And then you find out that surprise, you were ALSO being manipulated by your glove who pulls the rug on the final cutscene and your boss was ACTUALLY telling the truth about your glove being a ♥♥♥♥. It just..came out of nowhere? from what i could tell there were zero indications that your glove was actually going to betray you until it did a minute before the credits rolled. Dialogue's pretty bad at times but i'll blame that on bad direction and not writing. They could've picked a better catch phrase for P-3 though, that ♥♥♥♥ got tiring fast.Anyway, with all that said, this game:Can't really recommend this unless it's at least 50% off."

687,UpTide,https://steamcommunity.com/id/UpTide/,14,1,0,8.3,February,26,328,0,1,"The game has an interesting premise, and interesting visual themes. That said, the gameplay is not particularly fun, nor does it tell its story well. I played through in easy mode--I'm bad with arcade type shooters--and the gameplay is extremely frustrating for me. I'm sure it would be fun if I was much better at fast and snappy action combat.Potential Spoilers Below:The overworld punishes investigation hard. There's no way to stop the repair robots. So, you can't ever get a break to actually explore. And before someone thinks it's a skill issue: the repair robots respawn the instant they are killed. There is literally no time, because they come back instantly. The overworld is just an unavoidable slog through endless waves of robots to get to the next area. Disabling the HAWK only kills the repair robots for ten seconds.Another huge problem, to me personally, is that the difficulty setting makes the puzzles easier. For instance, the door locks have three puzzle ""slots"" and putting the game on easy makes all the doors only have one puzzle. Give me two difficulty sliders: one to turn the puzzles up to extreme, and another to make the robots wet tissues. I like the puzzles (except for the STUPID reaction-time based snap ones) and wish I could do more of them, but I'm too awful at the combat. I could also imagine someone wanting hard combat, but finding the puzzles to be boring and forced pauses in an otherwise action-packed game.The story, when reflected against Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is quite sad. In the game, the USSR is depicted as successfully advancing communistic ideals and truly making the world a better place for all. It's just an embarrassing reminder of the fact that the Russian government did fail, and is still failing in all aspects of success the game touts. The lack of innovation, the lack of wealth redistribution, the lack of security, the lack of morals, and the lack of international respect are simply some of these failures modern day Russia could never hope to aspire to."

The story is mediocre.  The constant and badly written chatter between your character and your glove is annoying and both of them are immediately unlikable.  Then there's the combat.  Spongy enemies in far too high numbers are an immediate annoyance.  Melee combat is especially bad.  Enemies are bad at tracking you so they regularly end up behind you.  This requires constant camera adjustment to keep them in view, at which point they have a much higher chance of hitting you because they'll start an attack off camera.  Weapons and abilities, even upgraded, feel under powered.  Even if I could push myself to deal with the combat, I can't imagine myself being able to deal with the constant chatter.  It's exhausting to listen to.  This is yet another game where you're constantly looting garbage off of everything everywhere to upgrade your gear too.  Feels like a bad knock off of Bioshock."
696,Elder Borjoyzee,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018649885/,3,,1,29.2,February,26,318,0,1,"This game is mid, or 6/10 for me.+ Amazing Graphics + Optimization+ Amazing Soundtrack that adapts to how long you're in combat+ Fun Combat that keeps you on your toes where you're expected to exploit enemy weaknesses to get the upperhand. (You're encouraged to scan the enemies to learn the elemental weaknesses, I like strategy like that.)+ Very cool setting with fun robot designs, reminded me a lot of bioshock.+ Fun system where you can respec your character build at any store for no cost. Experiment however you want.+ Feels good as a power-fantasy when you get the hang of the combat and upgrade your skills/weapons.- Way too much Dialogue. The Dialogue goes on for so long that often if you're moving through the level, the dialogue cuts out and new dialogue begins. The main character needs to stfu. I enjoyed myself when I was in the openworld portions because he shut up. The dialogue also tries to be funny (mainly through sexual humor) but just doesn't land much.- Forced walking sections, drawn out dialogue and long elevator rides.- Weak opening dungeon that goes on for far too long, should've been shorter so you got to the open world part quicker imo- Weird fixation on boring first-person parkour puzzles. In-fact, most of the puzzles in this game are just tedious. The puzzles aren't hard, just time consuming.- Open world seems.. empty? I don't know, the areas just didn't seem very distinct to me. On one hand, I like the open world because the main character shuts up, but on the other.. it just seems not very memorable.- The side dungeons are mostly the boring puzzles I mentioned earlier. Sometimes there are mini-bosses in them which is fun, but a lot of the time the dungeons just bored me with the puzzles.- The second enemy type, The Mutants, feel a bit tacked on. There are not a lot of different types and aside from their specific boss-type enemy, they're too easy to deal with and aren't very fun to fight.TLDR: Would recommend if you're starved for a power-fantasy bioshock-esque FPS that flexes your PC, but prepare to be bored by the puzzles and excessive dialogue."
697,SomeStonedDude,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SomeStonedDude/,6,1,0,18.6,February,26,201,0,1,"The main character is the most basic man you could think of. He's what comes to mind when you hear the phrase ""I am super straight"". Really immature, gets angry at everything. I think I've heard him say ""imma kill this guy"" after like exchanging two words with an npc, just for the glove to go ""nonono"" and him mumbling something like some angsty teenager. He's quite literally the most boring character there is, no witty remarks, no jokes, nothing. With the voicelines additionally constantly cutting off for other voicelines, you could play this game muted and get almost the same content.Gameplay is pretty boring too. Enemies are bulletsponges with lackluster attacks, stealth is unrewarding and doesn't work half of the time. The gameplay loop is the same thing over and over, go there, hit robots/plants, solve childish riddles and leave. Save for two or three weapons your armoury is at best basic, at worst a bunch of reskins. It's giving Biomutant vibes, where the design had so much potential but just ended up being uninspired. Abilities and most of all their upgrades don't work half of the time, and are rarely worth using anyways, probably even more so if you play at the lower difficulties and just get showered in ammo.I do have to say tho the game is a huge fever dream and cutscenes are pretty sick, but you only experience that through the main story and roaming around the world feels as boring as every other looter shooter with a semi-open world."

This immediately gave me three things I hate, forced unfunny dialogue with no necessity, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sidekick who probably has more story purpose later, but honesty was just unenjoyable, and lastly forced exposition dump about the world.On top of that the combat was very simple, attack attack attack evade, ring repeat, and all the normal enemies are pretty much dealt with, in fact I did it on the first 2 mini bosses it shows and it worked, I was also playing on the hardest difficulty. The game seems to boast weapon customization, but either it isn't as good as they said it would be, because it is linear AF, or I didn't get far enough in to even show me the cool upgrades. The movement is kinda annoying with a very shortrange dash and no sprint, unless I never found it and it was mapped to some weird ass key.I like the setting and aesthetic, but honestly the tells you more than it shows, breaking the simple rule of show don't tell. On top of a story that was incredibly boring to start, only 2 interesting characters, one you meet right off the bat, Granny, amazing character, I liked her a lot. Second, a machine that is basically into BDSM and though their lines seems forced, I smiled and chuckled at a couple of them. I was playing on the hardest difficulty and it was literally rinse and repeat your attacks until you get to the next spot. The world feels so cluttered and small, I didn't like the systems in play for when I actually got into open world. It felt like if they tried to make a GTA police system, but worse. The controls are ok, they felt responsive, when I hit things they really felt like they did damage, they have a system in play to make it so your enemies show the damage they take as you hit them, which is super fun and cool, probably the best part of the game.The graphics were ok, they really didn't blow me away, I felt more blown away by Horizon Zero Dawn's graphics and that was a port lol. They were kinda nice, though some of them felt like they were upscaled rather than just high quality textures, kinda like Cyberpunk 2077."
707,ĦΣĮℜ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/venzetti616/,82,15,0,1.6,February,22,639,0,1,"I walk into a hallway of an overrun facility, the walls cracked open, bodies hung on robotic tentacles, blood stains the floor, when suddenly a lullaby starts to play. I feel the confines of the walls pressuring me, I feel trapped in this small place with only one way to go, forward. I slow my pace, cautious, a little frightened. Then suddenly the main character swears a few times, insults his glove and just ruins the entire atmosphere. I kept playing a little bit on from that moment, but truly it was then that I gave up on the game.I really wanted to like this, but it's going to be one of the first games I've ever returned. The world building feels fantastic, the story seemed like it was going to interesting places, the music? Awesome. All of this is let down by some of the worst voice acting I have ever heard in my entire life. It's stilted, sped up in places, randomly cut short in others, the subtitles straight up do not keep up half the time, and then sprinkled on top of this sundae of bad are terrible lines. I don't think the best voice actors in the world could read this material and make it sound convincing, charismatic, or funny.You may think that it's a little bit much to bash the game for something like voice acting, the problem is the main character talks, all, the, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, time. He refuses to shut up. I can't walk through a door without him saying something dumb to his talking glove. Yeah, they even added a glove that can talk in order to increase the amount of bad dialogue. I could maybe, MAYBE, forgive all that if the gameplay was at least fun, but it just isn't. It feels like a bad copy of Bioshock, clunky, unfun, and boring. I obviously didn't get massively far into the game, but the fact is any time the game gave me a reason to want to continue, the main character would open his mouth, and I was reminded I'd have to spend even more time with him. I'd much rather bash my head into a brick wall, instead though I'll try and get the refund and move on with my life."

Regularly insulting everone and shouting his classic catchphrase ""Crispy Critters""The story is a mess, full of odd decisions, plot holes and huge stretches of credibility to make things work they way they do. The ending is also highly unsatisfying. Not in a Mass effect 3 kind of way where it just sucked, but Atomic Heart has you running down a story strand for the entire game and then tries to cram every interesting hook into the last 20 minutes of the game and then ... just ends. I have never had so many robots try to seduce meThe Boss battles also leave a little to be desired. Some look like they should have been battles but then turn out to be nothing (Giant tree) and all the others are just big bullet sponges.When you fight the big rolling boss there are actual mechanics that were kind of fun to figure out and utilize. Then they just kind of give up on that aspect and turn all other bosses into ""Shoot them until they go away""  All of the creepy transformations and unsettling encounters are one off cut scenes that have no effect on gameplay or the story and seem to have been created purely for trailer fodder"

Lost trust in AAA industry long ago and didn't buy a single AAA game on release day, since BF4. If not all this hate surrounding the game - wouldn't even bother to buy the game so soon. And what a jackpot! Just think about it. AAA game. From a noname studio, without any experience in gaming industry. Fully functional on the release day. On ultra. In damn 144 fps! What a damn magic is this?! Can you believe this? You press play and... you play! No wasting time on forums trying to find a solution how to launch the game. No searching for answers on Reddit. No wild dances with drivers and windows updates. No need for patches... Totally complete game on release. Haha, what a slap to other ""prominent"" AAA losers like EA, SE, Activision with their garbage releases.This game is like some time machine or portal to another dimension. Such an intense or, I'd even say, concentrated atmosphere. Exceptionally detailed lore and surrounding. S-so many details, all this music, aestetics of soviet retro futurism, synergy of real historical events and fictional ones, very well developed backstory of key and secondary characters. So far I spent most of the time just wandering around like in some amusement park, slowly exploring this uthopian universe, carefully gathering every piece of information. It would be really exciting to visit these locations in VR some day.Gameplay is very dynamic. There is a lot of melee weapons and firearms, both real and fictional. You can find them, or you can craft them. Every weapon has tons of upgrades (mutually exclusive as well) and all upgrades are visualized. And of course you have your super powers, which can be upgraded as well. Finding a good synergy of weapons and powers can be really game changing.The game also motivates you to experiment with your playstyle. Feels like you invested too much points into powers you don't like? - cancel upgrades and reinvest points into something else! Same with the weapons - all devices can be removed and you will get back your resources. From pre-release trailers there was a fair portion of concerns that enemies are too tanky. In fact - I would'n t call them so. Deadly? - yeah, for sure. Few hits and you are gone. Tanky? - not that much. I started on the hardest difficulty, so maybe on lower ones they are even weaker.Looting system here definitely deserves special mentioning. Looting never felt so satisfying. You enter the room and your super gauntlet, just like some vacuum cleaner, starts sucking in all possible loot from all these lockers, tables, boxes chests, dead bodies, etc. I won't talk about visuals - you can see everything yourself.Something else? Cool characters and uniques enemies of course. Get ready to meet robots in latex, chicken robots, carnivorous chickens, underwater cows, plantheads, horny fridge, Rambo-granny and many others! Ah, and voice acting is great as well. Can't speak for all of course, but out of curiosity checked few languages - swearing in polish is definitely a special form of art.P.S. Where the hell is Steam background with granny Zina?!P.S.S. Now I demand a spin-off with twin robots...... No... WE demand."

Game play mechanics are refreshing and are not clunky, music is very good and the story is unique, but weird. Atomic Hearts art team really went all out, even for the places you don't spend much time at. The weapons and abilities are both done really well and the FXs are some of the best i have seen. There is enough ammunition to not use melee, except for the very start, which will be nice for those who are not fond of swinging blades. The crafting of ammunition, upgrades, weapons and abilities are 100% refunded, allowing you to experiment without any issues. One of the best features of this game is the optimisation which for the most part is very good.There are some issues such as a few bugs and i suspect some later parts of the game had less optimisation (this could have just been my computer so i cant be sure), resulting in small FPS drops which was not a major issue. Personally not a huge fan of the open world parts, but it can be skipped fairly easily, just make sure to drive. Some parts of the game needed a few more save locations and a custom way point system would be nice. The main flaw in Atomic Heart was the lack of a 6 hour scene with the Twins.All jokes aside, this game was a real joy to play and i will play through again. It is amazing that this was MundFish's first game."

If the game was balanced I could have enjoyed these cool bosses (I liked Hedgie, all the proceeding bosses were just HP bars I held dash on).Despite feeling like a 7 out of 10, have to give it a negative review for the false advertisement.

There is not a single thing about this game's basic combat which could be considered creative, or even fun. In terms of mechanics we have basic shooting, a weapon upgrade mechanic that gives purely numerical bonuses & powers that basically amount to extra guns.Story: I hate agent P-3 with a passion. Every time that he opens his mouth I hoped the game would end with the protagonist being killed off. The overall conspiracy at the story's heart attempts to be compelling by having literally every character in the game either lie to you or refuse to share information throughout, but it just leads to a feeling of disinterest rather than mystery. The story itself felt like an entire 3rd act was missing & while I won't include spoilers, it does feel like the story is simply unresolved at the end.Overall I wanted to rate this game as just mediocre, a model 5/10, but given the absolute laziness of the game in its refusal to even attempt to be creative, I have to lower that to a 4/10.

Didn't notice the low FOV at the start of the game out of combat, but once I am playing the game and it is making me feel a bit sick when playingGame looks good. It feels like Bioshock but set in the Soviet Union. Works well on Linux (Arch Linux) and started straight up without any issues. Performance is decent at 4k with some stutters here and there and I will need to play with the setting to get things smooth but it seems pretty decent.+ Good graphics+ Seem like Bioshock which is good- No FOV slider. Can't play the game for too long as I feel sick and I have to find some patch and work out how to make it work on Linux when adding a FOV slider is probably pretty trivial thing to add in to the menu. Seems an odd omission to me and I don't buy what the developers have said about it being ""high"" already. It doesn't seem high at all.- Stupidly long title screens before you can play the game. I understand you have to credit the technology that you are using as it part of some sort of agreement, but it is ridiculously long.

Lame dialogue constantly, rushed out lines. ""Drone stuck in a tree that always cracks me up"" feels so unnatural every time he speaks. Elevator comes crashing down with me inside of it? Let me light a cigarette smoke it in one puff then say a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one liner. P-3 (main character) is the worst, I mean the absolutely WORST protagonist in a game that I have ever played. Other than that. The game so far is great. 30~ minute introduction (not a bad thing imo) Great visuals. Good music. Awesome tears and cuts when you hit enemies. I mean so far I love this game like it was Prey 2. Both Charles and Nora were hilarious but P-3 can eat an ass. BUT the cons (some minor, some more major)- No FoV slider on launch (yikes guys that's a basic)- No toggle-able crosshair (again a yikes that's a basic)- My mouse is insanely sensitive and I can not for the life of me get it figured out (turned down sens and everything so idk)- Melee seems a bit slow, at the beginning it's bad slow but it gets a little bit better Overall thoughts. It's a solid game. I don't see why people have cried about it honestly. If you play an easy difficulty then ♥♥♥♥♥ because it's easy, who's fault is that, the game didn't MAKE you choose easy. But to be honest, I was struggling with thinking about returning it strictly because of P-3's just god awful voice lines. The actors not bad, it's just the lines and how often he ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about things, and how many cheesy one liners he has. But I'm going to stick with the game because every else is good.

757,naomha,https://steamcommunity.com/id/naomha/,3,1,1,3.5,February,21,806,1,1,"Yeah, the comparisons to Bioshock Infinite are easily identifiable. However, there's a HUGE sprinkling of some System Shock 2 in it as well as The Surge games. It's an odd game. The first 45 minutes to an hour absolutely BLOW. It starts off soooooo sloooooow. Your character can NOT run nor move faster in this part of the game. It's an exposition that sets up the game but Jesus H. Christ if it doesn't take entirely too long. Saying that, the environments are ridiculously beautiful, jaw-dropping exquisite. The attention to detail is PHENOMENAL. Period. They definitely have created one heck of a world. I've seen a few people state that weapons don't have any feel to them and I'm seriously scratching my head on that one. Weapons feel meaty and require time to use. There's no insta-stabbing going on and the weapons feel, in game, like they have a definite amount of heft to them. Swings, sounds, etc, are all SOLID. Gun go BOOM and have a nice kick and OOMPH to them. Nothing was spared in adding little details to the weapon designs or sounds at all. Graphics are, well, amazing to be honest. If you've got a higher end rig this game will sing your praises for running it on max settings. The main character's dialogue is cringe-worthy. Sounds like it was written by an upset 8 year old who's mommy took away their DS and they're angry at the world because of it. God, I hope it gets somewhat better as I get on in the game. The ""GLOVE"" is fine. Nothing as absurd as in Forspoken (of which was written by the obviously same 8 year old). I truly feel that the devs, whereever they're all from, don't get laid enough. Good God, the first time I encountered the upgrade machine, who's name escapes me right now, my wife popped over and asked wtf was I watching. It's THAT crazy! Like, for realz homeboyz? That's what you're going to make a robot like? She's not even humanoid. She's a box. The next time I encountered her to be able to get through a laser array my wife popped over again and asked if I was switching screens on her! LOL! I had to pop up a YT video and show her! I can't believe anyone would let their kids play this game. Between the foul language AND the sex machine in less than 4 hours you probably should play this game with headphones on if you have little ones around. Seriously. It really is that naughty. I'll be honest. It's getting a thumb's up for now because I'm enjoying it but the first hour was torture and the main character's dialogue is second to that. First we got the horrific ""glove"" in Forspoken and now this character. Wtf is writing this material? Did the general population become insta-dumb in the past couple of months? Def try before you buy. Use your 2 hours and see what you think. Better yet, wait til the 21st and play it on Gamepass for PC. That way there's no loss of $$ on your end. I""m sure I'll finish it but it is a crazy experience I can't quite put my finger on. It's like nothing else out there so far."
758,The_Cpt_FROGGY,https://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Cpt_FROGGY/,2,,1,20.3,February,27,"3,023",0,1,"Atomic Heart:~~~~~~~~~~~ The U.S.S.R. was the proud victor of the Second World War and has made some extraordinary scientific breakthroughs since then. Now, in the 1950s, the Soviet Union is considered to have the most technology-savvy people in the world. Not only have they created floating facilities in the sky, but they have built the most sophisticated robots, including servant robots, labour robots and many more. However, the West has been slow in its technological advances and has threatened the U.S.S.R. with sanctions. To counter the West’s sanctions, the U.S.S.R. has given their robots to the world free of charge, to make their citizens’ lives as easy as they are in the U.S.S.R.  But one day, in facility 3826, the robots went on a rampage and killed all the humans within the district. Is it some sort of malfunction or was it planned? You are about to find out, in Atomic Heart!Atomic Heart is a first-person shooter developed by Mundfish and published by Focus Entertainment on the 21st of February 2023 on the Steam platform. The game is also available on PS4/PS5, Xbox one and Xbox series X|S.You play Major Sergey Nechaev, or P-3, the personal Spec Ops specialist for the leading scientist in the U.S.S.R., Comrade Sechenov. After an event in Bulgaria, you were reconstructed with implants and brought back to life, but your moods became odd during your rehabilitation as information about your past life was deleted. Despite this impediment, when the robots turned on the humans, you were the only person who could do something about it.One of your implants is Char_les, an AI that is located in your left hand as part of a glove. Char_les is very talkative and most of the story will be revealed in the conversations between you and the AI. The glove also has a few abilities which are very important to you. First is a kinetic ability that you will use pretty much everywhere to gather items after destroying your enemies, or to help you search in desks and other areas. It also has a shield and an electroshock system.I enjoyed the story as it keeps you guessing until the end, which is really fun. You’ll have a lot of interaction with Char_les and dead bodies as you go through the game. Yes, people have these sorts of implants on their heads, and they can still have thoughts even after being dead for a few days. I had a bit of a laugh with that, I must admit. The game itself is very linear as you have to follow the story from one place to the next. But everywhere you go, you’ll encounter seriously mean robots, and you’ll be living constantly on the edge. Black and white robots look strikingly similar to the German Dictator that the world had to deal with during the Second World War.  You’ll have quite a variety of enemies to deal with throughout the game. One thing you need to be very careful of is to not raise the alarm to level two, its maximum level, otherwise more enemies will be dropped from the sky if you are in an open area. If you are in a building, you must get rid of the flying maintenance robots and their dispensers as soon as possible as the maintenance robots can quickly rebuild the robots you destroyed only a few moments ago. The good news is that there are plenty of rooms where you can save your progress along the way.  You can craft many items, such as ammo, consumables and new weapons, through the red refrigerator in the same room. The crafting reminds me of Dead Island and Dying Light, as it is very similar. I did enjoy the battle I encountered in Atomic Hearts but I must say that I was a bit disappointed with the bosses’ fights. I only died a few times on the normal level of difficulty and only once when fighting the last boss, the twins. I find it too easy for my liking compared to other games of the same genre. For me, it came down to the use of the additional ability cartridges for your weapons. You have a frozen, an electric and a fire cartridge. You would think that the electric cartridges would affect robots pretty badly, but it’s the fire cartridge that give the most damage to all the robots and bosses. And if you have a good supply of them in your storage and inventory, you’ll pretty much breeze through the game. It did take me a good 17 hours to finish, which is decent for this type of game.  There’s a good Ability Trees upgrade which you can also access through the refrigerator. You’ll need to have plenty of Neuropolymers at your disposal, so make sure you check every desk, cabinet and chest along the way. In terms of collectables, there are old 1920’s watches that you need to find here and there. There are also holographs projected from microphone-shaped stands on desks from which you can read emails to learn more about the era and the game’s storylline. I also like the puzzles, which are frequent in this game. You have to unlock doors by clicking your fingers at the right time to activate or deactivate one of its locks. Place the right colour on the lock puzzles and the beam puzzles. There are quite fun!Beautiful graphics and the soundtrack is very good, and I do admit that I enjoyed some of the Russian tracks as you are fed with all sorts of genres of music. Overall, the game is quite good and I didn’t encounter any crashes while playing the game. As much as I like the story and the dialogue, the game was not challenging at all, and at was on the normal difficulty level. It is worth playing, yes, without a doubt! Just far too easy.Positives:~~~~~~~ +	Great graphics+	Good story+	Fun and easy to play+	Easy crafting+	Good selection of enemies and tree upgrades+	Achievements and trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Not challenging on the normal difficulty level-	Bosses are predictable and easy to beat.Get a taste of what life would be like in the technologically-advanced U.S.S.R in an alternative 1950’s world!6/10Key provided by the developer/publisher for review purposes.

The solid release, and interesting characters was a breath of fresh air in this world of ""Early Access"" games. I wish I could recommend this game, but there are two points keeping me from doing so: The story, and the price. Over the ~20 hours I played the game, I could unfortunately guess the ending. I was hoping it would turn out to be different than my assumption, but it wasn't. I will keep from spoiling, but all I will say is that it practically allows for zero player agency. There are technically ""two endings"" but one is pretty much a joke, and the other is obviously the intended path. When you think about it, P-3 had very little input on the story at all.  Maybe I missed the point but I don't really get it. besides the narrative elements of the story, the way it is delivered is not optimal either. If you move to fast, interrupt certain dialogues, or just don't read enough you can miss incredibly important narrative elements. For example, I thought that  were total red herrings until I read a wiki article on the subject. I had no idea that   This probably would have had a large impact on my emotional attachment to  and as such, I take it as a flaw of the story telling medium. Finally, I just cannot justify the purchase of this game. I explored a fair amount, and upgraded all the weapons I liked using, but even then my play time was just shy of 20 hours. I would never consider replaying this game, so 20 hours is probably the most any person will ever get out of it. The 60$ price tag is just too high. If it ever goes on sale for ~30$ I would recommend it at that point."

Though the dialogue can be a bit cheesy at times it's not as bad as others made it out to be, also P3's rudeness is partially explained in the story.The model detail is incredible and the robots always make me a bit frightened, the hedge/farm bots are strangely the most terrifying for the small type at least, the Belyash had to have been one of my most difficult battles (other than the last one that is) and Hedgie was a great battle too! every robot felt plausible for this kind of universe.the weapons and their sound and graphic design was honestly really well done, my personal favorites are the Pashtet and Fat boy, though i mostly used the Kalash for harder enemies and the Pashtet for general use. they feel really balanced which for some reason came as a surprise to me, also like I said the sound design is great! the guns and melee sound meaty and just fantastic! the upgrade system is really well done with both the glove and the weapons, it's difficult enough to get components that you spend them wisely and where you feel you're headed combat style wise, but also not so difficult it is tedious, i also like how you can upgrade your weapon upgrades to be more effective.as of now i've completed the game on the local malfunction difficulty and it was great, now i'll be trying on Armageddon and seeing how that goes.Mundfish has most certainly made a great name for themselves10/10 highly recommend!"

The players character vocalises his every thought without hesitation and while these voice lines and interactions were impressive and added a layer of immersion. After playing for an hour or so, I found myself increasingly annoyed by the over-saturation of these elements. What I had initially hoped would be endearing quickly became grating, leaving me frustrated and wanting more control over my experience.While the game's world is undeniably rich in narrative complexity, I found that it often takes control away from the player for extended periods, robbing any sense of agency that I briefly had in the game. It was as if I were trudging through mud, struggling to regain my footing and make meaningful progress in both combat and interaction within the world.Despite my frustrations, I recognise that this game has a lot of potential. Its technical prowess and attention to detail are impressive, and I'm curious to see how it evolves as it moves further into its release.

While it is potentially unique with its tropes, to a degree, it leads to a pair of ultimately unsatisfying endings..Wait for a sale if you have to play it.Russia and robots. Creepy looking robots. Interesting looking robots. And then the two everyone is memeing. The production values are super high, from the animated tutorials, music in game, and the general look and feel of the game really establishes the setting. It all works very well and supports the feel of being in a Robot Renaissance established in the USSR of that time period.First-Person shooter with a limited (but upgradeable) inventory, several melee weapons, two pistols, a shotgun, two automatic rifles (one shoots bullets, the other energy balls,) a rocket-launcher, and a railgun. All of the melee weapons function the same save what charged attack you opt for. The energy based guns, save the rail-gun, become irrelevant if you spend any amount of time exploring and gathering materials/ammo.The game splits its gameplay from exploring an open-map of buildings and robot patrols to crawling through twisted corridors of mad science presented to the masses. Secret labs and museums about the various accomplishments of Neuropolymer are all fun to navigate and explore, with plenty of dead bodies/audio logs/computer logs to read to further flesh out the setting. Optional “dungeons” exist to scour for more loot and blueprints to upgrade your arsenal.There’s a crafting system. Its unique in that as long as you do not create consumables, you get a full refund for breaking any equipment (guns) down for parts. Full freedom to experiment with weapons, with the end pay off being able to break down and use the parts for guns you do not like for ammo or otherwise. Such is the same for the underwhelming glove powers you can use.The left-hand powers of Atomic Heart are a mixed bag. The quality of life in using them is great; they all have cooldowns so their use is effectively unlimited. You do not need to seek out batteries or EVE or Salts to recharge your glove powers. Sadly, all of them are rather unsatisfying to use. Snapping your fingers to set a splicer on fire, or shooting bees out of hand, has a much greater impact and game-feel over spraying polymer (or cold polymer) over robots.Robot Communist Utopia! It goes to ♥♥♥♥. You’re a super secret agent sent in to fix it and have a chatty A.I. glove to assist you.The tone of the story jumps from political intrigue thriller to B-Movie action antics to psychological horror and never settles on a single theme. The protagonist is in a word: a dumbo, and while this is by the intent of the story we the players have to experience the intrigue with him. And he is a dumbo that cracks jokes and uses a B-Movie catch-phrase a lot. The camp is there, the effort is earnest and passionate, but none of the pieces fit well together before the credits roll.Fighting the robots was fun. The powers had utility but felt like wet farts instead of snapping fingers and BOOM they’re on fire. The guns were guns, the melee weapons fell out of use very early on because ammo is plentiful. The setting dressing was enchanting and there were some very memorable moments that were actual moments of gameplay and not QTEs or scripted spectacle.The story did not satisfy, as after the third time the protagonist had a discussion of intrigue with his A.I. Glove I found out I stopped caring. I did not care if the protagonist was being manipulated or who was genuine. I did not want to listen to any more of the audio logs or read terminals because I knew none of it would affect gameplay or lead to meaningful setting revelations. It was all background noise to the robot-fighting, and when the robot-fighting was done, all I was left with was a dumb pile of a story that felt only half-done.But I suppose that is what the eventual DLC may provide. But having to pay extra for the potentially better ending or more fun story does not appeal to me.The camp has merit and can be entertaining, but not for full price. Wait for a sale, if you’re really curious."

I have not put any points into health, so this might change, but so far every battle feels very much life and death struggle. Having seen some criticism of bullet sponge enemies, I gotta disagree, scanning new enemies resistances is a must, after that just use appropriate tools for the job and you can dispatch them in 1 to 3 hits.Main story so far is pretty straight forward, however, the world building from reading terminals and listening to recordings is superb. Game conveys both the shiny, euphoric futurism of post war, post Stalinist Soviet Union and its behind the scenes underbelly of elitism, prisoner exploitation, secrecy etc.Main character, in the original Russian voice over is gruff military type that feels real, unfortunately in English voice over it goes more towards a ridiculous, angry, non-self-aware, Duke Nukem like moron. So the game definitely suffers from poor localisation in that regard. Do yourself a favour and go with Russian VO and English subtitles, it will make your journey much more pleasant.Technically, it is gorgeous, runs smooth with medium settings 60+fps, or decent 40 fps on high settings. This is on my old Ryzen 2700X with RX580 graphics. In 9 hours so far no crashes and the only bug encountered, is some crafting items can get stuck with no ability to pick them up."

I have 16 hours, but almost 2 hours of that was down to me having to repeat sections due to glitches. If you want a slavic type game with a good story, gameplay, and music. I say go play the Metro series as it does everything this game does but better. The art direction and style was good but other than that and Mick Gordon's soundtrack; it was very underwhelming."

I know that eventually the world opens up, but for now I'm just in the labs. Performance on my 3080ti is amazing, curious how it holds up once the world opens up. Combat is awesome, graphics are fantastic, sound design and voices/characters are really solid. It's everything I wanted from a Eastern European version of a Bioshock/SystemShock type of game. My biggest gripe with the game so far is the lack of an FoV adjustment. Please, please, please add in an FoV slider. Oh, and I want to say there is some mouse acceleration in there, I would like to turn that off. I had to turn the in-game sensitivity down pretty low."

The setting is interesting, different to the norm but still familiar traits of FPS so you don't feel alienated.The combat is good and the puzzles are varied so it doesn't get boring with repetitiveness like some other shooters.It feels a bit like Bioshock but its not as in-depth with the crafting. It even has some ""under water"" elements. Though its not actually water. I won't say anymore as I don't want to spoil it for people.If you're a fan of FPS and want something a little different this is definitely worth it."

My jaw literally hit the floor during the floating car sequence.But then the rest of the game happened.The level designs got progressively amateurishThe enemy types were boring and repetitive.I hated the alert system that threw 100 generic bots at you the moment it caught a whiff of your fartThe cutscenes were really goofyI didn't like the main protagonist. They should have made him mute the the Bioshock guy.There were some other things I didn't like about the game, but were pretty minorI will still recommend and support this game tho.Because the devs were not afraid to get edgy with character designs and story concepts. You could tell they didn't care about censorship, and I love that. We need more AAA devs that don't give a crap about SJWs. I think it's kinda funny how the games that came out when I was a teen were way more mature than majority of the games that come out now that I'm a grown ass adult lolWhile their execution was poor, this was an interesting concept, and I would like to see more developers take on games like this in the future.I give it a 6.5/10"

802,WishingLaws,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WishingLaws/,15,6,0,22.1,February,21,"1,541",0,1,"Atomic Heart is a visually stunning game that transports players into a unique world blending USSR art, a 1950s aesthetic, and futuristic robotic utopia. While the graphics are nothing short of breathtaking, certain aspects of the gameplay fall short of the mark. Let's dive into this mixed bag of a gaming experience.The art and graphics in Atomic Heart are truly outstanding, immersing players in a vivid atmosphere right from the Prologue. One can't help but pause and marvel at the intricate details that bring the game's world to life. Every corner of the environment exudes quality, making it a visual treat for players.Despite an impressive introduction, the gameplay in Atomic Heart doesn't quite meet expectations. One notable issue is the difficulty settings, which seem unbalanced. The ""Peaceful Atom"" setting is excessively easy, while ""Local Failure"" proves to be surprisingly challenging. Adding a couple of intermediate difficulty options could help bridge this gap and cater to players with varying skill levels.Although marketed as an action game, adrenaline-fueled moments are few and far between. Players may find themselves spending most of their time exploring facilities, solving puzzles, and scavenging for materials. The prominence of puzzles detracts from the action, which could be disappointing for those seeking a more action-heavy experience.As an open-world game, Atomic Heart falls short for avid explorers. There are no side quests or living NPCs to interact with, and random events are nonexistent. Apart from the main quest, the only objectives are the Polygon underground facilities. The absence of NPCs and random events renders the game world lifeless and uninteresting. Moreover, the infinitely spawning repair drones in the open world are irksome, making exploration a frustrating endeavor.Although Atomic Heart introduces stealth early on, it is poorly executed. The level design often hinders stealth playstyles, and the enemies' heightened mobility and awareness render stealth kills near impossible. The lack of auto-lock on enemies is another source of frustration, particularly for those using a controller. . It is highly recommended to use a mouse and keyboard for a smoother combat experience, especially when wielding rifles.Atomic Heart is a game brimming with potential, but it stumbles in several key areas. The combat mechanics may not satisfy players who crave action-packed experiences. If you're seeking an open-world game with a plethora of activities, side quests, and thrilling moments, Atomic Heart may not be the ideal choice.In conclusion, Atomic Heart earns a respectable 7.5/10 rating. However, considering its current state and the standard set by other games in the market, it is difficult to recommend it wholeheartedly."

807,Lying_Cake,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069052412/,3,,0,24.9,March,14,104,0,1,"Yesterday I completed Atomic Heart after ~25 hours, and a part of me really wishes I could recommend the game. THE GAMEPLAY: The combat feels good. Shooting enemies feels good, using the couple abilities I found most fun felt good, and upgrading felt like it made a difference. The dungeons/non open-world segments I enjoyed every second of despite on occasion getting stuck on geometry and a couple of game crashes. The boss fights were a blast as well, not counting the final one. The open-world segments however, I found to be a chore and an annoyance. Go to this device, access a map that's a pain to operate so you can hunt for a specific camera to open a door so you can bum rush past enemies just to get to that door, and either shut them all down for about 5 minutes or climb onto a balloon to access specific areas. ""Well can't you just kill the enemies?"" Yes, but when you do kill one the infinitely spawning repair bots will arrive to start repairing the ones you've killed right away. ""Do I get more loot if I have to kill an enemy again after already looting them, to more easily recover ammo?"" No. ""Okay, well can I stealth past them?"" No. You can sneak, but the system for it is poor and you're likely to enter combat. The whole song and dance regarding the open world areas was the entire reason I only have 25 hours in the game and not more. I would have happily gotten all achievements if it weren't for that drudgery, but the pain of it all steered me away from accessing the optional areas that give you the cooler weapon upgrades. The unfun kept me from more fun, because the disparity between the two made it not seem worth it.THE STORY: For 90% of the game, the story is why I kept playing. There's a lot of mystery, and I was really interested in it all. At the end when everything was being revealed, I only kept playing because I knew I was about to beat the game. The reveal is a huge disappointment, and they splurge a ton of exposition on you at the end of the game to clear up all of the smaller mysterious story points. Much of the mystery turns out to be a mystery just for the sake of it being mysterious. So much information is being withheld from the main character for seemingly no reason, and it's just.... dumb. On top of that, there are multiple endings which can be boiled down to 'fight the final boss' and 'don't fight the final boss'. The final boss, following suit of the story, being a massive disappointment. THE MUSIC: Part of why I bought this is because I mistakenly believed the whole thing was composed by Mick Gordon. It was not. One song was, and it slaps harder than your mama when she finds out you didn't put the chicken out to thaw. The rest was okay, with a couple bangers. One of the songs I'm pretty sure is from the movie ""Annihilation"", but for the purposes they used it for it fit well. TLDR: Buy it on sale. You'll enjoy some of it, but I doubt you'll like all of it."
808,bubbaa,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126106141/,3,,0,19.2,March,14,51,0,1,"The game is just not... well put together. Gameplay is fun and story is intriguing. But some puzzle elements are introduced, seem like they'll be a part of gameplay and..never come up again. The first mission is so tedious that the main character makes fun of it for the rest of the game, which feels like they got bad feedback in play testing and instead oh changing anything they just make quips about it, which somewhat summarized the game. Other things that don't fit together - to see an enemies weakness it needs to be scanned which takes a good 5 seconds. Most bosses can't be scanned before entering the arena and then are ultra aggresive leaving 0 time to scan.The weakness is a visual that makes no sense, I've searched on google for a legend but it's all posts of other people who can't understand what the symbols mean. The parkour/assassins creed parts are so ridiculously bad that it's almost all limited to optional puzzle challenges, mainly because the difficult piece is fighting the physics engine. At least one puzzle is based around getting the character to do something easy, but the engine only accepts it if it's at just the right angle. Feels like something play testers ripped to shred and instead of fixing it, they stuck made it optional content.Interesting ideas, setting, plot, gameplay, but needed another edit of ideas for gameplay and to make the selected ideas actually work.I would be hesitant to buy another game from this studio."

The team really did a stellar job with the polish and optimization right out of the box!Between this and Hogwarts, I'm not going to be getting much sleep for the next few weeks, am I? (Writing this at 2AM...LOL)*Update after 14 hours of game play:*1. Making it through the first underground facility was pretty tedious and challenging, but after reaching the open world, you can finally explore and progress non-linearly. I've been enjoying this a lot more than the initial ""dungeon"".2. There are so many interesting secrets to learn scattered through out the game, and I'm really fascinated with the lore: For example, after taking the train across the map, there is a dialog event on the platform that seems to imply there is *a lot* more to your glove companion than meets the eye; also, if you go to the docks next to Testing Ground 9, there is a dead scientist next to the building who tells you something very peculiar about your character. TBD if what he said turns out to be true or not, but if it is, I'm very curious where the lore takes this! (I won't ruin it for you here though. You'll have to find out for yourself!) :D"

If you expect to stay in the Vavilov-Complex at the beginning, the transition to a more open world-style map later on might be somewhat disorienting, and feels like a different game. The soviet styling of the game is fresh and hasn't been done that much, but the unfitting english voiceover kind of destroys the immersive ""I'm in an alternate reality soviet russia"" feeling immediately. They could have done a bit more here, maybe let the main character speak heavily accented, even if its kind of a cliche by now. The NPC assets (mostly corpses) are recycled way too often, and it feels as if the soviets did not just master robotics but also cloning.  The same russian soldier-corpse over and over again can be a bit boring over time. Battles are ok, but lack a certain amount of punch. Most frustratingly, the male androids often grab you and you cannot do much until they simply break your neck. It felt almost like a unskippable cutscene. I would have taken this out completely. Let the player fight also in dire situations, and don't take this away from the player."

Cannot point my finger on it but althouigh some mecanics are similar to other games, i.e. Weapon crafting, looting, combat, it does not feel the same as other games at all.I want to add, that this game is very well optimized. My Rig is a decent one with a 2070 super and a Ryzen 5 5800 iirc and I can run everything at ultra with DLSS and get a stable 100 to 120 fps.The MC seems kinda dense in the first half/two thirds though.

It kind of reminds me of Security Breach in that it looks like they started to lay a substantial foundation, but weren't able to execute it in its entirety so they scaled things back towards the end in order to release a finished product. The huge world map blocked off by barriers is a pretty solid giveaway of the game's initial ambitions. It's Open World* in that you can bebop around the world map between approved locations, but you aren't able to return to story locations. It's your standard shooter with some light RPG elements. What few boss battles there were weren't as engaging as I'd hoped. They were too easy especially for as few as there were. Would have liked more scripted encounters with the larger enemies and a higher difficulty curve on said encounters. Resource balance is a little off as well. Health and Ammo are provided in such excess that you never need to produce it which leaves you with a substantial amount of the necessary resources as well, but finding enough of the rares stuff to build and upgrade all the weapons would require grinding enemies on main world for a substantial amount of time because of the low drop rate of those resources. It was still cool though, and the story was interesting enough. The ending actually caught me off guard though the Bioshock aspect is about as subtle as a third leg, but not in the way you think. All in all I had a lot of fun playing it, and I'm looking forward to seeing more from the future DLC releases. This appears to be Mundfish's first game, and it's a damn fine one at that. The team should be proud."

You can tell they took their time on it and there's a ton of little details every step of the way and you really have to pay attention to the story to understand it. The game is built around a futuristic world where basically artificial intelligence robots are part as the community just as much as humans are. CONS Sorta : in the beginning you might get frustrated with dying a lot depending on the difficulty you play and if you're like me I like a challenge and I don't like to go through games real easy so highest difficulty always wins.Overall Plot Summary : Without ruining the story mode or giving away any spoilers it's basically where the artificial intelligent robotics of the world are turned against humans . You as a commander are trying to figure out the source ,  as well as fighting your way through any attackers, Why exactly did the robots turn against humans? was it for money, greed , power . Who's behind this, are there any survivors........."

Puzzles, ""need 4 things to get through door"", limited weapons and skills, not a whole lot of ammo. But once you get past that I can say this is one of the best single player games that you can play today and takes a lot of inspiration from Bioshock and Doom to a degree in terms of how aggressive you need to be in combat. The game is great looking and runs awesome on a 3060 no fps drops on ultra with DLSS and the game overall was a solid and fun and experience. The story is good and well implemented nothing earth shattering but still good and the game is very melancholy. The gameplay is fun and gets better as it goes to where you are nearly unstoppable and each weapon has a purpose and reason to be there, want to pick things off? Use the Makarov, need to blow something away at close range? Use the KS-23 so on and so forth. The game is fun and dont let the controversy around it over bs scare you away."

868,Arkveveen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Arkveveen/,2,,1,33.6,February,22,859,0,1,"An absolute surprise, and the biggest surprise so far, of 2023. Atomic Heart is a thrill ride with great gunplay, cool abilities, arresting visuals, good atmosphere, decent exploration, punchy evolving guns, and a creative sci-fi world brimming with technological wonders. It pretty much is a superior Bioshock: Infinite, and unlike Bioshock: Infinite ( as much as I enjoy it too ), the upgrades actually alter the appearance of your weapons for damn once. That isn't the only thing I liked, but it's the first thing I noticed about the weapons and upgrades.You get the usual goodies to find, which I found enjoyable to collect due to the gravity-glove style interaction of holding down the use key to force open cabinets, drawers, storage containers, and more to suck up crafting components or upgrade parts. Yeah, every game these days has to have crafting, upgrades, and whatever, but Atomic Heart does it well by offering a decent selection of upgrades and weapons. Nothing we haven't seen before though.The game is somewhat linear, but not too linear, it rewards poking around into various rooms off the beaten path, and it's a world so breathtaking that I want to explore it a lot. At some point, things open up and you get open world sections connecting each major indoor area. From the first minute, you are immersed as much as an immersive sim can possibly immerse you, into a Soviet world of technology and utopia. But, there is a rotten core here full of contradictions and problems, and as per Bioshock or immersive sim tradition, things hit the fan!Out in the open world sections of the game, you will find little dungeons that each have their own unique puzzles, rewards/loot, and encounters. They are a lot of fun and add a lot to how rewarding exploration can be. The open worlds themselves are filled with enemies or stuff to see. I don't like how enemies basically respawn infinitely, due to repair bots, but overall it's a stunning world I want to sink my teeth into. The open world is the weakest part of the game, but hardly that bad.As you progress, you fight bosses like many other games, but these boss are actually quite awesome and memorable, they all have unique mechanics or behaviors.The music and audio is amazing. Apparently, Mick Gordon did the soundtrack and whatnot, and I can really tell. It really gives us this feeling of a technological utopia gone wrong.Combat is pretty good and satisfying. Some of the enemies are quite bullet spongey... but they are robots, honestly if they weren't bullet spongey then something is wrong quite frankly. Parts of them fall off in glorious and surprising detail as you battle them and damage them. Enemy variety is damn solid.The story is pretty interesting, but the main character is an unlikable piece of garbage. The voiceacting is okay and feels kind of off... leading me to believe it's all translated from Russian. I mean, of course it is. I am led to believe that they are trying to make the main character, Agent P-3, into the next Duke Nukem or Caleb from Blood. Because he is a wise-cracking action hero through and through.A surprise. That is the best way to describe Atomic Heart. It's great, with a few flaws here and there, some undercooked ideas. Luckily, the best parts of this game overwhelm the worst parts."

The environments are easily the centre focus of the dev here and they deliver. The combat is serviceable and after you get some upgrades it becomes pretty fun. It could use some more polish on the technical side but it doesn't crash or perform so badly that it harms the experience. The main character, while bland, doesn't perform so badly that it would annoy me and in general all the negatives are there but simply don't outweigh the incredible other parts of the game.This game in my opinion is a genuine must-play for anyone who loves old sci-fi works."

(Only 2-5% of the whole game has the twins)Some compare it to Bioshock, and that is a disgrace to the Bioshock franchise. Sure you have a few abilities, but in the end, they all do the one same thing, to keep the enemies away from you.Freeze them, lift them, slow them, shock/stun them ect. to stop them from moving towards you and thats it. The rest of the ""open world"" is boring.You will come to realize, that they pretty much just threw around vehicles, towers, houses and chests with nothing exciting or useful in them to make you busy and distract you. Sure the environment is pretty (Mainly underground) and all and they should be proud of that, but its nothing new from other open world games. The whole journey for the end is just not worth it and unrewarding. Id wait to get the game when its for sale for 20-30 USD.

The game is short, plain and simple, and while the story is super compelling, it comes with a few faults that make it fall short of being AAA worthy.1 - Its short, like 15 hours short, 30 tops if you go for all the upgrades.2 - the movement is a little buggy at times, I've gotten stuck like 20 times, usually can get out of it, but its not fun.3 - The ""open world"" is pretty damn chaotic and doesn't make you want to explore it because if you do you'll blow through all your ammo and health pots in the process. Trust me, if you play on anything other than easy, you'll need them.4 - A lot of people are saying there's not enough different enemies and that's true, but its such a short game, its honestly fine.That all being said this game is a lot of fun, and without going into too much detail, and possibly spoilers, if you like story driven shooters with a lot of dialogue its great.

This could be made much better if you could destroy the pchela spawners.

Minimal spoilers, ending was not at all what i expected-Crafting and looting isn't a chore, feels good and simple-Performance blew me away, running a 2060, i5-9600K and 16GB of ram on a SSD, ran on ultra settings at 1080p, rarely dropped below 75fps (some cut-scenes where low on start but smoothed out). Game looked and ran magnificent.Now some things kinda soured the experience;-Didn't get to explore as much as I wanted to on the surface, reason= Robots cannot be cleared from a area as they will be repaired no matter what, same with cameras. Sure you can disable them but only for a little while (I had a bug where it didn't repair but didn't allow me to enter a secret lab due to all things disabled). It gets annoying just running all the time to survive attacks and being spotted, no chance to explore houses or of path areas if you cant clear it properly. However in underground areas they are not repaired to that's easier.-English voice acting was so cheesy within the first minute I switch to Russian (which makes immersion better anyway), I think some things may have been lost in translation.-Cars like to launch into space at the worst of times-Some minor issues like some text or audio having no translationOverall, good game, would have liked maybe a bit more horror but its fine without, worth the money and wait.

And i would have liked to see some of the boss enemies show up around the world other than the few encountered as i feel like that would've added some extra incentives for building the tougher materials without needed to go to some of the newer areas and just loot as per normal therre. However great game nonetheless! solid 9/10.

I honestly wish there was a neutral option but as there is not one, negative is closer to my overall feelings towards the game.I have been following this game for years and even pre-ordered on Steam the moment I realised it was available but unfortunately there are multiple issues effecting such achievements as ""Apple Pie"" (apparently recent patch is to blame, only 99 apples but asking for 114), ""The Necromancer"" (every time i open the game, the counter changes) and ""The Motherland Does Not Forget its Heroes"" (another broken counter).Having said all this, if you don't care about achievements, I would recommend the game, I have really enjoyed the vibe but as reviews are meant for personal opinion (and I love to chase achievements), my review will remain negative (as at this point, even if the issues with achievements are fixed, it will still require me to replay not for the fun of it but to rectify achievements i should have already had)"
903,MASNOREH,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MASNOREH/,5,,0,6.9,March,23,479,0,1,"A very difficult game to enjoy. I had high hopes for this release and pre-ordered it in Jan 2023, keeping up to date with the game. I am yet to complete the game, but I find the story isn't exciting enough to draw me in, the character is dull and almost cringe teenage-like with his responses and general attitude. The world is okay, beautiful enough. I somewhat enjoy the Bioshock looking power traits that you wield, but they're just not good enough to keep the game afloat. I thought the combat was pretty basic and sponge-like. I felt I was hitting an enemy for ages before they died. The game also leads you blindly which can be frustrating. There's a lot of parts where it is just like ""Go and sort this out, but we won't show you how to get there."" It just adds to that boring feel of the game - I am struggling to go back to it. I would like to continue and finish the game, but it sends me to sleep that much I can't stay awake to finish it. 4/10 for me."

The story's predictable, the characters are unremarkable, the combat feels very floaty and unsatisfying, the achievement tracking is buggy (seems better after the last patch), everything after the early game is too easy (even on Hardcore mode), the AI can occasionally be brain dead, the world is barely interactable and some of the characters have absolutely horrible designs (P-3 and Filatova would look more at home in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hipster bar than the Soviet Union in the 50s). Is this the worst game of all time and literally makes you a Russian war criminal? Nope. The world is beautiful, the performance is fantastic, the music is stellar (especially the remixed Soviet songs), the robots are super cool (some even dare I , the Soviet aesthetic is striking, the powers are interesting and the overall pace of the game is pretty good with a solid mix of combat, exploration and puzzles. Concerning the controversy surrounding this game, I don't believe that Russian artists should be punished for the actions of their state, something in which they literally have no say, and I don't find boycotting games to be a meaningful way of combating state terrorism (the Russian government has their fingers in EVERYTHING over there anyway and the devs are operating out of Cyprus). Some of the haters and the things they say make me wonder if they'd walk out of a room if they found out someone there was *gasp* Russian. Seems kinda harsh to me at that point. All in all, the game's alright. It's not groundbreaking, it's not bad, it's a decent enough time for people who enjoy sci-fi or FPS games."

912,Please Know,https://steamcommunity.com/id/swisscheese714/,1,,1,39.4,March,22,81,0,1,"I'll give it a 7.5/10. I bought the premium edition (pass with glove, AK and Звёздочка skins).Minus 1 for the difficulty curve that keeps it entertaining in the very beginning, but flattens out and altogether plummets after a certain point in the game where you're just either fervently looting or nonchalantly dismantling mobs of bots and zombies along with unneeded ammo and unnecessary consumables to feed your arsenal. Only a few instances kept it interesting, especially where I was able to activate 3 Плющs and have them gang up on me. That, or the other times where you had gaggles of plant zombies coming at you. Bosses were also underwhelming with the variety (or lack thereof) of attack patterns. Mind you, I expected a challenge from Armageddon where game even warned about counting your ammo (I ended up counting the seconds between dismantling them). Mobs were interesting at first, but got boring after a while, I'd have liked more variety.Minus 0.5 for the bugs. You'd think they'd iron out *most* of the glitches in this game after 5 years of development (e.g. stuck in textures, uninteractable characters, unlootable loot, etc.)Minus another 0.5 for slightly unpolished design where there were literal blanks in map development, where you just cannot access certain loot/places.And minus the last 0.5 for weapon and upgrade choices. Some are just outright useless (The Fox, The Dominator, etc.).On the other hand...Amazing optimization to the point where I thought Atomic graphics would melt my laptop (2060 RTX, Ryzen 4800H, 1 GB SSD), but ended up just dropping fps to around 20. Hence, I was able to get a stable 60 most of the time on Ultra.Gunplay is great, satisfying and fairly realistic. Story was well-written enough to throw me for a loop with ХРАЗ and Сеченов's story. Environment was beautiful with only the occasional cheap cop outs (white background due to the sun? Come on, Mundfish).I didn't play with English audio nor text (and for good reason, according to comments and reviews), I can only say the Russian voice acting was great, very grounded and realistic, even though I expected more obscenities (then again, this IS the USSR and people were slightly more reserved with their swearing back then). Штокхаузен's German accent in Russian was great and added to the USSR experience.Eleonora, lmao. The actress must have had a field day with her lines XD.And The Twins. The devs gave them and the ballerina bots metallic nipples. What else is there to say? All in all, great game, cons notwithstanding. Would definitely recommend and will gladly play through the DLCs and grab AH2. Hopefully devs read reviews and deal with their bugs."
913,Beepin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gmodapproves/,1,1,1,25.8,March,21,804,0,1,"""I am P-3, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? 'Yes!' says the man in Chelomey, 'It belongs to the worker.' 'Yes!' says the woman in the Academy of Consequences, 'It belongs to the worker.' 'Yes!' says the robot in the Maya Plisetskaya Theater, 'It belongs to the worker.' I accepted those answers; furthermore, I chose nothing different. I chose the improbable. I chose… Facility 3826, a facility where the artist would respect the culture, where the scientist would not be bound by petty budgets, Where the great would not be contrasted against the small! And with the sweat of your brow, Facility 3826 can become your facility as well.""Atomic Heart is a ballet of violent optimism. Gameplay-wise, the guns feel satisfying to use, and the powerups are fun to use. Playing on the hardest difficulty, enemies felt dangerous and balanced… Except for mini-bosses that just seemed like damage sponges. The game has stealth mechanics without appropriate means to sneak. Enemies seem to have a strong sense of where you are once you come within 15 meters, making stealth feel like an afterthought. Big bosses were unforgiving and stylish – if not a little TOO extravagant in terms of abilities. The guns were great to use, but I HEAVILY relied on my powers to stall enemies. I don’t think I would have survived most boss fights without Mass-Telekinesis. Regardless, the enemies were fun to fight.Aesthetics are a 10/10. Graphics are a 10/10. Animations are exaggerated in a fantastic way that teeters on the edge of believability. The characters/dialogue lean more towards uncomfortable groans and edgy self-aggrandizing, but serve their purposes well. Unfortunately, the story feels amorphous in the pool of Slavic conventions. As someone who appreciates visuals more than exposition, I found it difficult to keep track of who was who (and where was where) without a picture reference to associate the names to the dialogue. The ending was particularly unsatisfying… I went online to make sure I hadn’t missed a better conclusion, but of both endings, I found neither to meet my expectations.Overall, Atomic Heart is a bioshock-inspired work of art. If you enjoyed the classic, you’ll definitely appreciate this take on the genre.Side Note: After reading online that the “Wall of Shame” was easy to find, I assumed that I would be able to stumble across it… Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case, and as I’ve read more, other posts suggest that it’s unavailable to return to after beating the game and returning to facility 3826. I’m one to explore every nook and cranny, so to play through the whole game and completely miss my photo is disheartening, but I suppose that just comes down to my own culpability."
914,EVERYTHING IS OP,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972661374/,1,,1,53.4,March,21,205,0,1,"Summary: Very fun and well-done game in the same vain as Bioshock. In fact, if you told me this was made by the same team as the original Bioshock, I wouldn't be surprised at all.Story: While it doesn't get too bogged down in the philosophical and social aspects of communism, it does do an interesting fly-bye of the problems arising from ideology meeting the realities of human nature and the socio-economic system's own internal contradictions. There's a lot of cool, interesting ideas in the story, and a fascinating setting, but the game is too fast-paced to let its characters or its ideas get fully fleshed out.The characters themselves are a bit of a problem element. Characterization for individuals and relationships between characters change rapidly and without much warning; in the space of a single interaction, for example the player character can go from joking and jovial to murderous rage for little to no reason.Gameplay: The combat is very fun from start to finish. There are 4 primary weapon types at your disposal: melee, guns, energy weapons, and the powers provided by the glove. These 4 can be combined in any which way you want, with different enemies calling for different offensive solutions. Though I preferred going in guns blazing, using the glove for crowd control, many situations called for alternative tactics that I had to improvise on the fly.The other major part of the gameplay is the puzzle system, which primarily takes place in large underground 'testing' areas. The puzzles usually involve either flipping switches to change up an environment, retrieving keys, or a combination of the two in increasingly complicated combinations. These are fun little diversions that can take up to an hour to complete each, depending on how quickly you can solve each puzzle.Crafting: One of the major faults of the game is the crafting system. I would say a good 1/4 of the time I spent playing was spent collecting every chest of craft materials I could find, and boy are there a LOT of them. There are probably thousands of chests, lockers, bags, and boxes scattered throughout the game, and if you spend the time collecting them all, you'll have fully upgraded weapons by about the halfway point. I had fully upgraded glove powers and weapons that I never used even once during the game. This leads to a major drop in difficulty, which lessened the impact of some of the bigger fights in the latter half of the game. Though still fun, having a fully upgraded telekinesis power lets you take out full groups of even tougher robots without breaking a sweat.I would advise the development team for any future sequels to lessen the number of crafting resources so that players are forced to make tough choices about which powers and weapons to upgrade."

Aesthetics are great, gameplay makes sense, plot is good. But it's not on it's own. It's so clearly a version of Bioshock, it's sometimes painful to play. And next to Bioshock it stands small. There are clear mistakes in exposition and cutscenes/action ratio, especially in the beginning. The protagonists doesn't behave as a person in the 50's would. It's modern hipster placed in 50's environment. Breaks the suspense of disbelief. Wasn't a problem in Bioshock. Action - bit boring, I have to say. Not that it's not challenging, but quickly grows stale. Certain things are bad, for example, sound from different groups you walk by gets all mixed up. Stupid mistake. On the other hand, soviet stylized look is excellent. That's a big plus. Plot on it's own good. Action is ok. Artwork is fantastic.Conclusion. On it's own it's a good game, not excellent, but good and interesting. Next to Bioshock it's a dwarf, unfortunately."

Repetitive and inventive combat.  Ok writing at best and only two like able characters.  Basically 3 enemy types and no real reason to use any of the powers in the game besides Mass Telekinesis.  I killed every boss in the game with a metal stick for fun, because all bosses basically followed the exact same fighting mechanic sequence.  Swing Dodge Swing Dodge, and you can basically beat any enemy. The ending(s) leaves  me feeling unfulfilled and without resolution. On sale for about $25-20 seems fair since again, it is gorgeous, but anymore and I can't truly recommend it.  Do yourself a favor and go buy any Bioshock instead."

Yes, there is blood and gore and sexual content as the game warns you about prior to playing or even viewing the page. No, I am talking about the game mechanics. When I viewed others game play and read early reviews I kind of made the assumption the game was like Fallout open-world RPG. And to it's credit it makes look that way. But for me personally Atomic Heart feel like a Souls game. Down to finding your ""campfire"" to save your progress or die losing it all. But remember I have only played 6 hours, died many times losing progress. So does evolve into a Fallout like OWRPG? Don't know... guess I will keep playing or die trying."

This action-packed first-person shooter by Russian developer Mundfish captivates players with its stunning graphics, satisfying combat mechanics, and a gripping narrative.Graphics: A Visual MasterpieceAtomic Heart's visuals are a testament to the power of modern gaming. The game's incredibly detailed environments transport players to an alternate Soviet Union, seamlessly blending the nostalgic aesthetics of the past with futuristic, bizarre elements. The meticulous attention to detail is evident in the beautifully rendered landscapes and eerie, yet captivating, creature designs. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle further enhance the immersive experience, making it hard not to get lost in this surreal world.Combat Mechanics: Intuitive and EngagingThe game's combat system is both intuitive and engaging, offering a variety of melee and ranged weapons that cater to different playstyles. Each weapon feels unique, with satisfying feedback and impact as you take down the game's grotesque enemies. The combination of crafting, upgrading, and customization allows players to tailor their approach to combat, ensuring that no two playthroughs are the same.Enemy AI is intelligent and challenging, pushing players to adapt and strategize during each encounter. This keeps the combat fresh and exhilarating, as you're constantly discovering new tactics to deal with the ever-evolving threats.Story: A Gripping Narrative That Keeps You HookedOne of the most compelling aspects of Atomic Heart is its rich and immersive storyline. The game unravels a fascinating narrative that delves into themes of science, technology, and humanity's darker instincts. Players take on the role of a Soviet KGB officer tasked with investigating a research facility that has gone dark, leading to a thrilling journey filled with twists and turns.While the story can be cryptic at times, the well-crafted pacing and world-building create a sense of intrigue that encourages exploration and discovery. The game's characters are well-developed, and their voice acting is superb, further adding to the overall immersive experience.Conclusion: Atomic Heart - A Must-Play ExperienceAtomic Heart is a remarkable game that offers players a unique blend of breathtaking graphics, exciting combat mechanics, and a captivating story. Its intriguing world and the sheer variety of gameplay ensure that every moment of the 50-hour playtime is enjoyable and memorable.

929,Choler Ichor,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036335718/,1,,1,32.4,March,17,245,0,1,"TL;DR - I crowdfunded this game years ago when I first heard about it, and I feel like I received wonderful return on my investment. Can hardly ask for more than that, can you? If you think Atomic Heart looks cool, give it a try!Overall score: [3.5/5]Story was fine, not amazing but good enough to make me want to find out what happens next. Characters range from intriguing to obnoxious. If you're an English speaker like me, I highly recommend turning on Russian Audio with English subtitles in the title menu; the English translation and voice acting is a bit rough at times, the native Russian audio has much better cadence and tone. The two endings are... interesting. With the studio's size being what it is, there are some obvious limitations on variety: enemies, powers, locations. Weapons actually had decent variety, though there is obviously favoritism in the design of the Zvezdochka (i.e. it is extremely fun, powerful and practical to use) which I felt makes it an auto-take over other melee weapons. This game wears its influences on its sleeves - Bioshock, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., even little bits from games like Dying Light - but undoubtedly puts its own unique twists on the gameplay, design and world-building. Big props to the developers for their vision. Some of the bugs range from negligible to occasionally infuriating, worst among them for me was getting stuck on objects and ""falling"" forever without being able to ever get out, requiring loading up my last save. There's a decent amount of content if you enjoy scavenging and finding all weapon upgrades like I do. Puzzles and boss fights are simplistic but are designed well with interesting gimmicks and don't feel like BS - Boss fights could stand to last a little longer. The game starts out with combat being a decent challenge, and as you upgrade you can find awesome flow in combat, and truly more than one way to build your character that rewards skillful gameplay. Maybe I just found really strong power and weapon interactions with my build, but the game can start to feel very easy if you've scoured all Testing Facilities and fully upgraded your character and arsenal. I had to boost the difficulty to maximum about halfway through to feel like I was still being challenged, and even then it was hard to even put me on the ropes.Nearly all criticisms written here are just nit-picks: I am so proud of Mundfish for what they've made, and I am very happy I supported them early on. I look forward to seeing what they do in the future."

The intricate mechanical designs, towering cloud-capped buildings, enchanting music, elegant ballerinas, and captivating art all contribute to its sheer beauty.However, an enchanting facade alone doesn't bring a world to life. The charming chorus of chirping creatures, insightful terminal journals, and engaging conversations with the ""talking dead"" all come together to breathe soul into this lively realm, making it both believable and immersive.Equally intriguing are the presentations of retro-futuristic technology. Robots, massive machinery, bio-mesh, polymer hive minds, jelly-like creatures, and even quantum entanglement music—all of these elements showcase the world's unique design. The humorous and clever ways these concepts are explained and presented only add to the charm.As a fan of this storytelling approach, I find it captivating. However, it might not be to everyone's taste.The story itself is decent—an average sci-fi tale with a predictable twist. The gameplay, unfortunately, falls short of expectations.If I were to judge this game solely on its artwork, it would easily earn a perfect 10/10.

939,Donut of Doom,https://steamcommunity.com/id/donutofdoom/,2,,0,8.9,March,14,413,0,1,"I haven't beaten the game yet and I think I'm half-way through. I'll update this further if I choose to beat the game. I wanted to like this game so bad, but I just cannot recommend it in good faith as there are too many things that ruin the playing experience for me. First, however, the good:The game is beautiful and it runs exceptionally well. I commend the developers for delivering a game that both looks and plays well.The gun play is fantastic and firearms feel like they actually have impact.Music is amazing when it actually works. Mick Gordon never misses with his compositions.Cool-looking loot mechanic, but it falls short of being useful in my opinion (details below).The ""just okay"":Climbing/Vaulting/Movement - There is climbing in this game, but only sometimes. During the first 6-8 hours of the game you're stuck in an industrial complex. Climbing is required in many sections here, but it's so incredibly slow and you can only release if you either look directly behind you and jump or if you look at another section you can jump and attach to. You cannot vault most things like the game implies (and at one point, explicitly states you can). There are some sections where you have to jump and dash to reach a climbable section. However, the game does not explain to you how to actually attach to the object (you have to hold space, but it only works sometimes). One tutorial states you must jump-dash across a gap to reach the other side. The gap is too wide to jump normally, so you must dash so you can just barely reach it. This causes an animation to play where you catch onto the ledge and pull yourself up. This only works ONCE and you will never be able to accomplish this again. Additionally, once you leave the complex and reach the outside world you'll be hard-pressed to find a section where you can climb or vault again.Open area environments - After you leave the complex you're greeted with a beautiful open area to explore. While it sure does look pretty, there is very little reason to actually explore the area. Sure, you get a few pieces of material to build items or a new weapon, but there are just so many enemies in the area, and they respawn infinitely. Do you expect to be able to use those climbing skills you used in the previous section? So did I.Weapons - There are a handful of weapons in the game, but so far (9 hours in) the only actual upgrade is the machete. It has more damage than the axe with a faster swing and charge time on the power attacks. It's just better in every way, so why not use that?Looting - The loot mechanic in this game is surprisingly intuitive and unique. On keyboard, by default, you must hold ""F"" and scan around the area to vacuum in resources. This falls apart, however, during actual use. In its presentation it shows a player moving around the room and simply vacuuming up everything. In practice, it's much slower and often doesn't grab all materials from containers. Additionally, after grabbing some loot the machine simply ""pauses"". The loot hand pulls down, waits for one second, then comes back up to loot some more. It's no game-changer, for sure, but these two problems combined make looting more frustrating than rewarding.Upgrading the character and gear- You eventually find an upgrade station where you can spend materials to upgrade your character and your gear as well as craft new weapons and items. While this mechanic is clearly useful and welcome, the user experience with this mechanic is downright frustrating. You interact with the upgrade station and are presented with three choices: upgrade self, upgrade equipment, and exit. After you choose one of the first two options a short loading animation plays and you're presented with the actual upgrades. Let's say you begin upgrading your character. The UI is a black background with red tables, red text, and red icons. Upgrades you cannot buy have red lines marked through them, but upgrades you CAN buy don't; they're simply a little darker. This is an issue because it's difficult to know what upgrades you have and which you don't at first glance. Also, Mass Telekinesis is the only power you'll ever need to purchase.If you choose to upgrade your gear you're presented with a much nicer UI. The weapon crafting and upgrade system is significantly easier to understand and use. You may also store and disassemble items here for materials. However, hovering over the items do not show any tool-tips that explain what the item does. You must first navigate to the ""Disassemble"" menu and click an item. That is the only menu where you can find any information about your inventory items. You can craft new weapons in this upgrade menu as well. It's loaded with all of the various weapons you can build in the game, even if you can't make them yet, so you know what to anticipate moving forward. With this information you can make more informed decisions on whether or not to spend resources now for a weapon or save them for later. Disassembling a weapon, upgrade part, or anything else will refund 100% of the materials, which I think is very nice. When you craft a new weapon you are booted out of the upgrade menu. The crafting station will play a neat-looking 3D-printing animation for the weapon you chose to craft. Once complete, you grab it and equip it. This looks nice and is a cool experience the first time. However, this happens every single time you craft a weapon and gets very tedious very quickly.You may also switch between the two menus without exiting and speaking to the crafting bot again, which is nice. What is not nice, however, is the unnecessary loading animation that plays when you swap between the two. Each time you switch between you are forced to wait a few seconds while a ""loading"" animation plays. I find this to be completely unnecessary and annoying to deal with. The developers could have just put everything into one menu, but chose not to. They also could have made the transition instant, but chose not to.The bad:Tutorials - Every time a tutorial pops up it completely interrupts the game. If you reload a save the tutorial will pop up again. Many times the pop-up happens during combat and completely ruins the flow.Music doesn't play - Music doesn't even play most of the time. I'm 9 hours into the game and I've only heard music play a handful of times. I've had to make sure my music volume was even on during my play, and it's set to 100%. The music simply does not play. It will sometimes play during combat, but I feel like the wrong music is playing when it actually works.The protagonist and his glove - This is one of the most unlikable protagonists I've ever experienced along with his smart-mouthed A.I. partner. The game starts out with the two bickering like an old married couple, but shortly after starting the game you learn that you just got this new experimental glove with an A.I. built into it. The way they both behave is completely contradictory to that fact. The protag also just WILL NOT SHUT UP. Most of what he says is whiny, childish, incessant banter. The A.I. partner will often give objectively helpful tips and the protag will respond with some comeback such as ""yeah, no ♥♥♥♥"" as if he was just insulted by the information. I honestly wished the long fall the protag took in the beginning crushed his left hand and his wind pipe and they both died, because they're both very unpleasant to listen to.English voice acting  - I don't know how the original voice acting sounds, but I can only hope it sounds much better than the english VO. Each line delivery sounds like the actors were recording with no direction. It becomes even worse when the protag is conversing with another individual. I can only reason that the dialogue between characters was recorded in separate instances. That's the only thing that makes sense to me because the flow of dialogue just feels so unnatural."

Played it after they released the FOV patch 1.3.5.0 and can recommend this. DISCLAIMER: Review is from a single playthrough on armageddon difficulty, all side objectives done and all weapons/abilities maxed.

Melee weapons with a ranged attack outclass all others, ammo-based weapons underperform versus energy ones and Mass Telekinesis and Polymer shield are basically free godmode, I barely died on Armageddon and was not forced to manage resources."

946,Red Aria,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004744150/,1,,0,9.7,March,12,695,0,1,"If i had to use one word to describe this game, it would be ""Soulless"".Now, thats a bit unfair, so let me explain. Visual design of the game - world design, graphics, animations, enemies etc - is fantastic. Its gorgeous, has a fitting style to it, and looks great. You have an interesting variety of weapons and special abilities aka bioshock, and i quite enjoyed the back-and-forth main character has with his glove sidekick.The problem is the level and gameplay loop. Having spent almost 5 hours doing exact same thing with exact same weapons against exact same enemies over and over, and constantly having to ""stop"" the fun loop of killing stuff to solve silly and simple puzzles, fetch quests and going back and forth to collect things, press buttons then collect more things, it becomes annoying. The main character constantly breaks fourth wall to talk about how annoying all these fetch quests are - cool, so why are they in the game, in such amount?""Oh, you need to go to the Cafe? Well door is locked and you need to collect 5 keys from areas around you. So you spend 2 hours collecting the keys, open the door, turns out the train to cafe is broken so now you have to collect 5 batteries from areas around you"". You spend more time doing ""fetch quests"" than actual story.But that's all still fine until you reach ""open world"" area. Thats when you realise that the game design is just annoying. Not hard, not challenging, not difficult - annoying is the word. You are surrounded by robots, who keep respawning, who keep summoning more reinforcements, and who keep repairing each other. Your best bet, in this ""open world"", is to play stealth and hide. It would be fine if it was just one segment, but entire open world section is designed to make you stealth around. In a first person shooter game. Who's bright idea was this?In the end, i found myself losing interest, and once i reached the point where game told me to use its terrible map to find some ""Optional testing sites"" i realised i actually had no desire to continue, and stopped. A shame because it had a very strong start. It just... fumbled and fell face first into dirt shortly afterward. It desperately tries to be Bioshock, Prey and Deus Ex, but succeeds at being neither."

950,JackColor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JackColor/,1,1,0,12.5,March,12,168,0,1,"TL;DR: Lots of cool things, put together a bit poorly.This game is like several pristine ingredients for a meal, mixed with one or two incorrect ones, and unfortunately not fully cooked well.Ultimately, the universe, setting, and characters are enjoyable, even the cringeworthy main character who is written to be a complete dumbass who's got bravado and no other skills. But the actual gameplay itself is 50/50 with good things and bad things: - The game is riddled with puzzles for door locks. Some are simple, some are complex, all of them are not worth the effort for opening a door. + The gunplay feels very good. + Good weapon variety and customization. + Most of the interactions with enemies are not particularly interesting. The humanoid enemies are exceptionally identical. They're all quite spongey. - Many puzzles for progressing don't actually serve the plot. Often times they amount to a hallway and inbetween both sides is a series of fetch quests for literally no reason other than padding gameplay with busy work. + The game DOES defy expected narrative plot lines. I expected a couple of twists and, at least for me, it impressively did not go as planned. - There are moments in puzzles or movement areas where your progress needs to be redone if you accidentally miss a jump or otherwise move incorrectly. While its not a huge deal, theres been considerable moments where I'd rather quit the game than run through the same boring puzzle a second time. - It is incredibly easy to soft lock yourself by getting stuck on terrain collisions. - Both Endings seem to be missing something. Hopefully DLC would add more story to the game. Currently the normal version seems somewhat short."

957,Varrukt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/varrukt/,1,,1,27.9,March,12,344,0,1,"Atomic Heart is a captivating first-person shooter that combines science fiction and horror elements to create a unique gaming experience. The game's setting, a surreal alternate reality where technology has advanced beyond our current understanding, is a marvel to behold. The world is filled with bizarre, otherworldly creatures, and the various locations you'll explore are hauntingly beautiful.The gameplay of Atomic Heart is engaging and fun, with satisfying gunplay that feels impactful and weighty. The game borrows elements from other first-person shooters, such as Bioshock and Half-Life, but still manages to feel fresh and exciting. There's a wide variety of weapons and abilities to experiment with, and the game encourages you to approach combat encounters with creativity and ingenuity.But where Atomic Heart truly shines is its story. As you explore the game's world, you'll uncover a complex narrative filled with intrigue and mystery. The game's plot centers around a Soviet research facility that has fallen into chaos after a mysterious incident. As you progress through the game, you'll encounter a wide cast of characters, each with their own motivations and agendas. The story is full of twists and turns, and it's sure to keep you engaged throughout.The graphics of Atomic Heart are also worthy of note. While the game's visuals may not be as stunning as some of the earlier trailers implied, they are still impressive. The attention to detail in the game's environments and character models is top-notch, and the game's lighting and particle effects add to the immersive experience.Performance-wise, I did not encounter any significant issues or glitches during my playthrough. The occasional missing texture on robot models was a minor issue, but it did not detract from the overall experience.In conclusion, Atomic Heart is a must-play for fans of first-person shooters and science fiction. The game's unique setting, engaging gameplay, and captivating story make it a standout title that is well worth the investment."

The game takes place in an alternate timeline of 1955 Soviet Union where the robots and mutants have gone rampant and caused a lot of chaos in the city. P-3 and his glove ''companion'' Char-Les find themselves on a dangerous mission to find out the truth and the people responsible.  On occasion, P-3 was stuck in Limbo and reaches back to regain consciousness but the unfortunate part is that he starts to question his reality and everything around him before making up his own mind.

I thought people were over exaggerating how much it was pro Russia but in context it's in the 1950's post WW2 so it shouldn't come as any surprise you're in the Soviet Union with lots of red flags around.  Between melee weapons, electric weapons and bullet weapons you get a sizable set to choose from.  I've found bugs everywhere including lootable containers still showing up after being looted, being stuck in-between rocks / ground, enemies glitching through walls  / ground and being stuck in the polymer ♥♥♥♥ you swim through. The game runs smooth even though it requires a lot of ram so be sure to either turn down the graphics or shut everything down or both.

The Russian atom punk atmosphere is on point, the music and the gun play feels natural and very enjoyable.In deeper dept. First of all I am impressed by how optimized this game really is. I used a mid-low PC to run the game, specs were the following:Intel Core I3-710016GB DDR4 RAMGT1030The game was ran from a HDD.With all the settings on the lowest, and screen resolution is lowered to 1280 ✕ 720 the game performed at a stable 60 frames per second on the enclosed space environments. On the open world sections the frames per second was between 30-40. Even with the lowest setting the game was very much enjoyable and graphically beautiful.The gun play of the game with all the modifications feels good to play. The combat system is simple to pick up, yet it is well balanced on normal difficulty.The open world sections contain fights, which may feel punishing, when not your arsenal is not yet upgraded, but this can be fixed by doing side missions (testing grounds). During your game I would suggest looting everything that is possible, as few bosses may require your whole inventory worth of ammunition to defeat. The game also contains puzzles and parkour parts, which I was personally a fan of as it broke the never ending chaotic battles, that the game can provide. Even if some of the puzzles could be broken or skipped by doing a bit of a parkour.The games world is absolutely beautiful and well crafted, everywhere you look the scenery gives back the feeling of a atom punk Soviet Union, this is paired with the nice sound tracks and music. Apart from the main story line you can pick up certain background story or few little stories during you exploration, which could give you a much broader perspective about the games world.The story line is one of the best I've seen in a long time. I will not go into details as I would not want to spoiler any pun/twist/core information that this game can provide. The overall story completion on normal difficulty with all the side missions took me roughly 23 hours.The overall problem that I have ran into multiple times was few doors like elevators or scripted doors didn't opened, when they should have. This could be fixed by restarting the game, which could be easily done since the game has safe zones almost every corner with save point in it.Over all, I think that even if this game is one the more cost heavy side of games that steam could offer, I feel like that the game and the story that you will receive, very much worth it and I could only recommend it to anyone."

989,"Sheev-en, God Emperor",https://steamcommunity.com/id/sheev-en/,1,,1,35.6,March,7,433,0,1,"is a wonderful alternate history game -- a sort of lite I-Sim. The combat is intense and satisfying, the exploration rewarding, the world fascinating, and the music is simply to die for. While the setting is very well executed, the narrative is merely serviceable. Had the narrative focused more heavily on the ideologies (e.g. Scientific Socialism, the authority of the state over the individual, etc.) and philosophical questions (e.g. the nature of consciousness, the morality of utilizing androids/robots as a subservient group, etc.) built into the world of this alternate U.S.S.R., I think that the overarching story would have been more interesting and less relegated to the world of tropes and needless comparisons to other great works of the same genre (e.g. ) that serve only to diminish the story's power and intrigue."

It had cool world design and most of the levels were fun but the open world was pretty useless for the most part and I couldn't be bothered to do almost any side content. The English dub definitely made many of the cutscenes come off very unnatural which made the story harder to take seriously but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. I didn't mind the banter during gameplay most of the time either. However the enemy variety was pretty terrible and even though I did almost no side content by the end I was very tired of the lackluster variety. However on the contrary the boss fights were always fun especially the final boss fight with the only bad one being the red goop guy which is dreadful. I'm personally not a fan of the way they handled the ending but what can ya do. Overall it was pretty decent and was enjoyable enough to make me not regret spending my $45. I wouldn't really say its worth the full $60 however, but that's just me"
998,Magatsu Cloud,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cloud8745/,2,,1,48.6,March,6,"1,856",0,1,Atomic Heart nails at times reminds me of a hybrid of Bioshock and Dying Light. The game is incredibly fun and I really enjoyed exploring the (Open World) and doing things when I wanted. The puzzles are pretty fun even if there are a little too many at points tbh. The story ramps up near the end of the game and sadly is when it gets really interesting! Before that point though you have a protagonist who may be one of the most annoying I have listened too for awhile...even if it's technically explained near the end of the game. However the game itself is fun enough to push me through! Fantastic music of course! (Will update later but the game is above average for sure!)

It's WAY better that way.A lot of love went in to this game. Maybe too much love. There's a lot of ideas the developers couldn't let go of that manifest themselves in unrealistic dialogue and a mistrust of the player to find their way through a story. There's something rigid and awkward about the pacing. Music direction is weird but usually works. Visual masterpiece. All other problems could be twice as bad and it would still be great.

1008,Slufzky,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Slufzky/,1,,1,15.7,March,5,70,0,1,"A USSR Fever Dream. 9/10.An Outer Worlds, Fallout, Destiny symphony well worthy of its popularity. As is my usual format, Ill break down aspects of the game and leave it to you to decide if you want to play. This will contain NO spoilers, just general information about the game and my opinions.Gameplay and Story-Atomic Heart is a rather short, yet extensive game, with a plethora of dialogue, endings, and choice when going about your playthrough. The game took me a little over 15 hours to complete without doing much exploring, but could easily be done in 10 hours or shorter if one sat down and grinded the game (which i don't recommend). The story is complex, with many characters, bosses, monsters, and various robot types. The endings are incredibly complex, and the story itself is full of twists and turns, and leaves you constantly trying to figure it out. Ill comment on the protagonist in its own piece, as i think he could get a paragraph to himself. The game didn't feel repetitive, although, I do wish you could skip cutscenes... only in a few instances did i find myself replaying a boss (the first twin) and dreading that the save was right before a cutscene. Outside of that, the story kept my attention and was well worth trying to figure out. Just try not to overthink the hallucination stuff... In terms of powers and weapons, some definitely stand out as being much better than others, but all in all, you do get variety in how you want to play and defeat enemies. I found myself mostly sticking to the shotgun and the AK, but if you wanted to pursue the other weapons, or tackle a melee run, you absolutely could. Just don't forget to stock up on elemental charges! This game looks unique, and has a beautiful aesthetic, mirroring on the Outer Worlds or occasionally Destiny/Fallout. With a massive open-world map and a decent looting mechanic, there is lots of exploring potential. This game falls short on actually giving you a reason to explore though, as there is no waypoint mechanic beyond main objective waypoints, and no real side quests. You can explore other facilities at your leisure, and can come across weapon upgrades and perhaps be able to upgrade your weapons to the max- but this is by no means essential unless you're playing the hardest difficulty. You can beat all of the bosses with the unupgraded shotgun and the axe if you want to, it may take you a little bit longer but its absolutely doable. All-n-all, i found myself most dissapointed by the large abyss of a map- if i could change one thing, it'd be to give players a reason to explore the massive map youve clearly put time into creating. Give it substance, a sidequest or an easter egg, something.The Characters, Protagonist, Antagonists and Bosses -This game was a fantastic example of the more the merrier. A ton of different kinds of robots, monsters, and enemies are available in the game to face at different points, and the variation in the bosses and how to beat them is just incredible. The game had several bosses, majority of them being robots, and majority of them being fun, interesting, and challenging to fight. Id actually argue that the final boss fight isn't as tough as some of the previous ones (but this REALLY depends on your difficulty and playstyle... in the hardest gamemode, i'm SURE this is much different)... The medium difficulty is definitely a recommended place to start, as some enemies will be incredibly easy, but some bosses may take a few tries to nail. The PROTAGONIST is one of the most unique characters i've ever seen, as he is one of the most entertaining, yet braindead characters ever made. He has a lot of funny and interesting dialogue, especially with CHAR-LES and NORA, but falls short on the brains aspect. He is a 1-trick. Hes funny, and badass, but that's about it. Hes clueless majority of the game, very naive, makes very questionable decisions majority of the game out of the players control, and is all-n-all, unpredictable. I found myself gasping at some of his decisions and his thought process. Lets just say, hes not the brightest. The game is full of antagonists and bosses, and they're all rather interesting. Having this portrayed in the USSR, you can tell the game is trying to play the sides of both the Capitalist and the Communist, and the banter between which is better. This plays a role to some extent as to why decisions are made by the Protagonist/Antagonist, but can easily be ignored. The Antagonists are genuinely unpredictable, and the bosses are all unique, with different fighting styles and different appearances/purposes. Music -The music choice for this game was flawless... I love the variation, as you had some ""Fallout"" esq music, but then some ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" music. The game is full of Soviet classics, while also being covered by heavy metal. I tell you what, when you're going on a ""Killing Floor"" style rampage late game and that heavy metals kicks in, nothing beats it.Achievement Hunting -I'm sorry to break it to yall, but this game is not achievement huntable as of release. A reasonable chunk of the achievements are broken, most frustratingly. I pray the developers will fix them soon, but would say, as someone who likes to 100% games, this one was sad to see uncompletable. Ill be completely honest, i did genuinely enjoy this game, and think as its one of the studios earliest creations, that it makes me excited to see what they'll make in the future. The NORA scenes especially stand out to me, as they were my absolute favorites. I wish there was more with NORA throughout the story, but im just glad they had the idea in the first place. Anyways, i loved this game, and think you should give it ago if you have $60 and 15 hours to spare!"

When I saw a first trailer I immediately got hooked with the unique vision, style and design of this game. What happens with me really not often, especially last 7-8 years. I said to myself ""this is daym awesome, I WANT to play it!"". But next 5 years of development turned out to be really complicated as for a developers, so do for all the people who've been waiting: many scandals, rumors, provocations, disappointments, attempts to accuse this game in propaganda and even BAN this game just because it was made by russian developers. At the same time those dumb people didn't even try to think how long the team and main author was working on this project. Since 2008! Long time before this ""war"".But really-really dumb people don't care. And even now trying to accuse, complain, and even prophesying this game to repeat a destiny of cyberbug 2077.Even through this I didn't stopped believing and waiting for this game.Eventually the game was released.I pre-ordered it, finished it.And now I feel pity. I feel pity that this game ended.During whole my walkthrough I didn't want this game to end. No way.I visited every single polygon, visited every single location, found every single upgrade for every single weapon.And I want more.The design, the art-style, the music, the attention to details are mind-blowing! (many music tracks went to my playlist even)Fighting robots and mutants is fun and SO satisfying.Exploring is addictive. This unique style and details were keeping my interest during WHOLE walkthrough. I was always wondering ""what will be next, what will be further"". An interesting ""semi-open-world"" game in 2023?! Is that possible?! YES and YES!And don't forget this: NO LGBT-crap propaganda, FINALLY feminine characters that emphasize female beauty, NO diversity!The only disadvantage is a terrible, ugly hairstyle and hair colour of Filatova, like a crap from a modern world. But it can be fixed by mod soon, I suppose. And it doesn't ruin the experience.For a first project of developers it's a truly fantastic job.I'm extremily happy that games like Atomic Heart are still exist... among this idealess pile of neverending ""AAA-""bulls**t.You're one of the reason I'm still interested in videogames industry, Mundfish.Please, don't stop making such a unique games with unique worlds.And I'm sure I will definitely get back in this world again soon.9/10"

Very well-balanced, which is super hard to find these days. Some people say ""Oh the enemies are bullet sponges"" don't be those people. Those people are dumb. Use to tools the game gives you to think more than the desk your computer sits on and figure out enemy weaknesses. You get just enough ammo to always have it, but not enough to not worry about it. First few ""bosses"" feel like mini bosses, but that first real boss is good. I found myself going ""Oh snap, I don't think I'm ready for this"" and after getting beat up for a minute I was like ""ohhhhhhhh, that's what I'm supposed to do"" That's kind of how the whole game is at least up to where I'm at. The difficulty is good on normal. You feel challenged and engaged, but don't really die unless you mess up. I've died twice in 11 hours for those counting. Overall, I was pretty hyped seeing the trailers for this game but didn't get to play it for like a week after it came out. I started seeing reviews and had mixed expectations going in. I want to say wholeheartedly that this game is worth the money and time. If you like RPG's, a moderate and fair challenge, and interesting worlds that peak your intrigue this is the game for you. I only have two negative things to say about the game. 1. Sometimes the parkour mechanics are dumb and unintuitive. You may find yourself going ""NO NO DO NOT GRAB THAT LEDGE FFS LET GO"" and 2. The protagonist is a little annoyingly cynical. Like why are you so mad bruh? Who hurt you? Why do you gotta take it out on everyone around you? It's ok to feel other feelings sometimes. Overall, I definitely recommend this game if it's even close to the kind of games you're into, which if you are reading reviews it probably is. A fantastic first pitch by Mundfish, and I can't wait for what's to come from them."

This is not Soviet Bioshock, though it shares similarities in it's mechanics, it is something far more than a cheap clone knock off. Combat flows like a dream, very smooth melee and firearm gun play, backed by the satisfaction of crafting over half your own arsenal, all with their own unique upgrades. Puzzles are sprinkled here and there but integrated in a intelligent manner than co-insides with whatever you may be doing in the game at this time. Enemies as vast as the world is big, and the visual theme stays the course without including any out of place enviroments. The story and lore run deep within the confines of this alternate version of the USSR. Replay value is going to be huge."

Worth 60, probably if your a diehard bioshock fan. 100% worth it on sale. Id even say 40 or less and its worth the price. Ita very VERY clear that they are directly targeting the bioshock fans. Through gameplay and dialog as well as some random easter eggs. Story wise? Its really hard to beat bioshock 1. I mean the ""would you kindly"" twist is infamous in gaming at this point. Imho i think they assume you know that and kinda string you along thinking its just going to be a slightly different take. They pull their own stuff but its not the best story, not the worst either. Semi open world aspect is... alright i guess, could be better but thankfully its not like a ubisoft, go to 1000 places and touch a thing, compleatly optional. Combat, is solid but ppl can argue combat wasnt the selling point of bioshock either. Overall i would personally rate it an 8/10. Maybe 7.75ish.Playtime: ~25 hrs estimated 100% 40-50TLDR:Duke nukem goes to rapture"

(will update properly once I've had some rest)Update - So the game looks gorgeous considering it runs on UE 4. The game is really fun. Love the fact that you can respec and change up your style anytime without paying a fee or getting punished, don't know why more games don't allow this. I don't have time to replay your game 10 times... The soundtrack goes HARD ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. A good soundtrack can really make or break an experience.The game wasn't perfect tho. Some bugs in the inventory which, in general, could have been a lil more user friendly but it was not tooo bad either. There was one point where I got stuck on a piece of the environment and had to re load. A super unfortunate thing is no manual save slots so if I gotta replay a section I like I gotta restart the game.A lot of people are saying the story is basic but I enjoyed the multiple twists so maybe i'm just a smooth brain who is easily entertained.Loved the references to Bioshock (which has very clearly inspired this game) one of my favorite game series. The references to both rapture and columbia are brilliant.Love this style as well. We have explored the retro futuristic American vision a bunch of times so I was happy to see a new take on this idea.I don't know how I feel about being sexually harassed by a fridge tho lmao.The antagonist was super aggressive but it wasn't annoying or anything. Hell sometimes I even agreed with his impatience. I'm excited to see what they do with the DLC.Also lastly, finally a fun game after the immense disappointment which was Callisto Protocol and the absolute snore fest which was Hogwarts legacy."

One can’t say these developers are not talented. The initial set piece alone is a great example of how they want the tone of their game to be perceived. That’s also one of the reasons why I believe this game will be liked or disliked completely by many players after experiencing that initial set piece. Characters are so over the top, the story is so utopian, the dialogues are so abundant with words (all kinds of words!), it all is a little overwhelming at times. But it works, at least it worked for me.After that initial set piece, you will traverse the semi-open world each time to reach the other chapters of the story, and this is where we begin to experience some frustration though. This semi-open world is quite difficult, due to the multiple cameras that will alert nearby enemy robots if you are spotted. A large number of enemies makes these combat encounters very hard, and you will think twice before exploring parts of the map that are away from the main track. This is a pity because the 8 testing grounds (think of them as some kind of dungeons) scattered throughout the world are another example of great level design from Mundfish. The fact that you can temporarily disable these cameras doesn’t help, unfortunately. Speaking of combat, almost all robot types have some sort of knockback attack. I have often found myself surrounded by enemies against a wall without the opportunity to escape because of this. It’s also rarely happened to find myself stuck in the environment. All these drawbacks are quite frustrating and not fun at all, and only if the player can see past them, they will enjoy this game as a whole.This is a very well-optimized game that will run at high framerates on many PCs and look very good! There is a graphics shader pre-compilation the first time the game is loaded, resulting in a stutter-free experience. There are several options in the settings, but there is no sign of a FOV slider, which could be a deal-breaker for some.Mundfish have stated that they don’t like their game to be compared with others, they believe it has its own identity. Still, it’s hard not to see traces of Bioshock in its combat; of Duke Nukem in the attitude of its protagonist; of Prey in its level design. And all of these traces blend together in a package that can favorably surprise the player in many ways. The many different upgrades make the combat a lot of fun; all the lockpicking minigames are some of the most original and enjoyable that I have encountered in the last few years of gaming and the music is always spot-on. There is a lot to like, that’s for sure. Hopefully, Mundfish will expand upon this game (4 DLCs are planned to be released in the future) and their next work will be even better. I honestly can’t wait for it.Dear reader, please be informed that this game and Mundfish are the subjects of a lot of controversies, due to them seemingly having ties with the Russian government (primarily this, but they have also been criticized for sexism and racism). Please make some research and judge for yourself if you are willing to buy this product or not."

В игре имеются мелкие косяки и какие-то технические мелочи, но я ничего критичного не встретил, а то, что встречал, решалось загрузкой предыдущего сейва. Нареканий никаких нет. Темп у игры, правда, разный. Первая третья более медленная и вдумчивая, прям коридорная, дальше только быстрее, динамичнее и масштабнее. Чувствуется, что на разных этапах пытались копировать какие-то механики из других игр. Тут и от DOOM / Wolfenstein есть (в основном в последней трете), и от Bioshock / Prey (в первой половине), есть интересные находки с головоломками, замками, полигонами. Игра не заходит в полной мере на сторону иммерсив-симов (не хватает этого), но где-то рядом топчется, периодически залетая в чистый экшен и шутер. Тут даже нашлось место Ubisoft-вышкам, которые никакой пользы, кроме как получение чертежей для крафта не несут. Стелса, при этом, нет, он просто отсутствует как данность.Озвучка специфическая, диалоги местами тоже, главный герой вообще изрядно наивен и местами туп. Более того, звуковой дизайн местами своеобразен, звук идет сразу изо всех источников как будто бы (ну или у меня наушники как-то шалят), при этом саундтрек вообще топ. Все новое - это хорошо забытое старое, ремиксы отличные. Топ за свои деньги."

This game stands out thanks to its extensive graphic themes and exploration opportunities. Along with being among the best in gaming, the music has an astounding variety that gives it the right flair. There is a lot of enjoyable exploring and puzzle solving, and all the tributes to the games that inspired it are beautiful and classy. Although it isn't quite as immersive and realistic as I'd like, Bioshock was the main source of inspiration. The storyline and presentation of some of the cutscenes bothered me in some ways, but overall I found the plot to be enjoyable. They all felt out of place and uncomfortable. I was unprepared for this game. I didn't have any expectations, yet the game met them. Although there is an open world, it is not as tedious as most open world games. It is a small world that only serves to further the plot. You access ""hubs"" called training grounds to obtain more riches and enhance your weapons. It's a nice touch that the game tells you just what improvements you can discover in certain practice areas. This way you can focus on the upgrades for the weapons you desire and ignore others. However game was so captivating that I ended up completing most of the training grounds, it simply was fun. Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot. Combat alone, if you're a bit out of the box thinker, is too damn fun. That alone made the game super enjoyable for me. This is a great game that is a labor of love and it shows. I'd recommend checking this out if you enjoy shooters."

The whole world is such a breath of fresh air when you look at a lot of the newer games that come out half-baked with micro-transactions and battle passes. Not to say those things automatically spell a failure of a game, but it has been a while that a game has slowly eased me into it's world and had me reading every extra file and listen to every audio log. My only critique is when you are at the ending of the game you REALLY feel it. As in you just get 30-ish minutes of context, a moment where you are giving 2 options (that don't matter at all) and then you continue to the final bosses/cutscene. It wasn't necessarily a bad ending but it definitely made me want more, in the good way. The same way you eat macaroni and cheese and get sad when your bowl is empty. Overall a definite recommend if you are trying to mix it up, especially if you haven't played bioshock in 10 years like me."

Totally happy with it., like Plasmids from BioShock, which allows you to launch bolts of electricity and freeze enemies with a cone of cold out of your palm. Control gravity itself. Or ""jizz"" on enemies with a sticky polymer. Which you can all upgrade. And yes, you feel those upgrades. , from basic shotguns and axes to railguns and rocket launcher. I only use half of them and was really happy with them, even tho I would have like some more variety in their category. You get 1 shotgun, 1 kalasch rifle, 1 rocket launcher and so forth. Only exception are the melee weapons, which are the highlight for me. + you get 2 types of ammunition. Normal ammo, and infinite energy ammo, which has to regenerate., which work half the time really good and then you get frustrated because the climbing mechanic in this game could need a big improvement. You get a basic ""sprint"" but it is basically a dodge/shift. Nothing great, but it works, most of the time., that go from stupidly easy to ""who in their right mind thought of that"". Most of the game is really fun and it's quick and fun to explore, with some small exceptions. If you're the type of player that wants to get every part of glowing loot you can find then you have to accept that some doors need a special type of code, which you have to find. Somewhere near.... hopefully. 90% fun 10% rework this ****** ****!, look I'm not a great story enjoyer, I play games for gameplay. But I enjoyed the story pretty much.

Its similar to your run and gun shooter like bio shock mixed with some other aspects but honestly, it should be classified as its own game. The story line is explained mainly through text and dialogue. At first it's linear then its open world and i must say, the setting and theme is amazing. It was the sole reason I bought the game. The guns are pretty unique.What I like the most though is that it is not grindy and is super casual. The gun attachment system of dungeons was a really good idea. This game PERFECTLY ties in everything without adding too much. Looting feels surprisingly fun (which is weird since most games make it so tiring). The scenery is great and everything about the world, enemies, guns, etc just really holds it all together.With all that said, there are still some bugs and issues that will probably get fixed, but this game has to be the best $60 I ever spent on a game.

Rarely had any lag spikes even setting everything on Max/Ultra on my old rig, I was very impressed.Unfortunately I do feel the game is a fair bit short for its asking price, while I do 100% recommend this game I'd also say wait it out and try to find a good deal, but that should always be the case."

Сама история постоянно открывает новые детали, заставляющие порой кардинально менять отношение к различным героям. Прокачка как навыков, так и оружия даёт возможность выбирать наиболее полезные в данный момент улучшения с умом, а ""секретные"" полигоны делают поиск рецептов для модернизации очень интересным благодаря разнообразным загадкам. И, конечно, нужно отдельно выделить саундтрек... нет, . Он настолько увеличивает атмосферность, что порой просто стоишь на месте ради песен, а порой идёшь в открытый бой вместо скрытности ради него.Есть и некоторые негативные детали. Основная - открытая местность. Во-первых, ориентирование на ней трудновато из-за малофункциональной карты, а во-вторых, уж слишком легко и быстро восстанавливаются противники, это порой надоедает. Также стоит отметить бесполезность почти всех навыков, кроме телекинеза и шока, и отсутствие чего-то столь очевидного, как огонь. Несмотря на такие недостатки, игра определённо стоит прохождения, а команда разработчиков - поддержки. В ожидании DLC..."

It is a solid game release for this new game developer. Graphics, game play, and character upgrades are very smooth and easy. The game was very enjoyable to play with a deep story with very few bugs. I'm looking forward to the addition of DLC, that being said its hard to justify buying the game at full price.There are some things that did bug me about the game. The biggest thing on my list is that there is a massive map but its all empty space. There is nothing to find or do outside the main quest and weapon upgrades besides kill robots. There is no reward system for exploring the map either, by that I mean there is nothing to explore. If you are going to give us a open world map the least you can do is fill it with places to explore and not empty space. The 2nd thing on the list of gamer sins is how fast you can complete the game. I did everything the open world had to offer and still beat the game in 31 hours. At the moment there is no reason to replay the game either so you are looking at $2 per game play hour if not more."

Like talking to some of the dead bodies their lines sometimes cut off early same happened with one of the endings during the fight both people talking had their lines cut short for me. Also the last computer you look at with that ending was in Russian which I can't read so even though I got tired of reading from the previous facility where you learned about your character and what's going on I couldn't get the last bit of info because couldn't read it.The jumping/climbing puzzles were very annoying with the jumping mechanics (no running just regular movement speed, jumping which sometimes you just jump up instead of forwards and the jumping from climbing on something was weird to learn and still missed or almost missed most jumps a decent amount of the time making the climbing parts the most stressful part of the game since I believe all my deaths were from falling playing on the easiest difficulty).There were a few times I got stuck. One there was a ""hole"" on the map somewhere where there was rocks on both sides which you can't walk on rock (guessing it's to prevent you from going where you're not supposed to or preventing dumb stuff like climbing up the side of a hill/mountain). To get unstuck sometimes it just pushes you out but in the spot I got stuck I had to spam jump and dodge (I could only jump when I hit the piece of ground between the rocks).I do hope we see more of this world but maybe a little less of the laboratories/facilities since it felt like 90% of the game was in facilities and I got tired of the Polygons (the Testing Grounds which are basically dungeons with puzzles and/or fights in order to get new blueprints for weapons). (Final edit) I just remembered the one lock puzzle where (the 2 times i unlocked them) you need to find a slip of paper with the code on it by a dead body was kinda dumb. I believe I didn't unlock 2 of those doors due to not wanting the search an entire building for a dead body with a piece of paper.For weapons, I mostly just used the Snowball, Electro, MP and KS-23 the whole game (once unlocking each). I tried the Pashtet (machete, just felt weak), Fox (hand axe also felt weak), Swede (fire axe, first melee weapon so kinda have to use it), Kalash (I swapped to it when my MP ran out of ammo then switched back to the MP once that ran out of ammo. The Kalash burns through the ammo it gets), Dominator (energy weapon that if I remember correctly is kinda like a machine gun it was weak, inaccurate and weird to use in my opinion). I didn't try any of the other weapons besides firing the Railgun once to see what that was like."

1116,Sam,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047109828/,1,,1,20.9,February,26,224,0,1,"The best I can say is that the game is alright. Combat is exceptional. Most games fail to live up to this level of excitement when it comes to combat, so that is probably the biggest plus. The story makes sense and none of it feels forced or unrealistic, except for maybe the end but I'll get to that. Weapons are awesome and unique, and really add onto the feeling of being a badass soldier. The enemies are all unique as well, and are reasonably challenging without being annoying or frustrating to play against.No game is without its negatives though and Atomic Heart does have a few. The first that I noticed is the puzzles/locks. They were fine at first, but about halfway through the game, after you've solved 30+ puzzles and unlocked every door known to man, they get super intrusive to the pace of the game to the point where I ended up following a guide or just straight up left the area to do something else.This last point may be more of just a personal gripe, but the ending, similar to the puzzles, require you to perform some mental gymnastics in order to figure out which of your two choices leads to the best ending. If you choose wrong, you're going to have to spend about 20-30 minutes replaying through a long talking sequence, as they didn't put a save point at any time in between these points. Of course you could just look up the other ending, but I find it more satisfying to play it rather than watch. I won't go into details to avoid spoiling, but long story short is that if you aren't a fan of thinking in games like this, you might have difficulty figuring out what is what at the end. I will also say that the good ending does leave a lot to be desired, as it feels like it ends too quickly. That is not the case with the bad ending however, but that is of course the bad ending, so it isn't very desirable either. Overall I do think the game is worth the money as I never really felt bored or uninterested, and it brings something fresh this genre. I think the devs did a very good job at designing this game, and I look forward to maybe seeing a sequel to this game in the future."

1122,xcallista,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xcallista/,1,,1,39.5,February,26,97,0,1,"To start off, this game had almost no bugs. Some annoying stuff here and there like getting stuck on geometry, not being able to loot some boxes, the achievements are bugged, and some cutscenes had big FPS drops (might be due to my toaster graphics card). However, while I was configuring my settings in Chelomey at the beginning of the game, I noticed that objects in the distance had this ""pixelated blurriness"" to them that wasn't fixed by changing any of the graphics options. Perhaps devs will fix it soon, nothing I did solved the problem.The combat is nice, you have your usual assault rifle, shotgun, pistol, along with several heavy weapons and melee weapons to pick from. Using the axe is a bit tedious but that's on me as I never bothered to try out the other melee weapons. I really love the telekinetic attacks, lifting and smashing enemies into the ground feels ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ great. Weapon upgrades are found in underground testing facilities which are Portal-esque puzzle areas that you have to get through. No enemies. I played the game on Normal, expecting to find bugs.The music in Atomic Heart is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fantastic. As someone who listens to Soviet-era Russian music, it was nice to hear Zemlyane and Kino playing over the ""Radio of the Future.""  I can only imagine what it is like for people living in post-Soviet countries who grew up listening to it. For people who hate the English dub, Russian with English subtitles is a whole lot better. As someone who understands but a handful of words in Russian, the delivery of lines sounds better. The subtitles are a bit small and hard to read and fight at the same time, but devs are working on that for the next patch, and it wasn't that annoying so it's ok for me. For the people concerned about ""glorification of Communism"" (lol) the way I described Kollektiv 2.0 to my friend was ""hypercollectivization."" Collectivism taken to the extreme, where your mind and body would become part of what is essentially a giant country-sized hivemind.  I think the most important thing to mention besides all of that is the fact that this is Mundfish's first game, and it was infinitely less buggy (at least for me) than some of the other games released in the past year or two. Cyberpunk 2077, Battlefield 2042, Fallout 76, big name AAA games made by industry veterans like CDPR, DICE, and Bethesda, all released in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ buggier state than Atomic Heart; some were just straight up unfinished broken piles of ♥♥♥♥ on release. Brand new IP, new game, new development studio, and they still managed to release a better product than the biggest names in video games. All in all this game gets 8.5/10 crispy critters.

Like the starting area takes around a quarter of the entire game of you just running around labyrinths doing repetitive tasks.- The game is not really open world. Sure it technically exists, but 85-90% of the gameplay does not happen in it, rather making you enter a one-way isolated underground locations. Moreover the ""open world"" has zero practical sense to it, as you cant go clearing up the areas earning completionist gratification, and there isn't much to find around it other than some weapon mods, literally.- The UI is a bit lacking. Open world map is literally unusable and useless in the scheme of things: no option to see it all or even most of it at once (zoom out is not possible), no legend of any sort or even indication of things. There isn't any meters for completionism, level requirements, story progress and bio updates for the important characters.- The ending idea is great, however execution makes it feel a quite a bit rushed. Let's just say the game ends abruptly after the final fight, very.Even despite all of this, it's truly a AAA title and considering it's devs first entry, and it actually works pretty well on release, it is definitely worth trying and keeping an eye on developers future works,"

They are quick and expressive and in my opinion HIGHLY enjoyablyI often found myself wanting to reload a save JUST to redo the fight.melee weapons are hefty,brutal and I found them satisfying to useThe puzzles keep you thinking and entertained without running you down.The abilities, while short and few; are useful and giving you the edge you need when fighting and I found myself using them A LOT.OVERALL; Its worth the purchase and if you are concerned about the short story playtime then buy it on sale, Problem solved. However for what the game is and it being this developers FIRST major title.. it is VERY impressive! It is a semi-open world so expect glitches, we should know this by now. I for one didn't experience any real.. glitches that I can think of aside from getting locked behind a door but I had just saved so I just loaded the save point and it never happened again.My only real issue I had with this game was the platforming. Your character has a bit of momentum when landing a jump so it can became quiet annoying after a bit but once you account for it, its smooth sailing.I give this game 8/10 its worth playing, experiencing and enjoying. It might be short story wise but overall its a blast to play and I am happy with it."

An extra minute at lunch is a minute stolen from the people"".  There's just a creepy, dystopian feel to everything.  Clearly very inspired by bioshock but not quite as serious as a bioshock game with some very Serious Sam level dialogue which might put some people off but I think makes sense for the setting.  You'd be cynical too if you lived in an orwellian dystopia. Lots of comparisons to Wolfenstein out there.  The game runs really smooth with only the occasional stutters.

1147,Jerot,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ToGJerot/,1,,1,19.6,February,25,893,0,1,"The game is a bit of a fever dream but it was an enjoyable one. Early game melee combat felt bad but once you get some decent weapons unlocked it improves drastically. Particularly the Pashtet with the ranged special upgrade. The guns felt good to use. The story itself was interesting but without going into spoilers the ending left a lot to be desired. There was some jank, a couple of texture bugs, getting caught on geometry, most notably the achievements appear to be broken as your progress doesn't seem to carry between deaths or re-loads, meaning for some you would have to complete most of the game in one sitting to get them unlocked. Hopefully this is fixed retroactively. The quality of the dialogue was all over the place, at times it felt weirdly paced, through the early game I wasn't a fan of the main character but the writing seemed to improve through the bulk of the game before falling off again towards the end. There might have been just a bit too much looting, but that could be on me for wanting to pick up everything. By the end I had thousands of the common materials but I used pretty much every uncommon/rare one I found to fully upgrade my weapons. Sometimes if you don't hover your mouse over a locker or chest long enough it doesn't pick up everything. Should probably just be 1-tap to fully loot. Mick Gordon boss and combat music was awesome as expected. Boss fights in generally were really fun, and most of the puzzles were interesting. The various lockpicking minigames were interesting too, though the one that acts similar to the 'Skyrim' style locks didn't have the clearest visuals. Having read into the developer and experienced the game for myself, a lot of the controversy around this game feels forced. This is far from russian or communist propaganda, it paints most of its driving characters as manipulative backstabbing psychopaths. In regards to the save room cartoon, it's close to 50 years old, and one particular scene has some racially questionable depictions, but they're animal people. They do little more than walk off a plane and shake someones hand before it jumps to the next cartoon, it seemed relatively harmless. And it illustrated that despite the 'progress' made due to the technological advancement, humanity still faced similar problems. It wasn't a communist utopia, even before the robots started killing. There were all kinds of logs and interactions that showed people suffering or being mistreated. Propaganda was used as a narrative tool more than truly trying to convince the player that these ideologies were superior in any way.Overall I think it's worth playing if you're interested in this type of game, though it might be worth waiting for some bug fixes, additional content, and potentially the price to drop first."

1158,Late4Work,https://steamcommunity.com/id/guitarzombee93/,1,,1,4.5,February,25,388,0,1,"Honestly, the game is great and I see the potential for multiple playthroughs involving different builds. Finally, we're given a AAA quality game that feels both mechanically polished and well optimized. I haven't run into a single issue thus far within the span of my 4 hours played. A worthy entry into the immersive sim/shooter genre....at least, I think that's what you might call this. It has all the aspects of, say, Bioshock, like the menu-purchased powers that can be upgraded with a few different effects and buffs. This time around though, instead of finding weapons lying about, like in Bioshock, you find blueprints in multiple areas along with varying materials to craft your arsenal. Not everything is craftable from the start, but you can see everything available to you, which is somewhat nice if you're trying to plan out a build ahead of time.Beyond mechanics, the game looks fantastic and runs very smoothly on an RTX 2080 super with everything everything turned up to the max. I can't say this will be the case when they eventually release a patch granting access to ray tracing options, but I can hope the optimization will carry through into all technical aspects of Atomic Heart. It's strange, considering this game was more or less the poster child for RTX. I remember hearing about this one years ago and then rtx became a thing, and they showed off the real time reflections with the infinite mirror effect! It was so cool. Soooooooooooooo.........where the ray tracing at?And, speaking of ""where at"", and I know this is probably a big one for most long time PC gamers.....but where the hell is the FOV slider? I read that the devs decided to forego this option due to the game already having a wider FOV than most games. I also now know that they're planning to add custom FOV settings, so once I can adjust that, I'll continue playing. As of this moment, it's mostly just kinda nauseating to play. I tried to push passed it, but I've been spoiled with 100-110 for far too long. At least the devs listened to the community and made the right choice. I guess I'm just really curious as to why they wouldn't at least include the option in the first place. An earlier title, In Vivo, featured an incredibly low FOV that the developer stated was to ""create feelings of claustrophobia."" However, regardless of this very clearly stated idea, the man still included a flippin slider. We're in 2023 and there is literally no excuse for this. Much confuse.Overall, great game, would recommend."

It has it's problems, but considering this is Mundfish's first game; surpassed all my expectations Here are my negatives for the game:-Melee combat is not that great, though I mostly use ranged weapons -Weapon quantity is low, you get one handgun, one rifle and a shotgun-Some of the voice acting is kind of bad-No FoV slider and any animation quality below maximum is horribleOther than those, gameplay is muaah amazingMick did a fantastic job with his soundtrack, but I have to give credit to other composers too; they all did amazing jobs. Soundtrack is amazingNow onto the things I want to talk about, mostly stuff critics didn't like: You have probably seen everyone complaining about P-3 swearing all the time, making him ''Childish'' I think P-3 being the early 2000s action guy felt great, because FPS protagonists are mostly mute; having someone speak all the time felt good, especially in a ''dead'' world like Atomic Heart Dialogues are fine, they are not some Tarantino level stuff but I think they hold up well. Especially the conversations between Charles and P-3 is fun to listen. P-3 in my opinion, is a well written one; a memory-wiped soldier serving the only person he sees as family, which goes well with the plot going forward. Side characters are great too, especially the occasional robots you have convo with World itself is beautiful, lore and characters are interesting; from propaganda posters to licensed soviet post-rock songs, the game really captures the Soviet feel (and the alternate history is well written too); art style deserves this year's award. Visuals are amazing to look at. And this game reminded me of something that is a bygone thing in gaming; a working game at launch. Yes, this game runs exceptionally well; I haven't encountered any bugs, performance is good but I had stutters here and ther I'm happy with the every single lira I spent on this game, congrats Mundfish; back in 2018 I thought this game was going to be a scam but here I am, explaining how much I enjoyed this game.

I had an elevator button not work making me reload my save, some robots will remain standing despite being dead (not often), and some lootable chest can't be looted. Melee combat is a bit difficult, but the gun play is satisfying. Hitting a robot point blank with the shotty and sending them 20ft back will never not be fun. They also have the robots get more damaged the more you hit them which is a nice touch. The puzzles are not too difficult. Environment and world is beautiful even on lower graphics. The player character is... eh. He's not as bad as people make him out to be, but does have a few cringy lines and poor line deliveries (at least for the English VA). The open world aspect is kinda meh as there are cameras that will send tons of robots after you if you're spotted and they are everywhere. When you destroy a robot in the open world, a passive robot will come and rebuild them very quickly which is EXTREMELY ANNOYING as you can't just kill the enemies in the area and loot/explore afterwards. The weapon upgrade and skill system is good. One thing that annoys me is you cant view/change controls for controller. The story (so far) is great and has some great boss fights and regular fights with bumpin music.Overall I'd give it a 7.5/10. Good buy, lots of fun, but needs some adjustments to really shine."

The last hour of this game is basically just dialogue you can't skip. And the game just info dumps a bunch of really stupid ♥♥♥♥. I beat the game without doing a single side quest or piece of side content and never had any trouble with any bosses or encounters. Which leads me to believe they are there for the soul purpose of milking more playtime out of people and slapping on the sticker of ""OPEN WORLD"" when this game should just be a linear shooter puzzle game that takes you through the interesting environments. I had enough fun to justify rating it positively, but be mindful before purchasing for a game the should be closer to $40."

Unless it was all buried in the incredibly small text that even my massive monitor couldn't clear up.As far as CHARLES, I don't have any complaints; I laughed the first time i looted a room because of how goofy it was.On to Combat. Combat should have been the most polished thing about this game. I went in expecting either Bioshock or  Dead Island; but ended up with Skyrim but worse. Melee felt clunky and unsatisfying, Sneaking was cumbersome and even after bumping my brightness up to 2; it was still claustrophobic and dark.

The dialogue is funny, engaging, and the characters feel genuine and not scripted. Being able to talk to dead people is a really interesting and fun way to incorporate different elements for the game. There is clearly *so much more* to do and see in this game, I feel like I have barely even started, and I can't get enough. This game is easily Game of the Year material.Before the game came out, people were saying this game is going to be a lot like Bioshock, which is another game I couldn't get enough of, and at this point I have to say this is much better than Bioshock. Pick this up if you want that feeling x10 that you got from playing Bioshock and Fallout 3. The only downside to playing this is it will spoil you and make other games pale in comparison.Fantastic job devs! I am so glad I purchased the premium so I can get access to all the future DLC to come.-----------------------------------------------------------I’ve only just begun but it is an *incredible* experience thus far and I don’t have any complaints.The optimization is phenomenal. 10/10 - Russian developers are doing incredible work and I can’t wait to see what they come out with next"

Pros:- 100 our of 10 art design, lore, sci-fi setting, and world building. The level/puzzle design is good. Watch a video about the opening scene: - Simple but engaging story line (no spoilers)The game world diverges from ours where the soviet union became the superpower by advancing tech to an unprecedented level. Frankly, this sentence alone can turn me on. What's more, there's a kind of jelly-ish material called polymer that can be used as an interface between human mind, the digital world, and machines/robots, backed by some advanced biotech. It is the backbone of almost every advanced tech in soviet union. The robotics industry of soviet union is so advanced that robots are gradually replacing the majority of a nation's labor work force. Naturally when the tech developed so fast while the our humans cannot keep up, bad things happened, as suggested in the trailers.Some people say the ending is underwhelming but I'd say it's perfect based on the lore and the soviet union in our universe. You don't have to agree but I encourage you to experience the story from the begin to the end yourself.Also, spend some time  listening to NPCs' conversations and reading text on the walls and terminals.- Fun combat and weapon system. Nothing too special compared to BioShock, but the combat (melee, shooting, and special glove abilities) is just fun and that's all we really needCons:okay here we go...- Balance is non-existing. Most people have to stay on easy difficulty as soon as you pass a certain point in the story. This point might vary but later on the game overwhelm you with floods of enemies. You can simply run away from them in many cases but in situations where you can't, prepare to be frustrated.- Music is 10/10, but the game doesn't play it at the right time or play it for long enough.In some cut-scenes there's no suitable ambient music to bring out some of your feelings, which can make cool scenes a bit bland IMO.And music stops playing every time you end the combat. That means for many scenes that have enemies scattered around, the music plays for 20s to 30s and then stops, like wtf I want some Mick Gorton.- THE BIGGEST ISSUE, the storyline is always interrupted with repetitive puzzle solving and lockpicking. This is not ok, even if the devs acknowledge this by letting the protagonist complain about it and make fun of it.I'll give them a pass on this considering the budget is probably limited.- THE SECOND BIGGEST ISSUE, the protagonist is annoying and stupid.Now some of his characteristics can be explained, for example, he always say ""crispy critters"" like wtf but there's an explaination (SPOILERS:  ) (shame on you gamespot reviewer you didn't read the text).But in other cases this guy is simply a dumb retarded smart-ass who complains about the smallest thing around him.I should mention that my game audio is set to English dub, not sure if this is true for other languages but my god it's so cringy.Finally, there's also this video I want to bring up . It says you shouldn't buy this game using some stupid arguments about politics and the Ukraine war and blah blah.Well if you've completed the game you will know that this is just a game, there's no propaganda or mind control, not to mentioned any expression of political views. It's just an attempt to making a good game, set around a universe where Russian for this one time isn't the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up country.Watch this response video please: This game is flawed, but don't nitpick. For many people this game is better than most of the new FPS out there. Not to mention people are willing to buy much much worse ♥♥♥♥ at higher prices.Besides, not many developers are now willing to optimize their games so that they can actually run on average machines."
1186,ameridiot6677,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dustbunny8651/,1,,1,16.8,February,24,302,0,1,"This is a difficult game to review.It isn't perfect, but it isn't horrendous.It isn't great, but it isn't bad either.My time spend playing Atomic Heart over the past few days was subject to a lot of frustrations, a lot of eye rolls, and admittedly, a whole damn lot of fun.The combat is weighty and packs a punch, but the enemies are frustratingly spongy at the start. This isn't as much of an issue towards the end, but as you finally find yourself able to hold your own in a fight the game begins throwing hordes of enemies at you in every room. Hordes of the tankiest enemies in the game. It's especially frustrating when the enemies are constantly revived by drones that endlessly spawn. It isn't impossible to manage or unplayable, it just isn't fun.The open world is.... well, it's a world. It has many issues, most of them what I listed above in the combat section, but it's serviceable. There really isn't much to say about it. It serves as a link between levels and as a means of finding the games testing grounds, which serve as your stereotypical open world dungeons in which you find weapon upgrades. Instead of combat, though, these consist of puzzles. The puzzles are fun and work well, though many of them go on for far too damn long.The story is probably the most controversial part of this game. The protagonists (P-3 and Charles, his glove) never stop talking. Ever. They ramble on for the entire game, whether it's over other dialogue, important information in the background, or cutting off their own lines to keep talking. Most of this dialogue is complaining, arguing, and banter. It's draining for the first few hours, but they eventually start to lessen their speech and talk a normal amount, and talk like normal individuals having a conversation rather than two people who hate each other. The other characters are bland, forgettable, and mostly poorly acted. The story itself is mostly incoherent and simultaneously too easy to predict and too complicated to understand. The entire game consists of P-3 being told important information, going ""I don't understand that"" and ignoring it. The game wouldn't have needed so many unnecessary plot twists and extra hours if he would just listen to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ glove. The ending, though I won't spoil it, is also rather surprisingly abrupt considering the game is 20 hours long and overwhelmingly underwhelming.Overall, I had a mixed experience playing this game. I enjoyed it for the most part, and I'll probably play whatever DLC comes out. If you're wondering whether or not to buy it and play it yourself, I think it just depends on how much dirt and stone you're willing to dig through before you can see the gold."

Yet here I am running around getting materials left and right and giving them NORA so she can provide me with more good service. I'm sorry NORA I'd ditch CHAR-les completely for you if I could, he's annoying and not in the fun way like you.Okay inside jokes aside, so far my impression on the game have been good, it looks great and runs smooth or at least I haven't had glitches yet which once upon a time wasn't noteworthy but these days it seems more often then not stuff gets released as buggy messes.If you are familiar with the core mechanics of games like Bioshock and Prey then this game will be pretty much the same remedy, progress, get new abilities and find materials to upgrade your gear. The melee combat is a bit janky imo and it kinda seems excessively brutal to let the robots keep hitting you after they've knocked you down if you fail a dodge. Failing to time a dodge already results in a hard blow to your HP bar letting the robot get extra hits in while you're still animation locked from it just strikes me as a tad bit cheap for anything below the hardest difficulty setting.Update.Also not sure if its feature of a bug but save points don't seem to work conventionally (at least not for me). By this I mean I'd use 1 to manually save and then later I'd load the last save only to find it be at an auto save point before the manual save I had just done. As I said I don't know if its a bug or if those manual save points are more like respawn checkpoints you can hit up and only have use upon death.Honestly so far thats about my only complaints so far.I've had this game on my radar for years and I am pleased to find out the wait was apparently worthwhile. I shall update this review further if anything else of note happens especially if anything that might cause me to switch this review from a Recommend to a Not Recommended one but for now I say go for it if you are interested."

English main character voice acting is... well, pretty meh. And lotsa jokes are lost in translation and just sound cringy. What I didn't like is the open-ish world in between the main locations that I didn't get enough motivation from the game to explore. There is not much to explore tbh, unless you just wanna fight more mobs and loot some mods for your weapons, so it is mostly a waste of time and space imo.The difficulty level feels a bit unbalanced. I started on normal, but in the last third of the game I had to raise it to hard and even like this the final boss fight made me heal just twice and didn't feel difficult at all, I don't even remember what this boss was doing against me coz it didn't pose any challenge, I just kept dodging and shooting. Steam progress achievements are bugged and reset after each launch of the game. Not important for me, but just an fyi for those who enjoy this part."

I've also finished most of the sub...quest?(more like dungeons). Keep in mind that I've got 400hrs on DS3, 1000hrs on Warframe, and 200+total on Elden ring and Sekiro. Let's go with the pros and cons. (I played on normal mode)Pros1. Great storyline, might be a bit cliche for people using half their lives on steam(including myself). Nevertheless, interesting story. I probably won't be disappointed in buying the dlc pre-launch if the story quality is the same.2. Dash quality is quite good, believe me, I've played a lot of souls games and some have terrible dash.3. Not too much farming. If you have a specific weapon/upgrade that you really want, then you might have to do some heavy grinding/looking cause some parts are quite rare. Otherwise, most items are craftable with loot from storyline battle.4. Speaking of loot, they implemented a magnetic system that automatically collects loot. This was quite innovative and convenient. Was a bit buggy tho.Cons1. Bosses were terrible. No gimmicks, doesn't require skill, and some weren't even quite story related. Sorta dumped random field mobs that have twice bigger size and 10times more health. Honestly, it was lackluster.2. None of the skills were really useful/interesting. Most of them are CC related, but later in the game a few bullets will put down pretty much everything before having to take prerequisite measures. I had some upgrades at first, then half way through the game realized i wasn't using them, so I just undid them all left them be.3. Weapon choices were terrible. A rocket launcher that does less damage than an AK-47, A railgun that takes nearly 2 minutes to recharge...etc. They give you so much bullets that melee is basically unnecessary. Weapon upgrades were also useless because they were literally useless than others, or they had specific uses... which had to be swapped manually in every checkpoint.4. Fourth con is probably the worst part of this game. NO FAST TRAVEL. The map is huge, obviously smaller than DS or elden ring, but definitely not a walk-friendly size.Overall1. Great story: YES2. Graphics: YES3. User-friendly: MAYBE4. Diversity: NO5. Boss originality: NOBuy the game when it's on sale. I spent around 80 bucks? for this game. Had much fun yes... but not really worth it compared to the 400+hrs I had on Dark Souls. I don't think I'll play this game until DLC launch."

The first things you will have the pleasure to admire are the , which on top of being absolutely stunning also run extremely well (I enjoyed the game in 4k without stutter or lags) and that is commandable, the optimization is great.2. The  are very interesting and detailed, I'd read and listen to each and every piece of information I could find to know more about that alternate historical reality and the specificities of this uncanny world.3. The , although not groundbreaking is still quite fast-paced and efficient, we find the mix between elemental powers and guns like in DOOM or even Cyberpunk, which are both games that I love, so no surprise in the fact that I felt at home, especially with that incredible soundtrack during fights.  are especially enjoyable and fluid.* Now for the negative sides of Atomic Heart:1. Some technical/rythm aspects. The  is locked and very zoomed out, it's just not comfortable, install Flawless Widescreen to tweak it and it should feel much better. Also wtf with the number of save rooms and elevators ? Just put an automatic checkpoint instead of forcing the player to enter a room -> press a button -> exit the room -> resume activity each time they end a parkour.2 For me the biggest disapointment : the  I've finished the game (although not a 100%, I missed a good chunk of exploration so add 3/5h) in barely 20 hours time.They crafted an interesting universe with a ♥♥♥♥-ton of lore and potential only to make it last as long as a COD campaign ? What a waste ! I really excepted more out of this game... I really wanted it to be my new obsession, but it's just not enough, especially when my last game, ELDEN RING took me 200 HOURS to finish. The contrast is just to painful for the same pricetag.Atomic Heart is a good game and is pretty much . But i's defo NOT worth 60 bucks. Wait for the sales and it'll be a good deal."

If you love world building, exploring futuristic areas, and want a game to binge play then definitely. The open scene alone is beautifully done. Really does a great job of quickly explaining how the innovation of the USSR happened and how the whole world ""works"" and truly puts you in the city setting really well. This is NOT a game you will enjoy if you were hoping for perfection with combat and world building doesn't matter as much to you. The weapons are kind of boring and just feel like nerf guns even when upgraded. You are basically just buying time to be able to use your abilities that actually will damage enemies. The boss fights are just ""let's see how many bullets and med packs we can make them use"" and then give you the resources to buy them right back, and no joke 75% of the game has been finding stuff to unlock doors to progress to the next door you have to unlock.Overall I think the world building is done really well, the story is actually pretty good so far, and I haven't hit a ton of bugs yet which is more than I can say about Fallout 76 or Cyberpunk so I commend the devs there. It is slightly frustrating though that the pacing is just driven by making you find things. Like there could have been cool vehicle chases, horde lock downs, boss fights with unique weapon drops, more side quests, etc. but the devs were just like ""ah throw another canister they have to fill in there and make P-3 say a joke about how many canisters you have to collect"".And the combat is just okay. I think a lot more enemies that are very weak vs 3-5 per room that all have timed special attacks would have made the weapons feel more useful and make it feel less like you are just dumping full mags on one enemy using your abilities and then you're just done in that area and rinse and repeat in most rooms.I'm 75% of the way through and would call this about a 7.5/10. Really solid attempt just falls somewhat short. Maybe pick it up when it's on sale for $45 eventually."

1230,XCheba,https://steamcommunity.com/id/XCheba/,1,,1,5.9,February,23,125,0,1,"The main character is corny af, the gameplay can be very boring, but also very fun at times. The main place that sucked was the ""tutorial"" area where you have to recover 4 different capsules. Its a very monotonous journey that takes around 2 hours even if your not checking for loot everywhere. After you finish all that you come out into a very annoying open world that does not feel rewarding when you check around and find good loot. There are these complicated cameras that call for more robots if they see you. This would be fine if the cameras didn't get repaired whenever you break them and continue to call in more robots. You can't simply clear out an area and feel safe to explore and find things. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have a lot of patience and wants to always be doing something or fighting something. If you do have a lot of patience and can handle the long and unnecessary non-skipable cut scenes then this game is for you. The controversy surrounding this game is stupid. Most of it is people saying the money from this game is going to go to the Russian government due to the Ukraine conflict, but wheres the proof? Does this mean I can't buy a single game that comes from Russia? If it wasn't for the hot ass twins I would not have bought this game. It is a shame there were no sex scenes but it is what it is. I'm sure plenty of mods will eventually come out that will give me the rock hard ♥♥♥♥ I was hoping for. Still a good game though!"

1248,Xoteck,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199011210023/,1,,1,17.8,February,22,64,0,1,"Just finished the first ending of the game because I'm unable to complete the 2nd one as of this moment. I will start on the pros and aspects of this game. To start with, this game feels really well put together. With Bioshock feeling enemies, souls game combat aspect, and a Dying Light idea of platforming. Honestly I love the story of this game, if you love story games definitely consider purchasing this game. Bosses had an actual challenge to them unlike some other games. Enemies are strong and are entertaining and still challenging in mass to fight. The designs in this game are outstanding I love all of the designs from small things like robots and water to the big ass tower in Chelomey which I forget the name of. And I loved the Soviet architecture that we see at the very beginning. Most of the areas were great but the tower as previously mentioned and the Theater take the cake for me. Great characters all in all. The cutscenes are also great. And all in all loved a lot of this game.Onto the cons and complaints of the game. This is definitely just my PC but it was choppy at bits. My frames drop after being perfect for hours. Usually a restart fixed it for me though except one part that I won't disclose so soon after launch. I hate the aspect of the cameras. If they see you, you get an Alert 1 and if you decide to hit a robot in its vision you get an Alert 2 level. And I wanted to explore parts of the map but figured it was way too much work, wasn't really worth it in my opinion. The tutorial felt like forever and it was just opening doors pretty much. Some of the complexes were a bit repetitive like the VDNH. A LOT of reading, I can not emphasize the amount of reading in this game. Luckily, most of it isn't required. I wanted to know more of the lore, but didn't have the patience to read the emails and whatnot. Some extras. I love but also hate the VDNH follow mission because I know they added it on purpose just to upset people. The robot walks down the hall and talks about every robot. I couldn't help but laugh about it with my friends. There is another follow mission but it wasn't too bad as it was taken up by dialog. TL;DR, Long tutorial but a nice, long, detailed story, although repetitive at times. Great graphics, characters, and combat. Cameras piss me off.PS: ♥♥♥♥ DEWDROP THAT BOSS WAS SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS."
1249,SuperScoop,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198830076998/,1,,1,29.9,February,22,60,0,1,"Alright, the basic summary is that this game is good, I wouldn't say God of War good, but it is Good. Non-triple AAA made, its impressive, facial details on AI is awesome. Also, you can spot some animations being a bit iffy but not game play-breaking.  Some sound needs to be worked on in cut-scenes but other than that nothing else to complain.Story wise the main dude is a really big a-hole but im sure that's what he was supposed to be, voice actors could have been better but it can get used to. Lip sync feels just a little off as well with some of the model's motions. One last thing, for now, is that the timing between sentences feels a bit quick and also timing with the dialogue during a cut-scene. For a bit more in-depth look, the game runs really smooth and if you seen someone say, ""oh Ive completed the game in 7-8 hours and it lacks (so and so) "". Im sure they have rushed the story and dint bother to look at the world for a bit. Im 8 hours in, nowhere near the end and I've been taking my time looting exploring and just taking a nice look at the world around me. Its quite bizarre and quite pretty with all the unique destruction and cool anomalies.The cons I would say is that the number of weapons/blueprints you receive to make said weapons is a bit overwhelming since you do want to try them all. They should of also introduced guns a bit later like when you start to leave the complex. If looting properly you get a great amount of ammo which really lets you shoot without much consequence and also make you use the energy weapons less since they are technically infinite ammo.Overall id say this is a great buy and just an awesome game, id sort of say this is a Ruined dystopia like Far Cry but with cool killer robots. Just take your time, look around and experiment with weapons. Would play this after a harsh day, either at work or in general.(Oh and P.S crispy critters.)"

The game takes place in an alternate reality Soviet Union where players take on the role of a KGB agent tasked with investigating a top-secret facility.The game's graphics and sound design are absolutely breathtaking, with stunningly detailed environments and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that perfectly sets the tone for the game's eerie atmosphere. The game's combat is visceral and exciting, with a wide range of weapons and abilities at the player's disposal.What really sets Atomic Heart apart, however, is its innovative gameplay mechanics. The game features a deep crafting system that allows players to scavenge for resources and build a wide range of weapons and tools to aid in their mission. Additionally, the game's branching storyline offers a high degree of replayability, as players must make choices that impact the outcome of the game.Overall, Atomic Heart is a must-play for fans of action and adventure games. Its combination of stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, and innovative mechanics make it a true standout in the gaming landscape."
1257,Khaldarim,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198197363614/,1,,1,19.1,February,22,104,0,1,"19.1 hours I spent on this game. These were enjoyable 19.1 hours. The game is rather short but very much enjoyable. This is my first proper review so sorry if it's poorly written and confusing.This game is pretty straight forward with it's story and missions however the stuff around it is very good in my opinion. The combat feels very nice and is very cool to observe. For example you can use telekenisis to hold your foes from attacking. Or you can use foam like (glue?) to apply elemental effects to enemies. This game wants you to find your playstyle with several weapons that can combine into solid arsenals. Each weapon can also be quite diverse for example the Electro can be modified to use an emp or a energy draining weapon. Whilst this might not sound like much by it self you can combine the energy draining mod to quickly reload your railgun making you a force to recokend with. Combining your abilities with your weapons to create fun playstyles is some of the most fun in this game.Enemies are good, mostly. This might get a bit spoilery if you consider enemies and the different ones you can meet spoilers. So the enemies in this game are divided into two groups machine and organic. I must say the machine enemies are very fun with a diverse group of them that forces the player to adapt to what they are facing with flying robots and drop kicking robots attacking you at the same time. This creates fun and engaging fights where you might need to use clever tactics to come out ontop without losing to much of your gathered supplies. However the organic enemies are lacking with there being a standard grunt that have a little variation depending on the colour their head, there is also the nests that spawn small Halo Flood looking creatures that will take over human bodies or just attack you. Bosses are also mostly good with a diverse array of them however the difficulty of some of them in comparison to others are quite stupid if you ask me. The main organic boss that you will meet is from my experience far stronger than what you will experience with machine bosses though this might ofcourse just be thanks to me having a bad set up for them. But the amount of times this boss was repeated feels stupid when you compare it to other bosses. The Open world is nice but not that interesting. This might just be personal preference but the open world felt a bit too shallow with the main thing that kept it alive being the robot eco systems that kept areas populated. The looting for supplies that drives you to search the map is at times not enough to get atleast me to stay and search every house since the dungeons part of the main story give you enough supplies to always make it through. Talking about the dungeons they are quite nice though at times tedious with a lot of doors that have to be opened via puzzles. The puzzles in the dungeons are usually fun (I found a personal liking to anything related to magnets) and give a break from the otherwise intense combat.The story is not that interesting and so is the characters. Whilst playing the game you will mostly be hearing the main character (He is a bit annoying but not overwhelmingly so imo) and his glove talk with each other with limited interactions with other characters which does two things. It makes it so you feel isolated and alone but also makes it harder to relate to anyone since you barely meet anyone that is just a common worker since pretty much everyone you meet has some kind of plot that is ongoing. The main story is rather shallow with a single major choice which is at the end of the game and decides your ending. Atleast the main story leads the player to fund dungeons so I am fine with it being shallow since atleast the gameplay is fun.Moving on from gameplay related stuff I must say this game is well optimized. I played on a pc with below recommended and got a steady 60 fps on medium graphics. tl dr: The gameplay is very fun with unique interactions with some abilities and weapons. Story and characters are a bit  bland. servicable open world with interesting ideas. Dungeons are fun with enjoyable puzzles. Enemies are mostly diverse altough the organics are a bit to repetitive at times. I would probably give this game a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. I can recommend it to anyone that is interested in the gameplay and puzzles can't really recommend it for it's story."
1258,Виагра ♿♾,https://steamcommunity.com/id/frostinooo/,1,,1,4.8,February,22,237,0,1,"dont know why all the hate for the fov slider but game is good nonetheless, still think that it drags a bit in the beginning before u get to the open world stuff, combat is good but repetitive, sometimes feels like the enemies have too much hp (especially the plant mfs) and that there can be too many of them, overall i think its got potential to become an amazing game, love the humour this game has and the atmosphere it develops when you get to the open world, feels like a whole new game with new enemies that havent been introduced properly and your just thrown into it would be a lot more interesting if materials such as metal parts could be obtained a LOT more, im playing the game currently on one of the easy modes (for story mainly) and still find myself running out of ammo and resort to using melee which just takes too long, all other materials are good for obtaining but just cant find any metal parts without using more im often using more than im getting back which could just be considered as a ""skill issue"" which is probably true, even so i still think that making some mats more obtainable in more places or in bigger quantities would make the game a much more enjoyable experience for me and others.thankyou for reading my review, overall from what ive experienced so far id give this game a solid 7.summary: good game, drags a bit here and there, mats need to be easier to get, combat is good but feels repetitive from time to time."

The graphics are greatly optimized even for medium settings, so me running off a pre-built Alienware Aurora R8 that I've had for more than 3 years, this is pretty great especially for a game as large as this. The setting is pretty immersive and easy to find myself involved with- and the architectural and mechanical concepts in-game are absolutely fantastic. The only downside is while streaming on medium graphics, after 4-5 hours in, lag would become more of an issue possibly having to do with how many enemies could be spawning- though I could be wrong."

1264,InVader,https://steamcommunity.com/id/1nVader/,No,,0,24.1,February,22,164,0,1,"I bought this game for no other reason than the unique setting in the Soviet Union. There's way too few games like this. However after finishing the game I must say I don't feel like I got my money's worth. I can tolerate the tedious combat, the cringe main character/dialogue, the crashes, the cliffhanger at the end, but not the open-world.This is NOT an Ubisoft open-world, but if it was, that would've been a massive improvement and that alone speaks volumes, because I hate those Ubisoft open-world games. The outside is full of enemies and cameras which send reinforcements via orbital drop when you get spotted, but even if you destroy them, they get repaired by infinitely spawning repair-bots. There's no way to permanently clear an area, so you can't play ""loud"". The game simply won't let you explore. The game is at it's best when you're inside facilities, which are basically ""dungeons"", but even getting inside them from the open-world is tedious, because you have to do it 100% stealth, otherwise you can't open the doors to the facilities. If you destroy the relays, the entire area with all the bots is powered down, but because of no power you can't open facilities either, so you just played yourself.This ruins the experience so much that it made me B-line towards the objective without any special weapon upgrades (which are cool, but they're in the above mention optional facilities).I do not recommend this game, but if you're still interested, don't be worried about UE4, because it actually runs well without stuttering! Just enable shader/texture caching and it'll be fine. No mouse acceleration either (if you ran windows update recently, check your mouse settings). To change FOV just download Flawless Widesreen."
1265,Lex Lagger TTV,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lex_Lagger/,1,,0,2.2,February,22,864,0,1,"Steam needs an in the middle vote/rank for games just like this. It's just bad enough to push it down though at the price of 95 bux... Get it on sale maybe.This game looked like a creative masterpiece, but what it is, is a complete rip off of BioShock made as raunchy as possible, with the main character dropping F bombs every other word.Seriously, it's not just innuendo; you'll be looking around as if you were watching the hub playing this if anyone walks into the same room. There is a ton of Innuendo as well though, you even stealth kill by inserting your Robo-tenticals just above the robots booty.Unskippable cut scenes, unskippable tutorials, and if you die you go back to the last time you manually saved at a save point. Which makes the more difficult areas extra annoying because of all the things you can't skip. When you actually need an explanation of how something works, lock picking for example, then just no tutorial at all.... Voice lines are unskippable as well, and will over lap each other if you move to far and a new one starts.If you can get past all that, the game play it's self is decent. It is after all basically BioShock, so much so that I don't know how they could make this blatant re-skin and not get sued. So the combat is fantastic. They added a dodge mechanic, and when you hit an enemy it leaves a mark on them where you hit them! You can DeadSpace your way through sending limbs and components flying and it's all very satisfying. At the core, the game play is what makes it good though it is very difficult to get past all the other nonsense.I'll shelve for a while and wait for some updates and hopefully they will fix some of the more annoying things, or modders will. At that point I intent to fully jump in, off stream, and wreck some robots while no one is home. Maybe pick up on sale later, and see if they fix all the unskippable stuff, add the ray tracing they said would be in the game, the HDR, and FOV slider since I had to get a mod to even play it on my monitor the way it is.If you are a wide screen user, use flawlesswidescreen with a dot ORG after it.

I've been following Atomic Heart since the Clown Trap and am not disappointed with the result of the game. It feels like a mix of Bioshock and Doom, both of which are games I love with all my heart.That being said, there are a few glitches, such as somehow being teleported into the ceiling after dying at a checkpoint. This is to be expected with even AAA games, and I'm shocked I haven't encountered as many bugs. Looking forward to see what Mundfish does in the future."

So far I'm super impressed by with all aspects of the game.  Talent points for the glove and weapon upgrades. Fun combat &puzzles  Most of all it's one of the most beautiful games I've ever played and really sucks you into the atmosphere.  P.s. Nora I love you

Climbing is painfully slow and difficult, but at least it isn't a key feature. Sometimes my character gets stuck when jumping around, which makes dodging mid-combat difficult. Loot from killed enemies can get stuck in unreachable areas and the range of the telekinetic grab is a bit short. In stealth, sometimes enemies detect me when I feel like I am not visible at all and haven't moved.      The game-play is fun and the way you can vacuum up resources en-mass is a very nice QOL feature. The atmosphere of the game is top-notch and very reminiscent of Cold-War era science-fiction (such as Heinlein). The visuals are very nice and it runs surprisingly well compared to other games of similar detail. Most weapons feel powerful and impactful, even the PM (pistol). Melee combat, while simple, is just complex enough to be satisfying when it goes well for you. The shotgun is awesome and it is a nice detail that you load the tube, rack the slide, and then can load one more round. The animations for the player's hands are very smooth and full of character and Char-les does grow on you.I could go on about the positives all day, but all-in-all, I am happy to keep playing."

1299,Airuniel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Greetings_Traveller/,1,,1,49.7,February,21,83,0,1,"I'll start with the cons.- I wish some of the games models/items scattered around the map didn't have collision. It felt awkward stumbling into a stick on the ground while pumping led into enemies. It feels like doom in that sense, but in doom, because of the different mechanics you are less likely to suddenly get crushed into a corner of foliage or suddenly get stopped by a rock laying on the ground while trying to dodge a laser from a robot.- Game has some little bugs. I really want to envasize the word ""little"", because it's nothing compared to other AAA-titles we have nowadays. - I heard english dub is odd. Would recommend playing in russian dub, especially if you can understand russian. I loved it. Now for the pros. - Atmosphere. The game feels USSR. It doesn't feel like it tries to be USSR but fails - no and I love it because of this.- Gameplay. It's a mix between bioshock and doom. When I don't get stumbled on a rock - it's fire. You can really feel the impact when shooting guns or knocking back enemies with a shotgun. The animations look sick and I love the different ways you can counter different enemies. Bossfights, oof, I'm still playing in my head the first time I met Hedgie - what a masterpiece of a boss and the animation transitions are seamless, chef's kiss. I could write an essay of how engaging all of the bosses feel.- Graphics & Optimization. Graphics are top-notch. Can't say much about optimization as was playing on a high-end PC but a friend of mine is having fun playing on his 1660 Super and holds 60 on medium without much trouble.- Story. Oh god, at first I thought it will be something absurd and comedic but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the endings. Without spoling too much - I extremely recommend paying attention when listening to dialogues and even encourage you to read some PC's with lore here and there as it really explains the perspective and helps you better understand why some have done what they have done. **Spoiler** Sad he threw the rings into the ocean as I think those were somehow connected with his wife..- Soundtrack. You really can't go wrong with old USSR songs and a remix/new songs from Mick Gordon and other amazing artists. It slaps, it hits hard - it really adds to the feel of the game.I absolutely love this game with all my heart. It felt like a breath of fresh air from all the half-done AAA-titles we had in the last 5 or even more years. The soundtrack, the lore, the atmosphere and gameplay are fire. I wish it was a fully open-world game but at the same time the state it is right now - it just feels right. It doesn't get boring, from the start to finish - it's a great ride and I enjoyed it fully. Looking forward to the DLC's! P.S. Sad the game had to go through so much politics and some players just refuse to enjoy it because of this, that and the other. It's a great game, heartbreaking people nowadays care more about being toxic then trying out a product from a new game dev studio."

1328,Hexenhammer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hexenhammer_/,2,1,1,22.8,March,9,"1,468",0,1,"Ill begin with this: Whom is this game made for?This game is made for people that grew up in USSR and Warsaw pact countries, people from the west WILL NOT understand the world, wont have any nostalgic feelings for the music and level design, it doesn't remind them of anything, its completely Alien for for them.If you from Warsaw pact countries, doesnt have to be ex-ussr, this game will feel close and nostalgic.The game is not pro or against USSR, but its deifnetly has a hidden subtext against China: you hear on the radio things like .""..people with low social rating..."", and found someone talking about unemployment in USA because ""we provide them with cheap robots"" [again about China, cheap electronics and the factories that moving there], game has labor camps, re-education camps and so on, it has every bullet point thing that makes modern China.Anyway, back to the gameWhen Half Life came out, people spoke about new video game genre ""Thinking Man FPS"", which compared to mindless shooting of Doom had more RPG, puzzles, story and element.Atomic Heart is definitely a ""Thinking Man FPS"", but with Duke Nukem twist the protagonist is ""Dirty Mouth"", which is in no way bad.Protagonist always talks with its glove and I love it, I don’t like silent games when you hear music and bullets, I rather enjoy the banter and IMHO it makes games more “livable”.So I hope it stays for Atomic Heart 2.Shooting mechanic is fine, Metro like, definitely not COD, Blunt/Sharp weapons combat is fine, its not as fun as Dying Light 2, but its Usable.This game has everything to be excellent, but ultimately feels unfinished and unpolished:1. No Ray Tracing, even thou the game was advertised for years as THE RTX game.2. Bethesda amount of Bugs, especially getting stuck in the environment of falling through environment.Even the cartoon TV, in some areas it has sound, in other it dont, in some areas its just white screen, sometimes it has video until you save than you turn back and its white screen.If you kill anyone in water, i dont mean a river but shallow water like less than knee deep, you cant pick up the loot, it glows blue but it cant be picked up, if the water is deep and you can swim than you can pick it up, but in shallow water you cant.3. Low veriety of enemies, i wish they had more types of zombies, plant mutants and robots, more female robots if they have a huge digging robot, while not make ""Pipe Digging"" robot, so youll have a surprising enemy that comes from below? 4. The open areas are big for no reason and feels more like a chore to move around, since the enemies are infinite, you cant stop the bees and eventually they will repair everything, you cant clear an area, so you run around killing same 2-3 enemies, the thing is for some reason the enemis never mixed up,Usually you have 3 types in each area, so you kill the same saw enemies, rarely the one that throws grenades at you and some bees, with Vovchicks mixed in between locations.5. Game lacks destructibility, you cant even shoot balloons, nothing happens, its like they made from concrete, and its this has negative effect, when you shoot guns its fund when concrete parts fly all over, when creates blow up and so on.6. Game has no environmental damage like in Bioshock, if you Zap a pool of water with enemies nothing happens I hope the dev threat this game like CDPR does with their games, instead of abandoning keep perfecting it until it has everything people want, no bugs, more content and then release a “GOTY” version with all the DLC included.But most important, I hope they keep working and polishing it .Also I hope to see Atomic Heart 2, in 2-3 years 😊 PleaseI would recommend this game, actually I had it on GamePass but I got a copy on steam, I also have Dead Space Remake and Hogwarts Legacy day1 and I still prefer to finish this game first.It makes me happy to see a modern AAA game that isn’t woke and isn’t full of degenerate extreme left agenda, and this pushed me to get a copy on steam to support the dev.Play on medium, on hard enemies are bullet sponges, on medium, if you collect EVERYTHING the game is not hard like some game “journalists” say."

I can see the vision, it might get better later but it feels more like something to do, then being the Hook that makes me want to play.The pacing: The pacing is so bad in this game. You get stopped every 5 minutes to do a puzzle, unlock a door, to go and find something, to scan something, or to talk to something or someone.  I don’t mind puzzles, but every five minutes you have to play the stupid locked door mini game. Oh boy.At one point the Protagonists literally says, “Another Locked door.” This is when I was done. Felt like salt on the wound.A lot of the puzzles are not difficult, but they get annoying fast. This is because there are so many of them. A lot of them are Vague, not set up well, or not needed at all.The Dialogue: Somebody should have put a leash on the writers. the Glove and the protagonist never stop talking “NEVER!!!”  If you are not getting excessive banter, then you are getting excessive exposition from the glove.  It’s annoying, so annoying. I tried changing the language to German and it helped a bit but didn’t solve the issue.  The Cut scenes look good, enjoyable to watch and listen too. But, then you go back into game and the banter starts.Maybe I would have played more. Maybe I would have tolerated abundance of locked doors and puzzles. But the nail in the coffin, is the none stop banter.I really wanted to like this game. Just can’t do it."

Fetch quests so bad that even the fetch quests have fetch quests built into them.The genius idea to put the player into an underground bunker for the first 4 hours of the game kills most of the desire to carry on, so that by the time you come out to the great-looking outdoors, you've just about had enough of the game. The guns are a mess concealed behind a pointlessly overcomplicated crafting system. Why is there a crafting system? Why is there a pretence of inventory management? Why is there a pretence of elemental damage system, when everything is a robot? If they took a scalpel to the game's systems and cut about two thirds of it away - it would have made for a better experience.I also get inexplicable motion sickness, even despite them adding an FOV slider (thank you though!). Could be because the character bobs during motion...Anyways, a good game is buried under a pile of unnecessary stuff and I am only playing to see more of that good game."
1334,Uncle Sickus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/soulkreig/,1,,1,12.8,February,23,964,0,1,"This game is a treat. Easily one of the best 1st person shooters that will come out this year. Beautiful graphics, fantastic gameplay, great pacing, loaded with lore and interactivity, very well researched... and criminally misunderstood by people who wont ever even play it. The humor is tongue in cheek and very ironic. before you even get out of the start area, you hear jokes about social credit locking people out of technology. A few minutes later, you learn to activate your area scanner by making the ""Finger L"" (Loser gesture), with some npc explanation about the peoples lead dadaist interpretive dance artist came up with it. If you dont get this joke, you probably thought Rapture looked like a fun place to live. after the opening bit, you get the rug pull and the utopia disappears immediately. you quickly realize your entire role is to mop up a mess before anyone outside of the ruling class can call bluff on the great peoples utopia. Also ""peoples"" utopia but too many robots. Also also ""people"" but rampant transhumanism. Irony upon irony. you'll see, the revelations are too good for me to spoil in a comment. The voice acting isnt great IN ENGLISH (which, if you're a Serious Sam fan, you'll feel it was more campy than bad) but the writing is fantastic, especially if you've read Roadside Picnic. This was clearly meant to be played in Russian and read for comprehension, like STALKER. tldr; big robo commie mommies, and sexual assault appliances.

The German dubs are fantastic. The soundtrack slaps. The game looks also really good, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the guys and girls at Mundfish are truly wizards when it comes to optimization, better than Nintendo, and a much much needed fresh air to PC games.As much as I like that game, there is one thing that annoys the duck out of me and could have been ended in a negative review if it wouldn't been the overall amazing experience. The awful writing of the player character, annoying and he curses every to every second sentence, its on the same level of being bad as Forspoken.I give some advice to any developer that is reading this. If your player character is annoying and curses with every sentence that is leaving his mouth then this doesn't make him appealing or relatable, its the opposite. But if you make a character that is well mannered and only curses when sh!t really hits the fan, THEN you know its really messed up and has quite the impact.PS.: Also features a dirty talking crafting fridge and the well known sexy robot twins!"

Safe points, uuuuugh: loot everything, die, respawn, loot everything AGAIN.Basically, the character is a redneck marine from 2023 talking smack to his... glove... who's time traveled back in time and landed in the soviet age. And then there is fighting and shooting, and you search for keys. That's it. If you're looking for profound.... anything, like in Bioshock, avoid this. Unless you're just in for the action.

1348,TimeForTim,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MotoX486/,3,,1,13.8,February,23,132,0,1,Honestly probably one of my favorite games Iv played in recent memory. Yes it has issues and it’s very much inspired by bioshock but for a first game release by mundfish you guys did a great job. The art is great and the world you built is pretty awesome tho a little bland and enemies make it impossible to really explore without being stealthy all the time. Speaking of enemies the robot designs are super cool. So far I’m enjoying it and I’m close to being done with the story. I’m excited to see where they take this from here. They laid out a great starting base.
1349,StingingVelvet,https://steamcommunity.com/id/StingingVelvet/,3,,0,14.6,March,5,870,0,1,"First-person shooter/stealth/RPG hybrid games are probably my favorite video game genre. I should love this game, but instead I just don't have much fun playing it. Why? I think it's a combination of lots of little annoyances...The writing feels very ""written in Russian and then put through a translator"" rather than having a fresh script written in English. On top of the awkwardness and stilted dialog that causes, the dialog is also very DUDE BRO, if that makes sense, like Duke Nukem taken seriously. I don't think the actual plot is very well presented either, and thus you have little motivation as a player outside of pure gameplay.The gameplay is... fine. It's strange in that it mixes Bioshock style indoor areas with Far Cry style outdoor areas with some Doom bosses thrown in for good measure. It doesn't feel focused, and since it took 6 years to develop I'm guessing the team were pulling themselves in lots of different directions rather than focusing on being the best at A or B. It also has that janky feel, you know what I mean, which does it no favors. Last but not least, no video game player in this world likes respawning enemies. None, zero, zip.Art design is cool and yet also feels repetitive, like once you've seen some whacky alt-future Soviet robotic stuff you've kind of seen the rest of it? The lighting can look pretty simplistic and flat a lot of the time too, robbing the game of a richness it needs. This is especially true in the outdoor areas, where building interior lighting straight-up looks like a 15 year old game (Crysis for example).Anyway... those are my best guesses as to why I don't enjoy this as much as I should. I'll probably finish it eventually. It's not BAD really, just... meh."

I beat the game. I *enjoyed* the story. I enjoyed the character design. I wasn't a fan of the FOV lock (a simple mod fixed that, just a drag and drop into the pak folder). After all, this is the age of modding. I wasn't overly a fan of the other ending-- however, knowing what I know now. I understand the story a whole lot more.Overall, the story was pretty good. I wasn't too much a fan of the linearity and would've absolutely loved more options when it came to the end of the game. There were things I expected. I wasn't a fan of the AI clumping up to kill me, I expected more from that. However, it wasn't horrible to deal with and it was fine most of the playthrough. It made me think a whole lot more and it made the deaths I had in the gameplay frustrating, but I eventually figured out my abilities absolutely help, rather than just my axe and swinging and dodging around. I enjoyed this game, a lot. $140 well spent. I'll keep playing as much as I can until the DLCs release. This was a fun game."

As soon as the game goes from indoor lab setting to the outdoor/open-world bit it starts to lag.Despite lowering all settings to the minimum it remained jittery and sometimes downright froze for a second. This happened even in cutscenes, resulting in mismatch between audio and visual, taking me out of the story.I will not recount how often I died due to glitches or laggy moments, but in conclusion I can say that while the game has good ideas and can look nice, it is NOT worth the full price. It would have needed more time to be polished, but I assume the current political issues forced them to release the game to even hope of selling it."

The weapons are probably more the okayish parts its a few melee weapons with some ranged weapons so you be easy through them but am okay with that as I prefer quality over quantity.Now for the more well meh parts are probably the times when you are outside, it is more a struggle to be outside with the flying robots constantly repairing and appearing as there is a infinite amount of those little bastards, and at some places there are just a ton of enemies which makes sneaking almost impossible, and if you think killing sure go for it but if you don't pay attention then those things will be back up with full health again.Another meh point that I find is probably the voice acting, it would have been so much better if we had a silent protagonist or something from like actual Bioshock with how Booker is, this one just feels a bit out of place sometimes instantly talks back when someone asked him a question, or just out of place words like they tried to make it funny but instead it became a bit more awkward, hell I sometimes even cringed a little bit from all the voice acting.BUT if you are looking for a replacer to either a good Doom or Bioshock then this game really fits well for you and I really enjoy it."

If you pay attention to names and read story notes you can start piecing together what's going on. The dodge battle mechanic is a little wonky and can dodge in a direction you didn't intend and must be used after enemy heavy attack is telegraphed and not before or you will get hit.

1387,OP4QU3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/OP4QUE69/,1,,1,16.8,March,28,88,0,1,"I'd start off by saying that this game might not be for everyone. It is a good game in my opinion with a unique overall story and game play experience. Combat can be difficult at times and the AI can be quite difficult to handle since their ability to spot you is just outstanding. Resource management is easy so that isn't an issue. There are some unique weapons that can be crafted but to get their attachments you need to do a lot of exploring in the areas scattered throughout.The game is puzzle driven so expect a ton of puzzles after short intervals and although they are mostly a repetitive types but yet they can be challenging at times although not a big deal.Overall I would rate the game a 7.5/10 because of the good visuals, good soundtracks.The biggest con is the voice lines for the main character which are a cringe fest at moments and I wished if he would just keep quiet for a moment.Game is worth trying although you can wait for a sale and get it for a discounted price if there will be any."
1388,Xanitos,https://steamcommunity.com/id/David_Xanitos/,3,,1,44.9,March,28,"2,806",0,1,"Atomic Heart is exceptionally unique in all the right places. I won't spoil the game in this review but I will say that the music, the art style, the game system and world are all so interesting experience  that this game will be remembered through history because of everything new that it brings to the table.Atomic Heart also builds on existing Imm Sim game concepts and stream lines so much in a very fun way, Every upgrade resource you use to make your character or weapons more powerful can be 100% refunded, this means that you can fully upgrade something, see if you like it and if you don't, you can break it down and upgrade something else with all the same resources, this eliminates the FOMO issue with most games like this. Making it a Joy to experiment without the need to reload a save or restart your run. Looting is also streamlined to be satisfying and fast so you can get your resources and move on quickly.The amount of combos you can do in combat isn't Fromsoftware level but it does have great variety and deserves to be emulated in what I hope will be future sequels.This game looks stunning for a modern era game, even though it's built on UE4 not UE5. It does have some bugs with animations and such but I have seen much much worse issues from AAA game studios, The performance of this game, as whole was so good that it was notable to me that my FPS almost never dropped even on ultra settings. Mundfish certainly should give talks about what they did with Unreal Engine to make the game look this nice and perform this well with an an older system.The game breaks up a lot of its core elements in a natural way as to never bore you with the same things for too long. Corridor shooting, Puzzle solving, Arena battles, world building, set pieces, mini bosses, open world exploration. The blend of it all is healthy without it overstaying its welcome.As for the story and the humor, I recommend going into this game as thinking of it like a solid B Movie flick, behind the veil it has some great ideas, and some thought provoking questions about science and humanity. The main story is crazy, over the top, doesn't, take it self too seriously, and has some great meta commentary and jokes about the world we live in.Over all I highly recommend Atomic Heart due to the experience it delivered, which can be summed up in one word:  Unique"

1397,Cheeseburger,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995610075/,1,,1,58.3,March,14,292,0,1,"I'll give it a 7 out of 10. (Maybe as low as 6, but I'll be generous and give it a 7.) I gave this game a ""thumbs up"" only because there was no neutral choice, and you have to choose either a thumbs up or down to post a review.It's as if the creators of Atomic Heart played the Bioshock games, particularly Bioshock Infinite, and wanted to make a soviet counterpart, replacing the American exceptionalism of Bioshock Infinite with communist doctrine. Except they failed to realize that the American exceptionalism backdrop of Bioshock Infinite was placed there as a dystopian mockery of the idea, not as praise.  As such, since they missed that, the Atomic Heart story praises communist principles and ideals over and over, without offering any true criticisms. Sure, the specific version of  ""Kollektiv"" (to which you will be introduced in the game) is bad and corrupt, brought about by one or two corrupt individuals, but never is there any real critique of communism in general. Only praise. Praise, over and over and over.As a matter of fact, the whole storyline of Atomic Heart is lacking; it's disjointed and not at all compelling. The protagonist is *deeply* unlikable. There are some good things about the game though. First, there's a lot of game. It took me on the order of ~50 hours to play it (that's several times the play-length of Bioshock Infinite). Of course, I'm the type of gamer who takes my time and likes to explore everywhere, basking in the scenery. And Atomic Heart has some wonderful and wacky scenery. There are both linear progression sections as well as wide, open world sections. The ecosystem of open world sections is actually pretty intricate and fairly enjoyable (e.g., finding a camera control station, opening doors by monitoring the correct camera, temporarily disabling all the robots in a given area, only after entering the correct building with the now-open door, etc.)There are some pretty fun puzzles in the game in what are called ""proving grounds,"" offering loot in the form of materials and blueprints allowing you to upgrade your weapons. One of the funnest parts of the game are figuring out how to even enter any given proving ground. These are sometimes just as challenging as the puzzles themselves. There are many homages and tributes to other video games and stories. A few examples include the Bioshock series, obviously (floating cities and a not-so-obscure reference to ""Rapture""), Half-Life (mention of a silent protagonist in a hazard suit), Doom (iddqd and idkfa), and maybe even Douglas Adams, Hitchhiker's Guide series (""Thanks for all the fish."") I'm sure there are more that I've missed.The combat mechanics are not bad -- not particularly great, but not bad either. The ability to spray enemies with ""Polymeric Jet,"" enhancing the effect of freezing or shocking them, is pretty novel. The weapons are nicely varied and configurable to suit different playstyles. I say the combat is ""not bad"", but frequently it is spoiled -- or shall I say, ruined -- by quick time events (where you have to press or mash some random key within a time limit). Atomic Heart does this frequently in boss fights. Look, if you're a game developer and you're reading this, and you are considering putting quick time events into your first person shooter's combat mechanics, stop. Just stop it. If your first person shooter's combat mechanics rely on quick time events, the game's combat immersion has already failed. You have failed. Stop it. Now.   There is no penalty for tearing down one weapon to use the resources to upgrade another weapon, which is really nice. I wish more games did this. There's limited inventory space, but you can chose what you carry with you; there's no limitation on the number of guns you carry, so long as they fit in your inventory. Since health and ammo are also inventory items, this creates strategical tradoffs that the player needs to consider on what to carry with them. The music is sometimes fabulous. That should come as no surprise, since Mick Gordon was listed as composer/sound designer for the game. I say ""sometimes,"" because the music is often hit or miss. But for those times when it's good, it's really, really good. In summary, there's a lot of good, but there's also some bad. 7 out of 10."

1400,SoupAssassin,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971177338/,1,,1,32.4,March,12,258,0,1,"I really enjoyed my time with this game, quite a bit especially later on in its campaign, but it has some issues which I'll lay out here.For starters the game looks great, it's built in Unreal Engine 4 and it shows. It's not the most beautiful game ever but it looks every bit the part of a 2023 game and just as importantly it runs great. I played it maxed at 1440p on an i9/3080/32gb and it ran at a nice high FPS way above 60 throughout most of the game. The most recent major patch, which was applied 3/10/23, seems to have caused some minor occasional hitching for me as I did my final play session to completion here yesterday, especially in the overworld. Not a huge deal but thought I'd mention it.Game has an excellent, excellent soundtrack. Some real bangers in here, but the game doesn't utilize them all that intelligently sometimes. There are some really excellent tracks that only get used for a single fight, and there is little to no combat music for the first 1/3ish of the game which is an odd choice. Overall though it's great, and the in between atmospherics are excellent with tons of environmental noises. In the overworld you can hear the booming and whining of all the crazy technology in the facility, and while inside underground facilities and similar you can hear the banging of pipes and machines and all sorts of other atmospherics. Sound design is mostly excellent like the graphics.Gameplay wise, the game is mostly great but suffers from pacing issues. Combat doesn't really start to come together into something great until about halfway through the game, early on it's just not that fun battling mustache bots with an axe and pistol. However by the end of the game with a full weapon and power loadout of heavily upgraded gear you're a walking machine of destruction and it's a lot of fun. The fully upgraded shotgun and pashtet are absolutely nuts when paired with cryonics and telekinesis. Fights that would have been a massive struggle early on turn into joyous bouts of epic destruction. Crafting is simple but gets the job done, and looting is great - your glove sucks stuff in from a reasonable distance and anything that can't fit in your bag is auto routed to your storage box. It's also worth noting that the game has pretty decent enemy variety, but you guessed it, it takes too long to present them. Ever present the pacing issues, it just kinda permeates the first half of the game - it's not bad by any means early on, but it's not until you leave the VDNH facility or a bit after, which is a solid 8-10 hours into the game, do things really start to click and does the games combat begin to elevate from ""acceptable/OK"" to ""really damn good"".Much was made of Atomic Hearts open world prior to release, and while the game does have an open world, it's IMO there more in service to the story and atmosphere than the gameplay. It's really there to provide an emphasis to the size of the facility and demonstrate the feel of the world they created in between major setpiece locations more so than a massive thing meant to be explored extensively. The only real ""extra"" content present in the open world besides basic scrap loot is the ""Testing Grounds"" which are big underground complexes of mostly large roomscale puzzles that grant the player with lots of extra scrap for crafting and most importantly blueprints for weapon upgrades. They are optional but collectively they only add about 3-4 hours to the game (there are only 8 of them) and are mostly fun to do, so just go ahead and do them. The later ones also add a good bit of story exposition that fleshes some stuff out and answers some questions the player might have.The story and characters are a mixed bag, but it's really going to depend on the individual player as to how they asses this. The main character, P3, is kind of annoying. He becomes slightly less annoying as the game goes on, and actually even has brief moments of thoughtfulness and endearment later in the game....but he never elevates to anything more than just kinda there. He didn't bother me but he might bother some, just depends. Charles on the other hand starts as just OK and becomes an excellent character as the game progresses and has a lot of great dialogue later on in the game as him and P3 start to soften up to each other, and he eventually becomes a core part of everything that is happening and acts as a very central piece of the game. I don't want to spoil anything, but Charles is great and will say a lot of stuff in later parts of the game that are genuinely thoughtful and chilling/sobering discussions on the role of governments and masters and power dynamics and the human condition and AI and robotics and all sorts of forward thinking subjects that go quite a bit beyond the average game. There is a reason for this as you'll learn, but again, no spoilers, so just know that Charles isn't just a fun AI sidekick. His presence eventually begins to elevate the entire story and game and that is appreciated because the game's story takes way too long to get truly rolling - again, pacing issues, and P3 alone could not have carried the burden of making the story evocative at all. It's also worth mentioning that there are some brief moments where I think the translation was not so perfect, although they are few and far enough in between not to interfere too much and they seem mostly to occur in the first half.The story itself is good, but I can't really explain why without spoiling important elements and plot twists. Those ever present pacing issues dampen the story at first but as you begin to learn more, and realize things are NOT what they seem you'll start to get hooked. The final act of the game especially, the final 4-5 hours, are incredibly intriguing as the situation begins to escalate and go far beyond the scope it's initially presented with. It's one of those stories where ""once you know you know"" - you can only truly enjoy the story once, so try and appreciate it while it's happening because if you ever want to play it again it will be with an entirely different lens. The ending is....uh....something; it isn't unsatisfying, it isn't particularly overly satisfying either. It's just kinda sudden and shocking. It's not as if the game doesn't answer your questions necessarily, it mostly does, but it's just....I dunno haha you just have to experience it I guess. Like I said you can only truly experience the story once. Overall I really enjoyed my time with Atomic Heart, and I really really enjoyed my time with the final 1/3 of the game in particular. It's not perfect but for a freshman effort it's great - you can tell a lot of love was poured into this project. It's a great game that a lot of gamers will really appreciate, but for all of its charms you can't help but also point at the flaws even if they don't drag the whole experience down too much. 8/10"

This game is a true gem and I am very happy to experience it. Every new encounter was challenging, fun, and satisfying to complete. The game kept me on my toes and never went stale, they kept it interesting through the whole journey. Geoffplaysguitar, Mick Gordon, good god this soundtrack slaps so hard. There are many bugs, but i've only had one game breaking experience where i got locked out of an area and had to load a previous save. After that, smooth sailing from there. Seeing what their original vision for the game was, I would love to have that. There was a lot of things cut from the game and i hope to see them appear in future updates or DLC. It seems that Mundfish is actively engaging the community for bug fixes, and even ideas to implement into the game.

A kick-ass soundtrack, a simple but fun and easy to fine-tune weapon/ability upgrade system in which you are frequently incentivised to perfect your arsenal without any downside or loss in resources. Incredible graphics and aesthetic. I'd say about the only place it falls short is on the story. It's just kind of average for an immersive sim game. It sets up a lot of intrigue, hits a lot of cliche's for the genre at this point but it kind of falls flat trying to explain the polemic and outlandish dialogue, characters and events. Still, the bioshock styled exploration, the frenetic combat switching between weapons based on weaknesses, synergies, range and priority targets accompanied by an unforgettable soundtrack completely carry any issues with narrative beats or conclusions.Main complaints not tied to the experience itself is the price tag (just a bit too high despite how high quality the product is) and kind of a big one but how the ♥♥♥♥ do you make an FPS game without an FOV slider????

The atmosphere and set up is good, I can see why people can get annoyed by the repairing robots, but I personally feel like it adds to the atmosphere of robots turning on the civilians and taking over. Also I didn't really come across the bullet sponges that people have been complaining about, I guess they didn't go and explore and upgrade their weapons because I really didn't struggle against most of the things the game threw at me; however  I will say though the main character at times is unlikable and I would highly recommend you switch the Voice Acting to Russian instead of having the English dub. The story was  interesting and engaging, but I feel like we're left in the dark for too long about what's going on.  The combat and gun play feels good and smooth and the animations just add to the charm, also you can choose what abilities and guns you want to use. You will have to use most of your abilities and guns to outplay situations, and this game is filled with puzzles that require thinking. The graphics in this game are beautiful and definitely on a next generation level. I ran into few minor bugs while playing this game, but at least it's actually optimize unlike most releases on PC.

There are some flaws here and there, but overall I had fun and that's all that matters. If you like games such as the BioShock series, Fallout series, or DOOM series, I highly recommend Atomic Heart."
1427,DiscoCrash,https://steamcommunity.com/id/discocrash/,3,,1,38.9,March,1,"1,110",0,1,"There is a really engaging game in here that is unfortunately lowered down in bad writing.In terms of pure FPS gameplay, I think Atomic Heart does a fantastic job. I got alot of enjoyment figuring out the best ways to handle combat with my powers, how to farm up robot parts by using certain systems within the game, and overall I think its moment-to-moment gameplay is rock solid. The puzzles in this game are incredibly complex and unique, and are on par with some of the most interesting ones i've ever seen in a game. Doing all the research stations introduces you to a huge variety of puzzles that are all pretty difficult and satisfying to solve, and the payoff is generally well worth the hassle. Very well done.But, Atomic Heart isnt all sunshine and rainbows. The writing in this game is quite poor, with a really mean and aggressive protagonist, hyper-sexualized side characters, and some really ham-fisted quests that any high school student could have came up with.By the end of the game, I was really happy with this game and how things ended up in the story, until I reached the end. For me, the endings (i did both) were unbelievably bad and really brought down my overall happiness with the product. I was on track to giving this like an 8.5/10 until i did the endings, which dropped it down to like a 7/10. If this was written better I have no doubt this could have gone down as an FPS great, but unfortunately we got what we got.Overall though, this game has alot of content and most of it is enjoyable, and I do recommend it."
1428,FetusFleshlight,https://steamcommunity.com/id/notsogerman/,1,,1,27.5,February,28,269,0,1,"If you enjoyed Bioshock or the Far Cry games you will enjoy this. I would rate this game an easy 7.5/10After 27 hours of game-play on the hardest difficulty I finished it and got the bad ending (I think there are 2 endings, maybe 3 if there is a secret ending). Pros; - The OST for this game is phenomenal. The music in this game matches the game-play in a similar way DOOM or Hotline Miami music matched their game. This game absolutely deserves an award for the OST. I found myself listening to a few of the songs while in the car or playing other games. The music is nothing short of FIRE. - The graphics and performance. The graphics look amazing and the performance of the game runs better then 90% of other games with graphics barley close to this games. At all graphic settings maxed out on 2560x1440p I got 120-165fps consistently. - Combat is fun, challenging at times, with plenty of different weapons and abilities to choose from and upgrade. The combat is very close to that of Bioshock from the skill trees to weapon upgrades. - Enemy variation is very good. Plenty of unique enemy types all with their own strengthens, weaknesses and abilities for you to go up against. - Looting is so damn satisfying. The way you use the force to rattle apart cabinets, chests, desks, and drawers is just *chef kiss*.- P-3 and CHAR-LES are hilarious (who you play as and your AI glove). They often say what you are thinking or simply just make fun of situations in the game and it added a great layer of humor in the game for me that I loved. The game memes just as much as it takes it self serious. - Level design is very well done and very well put together. The overall atmosphere of every area is perfect and done exactly how I imagine the director of the game wanted. None of it is bland and all is very awe inspiring and interesting to look at. - Story is predictable at times, but it has plenty of twists and although seems clear at the start, you will start questioning and doubting everything with consistent surprises that keep making you change your mind on where the story is going. - Definitely a game for streamers to play with an audience. Very entertaining to watch and play. - No game breaking issues that I encountered. Even my personal cons are not that bad, but are worth mentioning. - Gave me my new catchphrase ""CRISPY CRITTERS!""- Has Granny Zina. I love Granny Zina. Why is there not more of Granny Zina? Give us more Granny Zina. Cons; - The pacing in this game is off. One second you will be exploring, then the very next you are running for your life while blasting anything you can frantically, then the very next stuck in a building with 5 locked doors that you need to do tedious puzzles on each door to get through to the next room that will just lead to more wandering, or frantic shooting, or more puzzles. This loop is pretty common in this game. The puzzles slow down the game a lot and in most areas the puzzles don't even feel needed at all. It feels like these puzzles were either added to pad game time or to try to break up the action by allowing you to explore, when exploring is not really that rewarding because the best thing you can get is blueprints for new weapons or attachments, and the map shows you where to find these blueprints so more times then not you don't actually need to explore this massive beautiful world they created. - Animation of human NPCs is very....strange. All the other AI models in this game have well made animations and I never batted an eye at the animation until I saw a human NPC move outside of a rendered cut scene. This NPC (I wont say who as it is close to a spoiler) was very stiff, and moved like an idle FNAF animatronic. This jarred me so much that for about an hour or two I genuinely believed this human NPC was actually an advanced robot that would reveal itself later in the story. When that reveal never happened once I finished the game I finally realized that it was just REALLY BAD animation done for this character. - Enemy population in my opinion should be much higher. Yes, there is a very healthy amount of enemies roaming the land, but usually in groups of 2-5 and they are all massive bullet sponges. I would prefer slightly weaker enemies with a higher population, but this is more of a personal gripe rather then an issue with the game. - Enemy outposts are pointless. The map is scattered with robot outposts like the Far Cry games and you are supposed to take them down...but its to easy and not rewarding AT ALL. You go to a camera, hack camera to open a door, and click a button to turn off all robots in that area. That is literally it. Maybe you will find some scraps to get 1/4 of the ingredients for a blue print you want but there is nothing more to it besides spending time to farm XP if you want to level up your abilities if you choose not to shut down the robots in the immediate area. - No side quests. Nothing besides the main story. No survivors you can find and help, no secrets to really explore, no bonus side stories. Just the main story. Again making exploring kinda pointless. - Can not place custom markers on the map, and the map doesn't have the best detail, so if you want to find your way to a specific area then you're going in blind and better have good navigation skills. In a military sim game this feature works, but in this game it does not. - NOT ENOUGH GRANNY ZINA! towards late game she calls you and tells you that you can come visit her any time for more weapons/gear and you literally can not go to her because the entire area she is in is not accessible anymore. Maybe I am an idiot and could not figure out how, but shes on an entirely different island that you can not swim to and the way you took to get off is no longer accessible. Over all was a very fun game that was well made. Some aspects may have been rushed, and some of my cons might come in future updates or DLC additions. Who knows? If you are bored of all your current games pick this up for a good time. I don't know if I can say it is worth the $60 because to me it was worth it, but at the same time if this were to have come out around other major releases I would say its worth a minimum of $40."
1429,Kazzy | Team K4L,https://steamcommunity.com/id/almightykaz/,1,,1,11.9,March,1,263,0,1,"Mixed feelings on this one but since there isn't a ''I don't know how to feel'' sort of button I'll just give it a thumbs up since I did enjoy my time for the most part. First and foremost the graphics are stunning, adding ReShade mods on top of the already great looking game makes it look even better. Story is a weird one, it feels like your playing a dream inside a crackheads mind who's OD'd on acid. It's bizarre to say the least but the later half of the game had me engaged whereas the beginning to middle felt meh. It's like Bioshock had a baby with Wolfenstein, gameplay is fine but found it to be a tad tedious at times when facing huge groups of enemies, not to mention the lack of using more than 2 abilities at one time which was quite annoying. You notice a big difficulty spike as the game progresses and it hits you HARD. Recommend playing it on a sale rather than paying for it at full price."
1430,Conqueror Koala,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198088883462/,1,,1,21.1,February,27,185,0,1,"I enjoyed the game.I liked the artistic style, dialogue, voice-acting, and story.While playing on the hardest difficulty (which I do not recommend, it just had tanky enemies that felt unfun to fight), it took about 20 hours exactly to beat. This was not including the optional content that you have to go out of your way to complete; however, I did read every terminal and email I could find. There was probably around a hundred of them.Overall, if you enjoy reading backround lore through emails, looking at the terminals that show the base personnel and reading their biography so that when references are made later you can understand who they were, then this game is for you.  The game is not nearly as good when blasted through vs. methodically reading the content you pass by in my opinion, as a lot of world building is done through terminals and voice recordings.On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being trash, and 10 being on the same tier as Bioshock, I would rate it 7.5/10Side note, the game ran very well for me, I had a constant 144 fps throughout the game on max settings; however, I do have a very powerful computer. Overall I was surprised that the game was optimized at all, let alone how well optimized it actually was"

1436,Daler,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198092687700/,1,,0,21.6,February,27,65,0,1,"The writing of the story needs so much work, the visuals are the only thing that carries the whole thing. I played it in russian and didnt hear the ""Crispy Critters!"" god awful catchphrase, in russian it was simply ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pies"" (Ебанные Пироги). Pls translate that better next time or pick something more impactful than a random phrase (proven by lore).I dont mind the swearing but the way it was used is like a child that learned new words and that tries to rebel against his parents. You can do better portraying people especially scientists, in a fictional world yes but still. Swearing has to have a purpose and intensity to highlight emotions, bluntness and cut to the chase attitude. The game just randomly assigned it to portray people as vile pieces of ♥♥♥♥ not even attempting to seem polite. Another thing I wanted to mention about the writing is world building, I feel like the world and description in the beginning of the game is the only thing that describes the lives of normal folks and the timeline of the Atomic Heart. Yes, there is so much tidbits of interpersonal relations but I didnt feel like polymers are that impactful beyond the soviet union and le evil plan to make capitalists so much money and displace people from their jobs... Finally, lore wise I felt like the writers got lost and couldn't formulate the message in the game beyond trying their best to portray the evil nature of communism. Basically packing the whole argument within the revocation of free will (under the plan of kollectiv 2.0) and the plan ""Atomic Heart"" (spoiler so I wont say further). It really felt like authors simply used the catchphrases like imperialism, workers, and collective as catchphrases without understanding their descriptive significance nor foundation. I think this game perfectly describes the popular understanding and perception of ussr in lack of understanding, any sort of research and simple nostalgia topped with vibes of cool soviet rock music with propaganda posters on every corner. Gameplay was ok. Abilities were pretty boring to use and didn't feel like that impactful or significant neither in lore nor gameplay. The variety of weapons is nice, but I didn't fully feel the upgrade system or felt the necessity for it, the constant looting got super annoying. Exploring the world never felt that rewarding and the endless waves of Romashki and alert systems was tiring. Regarding the enemies, I think it was nice that we had two types of robotic and organic things to kill. However, I felt that having important lore connections was severely lacking. I wish we could talk to more robots and maybe see a combination of both to make the world feel more alive. The world was so dead that the only ""things"" we talked to were the echoes of dead people killed somewhere along the way except that one guy near the plants.Спасибо девам за игру но если вы (сценаристы) срете на советский союз и на злых комми за все злое то вы хотя бы сюжет получше то сделайте."
1437,sssawfish,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016164777/,1,,1,31.8,February,27,327,0,1,"I was worried that this game was not going to be good, given it was a new company working on a AAA title, and the recent controversies that followed it (regardless of your opinion I did find it possible that it could have impacted development in some way). Luckily however I was proven wrong, this game is amazing and it shows a promising start for Mundfish.Everything about the environment, and setting is astounding. The retro-futuristic soviet style definitely shines throughout. The gameplay itself was amazing, with enemies that were interesting and fun to fight, and the puzzles (located mostly in the optional testing grounds) were challenging but not infuriating and thus fun. The story was very compelling and whilst there were some twists I was expecting, I also didn't expect some of them as well, especially the ending (I know there are two but one of them is literally just ending the game before the final boss fight) which I won't spoil here but was quite the shock and took me off-guard.There are two things I would like to point out however despite all of these positives. The movement in this game can feel clunky at times, which has caused me some frustration throughout my playthrough. And as weird as this sounds, the game is a little too horny. Sex with robots is talked about a lot more than you might expect and whilst this is often used cleverly, like during the theater area where it's used to show the corruption and vice of the high ranking communist party members, it is still somewhat overdone and a bit weird.That being said though those are fairly small downsides and the majority of the game is very good. Overall, I highly recommend it, 9/10(EDIT: I originally stated that the achievements were pretty broken but a patch has been released now which should fix most of the issues.)"

The main character will soften up and the gameplay in the ""open world"" is much more intuitive. You have your main mission, and extra stuff to explore, its repetitive but I still enjoyed it. Especially if you find a weapon build, that you enjoy! (Try full energy and ZVEZDOCHKA with the second rightclick ability.

Then make the protagonist completely obnoxious, to the point where you should bother even trying to listen to audio diaries because theres going to inevitably be some sort of pointless banter. The gameplay is fun for the most part, its nothing ground breaking in terms of what you've seen before. The story seems to be there...but its pretty vapid overall. The dialogue in general is probably the biggest setback for the game. I'm about 2 hours in, I'll keep playing to see it through. If you're on a budget...honestly Returnal is a better recent release. This game is worth your time, but not a priority imo. Would be a pretty decent offering if you could click a menu button to mute the main character."

Not only is the tutorial extremely fun and rewarding, but the combat systems and skill trees are fun as well. It can be a little raunchy at times and has a lot of sexual innuendos but that just adds to this games unique humor. The performance is extremely optimized and works well even with my 2070 Laptop, so if you were afraid of performance issues you should be fine! My one critique which could be fixed with an update is that the crafting system requires a specific material (scrap metal) in almost every gun but robots and the environment barely drops any scrap metal even though it is said that it is frequent. I have consistently gotten only one or two from a robot when you need hundreds to craft guns and upgrade. Like said, this game is great and has a lot of potential with a few small updates to be even better. If you are looking for a fun, raunchy, and combat-filled action-adventure rpg that has a beautiful open world and fun story than this is the game for you."

Graphics are very good, haven't seen any bad textures or clipping3. Great RPG system, you can respect freely with abilities and you can get all the components back from guns if you dissemble them4. Melee combat just feels right, if you have played Dying Light then you know what i mean5. The story that i have played so far is somewhat interesting and simple (hopefully its expanded upon with the dlc)Edit at 13.7 hours: The story has gotten more interesting6. The world building/aesthetic is quite fantastic somewhat reminiscent of Bioshock/Wolfenstein7. Badass Russian GrannyNegatives:1. not being able to run is a little annoying, the character just kinda does a goofy power walk everywhere lolEdit: there is a character upgrade to improve movement speed, its useful for combat obv. but also tad annoying during certain puzzles but nothing major2. If you have a problem with the fov then you need to download a mod called: Flawless Widescreen (me personally I'm not bothered by it but thought i would add it here anyway)3. People have complained about mouse acceleration but all you really need to do is just fiddle around with the in game sens and get it to a level that works for you4. Climbing can be tedious but only for the stuff where you have to shimmy along a beam but from what i have played there aren't too many so don't worryFinal Conclusion:A lot of games over the last few years have launched with either terrible optimisation, a half functioning game or locked content behind a paywall that doesn't need a price tag. Atomic Heart is nice breath of fresh air where the combat is engaging and there are a few play styles to choose from, the world building/aesthetic is amazing somewhat similar to Bioshock (as mentioned above in positives) but it is its own thing and there is also 4 DLC coming along if you have purchased either gold or the premium edition. Is this game worth a AAA price tag? absolutely! the devs seem to actually care and have put in a great effort to make this game very special, especially since they are a new company and this is their first title."

Ballistic guns use ammo, that you can craft from scavenged parts, energy weapons use special energy meter and your melee attacks recharge that same energy meter.The character can crouch and dispose of enemies using stealth, or go all-in guns blazing, skillfully dodging enemy attacks with dashes.The whole system is pretty slick and works like a charm.Steam Deck users, the game is very well optimized and can run on Steam Deck in solid 40 FPS on medium settings, while still looking positively stunning.I salute the devs for delivering us such an amazing game - highly recommended!"
1478,marthiology,https://steamcommunity.com/id/marthiology/,4,,1,43.3,February,21,125,0,1,"Loved it!Expected a little bit more for a game I waited years for, but this is DEFINITELY a must buy for fans of the Bioshock franchise.The game is VERY well optimized even with the most insane graphical settings turned on, controls (i.e. bindings, sensitivity, etc) are very easy to navigate and alter with no need for third party software to macro the extra mouse buttons thankfully.The game is somewhat challenging so far, but I am still in the beginning of the campaign. The gameplay mechanics work smoothly, but there are odd GIF looking animations during some scenes. Hopefully they rectify this in the near future. Additionally, the story is interesting (somewhat), but the English dubbing, and especially the main character's forced personality, can deflect the immersive experience at times. He's like a kid in school who just recently discovered vulgarity and automatically added it to his day-to-day vocab. The game might be best played in its native language, with English subtitles on for purists looking to emotionally feed off of the vocal tones, rather than linguistic coherency.Overall, I'm definitely seeing the game through cause it's VERY enjoyable, and to have combat mechanics that work well, in a very well-optimized engine just feels like a treat when comparing it to other recent releases."

1483,SmallfryRie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/smallfryrie/,3,,1,31.0,February,21,315,0,1,"So far I am enjoying the game a lot. I'm not too far into it yet, but the atmosphere and incentive for exploring to get more upgrades is addicting. The amount of possibilities of different builds you can go with is very refreshing to see in a game like this to further deviate it from feeling so linear even with it being a more linear based story game. With that being said I feel the game world offers enough open-ess to it to feel less linear. The combat is slower paced and more difficult, but those aren't complaints. I feel the combat feels more immersive and you feel much more engaged with each encounter because of it. The story so far is intriguing as well and I don't find the dialogue to be as bad as others are stating, but I'm not necessarily saying it's the best either.As for the performance I am running a 3080, 5900X and 32GB of RAM. Almost all max settings with DLSS on quality and I am getting 130-165 (capped the game to my refresh rate) easily. No stutters so far either. The only gripes are the forced mouse acceleration and lack of a FOV slider. Flawless Widescreen fixed the FOV issue easily for me and to be honest the mouse acceleration doesn't even feel that bad to me as some others make it out to be. It is a slower paced game, so the acceleration doesn't throw me off as much, but obviously I'd still hope to see if they update he game later on to be able to disable it.Overall though, I've been having a lot of fun with the combat, exploring different ability/weapon combos, and learning each new step in the story. If any of my opinions change the more I play I will come back and edit this review."

The story is alright so far and I feel curious to learn more about the story. But the game in the current state has too many bugs. I have lost about 4 hours of game time due to various issues described now 1) Many people including me had a weird issue where the game would say it saved but it would not actually. Some people were lucky enough that they died soon after saving and went back to that save point but for me I went 2 hours without dying and assumed the game would save every time it said it did. I lost 2 hours of game time there. The fix was to delete some of the old saves. 2) Twice I died while getting out of a burning car, and the game would freeze on that animation of getting out and I would die losing me more game time. 3) Random crashes on high end PC4) The game autosaved inside the boss arena instead of outside. I dont have the neccasary ammo to beat this boss, my options is to try and beat this boss with melee or go back to my last save point which is 20-30 mins back. Why is this game saving in the boss arena"

The plot is okay but I am pretty sure I know what the 'twist' will be and have known since an hour in to the game. What is the absolute worst of all, though, is getting stuck when you climb a ledge. You just get stuck, there is no rhyme or reason, forcing you to reload a save which is just the stupidest ♥♥♥♥; there's absolutely no way the QA testers did not find this so it will absolutely has to be the developers choosing not to fix it. It can happen anywhere, at any time, just requires you to climb a ledge and it happens. Most games will unstick you after a few seconds but not this game. So, if you play the game, prepare to get stuck on random ledges after climbing them and hope you don't lose tons of progress.The only thing this game has going for it is very good performance optimization."

I love the aesthetic, I really do, and going in I really thought it was going to be like bioshock, but it just seems to be trying to do too many things at once. It wants to be an RPG with dialogue options and a skill tree, but at the same time it wants to be bioshock with abilities. It also wants to be a horror game while still being funny. Also the English VO is some of the worst I've ever heard in a video game. Every time this guy says ""CRISPY CRITTERS"" I want to punch my monitor. There are times where it's fun, but there are also too many times where it's a boring slog. I utterly despise how awfully slow it is to sneak in this game despite stealth being ENCOURAGED in most sections. I completely HATE how slow you walk in general despite most FPS encounters being fast-paced and frantic. How the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to use my axe to slice a dude in half when I lumber around like an obese person???

It is really awkward and inconsistent at times. Its possible you should use russian w/ subs if you care about purity. The story is fine. Above average. Heres the real issue:Its the above ground combat thats destroying this game. The game itself plays a lot like Bioshock and Prey mixed together. The gameplay has a mixture of combat and puzzles, but the only way i can really be immersed in it is when im in the underground levels. Above ground its entirely pointless as the small robots repair the large ones infinitely w/o end. There is no point. Its like an entirely different game that destroys my desire to want to explore and is there only for padding. Its really clear that the design of this game is off.Combat isn't bad. Its really basic and the NORA storage system is too silly to constantly have to get into. The UI could use an overhaul too. It really should be redesigned. ITs like they added the above ground for no good reason.  There are no quests to complete, just bunkers to move towards in poorly rendered vehicles or on foot with random houses scattered here and there. And of course robots everywhere that are perpetually repaired. Stealth is also non existent where robots can see you through bushes for no good reason. And CCTV cameras can be disabled but as this is only temporary the game forces you to destroy it and, like the others, it gets repaired. So combat situations have to be calculated to get kills. You collect parts after and then have to move on because you can't stop the endless waves of repair bots from fully repairing all robots you just downed. It makes high alert battles frustrating and pointless as every robot you kill gets repaired. You have no choice but to run. ITs just not fun.Underground the battle are smaller and much more manageable. I feel like they should have just scrapped the above ground sections all together. The UG sections have much better story elements that mean something and make you feel like you're progressing the story. The AG sections feel like they are just glorified loading screens to the next section and dont do much to make the game enjoyable. Just padding for exploration of a pointless environment that you dont need to explore  because it all looks the same and resources are so abundant everywhere else that you dont need to worry about it (you can just run to the next section). Its like if bioshock had AG sections between each level that existed for the sole purpose of moving to the waypoint that starts the next level.IF you like Prey a lot and bioshock, youll probably like this fine. Its a good game at its base, but it has lots of hang ups that keep it from reaching its full potential. Id wait on this one for patches or sales. 30 bucks or less on this one. Its a shame they did it this poorly."

The narrative is interesting, if so far predictable, and has kept me engaged enough to pay attention. The combat is mostly fun, though the environment seems to be the greatest enemy since it's far too easy to get stuck against or between geometry.Honestly the only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the writing for the dialogue. Many of P-3's lines are over the top and obnoxiously aggressive, and many other characters speak very oddly. The VAs are doing a great job with delivery but clearly are working with a translation that's a bit awkward."

The good:Cool world, cool atmosphere (a little too propaganda'y but it feels bioshock-like in that sense which is fine). The combat is good in theory (although is more frustrating half the time). The way you get items and the gravitational effects all are cool concepts. The bad:Worst main character I think I have ever encountered. Beyond obnoxious with terrible pacing and writing. Menus and UI are very not-user friendly; more frustrating than enjoyable. Random environmental deaths that compound the frustration. Dialogue doesnt match subtitles or skips through things at weird paces. Its all just very unpolished in a sense (although it looks great). Combat can be cool but ends up being fairly annoying often. I NEVER get motion sick in games but the FOV plus the ""spin to win"" axe attack is just bleh.Its not a bad game really, but the main character is the biggest turnoff ever. I legit couldnt stand him.

After the tutorial you are more or less left to your own devices.  One of the weapons is completely broken.  You can make it, but it is never useable.  You can work around that.The game, however, does have quick time events. The worst kind.  Random key quick time events.The end fight, in fact, is a random key quick time event.  So you die over and over guessing the right key.The story was weak until just at the end when a long set of exposition puts it all together for you.  Then, that quick time event.  Oof."

And in some occasions, the combat felt a little unpolished when getting swarmed by multiple enemies in open or interior areas.Regardless, i enjoyed the game, but hope these small issues can get improved."

You could chain 2 dashes once the character is upgraded, however agility is still quite poor.- There are extremely unwelcome movement corrections, for example when I jump towards a platform by the wall at an angle, the game corrects my movement to be parallel to the wall, then I fall down. It is honestly distracting and unnecessary, please just give me my movement exactly as input.- Wall climbing is very buggy, I can not pan the camera during certain animations, almost feels like I am fighting the camera controls some times.- Platforming is awful due to forced additional movement, game is correcting for something that it does not have to.- There are numerous bugs with pathing, I can get stuck between rocks or other props, or in a hole with no obvious way to jump out (work around: spam jump until the game boosts you randomly).Now the META:- The main goal is to get as much guaranteed invincibility as possible while doing as much damage as possible, and avoiding being knocked down at all costs. Reloads are cancelled on knock down.- Take care of the Character tree, get Sleazeball + Second Wind to dodge all damage, get Juggler for one-hand heal- Max SHOK for range (range is very bad if not upgraded, but when upgraded, it is at least 100m)- Max Energy Management to 5 bars- Max Electro (energy pistol)- Max Pistol <- absolutely required for accuracy"

Since there is no penalty it allows you to try everything and find your niche.* Doesn't get grindy-- if you take you time to find the loot you pass by you will have enough mats to craft what you need.* Combat is fun and requires skill. Its not dark souls but is still something you need to learn* The level design and scenery are amazing. Spent a lot of time admiring my surroundingsCons:* Would like to face more difficult enemies, maybe I spent to much time exploring and was over-leveled, but it felt easy enough I set the difficult to armegeddon and still was pretty much invincible by the end. * Would like more guns (some feel pretty useless)* Side quests would make it more engaging-- there is literally no one other than the main story characters other than enemies* Please make the shotgun craftable"

Gameplay was great with immersive music and atmosphere, weapons felt good and puzzles were well thought of. Lore in game was so good with audio logs that help with the world building for those into lore. But with that the game had its downsides such as glitches. Such as, getting stuck in pool, instant death stairway, unreachable loot, robotic and clunky npc movement such as ""Filatova""  and the final being the ending, GOD the ending I was so hyped and well drawn into the final part of the game and thought. ""I need to get the good and alternate endings, but to my surprise the good ending felt rushing and with so many questions than answers.

Mundfish did an amazing job! Especially taking into consideration that it's their first game (not taking into account the VR Soviet Lunapark) they truly have a lot of potential! I wish them nothing but the best with Atomic Heart 2 and/or other titles which will follow, I'm definitely buying their next games (DLC pass for AH already purchased). The game is totally worth playing, even if you don't get any of the Soviet references, the story is definitely worth the playthrough. Gameplay is fun, the weapons feel punchy, the craft is detailed. Open world to my taste wasn't the most pleasant experience,  but you can have some fun blasting through hoards of enemies, experimenting with loadouts and more. Issues such as FOV slider and other bugs are already planned to be fixed in an upcoming update, really like the fast response and communication from their side. Also worth mentioning is the absolutely amazing job on the game optimisation! Was able to play on my GTX 1050ti laptop and still enjoy the beautiful visuals with 60 FPS, BRAVO!"

Numerous bugs that ruined my playthrough and the amount of times I got stuck on the environment really hurt the game for me. English voice acting was trash and cringey half the time and the ending was extremely lack luster. The open world is painful to explore and enemies can get really spongey at times with the amount of ammo I had to pump into them (I played on the hardest difficulty, I get that). I have the amount of time I do on this game because most of the time I would open the game, play a few minutes, and get so frustrated and tab out to do something else. I really didn't have many expectations for this game but it still managed to let me down multiple times without fail.

Yes I played through what appeared to be the different choices for endings..  Over all it felt like there was something missing in the game play.  I dont feel complete with any of the endings.  I also feel like I missed something.  I was hoping to get something more but like I said I was expecting this kind of an ending.  Based on the choppy game play, dialog, and over all flow of the story I would rate this as a good game to buy on sale.  Towards the end I finally got the winks towards other games over the years.  Thats probably on me.  I enjoyed the art and new look toward the environment.  But I was not excited to keep exploring.  I was not pulled into different areas of the map to find new things.  I felt more compelled to just get it over with.  Its a one and done game.  It seems as though they would like you to enjoy the arena after you are done but in fact I am just done over all.  It fulfills the Russian story line.. Just wish it did more with the story.. It kind of felt like they ran out of ideas towards the end and just wanted it done.  Good game on sale.. Not full price.  Hope they do better next time.-------------------------------Update:  Ok, well, I said I would come back in a couple of months thinking the screen tearing was an optimization issue... It is.. in my opinion but the steam forums suggested to set the frame rate to a max of 90 to resolve that issue.  It worked.. I can play just fine now.  So I am pretty savvy about staying away from places to get stuck now.. I cant really give it a thumbs down since I am having a good time with the game play.  ------------------Ugh.. If you like choppy game play to the point of waking up dead, questionable dialog where the main character feels like a b list duke nukem, getting stuck in the environment (dont go trying to get around rock walls, or jump on broken magnet springs or get knocked into corners that have just about anything near by), oh and I know its a Russian game.  I was expecting the movie levels of propaganda.  You know the hero gets shrouded in the hammer and sickle after a big win or you get a bear pet that has a red hat or even some kind of homage to the proletariate... What I did not expect is to get constantly hammered with non stop dialog about how great the russian state is and how everyone wants their manufactured goods... and how much smarter they are and how great communism is and how bad capitalism is and well, the only thing I have not seen is how much sexier their women are and how much more handsome their men are... The only funny thing I heard when they said some people are more equal than others.Its funny, even with all that I see a potentially good game.  I would easily look past the dialog especially since the graphics are unique... they are in fact quite well done.  I like the style.  It just would be nice if I could play the game with out all of the restarting issues mentioned above.  I guess I am going to take a break on this for .. what?  a few months and see if its playable.  I expected more from the Russian programmers.  If the game play was as strong as the dialog's opinion of itself .. hell the game would practically play itself while it mined bitcoin in the background.  Sadly the boasting in game does not live up to the reality of the game play.  I hope to come back in a few months to edit this and give it a thumbs up.Just in case some one from the staff reads this... a teleport from stuck to a safe place would be nice .. but I know that can be game breaking... I would say a way to report bugs but I have not seen any that would be easily reportable.  It just needs optimization... and maybe a teleporter if you cant get to all of the places you can get stuck..."

It starts really promising, but as time goes on the gameplay gets repetitive, the combat become easy, and the story falls off a cliff. I played on the hardest difficulty and the only time I died more than once was at the very end of the game, where on the hardest difficulty I beat the final boss on my 3rd attempt, after blowing through almost 80% of the game not dying.The story is really good until its not. The animations later in the game make games made by Supermassive Games look like Avatar, and I wouldn't believe it was really in a game charging you $60 unless I had seen it for myself.That brings me to my last point, the price tag. The devs are smoking crack if they think this game is worth $60, as after playing it I don't think I would spend more than $30 to experience something like this again.All that in mind the game is decent, however the glaring flaws in its design are making it hard for me to ever recommend this game unless its on sale."

The story and character are likable and the soundtrack is mind blowing. Even if I finished the game I believe there are some ARG component in it because I feel there are some still some questions that needs answers and I'm scouring the open world to find them (maybe they will get explained in the DLC that is due in april). All in all I absolutely recommend this gem of a game and stop looking for r34 about the twins.

I'm a sci-fi nerd who has read a lot of Soviet sci-fi and played most immersive simus (I know Atomic Heart doesn't fall into this category, but it's hard not to relate with the overwhelmingly shocklike propaganda) but I don't understand how devs, as a group of Russians, perceive the sci-fi culture of their country.

Bonus: no predatory time wasting crafting/farming mechanics, the game doesn't rob you of resources for trying out different weapons.A collection of proven gameplay ideas, most of which fit great together.For once, an ending that subverts your expectations that's done right.An open world that's completely 100% optional and never tries to interfere into your campaign playthrough.Decent graphics and wonderful optimization that runs smoothly on GPU from 2019.Few negatives are as follows:a couple parts of the campaign really do drag for longer than they should;audio may get confusing at some places where the game tries to play music, background NPC dialogue and the main character's dialogue all at the same time, especially early on;the music playing on radios and loudspeakers, as cool as it is, tends to get tiresome after a couple loops."
1609,xps,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xperiens/,1,,1,44.3,March,3,572,0,1,"Disclaimer: the game contains a bunch of reference to the Russian culture, which can be missed by a lot of people who didn't grew up in it.Another disclaimer: this game doesn't feature ray tracing. Developers marketed it as heavily RT-enabled title, and this would actually have been a big improvement for the game visually, due to the amount of metals, glass, and mixed out/indoor areas. All these RT would help with. Unfortunately, developers did a bit of a dirty move and didn't explain why they didn't include the RT into the main game, just that RT will be added ""post-launch"" which is from the launch to infinity. I still recommend the game, but in the future, we should be cautious about this developers and the promises they make.This is a surprisingly great game. Aesthetics and ambiance are top notch. The soundtrack is intriguing, definitely. Some of the mechanics are novel to this genre, like looting everything from drawers by a telekinesis suction - quite satisfying.But be aware that there are of course quite a bit of cons to this game - you can get stuck in places quite often, and since you can only save at special stations, this can throw you back quite a bit, so save often. Also there are some cringey moments in the story, be prepared.But this - in my opinion at least - is heavily outweighed by the pros, overall game impressions are very good."

Story is very foreshadowed (and cheesy) throughout which makes it feel a little predictable, nevertheless incredible and enjoyable. The game has one ""quest"" which is the main path and anything else you do is optional. It doesn't hold your hand and what to do other than this main quest so get ready for exploration. Combat is great and worth investing in skills for awesome combinations. Game look and runs perfect. Only encountered 1 bug that threw me under the map when entering an elevator, this was easily overcome by how often the save points are so a quick reload and barely any progress lost.If you only follow the main quest I feel the game is only around 15 hours long - I would advise you complete all the ""Testing Grounds"" for maximum content."

1629,Michael the Brave,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Michael_the_Brave/,1,,1,42.6,March,8,"2,852",0,1,"In short: flawed but very enjoyable. Yes, it's a very cringe filled experience sometimes intentional, most time quite the opposite but there is a solid and interesting story peeking from under all of it and it touches some very interesting themes along the way. True, it starts off with some Half-life vibes, then feels like Bioshock and Wolfenstein a bit before settling into just being it's own self and when it does, it really kicks in. Gameplay wise it's the exact same stuff, familiar but not to the point of feeling like a lazy rip-off of any of those titles....more of a melee brawler than a shooter, with some light platforming and puzzles to fill in the gaps.  Unfortunately, you will encounter quite a handful of nasty bugs, from desktop crashes to being stuck in the environment, to key presses not being properly registered to plain ugly animations even on max details (busted out laughing when seeing a few characters going down stairs a la Daikatana). Addressing the elephant in the room, after playing the whole game I can safely say it contains no russian war propaganda and to be frank, given the themes it touches and the immense sarcasm dosages infused into them, the whole affair is filled to the brim with backhanded and subtle criticism. That's not to mention the fact that the no.1 song you'll end up stuck with in your head (and it's awesome remix) and which was featured in the promos belongs to a singer quite famous for her anti-war/Putin views (to the point that her husband, which fled the country, was designated as a ""foreign agent"").All in all, 41h on Armageddon difficulty leaving no stone unturned (didn't found it as being a difficult game, nor one with scarce resources as others claimed). A solid, good leaning towards great experience with a unique esthetic and twist on history, albeit a flawed one at times."

The game is a little lacking polish as you can tell the dev team is new to AAA titles. There are quite a few minor bugs, but nothing game-breaking. For instance, often lines of dialogue will get cut off by other scripted dialogue unless you stop moving every time dialogue occurs and wait for it to finish before progressing.Don't listen to the haters who bring politics into the gaming industry; these developers have nothing to do with Putin other than living in the same country. These same haters buy Chinese-made goods every day without a second thought.Overall, pretty fun single player game with some neat combat mechanics and decent skill/weapon systems.

For me, there's something incredibly appealing about navigating these games which feature a unique interpretation of our world, all while piecing together what lead to it's demise. Whether it's Half-Life, Horizon Zero Dawn, Prey, or We Happy Few...these games are nothing short of amazing, to me.So within two hours of playing this game, I have no doubt that I will enjoy it thoroughly. I'm still playing what is, effectively, the tutorial...and yet already I find it's style beautifully distinctive, and it's gameplay both engaging, and challenging. So far the story holds up enough for me to want to push my way through, but I'm looking forward to exploring the open-world setting. The characters are interesting, and the dialogue can be funny at times, but the main protagonist isn't exactly the best written. The crafting and levelling up systems are decent, with enough room for experimentation. By far, the graphics, level design and music are it's main selling points - it's all very captivating.I've encountered no bugs, and performance is very solid. The only downsides I've personally come across are a lack of an FOV slider, Photo mode, and the option to make changes to the HUD.If you're like me, and you enjoy these type of games, then I have no doubt that you will have just as much fun as I am. We -need- more wonderfully unique games like this.Oh, and the vending machine is a hyper-sexual, mentally unstable fridge that flirts with you."

After you got fat boy, game is technically over because the resources are abundant even at high difficulty and you just spam your way through every boss fight. Enemy type is limited. Bosses either shoot easy to dodge laser or try to melee which usually don't land because character is (can be) immune when dodging. Dungeon progression is tedious a repetition of finding a key or parts of key set to open the next gate, reminds me of darksider2. Obviously, a desperate attempt to elongate the game play. I did some test grounds and both endings, took only 22 hours. Not to mention I am definitely one of the slower player. With a re-imagined soviet society and such a superb artistic style, I do expect a bit more expression from this open world. Yet the map is largely empty, exploring = gathering resources you won't be able to spend. No side quest even. Most dialogue happens between Sergey and Charles, shows no character development, only to fill the player in with some background. You missed 2 boss fight for the good ending."

1669,Templer1333,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198201582389/,2,,0,21.0,March,5,52,0,1,"OVERALL THOUGHTS:Great ideas with a nice setting ruined by a rushed and completely random story coupled with a shallow and illogical cast.PRE-GAME:I was quite excited when I first saw this game due to its unique setting, pretty world and seemingly complex gameplay. The fact that the late monetization and trailers featured some hot robot ladies also got a lot more people interested, I'm sure.FIRST IMPRESSION:Starting into the game, you get a first glance at the world and its setting, being introduced to the post-war soviet world and the advance of science. A really pleasant and intriguing introduction. This positive feeling lasts for a while longer while the events of the robot massacres unfold, and you are forced underground to escape.OPEN WORLD:Entering the “open world” is when things first get a little annoying. The open world really just feels like a spaced out, liner path with a few building left and right. It basically just follows one main road that you are forced to go down to complete the story, with the testing grounds and enemies scattered at the side of it for some additional action and resources.TESTING GROUNDS:Speaking of the testing grounds, they leave a lot to be desired. They are put into the game to give you something to do besides follow the story, since the open world has nothing to offer for exploration besides them. They hold upgrades for your weapons, for which you will need to complete different types of puzzles coupled with a few enemies along the way. By few, I mean 3 different puzzle-types that just have a different layout each time. They get repetitive and annoying rather quick, but if you want the upgrades, you will have to suffer through them.GAMEPLAY:However, I was still able to put all this aside because I genuinely enjoyed the gameplay itself. The weapons do feel fun, your abilities are strong but not too powerful, unless you used telekinesis like me and killed 10 enemies just by holding one button. But even here, I wish the game had more diversity. I can accept the amount of different enemies, even if I wish there were more, but the amount of guns was lackluster. Especially since you unlock all the weapons within the first 3 hours. Boss fights also felt underwhelming, since you can either view them as bullet sponges or just kill them within 30 seconds using the rocket launcher (don't blame me, It's just too good). Some bosses will also be reused throughout the game. The cameras and repair bots make staying in areas, “exploration” or longer fights also extremely unfun. Yet even though I named all these negative aspects, I for some reason still found myself enjoying shooting the same enemies and using the same two skills throughout the whole game, but for others it might be more crucial.CHARACTERS:Reading through other reviews, I can see that most of the community agrees that the protagonist is annoying and dumb and really just makes you want to skip his dialogue. While the player itself gets a pretty clear view over the situation and story quite early into the game, the protagonist ignores all of it and rather throws childish neglect and weird phrases all over the place. Unfortunately, all other characters that hold any value for the story suffer the same fate. While not as childish as the protagonist, they are extremely shallow and only seem to be placed in the game to serve the story, resulting in a loss of interest in them and no character development in most of them, with a few exceptions. But even those characters that undergo some development again only do so, to fuel the story and try to make the endings at least somewhat “acceptable” or logical. Their change comes unnatural and forced, with no real  sign of commitment in their beliefs.STORY:As I already mentioned, the story isn't exactly hard to figure out, so you will quickly have a good understanding of what direction the story will take. And while I did have moments during my playthrough in which I questioned the logic or connections of things, I just brushed it off and happily accepted it. Towards the end of the game however, I slowly lost hope in the story that had been build up so far, with my fear being confirmed once I beat the game and looked at both endings. The story, while not perfect and quite predictable, can only be described as rushed or changed last second. The scene that gave me this feeling is the one in which you throw away the box with the two rings, a valuable, important and quite useful item you obtain during the story. In order to understand my thoughts now, it is helpful to have completed the game or seen the endings. Up until the point the protagonist decided to throw away the rings, I believed that they were a key part of stopping the evil plans and getting to actually interact with the oh so popular and much advertised twins. After all, two rings for two robots. Charles even tells the protagonist that these two ring are to be put on robots to make them specifically obey their master. And two very powerful assassin robots in the shape of a human women have just the right figure to wear them, too. So to me, it seems quite obvious that the original idea was for the player to fit the rings on the twin's hands and have them join you. Not only would this make for some fun combat and actually give them a proper function in the story, but it would also appease the player, because who wouldn't like the overly sexual robots as their own bodyguards?But by throwing away the rings, simply because Charles tells the protagonist to do so, this path is completely discarded. Instead, the game seemingly forces a new solution and explanation for them and the path you will continue on. The reveal that you had your mind wiped after being attacked by terrorists and lost your wife in the process is completely out of the blue and feels fully forced. This is the game's way of adding “mystery” and “confusion” to the story, while also explaining why the two twins exist. Not because the studio needed a way to monetize their game, but because your dead wife was also a special operator and ballet dancer, who's skills were programmed into these two robots after she died.....Furthermore, Charles's betrayal seems like another weird and unexplainable twist in character, as it is unfortunately common in this game.To me, it just felt like the original ideas and story were cut during the mentioned moment in which the protagonist throws away the rings. Instead, the game continues with an illogical and rushed story, resulting in two very disappointing endings.CONCLUSION:The gameplay was enjoyable on the surface but once you dive a little deeper and really reflect on it, you will be able to find more negatives than positives, hidden by some nice graphics and a mix of popular tropes and ideas from games like Far cry, Bio Shock ect. The game is not bad, but it is heavily let down by its seemingly change in story towards the end, abandoning all reasoning and established lore. The english voice acting and cutscene also do not add, resulting in cut off dialogue and wonky animations. If you can overlook this however and just need an, unfortunately, simple game with some fun gameplay and good graphics, this game will give you just that. If you care about decent world building and good story however, you will find yourself left with a feeling of emptiness, since you won't find it here."

Full review when i beat it but man, this game is good so far.Edit: So i beat the game and i have a few thoughts on the game.. First and foremost, it IS good. From a decent story, fun dialogue that doesnt take itself too seriously coupled with a top notch world, decent combat and a whole lotta fun, this game laid out a good foundation for itself and its future expansions. While I do believe the game was a bit short, it makes up for it in other places. Amazing animations for almost everything the player does, a nice touch. Fun high action boss fights. Good hefty weapons that will leave a few dents in all the metal you'll be hitting. Good Map design. Good difficulty scaling. Good power scaling for the player. Good just all around and thats basically the final verdict. Its just a good game, not perfect, but good. That 89% rating hits the game right on the nose, easy 8.9/10. Im sure with the 4 planned expansions, this game will reach the love that bioshock gets for its franchise and will become a 9/10 or maybe greater, only time will tell.Also, day 1 with no Nvidia driver and its running INSANELY well? An optimized game in 2023? Unheard of. Ive never felt 300 raw fps until this game and man, i was impressed. (300 fps was hit in testing ground #1 indoors) ((still insane)) (((on RTX 2070S)))The only complaint I truly have is that all the dead soldiers in the game use the same NPC model, its really annoying to see lmao.

Atomic Hearts is such a pleasant surprise. Endlessly creative, constantly delightful with its music, storyline, combat and visuals. Refreshingly well polished too so that's nice.The main character is my biggest gripe as his lines often remind me of a constantly complaining teenage boy. They tried to go for a playful and somewhat meta approach to writing him - making fun of video game tropes/saying what the player is thinking - but it ends up coming off pretty one-note and often obnoxious.This is my only major criticism of the game. I don't remember the last time I felt like I need to make a review and voice my opinion on a game. This is a masterpiece through and through."

Is it as fun as bioshock? I would have to say no! Is the world as immersive as rapture? no again. But all politics aside this is very welcome after such a long dry period of video games.

1708,Marco!,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ye_Poopsock/,17,2,0,16.2,February,25,451,0,1,"Atomically bland.I've followed this game for nearly half a decade and it is unfortunate that the aesthetics is the highlight of the game. There's a lot of small and big influences on it: Bioshock: Infinite, Singularity, Mirror's Edge, Half Life, and Doom 2016. But none of it is particularly competent or remotely adequate outside of the art direction. I think the primary driver of influence is Bioshock: Infinite (aesthetically) and the Doom reboot (mechanically) series. That being said, this is worst Doom clone I've played. Where as Doom tended to be fast and exhilarating. This game is muddled and slow. You have a similar design philosophy as Doom, most enemies have projectile attacks or easily readable attacks that you need to dodge or sidestep, you have a dash mechanic, and Mick Gordon even did some of the soundtrack. But your movement is muddled any you sidestep or backstep with a movement penalty that cuts your speed in half. You also suffer a lot of knockdowns with certain attacks, which can lead to enemies stunlocking you into corners. The movement is pretty subpar in general. I noticed you can get stuck in certain spots like walls or slopes. Which is incredibly annoying in a game that prioritizes MOVEMENT over AIMING. Ammo is barely given to you when this game swarms you with them with additional mechanics to spawn MORE of them or EVEN REBUILD THE ONES YOU JUST DESTROYED. You have to craft ammo mostly to get it, you better believe the crafting system is absolute hogshit like every other video game. Basically after every major fight, you have to dig into a menu in a vending machine to generate ammo in a ""fast paced"" action game no less, because bringing the game to a screeching halt every 5 - 10 minutes isn't insufferable enough. Especially when the game drags as is. The damage output for most of your weapons is excessively low for whatever reason too (even weapons are maxed out). But there are some weapons that are absolutely busted in terms of damage output and you have unlimited energy for those weapons.To be fair, when the game progresses a bit more. You get plenty of ammo from crafting and the bosses can be okay (except for Plyush, ♥♥♥♥ this dude). But the horde fights are probably worse than most horde shooters I've played. It's meandering and lacking in tension. The game plays out like this in the open world: You just run past everything since there's zero reason to fight enemies and the combat does not feel rewarding in the slightest. There's places to rummage through. I guess the game is more immersive with an open world. But it's just stock crap you've seen in 90% of them. It's rather mediocre looking in comparison with the much more focused linear areas, which look great.The linear dungeon crawling segments I just used the zappy gun's alternative fire to cause a huge AOE blast the decimates everything around you while spamming dash as much as possible or abuse rockets. There's a cooldown on items that prevents you from abusing it too much but it almost never comes off as an issue in the dungeon crawls. The combat in general seems to be abusing powers that freeze, stun, and lock opponents into place, getting them stuck on geometry (they often get stuck on doorways or cramped areas), or using AOE weapons. The game turns into this run around in circles like a robot herder while fart AOE blasts then finish decimating your opponents by stunlocking them. Rinse repeat.The only thing it has over Doom 2016/Eternal is the levels feel like places over ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arenas. But it's such a downgrade in movement, weapons, combat, and enemy design that makes it mechanically the worst Doom clone I've played yet.I think all these game played better than this. Some of them aren't even finished games for fug's sake.CulticMetal: HellsingerTurbo OverkillUltra KillShadow Warrior 3I even realize Doom 2016 isn't even relatively new mechanically (it did popularize a lot of things). But I think this game is worse than Painkiller in just how it flows and plays.The game's plot and story blows too. There's a lot of interesting things about it you can see from the visuals. Polymer, the floating goo with sea life in it. Being able to talk to corpses past their expiration date. The theme park-esque robots covered with retro futurist motifs. None of these concepts are explored in an interesting manner like Bioshock. In fact, the writing feels like an esoteric joke. From the awful dialogue (who literally thinks ""Crispy critters!"" being repeated as an expletive is cool?), to the flat characters, especially the dumb protagonist, and meandering plot that seems to drag as your protagonist does banal BS like collect robot parts or something while all the cool concepts like the former mentioned just kind of serve as background dressing.Just a whole lot of wasted potential."

The 28 minute intro, was a drag for starters. Then the FOV...60 FOV to start has me sick, literally sick, I have to take an hour break after only playing for 2. The FOV not only makes the combat annoying, the combat itself, is annoying. The game does not support PS controllers, only Xbox controllers, I was forced to play M&K which is fine, but, combined with the janky combat and 60 FOV, it's just not fun. The story is a snoozefest, i'm 4 hours deep and don't even know what I'm trying to achieve? The truth? All I know is i'm solving puzzles for 2 hours trying to get 4 canisters to revive a tree. That.

Enemies detect you when crouched and behind walls, Pchelas are the most frustrating enemy of the game because the game has no limit to how many it'll spawn in 1 area and they function like the Watchers from Halo 4, constantly and endlessly reviving enemies to wittle down whatever supplies you may have. Melee is not enjoyable at all, the most basic of components are the hardest to find and the abilities I often forgot I even had them as they weren't significant to me at all. To think this game got delayed HOW MANY years and this is what we get? On top of that I've had multiple friends tell me there's just some random sex scene where you ♥♥♥♥ an android.

There are cool moments, and combat is mostly fun. NOT fun when you are caught by a camera every 10 meters, and now you have to do it all over again. The part where enemies reincarnate in front of you in real time is annoying as hell. Repetitive annoyance at best.Edit: Finished the game. Story only picks up after half way through.

Sadly I can't say it was worth the wait. The level design is really forgettable, with no real reason to explore. The story are a mixture of both confusing and forgettable. These could maybe be forgiven if the combat was good enough to balance it out, but it is riddled with completely unbalanced difficulty spikes, and constant instances of getting stuck in terrain as a group of melee enemies beat you to death. Not to mention most of the enemies are much faster than you, making managing them in first person a guessing game of where they went with each blink. It also doesn't help that the UI is painfully unhelpful in both gameplay and menus.I was really hoping this would be the next Bioshock, but am left very disappointed.

1739,Neohampster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/neohampster/,10,1,0,12.2,February,24,473,0,1,"This game is incredibly frustrating which is honestly the worst part. It's so close to being fantastic. The world is very interesting, the gunplay is fine, melee is also fine. Story is also quite interesting so far. All that said I have two huge complaints. The first is one I heard often, the main character sounds like a parody of a teenager who was just handed a book of swears and told to go nuts. It's pretty trying, I am less bothered by that kind of thing then most though, it really didn't start bothering me until around 10 hours in. That said it did eventually bother me. My other major complaint is the fighting itself. Whoever thought it was a fun and rewarding system to swarm the player with knee high robots in bushes that randomly jerk jump around is not my friend. Whoever decided it would be a good idea to allow lunchbox sized flying things that don't attack you to wander around the battlefield near infinitely and just resurrect every robot to full health over and over again is my worst ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemy. That system is why im writing this.Nothing bothers me more then moving around in a fight, killing the two long range enemies that were pummeling me with explosives, to then turn and start fighting the other enemies just to have two flying idiots wander over and resurrect the two enemies I just killed. You kill half the encounter, get half done with the other half then have to go back and kill the first half again. Though you can only do that AFTER to get hit a few times and lose track of every enemy to look up at the sky to shoot down the idiots bringing back everything you just killed.It is profoundly unfun and the reason I am putting this game down. The combat is fun, if those flying things couldn't resurrect enemies it would be challenging and rewarding to get through the fights. To see half your work get removed when the robo-emus you just killed dash back over the hill because you missed a lunchbox (or, god forbid, theres an invincible spawner of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things nearby) is just demoralizing.I don't want to play this game when it seems like the devs are actively encouraging me to dash from one point to another and only fight when they literally lock me in a room."

I found many puzzles refreshingly tricky at times, and mechanics like the floating polymer globs quite exciting. Where Atomic Heart fell short for me were its very awkward writing choices and dialogue, and a mediocre handling of exploration and progression. Scanning my environment is not fun and slows everything down. Sucking up loot is slow and very fiddly. The abilities and weapons are very cut-and-dry shooter stuff; scopes, extended magazines, ice powers, shock powers...and I found myself neglecting their usefulness because I simply didn't need them, even on the hardest difficulty. Finally, the dialogue. I did not enjoy being the protagonist. Their personality and speech felt juvenile. The conversations between Charles and you (and the horny vending machine) carry on for long bouts, often repeating plot information immediately after receiving it. It was funny, and then eventually stopped being fun, and started really getting in the way of my ability to enjoy the otherwise fantastic tone and atmosphere of Facility 3826.Atomic Heart is a stunning visual feast, marred by some frustrating hurdles. I enjoyed it, but it was a bit exhausting. Wait for a sale."

Aside from all the robot ballerina memes the game stands on its own. The world building is amazing and the detail is fine tuned, with the historical setting, the Kolective, and how the story actually cleverly handles Soviet Era politics and struggles with an added sci-fi backdrop. The game play is exemplary, having you start from scraping by with an axe to a full arsenal of guns, energy weapons, and powers that are essentially plasmids from Bioshock, but they do enough original and unique things to where they really stand out. It is really, REALLY fun to fight the robots in this game. My only major complaint is Major P3's dialogue. Its not Duke Nukem Forever or Forspoken level bad, but he needs to know when to stop, and I can definitely see why a lot of the game play trailers had no dialogue. Overall so far, excellent"

The Marketing gave me too much expectations and I was let down by it though. but thats partly my fault for expecting too much.Note: Played through Hardest Available Mode: Armageddon, Got all the Upgrades and Finished the Story.  let me list down the pros and cons. I tend to list more on Cons but dont let that deter you from trying this game out. I usually just put them there to vent and hopefully get the Devs to acknowledge the flaws of the game:PROS+ Ending was Bold enough. No Good Ending. I respect that.+ Game is really optimized for an open world game. considering I have like an old entry level gamer laptop.+ Gameplay is Fun until you get all the upgrades though. but still fun+ The Looting Mechanic is Fun. getting to loot many things by holding down the button really helps+ The Ability to store items to the Fridge on the Go+ The Fridge+ The Twins. The Devs and Artists know what they're doing+ The Setting and the Premise have so much potential. They can do with alot of this in the future since ending seems to hint a sequel. It can make for a good Solid Survival Horror instead. they should bank on that genre in the future+ Pausing the game does not interrupt or cover up the subtitles. wish they could implement like a dialogue history like lost judgement did but still helps for me who really likes to take time to read subs.+ Dialogue choices are exactly what the character will say. not a summary of what the character might say unlike Fallout 4. CONS- Character interaction with his Glove reminds me of Forspoken. Its Irritating and Exhausting. Id rather have the main character be Silent.- The Open World didnt have much to offer other than Resources for Upgrades. - No Side Quests or even other NPCs. Everyones Dead. feels the world of Vermintide.- Enemy Variety was honestly lacking. - Game is actually pretty easy. Especially when you get your weapons upgraded. Weapons like Snowball and its Leech Mechanic are too OP. Telekinesis is also OP. - Music Although by MIck Gordon, was little less than noticeable.  Also the way they repeat it all over the radios in the open world got me annoyed- No Replayability- Upgrades are too linear. No Build Diversity by Limiting your upgrades. you can upgrade your character to the max pretty early on. I hate when games do this. it hurts the replayability significantly- No FOV option on Launch- Even on hard Mode, resources are too plentiful, and enemies are still easily exploitable.- Cutscenes and Voice Acting are pretty sub par. the way the camera's are shot goes way too fast. watching cutscenes feels rushed. this is even for Russian Dub- Subtitles are too small and they go by way too fast. Sometimes they would start talking before subtitles come up, Sometimes they dont even appear especially in Epilogue scene."

After disappointment and confusion.After all of these things I can safely say this game is not worth it. Not $90 dollars, not $60 dollars, not even $30 dollars.The story is boring, scant, and confusing. Characters are introduced poorly and killed off quickly. Back story and explanation on people is scarce and when the big reveals start happening you already know. Partially because of the most obvious telegraphing ever and partially because you are not stupid and can see it coming. The ending I got was terrible and without spoiling anything it was terrible because it made no sense and ended suddenly.The environment is pretty enough but lacking any real depth, it quickly becomes old and irritating. The over-world in particular felt empty except for sparse pockets of robots that would quickly overwhelm you. Most boss fights are terrible with exception of Left, not Right and Left, just Left. The former was fun enough and the latter just immediately recycled itself into pure boredom. Usually a boss can only be beat with melee weapons as the guns do precious little damage until the late stages of the game. Maybe you were supposed to really want those upgrades but without them you are well and truly fu.c.k.e.d. Especially when they randomly put you in a room with 3! plyush. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. THAT! One was bad enough.The gun play and movement is stiff and clunky without any real sense of snap that is cruscial to shooters and to be clear this game is barely a shooter.All too often you end up having to stand still and listen to Charles exposit his endless wisdom because if you walk ahead too far the game just auto skips the background dialogue. Dialogue which can't be heard half the time because the voice audio either cuts off abruptly or is drown out by the overwhelmingly bad audio balancing and NO adjusting the music volume will not fix it entirely as some scenes have baked in music louder than the second coming of Christ, almighty, himself.Writing is poor and character motivations are not always plain as the main character flip-flops back and forth on being stupid, being smart, being pro communism, and two seconds later being pro anarchy.When I think back I feel it is just forgettable and disappointing and little is worse in media than being forgettable. Atomic Heart, you weren't even bad enough to be remembered. Sub-par in every way.It runs well on Steam Deck at least.I rate it 4 Crispy Critters out a possible 10 Robot Mommy Domies."
1778,Keetru,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112344553/,2,,0,17.2,March,28,360,0,1,"[SPOILERS FOR END]-(*Played on normal*): Srry it's a bit ranty but should get across the issues.TLDR:  twists that disrespect you, two shotting enemies, enemy spam/infinite enemies, randomized upgrade looting, and awful VA.The game is way to hard. Its not difficult hard, just unfair hard. First upgrades for weapons, upgrade/item/weapon blueprints are all randomized. if you want a certain muzzle/sight/ stock or consumable go to 3-5 areas that that specific upgrade can be in and hope. I spent the entire game picking up upgrades for weapons I couldn't get till later in the story, and the few times I did get stuff I could make/get it was all electro capsules. So getting a blueprint is random and you can get ones you already have and numerously with nopayback/refund for the already known blueprint (in total in 16 hrs I have picked up 13 electro capsule BPs ). Another issue is way to fast attacks on certain creatures that can't be dodged quick enough and extreme enemy spam, and in the open world segment a awful infinite spawning enemy system. By the time you kill a second enemy a drone will have already have repaired the first one. At least on normal mode most enemies nearly two shots you, forcing you to put points into defensive upgrades first and foremost. Unless played at the easiest difficulty the game is not enjoyable most the time. The few times where the game was fine was the few scenarios where they did not enemy spam a corridor, room, or long puzzle/dialogue that forces you to go through the entire thing again since auto saves seem to be event based and few and far between. If you happen to trigger dialogue that requires interaction and interrupts gameplay, good luck if there are enemies nearby as you have to wait ~2 seconds for a dialogue interaction to cut off to bring up weapons/abilities (ignoring this issue this also [at the time] seemed to be the games biggest crash causer). Ignoring the gameplay what is left is the dialogue and associated story, we all know the acting is awful, there are few VAs that are good, but P-3 the protagonist the one your stuck listening to 100% of the game is unbearable. Then there is the story, its not the best but its not terrible. What is truly terrible is the complete lack of choice, interaction, and twists (one of them mainly) of the story. All choices ...just lore essentially, all interaction ... doesn't matter until the end. The twists however, most of them are good for the story, adding lore, developing the plot, making the P-3's mental dilemma worse and making you question what you should do (Doesn't matter as there is no choice). But yet again it ruins it right at the end. First led by a false choice of fake end vs true end being the only choice in the game, followed by beating the bosses by a twist villain char-les/charleston the game is already over but they show you everything you thought was wrong (being led on), everything you thought you could do was wrong (no choice anyway), and worst of all all of this with no forewarning, you start to question your char-les 5-10 min before the game ends. That's it, all of that development, all that story, just to toss it with a random insert twist villain, which the game is over you can't do anything now. They drop hints the char-les is something more, or makes you question your reality in things around you, but what are you supposed to question when nothing makes sense yet it all is supposed to the time it needs to be."

It tries to do a lot, but ends up stumbling in some cases.I helped fund this game back in 2020 and I'm glad I did. The game ended up being different from what I expected, but in a good way. I love games like this, so naturally I'm gonna be extra critical.The movement system in this game is great for combat, but isn't very fun in the parkour sections. The parkour also feels kinda out of place. The puzzles are fun and the story is engaging. English VA didn't really fit P3 IMO, russian VA did an amazing job. The characters are all well written and distinct. The story had some fun layers to it but wasn't too confusing. The art and music for this game is top notch. The linear missions had great level design and set pieces.The ""overworld"" needs work, too many enemies in the endgame areas made it frustrating to get around, I ended up just running passed everything. I don't like the reused bosses. Towards the end of the game it just felt like they were throwing more and more tanky enemies at you. I wish they had more variety with enemy types at the end. The enemies respawn super quickly, which isn't the worst thing but I think it interferes with the pacing and ambiance of some missions.If you are a bioshock/hl/farcry/metro fan it might be worth the full price, if those games are hit or miss for you i'd wait for a sale."

The music is wonderful, the art style is interesting and coherent, the combat is well rounded, but it doesn't really do anything interesting. If you've played bioshock infinite, you've seen nearly all this game has to offer, mechanically. The world lore is fascinating but I've never been one for lore. The combat is fast paced, but sort of repetitive. Find your favorite short ranged and long ranged option and use those for everything, slotting canisters where nessicary to apply specific damage types. Well rounded, competent, fairly boring and repetitive though, enemies don't use cover, almost none of them have ranged weapons, and so you just gotta backpedal and blast for the most part. That's the reason why big-ball McGee is such a hard boss, because it's so much faster than the player that the established combat routines are no longer a viable strategy. but once you figure out how to beat him it's back to the old grind.The puzzles are varied, nonsensical and tedious. The character lampshades this multiple times. Lots of times. Hell, he's constantly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the puzzles. Which makes sense, because they're stupid and nonsensical, and tedious. They're also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ everywhere. Every door is locked by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ timing puzzles or something. Guys, lampshading is fun and all, but it doesn't actually fix the issue.Cannot recommend this game for $60 unless you have not played any bioshock game before. If you have not played bioshock, this should be a great game for you. If you have, wait til it goes on sale for... say... $20. TLDR: Game drags on, has stupid puzzles, and has no soul.

Good (4/5)Vizuals: Realy good (5/5)Fight mechanics: Meh (3/5)Map design: Bad (2/5)Buggs: Meh (3/5)Other game mechanics: Meh (3/5)The story and the concepts are good, It has some surprises and a good concept all in all. There is a good amount and variety of puzzles.The boss fights usually don't really mean anything or add to the story , they are just there to make your life a bit harder and then give you some materials, also Plyushes might be harder to kill than actual bosses + they have more ""skills""/attack types, I think, or just live long enough to use all of their moves. The combat is not terrible in itself but the lack of explaining things or explaining things after you used them, or popping a window in the middle of a fight to explain something you already used for some time, now that is annoying. (Make up your mind, you either explain everything or just shut up and don't say a damn a thing). Enemies glitch in before their arrival animation, in the early stages. in rooms with flipped or thin objects in it you will definitely get stuck in some manner  while jumping or dashing, wich you probably will in a fight. The map is just bad, the game don't relay have any side missions just places you can go for some extra gun attachments that you don't really need, So it just skips over them and tells you that you need to hurry and do the main story, wich is realy the strongest point this game can show. (Oh and the DLC-s are a joke I hope everyone knows that.)All is all: I would buy, and recommend this game if it was for about 40 Euro with a decent DLC, but it is just a massive letdown with a lot of potential, a AAA priced cash grab, it might have been a better game if it was an open world, with a decent way to travell."

Ffs my Steam Deck can run this thing at 60fps on high settings... that is insane. Optimized much like the Wolfenstein reboot games. The melee is a bit sluggish for my taste at first - very Dying Light 2-handed weapon speed - but looks like it improves as the game goes on [EDIT: It totally does, you can get faster 1 handed weapons just like dying light]. Gunplay feels solid. Enemies are difficult and aggressive. One of the few games I am bothering to read every little computer log and inscription I come across. Truly a work of passion and vision. As grim as it is eccentric. Amazing sound design. I literally just sat in the safe room for like 30 min last night listening to that eerily soothing atmospheric track that plays. Very RE-esque.

Игра очень сильно навязывает ближний бой, при этом враги обучены всем разновидностям боевых искуств, имеют реакцию мангуста и удар с разворота Чака Норриса. Додж приходится прожимать так часто, что это больше похоже на какой-то souls-like, чем шутер- Нехватка патронов, нехватка ресурсов на крафт патронов, нехватка места в инветаре для патронов и аптек- Главный герой с IQ горбушки от хлеба и шутками уровня Аншлага или журнала Каламбур- Абсолютно отвратительно прописанные персонажи и диалоги. Диалоги для шлюхо-холодильника (да, там есть такой персонаж), кажется, одной рукой писал перевозбужденный 16-летний школьник, озабоченность которого вышла из под контроля на пике полового созревания- Не интересные скиллы, некоторые с неоправданно долгим кулдауном- Медленный прогресс сюжетки и смены локаций. Каждая локация перегружена посредственными головоломками: в этой комнате найди 3 ключа, в следующей поверни 6 вентилей, в следующей принеси 4 колбы из разных частей карты, в каждой из которых свои мини-загадки. Отлично, вы только что потратили полтора часа чтобы выйти из грёбаной лаборатории! Дальше – больше!- Изобилие таких абсолютнейших ""шедевров"" геймдизайна как: бесконечно спавнящиеся волны противников, пока ты не решишь очередную мега головоломку или не убьешь босса; мелкие мухообразные летающие противники (это же так весело и совсем не назойливо! Ах, кстати, у вас опять кончились патроны, так что идите рубите их топором); босс-файты в комнате площадью 15 квадратных метров, в которой полно тех самых насекомых которые налетают со всех сторон, при этом у персонажа нет спринта чтобы отбежать на безопасное расстояние, а ещё они поджигают! Фан! Быстрые сохранения? Это прошлый век! Теперь сохраняться можно только в специально отведённых для этого комнатах- Не возможно и метра пройти, чтобы не попасть под стационарную или ЛЕТАЮЩУЮ бл*ть камеру, которая либо алертит всех ближайших врагов, либо спавнить новых их воздуха. А если отстрелить эту камеру, то прилетит дрон, который её починит.Почти каждая механика в этой игре жутко давит на нервы и выбешивает, от диалогов кровоточат уши, зато секси роботы близняшки конечно моё уважение"
1838,Salvage,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Saalvage/,4,,1,21.0,February,24,981,2,1,"An absolutely fantastic game that lives from its worldbuilding and design but sadly suffers a few deficits that drag it down a bit.But first the good parts: The design of the world and especially the various robots is hands down the best thing about this game. They are incredibly creative, often quite scary-looking and just all around great to fight and admire. Same goes for the retro-futuristic soviet-style rest of the world, such a great concept to explore and the execution is excellent.The gunplay and melee combat feel great and rewarding. There's a decent range of weapons, although some could definitely use a buff. I'm especially a fan of the upgrade system in which you can return any upgrade and get a full refund, allowing you to experiment to your heart's content on the best way to rid yourself of the various fiends around you.The story is good, unexpected twists, generally cohesive although the exact details are a bit complicated at times.The soundtrack absolutely slaps as well, featuring a wide variety of music, including old soviet songs as well as sovietwave to create an authentic atmosphere. Accordingly, the boss battle tracks really manage to get your adrenaline pumping.And now the bad parts..: While the enemy designs are amazing, after a while they do become rather repetitive due to a relatively low amount of regular enemy types, especially if you consider that for about half the time you're simply fighting humanoid robots and humanoid zombies, pretty much the last thing you'd want in a game that bases itself on fighting crazy-cool robots.I understand the marketing aspect, but the oversexualization, which is evidently largely an afterthought, is kind of unnecessary and distracts from the game's core strengths. I really don't dislike it per se, but I find it a bit sad that most discourse surrounding the game is just the twins which take up less than one percent of the screentime.The writing and voice acting at least for English is less than ideal, I've heard it's much better in Russian (which is evidently the main language the game was made for), but since I sadly can't speak Russian I cannot judge this. But in English the dialogue is more often than not uninspired, unfunny and even cringeworthy.Writing this 2 days after release, the game is a bit unpolished. Sadly, contemporary games are so much worse in this regard that this game is being praised solely for being not as bad. But I still think a game should not release in a state like this. I would've preferred waiting another month or two if it meant the various issues could be ironed out. Steam achievements don't track your progress across game starts, dialogue is often cut off, reloading twice allows you to fit in another bullet, stealth and parkour mechanics are there but pretty primitive and a lot of minor graphical stuff that is not worth truly listing in detail. None of this is really gamebreaking (although I've heard of people being softlocked) but it just degrades the overall experience ever so slightly.There are also a few design decisions I don't fully understand and that I could happily live without such as the annoying repair bots that just constantly spawn and try to rebuild their already slain brethren and if you don't catch them in time you get the awesome opportunity to fight the same enemy again but without the rewards this time! I can imagine a few different intentions behind this, but I think the core consequence is that it simply punishes you for exploring and sticking around for a while, which is real shame.The dialogue system feels cheap, you don't really have the opportunity to truly lead a conversation anywhere, just pick between a few additional questions to ask or the option that makes the game continue. Nothing ever has consequences or branching paths. (Spoilers ahead) One thing that I would also like to mention because it pains my heart:It's sad to see that the game is being smeared so much just because the team behind it is largely from Russia. The fact that even the Ukrainian government is joining in is pretty pathetic. No matter your stance on the war in Ukraine, trying to boycott a game just because the development team is Russian and the game is receiving funding from other Russian companies (because it sure as hell wouldn't receive any from western publishers!) is just straight up stupid. The devs have expressed their opinion of the war to the extent that they can do without the fear of negative consequences. The people screaming that that is not enough would be the last people to potentially sacrifice their livelihood, company and much anticipated game to change literally nothing.If you are still of this opinion, please ask yourself:1. Have you been playing games featuring the US Army as the good guys recently and if so, have you been criticizing them for being propaganda and ignoring American atrocities?2. Have you been playing games made by American developers/publishers and if so, how do you justify that your purchase is directly contributing to the American military industrial complex due to the taxes these companies have to pay? You are directly financing America's unjust wars - present and future, are you not? This actually also applies to any games on Steam as its an American company, so if you truly are against war as much as you say you are, please do not buy games through Steam again, their tax dollars are fueling the American war machine!(Just to make this abundantly clear: The above questions are obviously hyperbole to expose clearly existing hypocrisy, purchasing a video game is not going to make any significant contribution to any nation's war effort. The war in Ukraine is horrible and should be stopped. Games featuring the US Army are actually quite often propaganda pieces that twist history to make America appear as the good guys, meanwhile Atomic Heart doesn't even present the Soviet Union (which is not Russia) super positively, clearly demonstrating its shortcomings with internal power struggles etc.)I think I need to reiterate, because the negatives are thrice as long as the positives: The game is amazing, I'm in love with its world and aesthetics, its music and story (ok and maybe the fridge as well). But there's simply not much to say about the aspects where the game does great. For the style and designs pictures say more than a thousand words. Meanwhile, pretty much all of the issues are minor in nature so require more explanation.All in all I am really excited to see what the DLC will have in store for us since I believe they can remedy pretty much all of the shortcomings and I've heard that even the idea of a sequel is already floating around! I hope we see many more games from Mundfish in the future!"

I didnt finish the campaign yet, but I can already sense that there was a moment where they run out of money and time, and had to compensate(there is a boss arena with a boss that would suggest a bossfith, but instead you play snake(yeah the 2d mobile game 20 years ago) and the boss just gives you the item you need)the combat is fun, the enemies have a lot of moves, and are pretty sturdy so you have to use all your tools even on normal to go forward, which you have a lot. once I figured out that melee hits restore charges for my weapons combat became way better, so just a heads up that this isnt your traditional shooty shoot, its a pew pew bang bang zip zip.The pacing of the game can feel weird, and there are some things that it never tells you, but you can discover, like you can actually disable for a long time all robots in an area, but you are never told this, you have to discover it.I think that compared to other releases this is a really good game, and a game, not a cutscene simulator, the setting, voice acting and writing for the dialogue is solid, but what shines for me is the combat and complex enemies, and the sweaty bossfigths."

1850,Vermillion,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980847018/,3,,0,5.6,March,15,620,0,1,"The game before the open world section was interesting and generally fun but once you get to the open world section the game dives off a cliff with terrible game play design.There is an alert system that sends robots after you if you are spotted too many times by the cameras so you think to yourself I will shoot the cameras but the issue is that there are legions of repair bots that go around and fix those cameras and you usually get 10 seconds before they show up and fully repair the camera.So you think to yourself ok just shoot the repairs bots. Those repair bots are infinite and never stop spawning and they usually come with a bot that has camera on it that will patrol and try and spot you.Then you say ok i'll stealth around and try and stealth kill the combat robots that are in the way of your exploration. Well the combat robots are very fast and you crouch walk very slowly and they also have a habit of turning around at the last second or just hitting you after you do the QTE kill.Then even if you kill the combat robots remember those repair bots?, yeah they come in repair the enemies you just killed infinitely. So you have game that then either forces you to speed run the open world sections and avoid everything or you constantly waste all your ammo and resources just going around and temporarily blowing up the robots before they all re spawn in under 30 seconds.But there is a way to turn them all off by turning off the robot hub and that's great because then you could take your time to explore, enjoy the background storytelling, maybe do some side quests and just do things at your own pace. Actually that hub shutdown lasts maybe 5 minutes at the most sometimes a little longer if you are lucky so you have speed run around still but now it is because you have a countdown until robots come back again.So that whole aspect just ruined the game for me and just made me drop it but if you can deal with that then maybe buy it on discount."

I felt like it really let itself down with the constant dialogue (much of which meant nothing) and it's general ""tell don't show"" way of presenting itself. I felt the game could have done with much more in the way of environmental story telling or leaving some things for the player to figure out or think about. However, the game eventually really grew on me and I started to appreciate it for what it is. The combat is very fun and the music is fantastic. The world and lore is really good and what I imagine most people are interesting by being that it's so unique. If you are like me and had a rough time getting through the first couple of hours and having a few problems with it, might be worth sticking it out a bit longer."

1867,flatlander,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989291948/,1,,1,14.4,February,26,103,0,1,"The Good:-Amazing soundtrack, a mix of old Russian classics and modern ones. Remixed classical numbers also show up.-Unique art style, earlier footage/art shows the art style being a complete acid trip however I guess the developers pulled back for mainstream appeal. -Crafting system and the ability to refund your skill points and break down guns is a great idea.The Bad:-Who knew a main character who's name is P3 could be so generic. Persona 3's dialogue can be summed up either by ""generic expletive"", ""What is that?"" or ""I am angry!"". This wouldn't be so bad if he didnt talk much but the dialogue is especially verbose and mind numbing. These maps are pretty large so there were times were I killed every single enemy and looted every single container and he was still talking for the giant exposition dump. Dunkey said it best, no one cares how fictional technology works just put it in a log file under a bed. -Needs more enemy types, I get these robot models are mass produced models lore wise but at least give me one thats painted orange and has a flamethrower or something. Since there are so few enemy types the game just throws a bunch at you if it wants an ""epic"" fight.-Story, when all the major plot beats are taken from Bioshock you don't get any points. Theres even a Frank Fontaine and Ryan archetype. Flawed, good but there was potential to be amazing. Early concept footage for this game seemed to be more focused on survival horror. It looked intense with a standard robot taking ~10 swings of your melee weapon to die. Somewhere in development it looks like a lot got the ""mainstream appeal"" treatment."

The combat is strange. You know how in dark souls the weakest enemies can kill you quite easily pretty much no matter where you are in the game if you mess up. It's like that in this game as well. You get the ability to kill them easier, but they can still do you in. At least on the hardest difficulty. If you're smart and you get the timing down, you're good. It is so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun. Obviously the similarity to Bioshock is present as well in the sense of a trippy story and right hand plasm-sorry, polymers, left hand gun or melee weapon. I like to think of the VA as an English dub over Russian. It makes the slightly odd VA just perfect. It's actually pretty anti-ussr and anti, how do I say this in a symbolic way, anti-war, both literal and societal, ya know. It's not the studios fault that Russia did what it's doing and it's certainly interesting how it's being portrayed that they have the privilege of not commenting on the war when in reality it's not a privilege. You have the privilege to say ""♥♥♥♥ what the Russian government and military is doing in Ukraine"" and not have your family slaughtered. Your children, your wife, husband, parents, you. They stealth commented and attempted to make their point of view known in the only way they could because they don't have the privilege we do. I wish them and their families the best of luck and finally... ♥♥♥♥ the Russian government for what they're doing in Ukraine. I'm gonna donate to Ukraine relief and I ask that you do too."
1876,The What?,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xcomhunter/,5,,0,8.4,February,23,243,0,1,"Against my high hopes and wishes, I am sad to say that this game just doesn't really feel like it's what it was advertised to be.You start to game walking around a glorious, flying city showing off the technology of the soviet power had they won the world war. The game looks amazing, fairly immersive and showing off what you were lured into from the trailers and get explained the lore over 20-30~ minutes of walking around, talking to a key character or two, and sitting in a car that's pulled around by a flying robot 'bumble-bee'. It felt a little drawn out, but the game takes a sharp turn and sh*t hits that fan. Robots have cone berserk and start killing people out of nowhere! You get dropped into a underground facility in which you spend maybe an hour and a half running around doing tedious, dreadful fetch missions while slowly expanding the basic mechanics of the game. Lots of spending a minute here or there to completely salvage all lootable containers in the rooms for much needed supplys to upgrade weapons, or killing enemies which drop certain supplies depending on the enemy type, and the most reliable way of getting Neuropolymer which is needed to upgrade your character and the skills you can use throughout.The initial fetch quest felt awful. Running section to section while listening to the main characters duke-nukem style dialogue gets stale quickly, is frequently complaining about the typical tropes of what most video games do such as having to do everything yourself, other character forces being useless, and even acknowledging that finding the canisters you need to leave the tutorial zone itself is annoying. Despite how much I disliked the area, I pushed through until I finally left the tutorial area and was able to enter the open world above. The open world isn't to bad, but the numerous enemies almost everywhere you go, the cameras that can spawn in, technically, never ending swarm of enemies unless you either destroy the camera and prevent it from being repaired while you clear the area, or leave the area and hope they despawn if you have to pass through it again, or is a mission objective.The enemies themselves are fairly interesting in design, but the combat can feel very clunky and awkward at times for the first few hours until you get yourself a weapon that's upgraded a fair bit. You can get stuck and caught up on enemies at times, they may launch themselves into weird terrain and seemingly lose any functionality besides standing in place, and the hit boxes for some enemy moves are weirdly larger then they would feel to be. That being said, most of those issues aren't to much of a concern once you spend a few hours progressing through the story and exploring a few hidden labs to unlock schematics for your weapons which drastically improve their performance.The overall story doesn't seem to be that bad given your characters occupation and what your mission is, the in game lore findables are fairly interesting and comedic at times, but the main characters dialogue is quickly annoying and atrocious. As  I said earlier, it's an american sounding russian guy pretending to be duke nukem. Every time you start hearing about the interesting bits of how some of the impressive technology works, he interupts with ""Hey, dumb it down. Don't bore me with the nerd talk"" type lines which happens a fair bit.Regardless of my personal opinion about the game and nit picky critiques I'll probably continue to play the game if I'm bored enough since I couldn't get a refund, but will say that I am sorely let down with how a large portion of the game was delivered, especially the writing."

But I was expecting more based on the trailers. You never get to explore the floating structures above. Plus the story feels rushed, transitions are jarring, and voice acting is rough at times. I wish I waited for a sale. Doesn't feel like its worth $60. I only got 25 hrs of play time out of it and that's with exploring and wandering around (with what limited wandering there is available). Maybe the DLC will add more depth to it but I'm not sure it'd be worth the extra money. Just have to wait and see"
1894,Victerro,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198194029685/,2,,0,20.7,March,16,118,0,1,"Atomic Heart is a game that many have watched closely for years since its first announcement, with its first-ever teaser dropped on their YouTube channel almost 6 years ago now. It grew a following over these years, with the game's stunning visuals, unique designs, and intriguing world. Through great effort as well as great controversies, has Atomic Heart delivered on what fans had expected?--ART DESIGN AND MECHANICS--Atomic Heart certainly carries out what it promised with a visually amazing world that fits well with the atompunk-1950s aesthetic. The developers certainly found a brilliant style and keep it consistent throughout the game in all aspects, making every asset in the game fit very well. The world feels grand and intricate, although the actual play area itself that you cover in-game is smaller than it seems. Stray far from the beaten path, and outside of shallow explorable areas for upgrades and materials and the occasional speaking dead body, the world is pretty empty. Back on a lighter note, Atomic Heart introduces the player to some of the wackiest and most unique enemies, as well as an equally interesting arsenal to take them on. The approaches that you take to combat can be as simple as shooting a robotic terror until it's decommissioned, or as complicated as mixing and matching different polymers, weapon types, abilities, and environmental hazards to take them down shock-and-awe style. The progression of the game also allows players to experiment with ease, testing out new abilities and upgrading weapons in completely different ways with little cost to your resources as it refunds most if not all materials when exchanging upgrades for another.I love the art design and mechanics in this game, and conceptually it is something I'd love to see more of. There are designs for enemies and weapons seen in development footage that I really wish we could have seen in the full release, but who knows if maybe we'd see it in the future.--STORY AND CHARACTERS--The story of Atomic Heart is a somewhat generic yet still pleasing one. At least in concept.Throughout my entire playthrough which I'd streamed, taking roughly 16-17 hours total, the story felt extremely fragmented and boring. Typically, I'm one to attempt reading and listening to all the different bits of lore in story games. In this case, however, many of these audio logs and journal entries did not relate to the main story, and if they did, it was delivered in a way that felt very flat and was only there to pad time for people who want the achievements for finding all the lore bits. Most of them were random characters who were likely there to help with world building, but ultimately detract from the world as a whole. I found myself skimming these lore bits at best, skipping them at worst. At many points, dialogue from the characters would overlap or even cut off the audio logs and vice versa. Whether it be an audio log or dialogue between our main characters, there was a good chance it could get cut off and you'd then be completely lost.The side characters ultimately are just that. They are cast off to the side, never feeling very interesting and instead just serving their purposes to the plot. After that, they aren't worthy of a second thought. Aside from the main characters and the twist villains, every other character can be forgotten about.The main plot that drives the character is not particularly unique and has very poor execution. Slight spoiler warning, but 90% of the game has the goals of the player obscured and left unclear as part of setting up not one, but two different plot twists that it rams into the final half hour of the game. Additionally, the payoff for either of the endings left me very unsatisfied, leaving the last couple dozen hours of gameplay feeling like a waste. The game, in my opinion, would have been infinitely better had the main character been mute and most of the interaction instead coming from the side character that we spend the entire game with. The reality of the game, however, is that we are stuck with a poorly written antihero that makes it very difficult for the player to become invested in their story. The story would have also likely benefited from having more focused and clearly defined goals, instead of going from one government facility to another chasing one McGuffin after another for reasons that only the higher powers get to know about.--OVERALL THOUGHTS--It really pains me that my overall experience with the game came out as negative, because Atomic Heart was a game that I really wanted to enjoy. I was one of the many people hooked by the intriguing concepts and designs teased over the years by Mundfish, and I wanted to see a story that would be as compelling as its style. Unfortunately, I'm not someone who can enjoy a story-driven singleplayer game just for its style and mechanics. Moreover, I can't ignore a story that I previously wanted to enjoy but just ended up infuriating me throughout, especially at the end. When it delivered two consecutive twist villains that did not feel earned in the final thirty minutes of the game, I'd finally decided that this was not a game I enjoyed."
1895,Nano,https://steamcommunity.com/id/voidyoshi/,1,,1,98.3,March,10,240,0,1,"A refreshing alternative world.Pros:- Absolutely beautiful game design.- Realistic graphics. True to the design and style of the 1950's.- A wealth of lore fills the world of Atomic Heart. Many things to read and listen to.- A complex political storyline which hints at much larger story elements at play.- Straightforward, challenging gameplay. Progress at your own pace and difficulty.- An extremely large open-world area with ""dungeons"" that you are free to explore at any time.- A rewarding crafting system.Cons:- A lot of things are introduced very quickly with little time to understand it.- Very easy to lose track of your current objective. You can ""over-explore"" and become lost.- Essential game mechanics can break if you abuse them.- The player can become stuck in geometry, forcing the player to reload their last saved game.- The game can lock progress if certain events do not trigger properly.- Very short and abrupt final arc.- Few crafting items.Overall:- Graphics: 5/5- Gameplay: 3/5- Storytelling: 4/5Notes:- Despite its flaws and unpolished artifacts, the game offers a lot in terms of introducing a brand-new world and story in an alternate world where the USSR and United States of America have a very different kind of Cold War.- If you enjoy complex, psychological stories and lore with challenging gameplay, this is a great game to own. Make sure to read everything and loot whatever you can.- Completing difficult parts of the game will reward you with story progression. Worth.Final Rating: 4/5 - Would play again. If not only for the Twins."

I grew particularly fond of the Pashtet+ Puzzles+ I've seen a couple of cheeky references to Bioshock.

The world is well-constructed and interesting. It runs really well. I'll probably play more of it until I finish it. But I have to pace myself because its just so. Damn. Tedious.Everything in this game is a chore. Hold F on every drawer, body, and container you see to collect one of 50 different kinds of material to craft and upgrade your weapons, ammo and abilities. Manage your inventory system that is barely explained to make sure you can actually heal when you need to.Shoot into swarming, spongy enemies until they finally pop apart in the same way. Rinse and repeat until your character is no longer as annoyed as you are (And that mfer is annoyed at everything like an edgy 13 year old).Half of the damn doors in the game require multiple macguffins to open for no good reason. Just because your character gripes about this does not make it an okay mechanic.Every single character you encounter is a long-winded exposition machine. Literally, in some cases. Even dead characters have some irrelevant non-sense to babble on about for minutes at a time. Don't even get me started on the awkward dialogue. The voice actors are doing their best but its clear no direction was given to the talent. The main character is written extremely poorly and never shuts up, making matters worse.I've gotten stuck on random crap around 6 times and had to reload a save because I dared tried to jump over something. I have to use an external tool to fix the FOV to not make me physically ill.I could go on but you get the idea. The game is just very meh and tedious."

1925,Tomphonse,https://steamcommunity.com/id/memekill/,1,,1,18.9,February,25,538,0,1,"An extreme breath of fresh air in the gaming space. Combat is a lot of fun even if at times it can be a wee bit jank. If you dont have the right upgrades / using the correct buffs some enemies can feel a bit bullet/hit spongey.  Great graphics overall but more importantly unmatched art direction and animation. In terms of art the only games I can really think of putting this in a basket with is maybe Psychonauts 1, Planescape Torment, Bioshock Infinite and a few other games that feel totally inspired of which maybe half a dozen or so come out a decade. If you just enjoy 3d modelling and art its well worth full price for 20 hour plus exhibition of said art. Performance is amazing, one of the most optimised games of recent memory, up there with RE Engine games and Metal Gear Solid V. Only downside is no raytracing (they say it might come later) and some of the animations seem to be capped to lower frame rates (these animations can be brought up to the game fps with console commands and their speed isn't tied to frame rate either, hopefully an update will fix this as they seem to be capped for consoles or something.)Story and writing is solid with a big asterisk. It's only solid in Russian with subs. The english dub is beyond terrible, worse than the worst anime dubs. Issue with Russian with subs is that it can be hard to read subtitles during combat. However, you can get around this by stopping and listening rather than running into the next combat area whilst talking to your glove or another character over radio. That might be a wee bit tedious for some. If you're deadset on playing in english then you probably also want to be the type of person who doesn't care about the story either. If you want a great story and to play in english then this isn't the game for it sadly. My main issue with this game has to be the open world. In the open world there is basically a wanted system which is extremely frustrating. Makes it really hard to explore. I wish they went for something more like Far Cry where you can permanently take out a base. If they don't want the player to be able to clear the map maybe make it so the bases can be rebuilt after one of those 2-4 hour story dungeons. Luckily the open world doesn't take up the main focus and is just really there as a means to get between the 2-4 hour long story dungeons. Which also then makes you think why even have this open hub world that isn't fun to explore and doesn't have much use. But the dungeons all together make up the length, maybe more, of your favourite half life or bioshock if you arent speedrunning so it's still worth it.But all in all this gets a big recommendation from me"

You do feel from time to time that its the first game made by mundfish. However, it is is a LOT of fun. The story might not be very deep, however its solid and totally fine. One of the biggest flaws however, is the open world. While there are some nice villages, after you find a way out of the underground complex, you get thrown into the open world and it feels odd. The open world itself is also partially a bit empty... However this gets pretty much compensated by the design of every single complex and testing area. They are incredibly fun to play and also have an awesome artstyle. Sometimes you will encounter things that seem to be a mixture of the visuals of we happy few and bioshock. Visually this game is pretty consistent a Banger (as long as you ignore spots of the open world). Fights are fun and you can play around with yout abilities. And while Charles, your glove who grants you 3 abilities is awesome, some critics say, the main charakter isnt. While in my language, the voiceactor compensated quite alright the dullness and dumbness of the MC, I do understand if people are annoyed by him.

The game play is barely serviceable, do you know how *good* the visual artistry needs to be to make up for that? This good. Trick is, that doesn't age well. Eventually these graphics will be last gen... but the game knows what it is, its a graphics game. Thats why it hijacks my camera every thirty seconds to show me a pre-rendered thing. But for now you get my thumbs up... barely.pro tip: turn the dialogue to russian, its way shorter and suddenly it makes sense why the main character goes from aggressive diatribes too 'ooo radio'"

I like these games a lot, so finding something similar is nice. 3) Puzzles are interesting, at times tricky.4) Story is good, though nothing is really hidden. So if you listen/read thorough enough you won't be very surprised in the ending.Questionable:1) For me battle system was fun, but I am filthy casul in FPS, so it might be boring for someone else.2) Crafting is ok, but do not expect something specialWhat I disliked:1) Bugs and bugged achievements (still don't have all of them). Some of bugs are already fixed, some will be fixed when the person reading this review will get the game. I didn't got a gamebreaking experience, but sometimes it was irritating.2) Well, platforming does not feel fun, I'd say clunky.

The guns hit somewhat hard even for the most difficult setting. But so does everything that's trying to kill you. 60$ and it's an entire game with a start and finish. Little to no bugs. This is a RARE thing nowadays.Now, basing how well this game is doing purely on the checklist of, ""has a story"", has little to no bugs"", ""not a beta or an alpha test"".

Shotgun and Fat-Boy)- the open world needs more stuff to discover- there is no option to really hide from enemies in the open world- cheap blood / gore effects (blood and gore are nice, but the implementation could have been better)- no free saving in the open world, so you have to drive or run around until you find a saveroomIf you don't take everything too seriously, if you are a fan of the ""Bioshock"" and ""Wolfenstein"" games and if you like challenging shooters, you will like this game.

Verdict: atomic heart does a lot good, a lot average, and a lot bad but overral its still a unique experience in a sea of the same games and while its not perfect i do still quite enjoy it. that being said its not worth the 60 bucks, wait for it to be on sale.6.5/10"

Flawless Widescreen is buggy. The devs said they didn't include it because the game has a ""wider than normal"" FOV than standard games. What were they smoking?-An unlikeable main character + side-kick glove that doesn't STFU. Not even Duke Nukem was this cringe and even he knew when to STFU. It becomes so overwhelming that it starts to overlap on other objective narration from NPC's.-Over the top, tasteless, non-stop cringe dialogue/script from everyone else. Youtube an early cut-scene called  Nothing preceding this moment in the game logically follows what happens in this scene. It made no sense whatsoever to have dialogue like that. I was ready to ALT+F4 mid-scene because of how heavy-handed it was, but decided to push thru for a few more minutes hoping for the best...until it eventually crashed due to the Flawless Widescreen FOV slider having a conflict with the Shok ability. Between the cringe and tasteless dialogue, the lack of a proper FOV slider, no RTX even though that was a big selling point but was dropped last minute, and from what I've read from other reviews regarding what the open-world eventually turned out to be, this is an easy refund.All the good points this game had going for it was just hampered by the execution of other core elements.

1979,Andrew,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984732728/,3,,0,13.2,February,25,122,0,1,"ADDED 26/02/2023I gave this to the open world part, I really did want this to be fun. They lied about that. It isn't open world, it's heavily gated and horribly repetitive. There are whole areas on the map that are completely empty then others that are so full of respawning mobs it is clearly the only part that matters. The alarm system is full of bugs and either barely functions or goes off for no reason what so ever. The respawning mobs can not be looted which means you run out of ammo FAST and can only use the slowly recharging whimpy lazer., Much of the backstory and in game found material doesn't play or is just garbage that seems to have been thrown in at the last minute. Many of these voice overs must have been really cheap to make or done by staff.Just walk away from this. ORIGINAL REVIEW.This should be a good game, this should be the next Bioshok. The art of the world is great, and there it ends. The story is uninspired and stereotypical to the point you know it already, attempts to hide mystery are made fun of in the games 4th walls comments. The movement, which is oh so important in this, is clunky and feels both mushy and indistinct, this is really bad with the large sections of platform puzzles. Often you'll be left wondering what happened to a jump or a climb and the answer is it just didn't, the double jump or rush jump fails randomly. I'm not sure if it is meant to be funny but it if it is the humour wears off fast.Controls can natrually be changed, but then again they can't be. Some controls form parts of the game mechanics that can NOT be changed, but can have the same effect as another control. You can accidentally bind controls to exit to move or exit to parts of puzzle solving problems, makes them extra challenging to have only half the controls accessible, but extra chances to exit and fail. This is really game breaking when you end up being grappled by some opponents or following onscreen instructions. You get a series of buttons to press, to this point they have not worked, I think they are bound to other features.The game progression and crafting is simplistic and again vague, increased damage was never observed on the weapons and the backpacking/storage system is just an afterthought to try and make the game seem bigger. The only way to identify something in your inventory is to go to the save area, transfer the item from the back pack to the storage, close that and then try and dismantle the item. There are NO mouse over features. Which brings us to the big one, the save system. This is a game with no online requirement and complex alarm and detection systems in game. There is only save at certain points and others you are NOT warned about. It is easy to miss a save point and lose hours of play. There are reminded to save, but these pop up literally next to the save mechanic. This says the developers were well aware it was possible to loss significant game play and thought I note was sufficient to fix it. I really wanted this game to be great, another world to enjoy. Instead even after it's development process it feels unfinished and very expensive at that. Maybe they will fix it."

They blew it out the park. The second is learning just how hard game design is.The art is fantastic. The world is amazing. The (Russian) voices tickle me just right. The soundtrack made me pregnant. The twins don't actually have the biggest cake in the game, Dr Larisa does. Anyway, time to spend the rest of this review ripping it apart.This game's problem is Bioshock 1. They took a lot of pages out of 2K book. Now I have no problem with the idea of sticking to a legendary title like that for guidance, my problem is that it's Bioshock's book. Graphics aside, this game would be a killer competitor to Bioshock. In 2007. With its 2007 combat, and its 2007 level design.The world puzzles don't feel immersive at all, they feel more like Portal test chambers where everything is designed FOR YOU, as a player.The combat doesn't feel worth it most of the time; I'm not excited to fight like I am in Elden Ring.The questmarker makes no sense. I won't get into it, but at one point there's a quest marker that says ""go to the second floor"". You can clearly see the second floor. You can clearly see the quest marker up there. There's a 30-second video on youtube that someone made to point out you need a press a button to crash a submarine attached to the ceiling to make a bridge. How was I supposed to know that?Huge parts of the missions are ""this door needs 5 keys but the 5 keys are all in different places and take like 30 minutes to get each"", which is the most Bioshock thing I've ever heard (not in a good way)If you want to make an AAA game these days, it needs to stand shoulder to shoulder with other AAA TODAY. Not 2007.Cyberpunk 2077 absolutely flies at everything this game stumbled with.To be fair, the opposite is also true (as in this game actually runs lmao)"

It doesn't offer anything else tho.Yes, it is Bioshock in the  setting, we've seen this 15 years ago. This game borrowed too much from other games and lost its own uniqueness (except for the soviet setting ofc). For example, a pioneer boy, it’s just a copy of Vault boy, and the perk videos are copied from the Fallout 4 SPECIAL videos.The game has many downsides. Developers tried their best to make good visuals, but forgot about the gameplay, it’s boring and monotonous, it takes too much time to kill armored opponents even on medium difficulty. Many animations are really clumsy, shooting impact is terrible.The quick-loot system (push F to loot) kills all the fun of finding items, you don’t even notice what exactly you take. Besides, it works bad, sometimes player can’t loot some crates because he’s standing at the wrong angle. The plot is… predictable. That’s all, there is no feelings or emotions. All the promised “twists” seem to be taken from comics for kids and other games. Sci-fi in this game is quite silly. All things are explained with the help of . Robots? ! Perks and skills? Yeah, . Bioengineering? That’s… yep, that’s also . My favorite thing in this game is Hermione Granger’s handbag as player’s inventory (guess it’s  too).And of course there’s tons of fantasies about the . Sometimes it’s really funny tho. I didn’t understand this weak attempt to put the once-existing country (with all the repression and state crimes) in a good light. Should I remind that people who was born in times of the , and who lives in rusia now, who holds a public office – are the reason for rusia's attack on Ukraine? But the developers don’t seem to care much, the developers try to stay out of politics. Just close their eyes and pretend nothing happened, imagine this wonderful world of the . And of course, the twin ballerinas became the biggest advertisement for the game. You will easily find tons of comments to this game from “Neuron activated” monkeys that saw pretty robo-girls and started praising the game just for that.Rubbish"

К сожалению это уже стало редкостью что игра в первый же день работает без мини игры в патчи. На Линуксе все работает идеально без просадок без доп. Настроек, в первый раз такой уровень оптимизации за последние лет 5-10 (даже дум этернал на релизе работал хуже). Разработчикам мое почтение, я вообще не фанат такого рода игр, но захотелось попробовать и честно говоря очень рад. Все на высоте, начиная от технического исполнения заканчивая музыкой и стилистикой, уровень в театре это нечто. Если какие замечания и имеются то это по части языка, после покупки на стиме на русский, на момент прохождения, переключить не получится, а английский в таком сеттинге смотрится инородно, так что готовьтесь комрады-мажоры :) В общем очень рекомендую.EN:The game is a masterpiece. Works on Linux without any additional tweaking. First time in a long time I see that level of optimization on release. This is a good precedent to set for other developers, no over hyped release dates, no delays (maybe I was out of the loop) just solid performance on day one, without “early betas” and so on. Imo developers managed to take every advantage of the video game medium as an art form, there is no way it would be possible to realize such a vision in a movie or a book. The music, the assets, overall styling is 10\10 my personal favorite being the theater level. The only issues I had was with language switching. Also maybe inconsistent endings as you can do a thing in one ending that is not possible to do in another."

Basically, it seems they liked the idea of a gruff anti-hero but had no idea how to make that personality likable.Additionally there are several moments where the characters will start to monologue what I can only assume is propaganda as these speeches are often unprompted and seem to come out of no where."
2009,Goobie75,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076796030/,8,1,0,21.8,March,2,302,0,1,"The game has an incredible setup, the fictional world of a Sci-fi Soviet Union is interesting. The game wears its inspirations on its sleeve, Bioshock being the first and most prominent influence. I enjoyed the setting but after the first few hours, the gameplay comes to a crawl. In general the game can be described as a worse version of every game it takes inspiration from. The setting and world is interesting at a glance, but its never well fleshed out, the melee hits feel floaty and unresponsive, the powers are lackluster and too few to allow diverse builds, and the lack of enemy types makes combat in general feel boring. On top of the previous problems by far the worst aspect of this game has to be the dialogue. The characters are constantly talking and blabbing on about every insignificant detail in the map, there's no way to make them shut up and the characters will often cut each other off, voicelines will randomly replay, and the writing of the characters feels inconsistent. The number one worst offender is your character P-3, imagine if someone took only the worst aspects of Iron-man, Duke Nukem, and Sokka as mashed them together into the goofiest guy you've ever met. All of his lines are weird and don't make sense he keeps trying to push a catchphrase, and he's oddly combative to everyone. This isn't even to mention the message of the game itself. Mundfish, the game's developer has proven ties to Russian oligarchs and the message of the game isn't a critic of the USSR. Every other game in this genre uses their setting to critic and comment on the belief system, but Atomic Heart doesn't ever attempt to do that, I was holding out until the end, hoping that there would be some slight criticism of Soviet Russia, but there is nothing. In general, don't waste your money on this, instead buy a game that Atomic Heart takes inspiration from like Bioshock, Prey, or Dishonored. I can assure you, you will enjoy them far more than this game."
2010,ThisSonofaGun,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NightDogs/,3,,0,20.5,February,23,282,0,1,"I'm mixed, more inclined into negative.Gameplay-wise, it's decent. Nothing to write home about.It's trying to be Bioshock to a point I felt the urge to play Bioshock instead while playing. And I'm not even refering to the clear nudges they did. I mean the overall gameplay and feel.If you mind bad writing, stay away from this.I personally get thrown off by bad plots and terrible dialogue delivery. If you're the same, you're better off playing something different (Changing the language to Russian makes it more ""believable"" but still has terrible pacing and plot. The english voice actor is just... ugh).Don't get me wrong, the plot starts strong the first half. It was really interesting. But the more I played, the more I realized the use of clichés and Story Telling 101 material.And to par all that, my engagement was broken by weird FOV, weird hit boxes and bad game design choices. A vision of the world in which USSR achieved a robotic utopia, that sounds awesome. And, they thought out of the box in how the world would have functioned with their overall environment design. To those complaining that it's a pro-communism game, it's not. The game actually allows the flaws of communism to become really apparent.The music is brow-raising, really well done and composed. There were a lot of sequences which the music took protagonism and practically carried out those sections. I was capable of ignoring the flaws by the music alone. It really was that good. The one exception is the music in the vending machines, by the end I dreaded going to them or turned the music down because of how it sticks in your head, and not in a good way. I still hear that stupid song.I believed Atomic Heart would have been material for GotY.But, I seriously doubt that will happen now after experiencing how rushed the final product turned out to be."

But let's all agree that boycotting a company that has literally put 7 years of development time into a video game because of a conflict so-called in Ukraine is probably the dumbest thing you could possibly do it would be like us boycotting all Chinese Vietnam Russian Goods around the world virtually all of the goods that America gets would be gone in a day all of your silverware all of your gasoline everything would be gone. This is nothing but a bunch of crazed leftist Communists trying to destroy a game company and I am appalled at what I witnessing here they claim to be for free speech but they stifle free speech and expression in order to push their own agenda this is just disgusting to watch they say they're moral people but have absolutely no morality at all, if they were as virtuous and moral as they claim to be they would never buy another thing from Walmart Kroger any of these stores ever again, to the developer. I will be honest 100% in my review of your game this weekend and on behalf of the entire United States from the bottom of my heart I am so sorry with what this country has done to you."

Sure the game looks great aesthetically, however many of the textures are just not ironed out. Grass and trees looks off, while the reflection on metals and other hard surfaces are good. The BIGGEST deal breaker for me is how a supposedly highly trained intelligence operative can talk with less IQ than most 5 years olds, like the banters and jokes are not funny but cringe. And its only the player character that has that problem. So you have this weird contrast of a 5 year-old acting tough and funny while surrounded by NPCs with actual people skills."

I am a sucker for BioShock style story/horror elements, so I really enjoyed the story. Though some might complain about characters sounding wooden in dialogue, I recommend playing in Russian with English subtitles. I have no complaints about VA, though sometimes there is dialogue playing whilst I am fighting so I miss some crucial/non-crucial details in world-building and character motivation. The world building is fantastic, and gives a perspective on Russian (alternate) cold war life that I've never really seen in games before.The core gameplay loop is really fun, using everything at your disposal to rip and tear through enemies of varying sizes and danger to you. I played on Armageddon(Hardcore) and was able to get into a rhythm of fighting within a couple of hours (Zvezdochka reverse shot and Mass Telekinesis are your friend). The open world gets pretty samey after 10 hours or so, as you can either run around all enemies to quest points or just open the Labs, grab loot and skedaddle. Fighting the Bosses is really fun, but I felt like there wasn't enough of them to really grapple with. In terms of resource management on Armageddon, after around 7 hours I was stacked and could do what I wanted. Being able to recycle weapons (DON'T RECYCLE YOUR SHOTGUN) and craft new ones for the same resources was cool to experiment with what playstyle suits you. By 15hrs I was maxed on Shok and Character Neuro-Polymer upgrades, so I could experiment pretty easily on that front as well.RTX 2070, Ryzen 5 3600 X, 32GB RAM and SSD. I was hitting around 90 FPS consistently in open and underground areas. Didn't crash once, had a couple of weird texture pop ins, but overall performance was very solid for me.  So take my experience with a grain of salt.There are a lot of bugs that people are experiencing, I was lucky enough to avoid most of them. The most impactful for me were the recycling of the KS23 Shotgun, and not being able to get it back through a bug with the blueprint, and Hawks being bugged if you overload them, with the game not fixing the towers. Also most achievements are bugged, like running 20 enemies over. If you don't do it in one gameplay session the Achievement will reset for the next one, making it difficult to get them.Overall I really enjoyed this game, but it's a toss up if it's worth buying now. If you like BioShock style games/story and can endure some early release bugs/performance issues go ahead. I would probably recommend waiting a few months for Mundfish to stabilise the game and a DLC to come out. The price you pay is up to you, I pre-ordered the Premium edition because I was very excited for this game and wanted to support the devs, what you're willing to spend is up to you."

Your character explains early in the game that he only respect people who earn his respect, I.E. save his life or prove their worth to him. a guy saves his life after saving him from an ambush, but instead of helping to save that man's life you refuse to help save him because the doctor who asked you for help refuses to answer your questions so you just say, ""♥♥♥♥ you, you can save this man on your own because you arent going to answer my questions.""another actual interaction:*climbing on wall moving right**giant robotic worm digs 10 feet infront of you making a gap where you were about to climb in the next 20 seconds*Glove: ""Wow, you have great reflexes!

Besides that im already 2 hours in and I AM LOVING IT. 1. Robo twins are great2. Dominant upgrade vending machine gets me laughing every time.3. Every minute has been just action/comedy filled and it makes it all the better.Will edit it when i completely finish the game!Edit:(ill leave a lot of stuff out i really didnt see any cons about the game mostly pro's)   I have enjoyed this game all the way to the end and got the good ending. This game is spectacular in combat story and lore wise. There wasn't any wide open spaces to where it was just barren it was close together combat was around mostly every corner and you had to think to not get killed. I played this game through Armageddon to get the full feel for it. It was challenging to where i had to think before every scenario what i should bring what i shouldn't bring. I cannot wait to see what they will bring to the table with the DLC. Plus i never thought i would've seen a ""Return to Facility 3826"" an open world to finish up anything remaining in terms of achievements or story telling that youd missed before nice added touch for those who didn't want to restart the whole game and do it over. All in all 10/10 a great take on a ""what if"" the soviet union had won in the war."

It has pro-communism, pro-ussr, anti-capitalism posters everywhere - unlike Bioshock. Yes, there are references to the War in Ukraine also.It has a long tutorial stage with some underground zones (like Rapture from Bioshock)It has the world reveal at the very start like Half-Life (and Bioshock... and Prey)It has abilities (like Bioshock) and some other personal skill tree upgradesIt has an Open world area (JUST LIKE HALO INFINITE.)(It's beautiful but I'm hoping it won't just be a nice mountainous forest zone. I'm still exploring - THERE BETTER BE DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS IN THE LATER ZONES)It has cameras to sneak by (BUT NOT LIKE DISHONORED cause drones will repair them since the whole game is being self-sustained by an AI. Your enemies will be regenerated so... long story short farm them.It has a GTA Wanted Level... so don't fight too long or else you will be swarmed.Upgrade often. Cause the loot you obtain will be lost if you dont call it a day from hunting/farming bots cause you will eventually have so much loot you wont want to lose.The characters are voiced well and believable.YOUR character is... I would say, easily annoyed. He doesn't like the robots, he's impatient, and NOT cringey. He's actually kind of reserved to his own standards. It's -- refreshing I guess. Other times, I think his sarcasm or sardonic attitude is misdirected. Who's he mad at? Everyone? Why TF does he have a catchphrase? Is it some reference to russian meme culture? Crispy Critters???????????? Oh well. Definitely interesting. It's just nice he's not a badly written comic relief dimwit like in many games now. He sounds like someone you want to take seriously, but the suggestive fridge AI is in the game to break any tension he's constantly under.Whatever. It's fun, different, stable, ...optimized, beautiful, builds upon Halo Infinite's bland world setting, ...isn't easy on normal,...you must level up the Freeze ability, or get Fire cartridges for some enemies (you'll find bulletsponges if you dont prepare)oh,...and it has a horny fridge."

It is unacceptable for a 60 euro game to have such an amount of crashes that playing becomes practically impossible.  (after updating drivers, verifying the game cache, still had consistent crashes every ~3/4 minutes of gameplay)For the 2 hours that I played, gameplay was very enjoyable however with a storyline that had me interested.Edit: Also wanted to add that the missing FOV slider is another big miss.

Not only does it run great, it looks great! The game play is satisfying and it always feels great to kills robots and mutants. The environment and world is amazing. As a single player and story driven game, it is amazing. I don't think it is just a good game as others say. It is an amazing game. Also some food for thought, this game is the first game that has come from the studio Mudnfish. I can not wait for more games from them and maybe a dlc. Only complaint is that the voices are odd but that is bc it's an English voice over. 9/10 would recommend."

The amount of times i had to reload a save just to get unstuck from game meshes. *sigh*THE PLUSES:+ The art direction is phenomenal and i kept stopping to observe these bizare designs of pretty much everything in the game.+ Music is great but at times it is poorly implemented: in story moments it can play over a dialogue and be distracting+ Story is good and i enjoyed the protagonist even tho lot of people hate him because of his chatter and personality but I loved both aspects.+/- Graphics look great, models and the baked lighting is really good in the underground sections but lacks in the open world. Considering the game has a fixed time of day, the more indirectly lit areas could use a bit of love+ Gameplay: If you love a challange, quick action, dodging and killing mostly the same type of enemies over and over then this is your game. I personally loved it.CONCLUSION:Overall if you want a game with some unique looks a good story and fun combat while listening to some sick beats then this is a game for you.For a (FIRST) Mundfish game i was pleasantly surprised. In my humble opion, it was worth the preorder."

I'm not saying these issues aren't frustrating, but the pros of this game significantly outweigh the cons. The dialogue can be a bit jank sometimes and getting stuck so you have to reload and waste 15min of gameplay is annoying and disappointing. But Crispy Critters, the ambition and execution of this world and story are excellent. This game is a trip, and a good one at that. One of the most unique experiences in video games, meant as a compliment. Like a cross of Cyberpunk 2077 and Bioshock.

2108,Hextor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hextorio/,3,1,0,21.4,March,6,455,0,1,"Great setting, beautiful design, wise gameplay ideas overshadowed by lot of glitches and very poor story execution. Dialogues, plot twists and characters are written very poorly. Also the game is not so open world as it was initially advertised. I would describe the world as semi-open. I was expecting different. On top of the linear levels like testing grounds and other underground facilities in which you are pushing story forward there's not so much to do in the open world. The gameplay is getting pretty repetitive quite fast as there's no big variety of enemies and arsenal you can use. On top it's worth to mention lots of glitches that were forcing me to reload the game very often - also a lot of achievements are glitched and they didn't unlock for me at all.My recommendation is to grab this game at heavily discounted price just to enjoy its retrofuturistic art style."

Its well optimized and looks fantastic without sacrificing gameplay. However that gameplay tends to be average. It has its kinks and issues many can be chalked up to a dev team working on their first game, combat is way to easy to exploit but this is kinda offset by many of the fights being tailored to absolutely screw you over, making it a weird mix of to easy and to difficult.The story could use some work and the ending is, put simply, not the best. However despite its shortcomings in dialogue and pacing i still enjoyed myself every minute, wish it was longer to be honest. Tl;Dr the game is good, not phenomenal, but well above expectations of a fresh dev team. Fun to play, well optimized, with a few flaws."

The guns feel nice and chunky, the powers are satisfying, charging up melee attacks and dodging around is fun. The game looks and performs fantastic. It's missing RTX I guess but I really don't care.The setting is one of the best I've seen in a game in a while.The Bad:The story and writing is bad. I could forgive this to some extent if the story didn't get in the way of the game but it does. For some reason there are third person, pre rendered cutscenes and also in game first person ones. All the the third person ones were insanely bad and you can't skip them. Story for this kind of game is much better delivered via radio while you are doing the fun part of the game.There are a few parts where the game deliberately wastes your time and it obviously thinks it's hilarious for doing this. It isn't.Overall I like this game and hope this studio improves upon this formula."

The style is certainly what stands out most with it's retro sci-fi feel, the gameplay is pretty solid if not a little borked, the plot is fun and interesting, and the soundtrack is fantastic. Just know it's more akin to something like Bioshock Infinite than Bioshock 1 if you're someone like me who was going into this expecting something kinda like that.

2133,Starrune,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Starrune/,6,1,0,12.6,February,25,168,0,1,"I reasonably liked the game for the first bit i was mesmerized at the beauty they put into the game and how it feels to be in that soviet era, but when it boiled down and you slowly worked your way through the game it was a polished crap.Protagonist- In any way shape of form the protagonist feels like a child who just learned to speak English and says annoying catch phrases or says the same thing multiple times. This man is broken record but people seem to love him saying crispy critters every 10 minutes of game play. His words are so basic and the way he speaks to nora or any robot is that of a whiny child.Game play- Then you get to the game play it felt so garbage even before you left the starting area into the open world. the same enemies very telegraphed with boring mechanics and it seemed every time you met a so called boss before the first actual boss in the arena it just got killed it and didn't let you fight anything different or have a mini boss fight before throwing that hedgie at you. With the confines of the underground areas out of the way you get to the open world not only is it very annoying to have the stealth system built the way it is for the way enemies come fight you endlessly. With the fact that areas cannot be cleared it makes the over world just annoying rather than feeling like an actual addition or relevance to the actual game.Events/Missions- With the game play aspects out of the way you get to the story and plot. Not only does it feel like the starting area is too long it feels very telegraphed with the mentioning of everything and hinting before anything happened i was never surprised or even caught off guard with the enemies it threw at me or story it made being very 1 dimensional with how it approached it. All the tasks being very tedious and being shoved in your face with long annoying un-skippable parts like you were doing a Assassins Creed or GTA Following mission which aren't inherently bad but when it seems you are stuck in the same area having to backtrack to get the things needed to progress it makes it a time pit rather than anything memorable. Story-Finally the Actual Plot/Story.. I could not even follow it not that it was hard to but it was just so disastrously boring for me/ so predictable and basic with games like this. Everything fine.. you Sent to go where most of the story will take place.. Everything gets predictable because the world falls apart as soon as you get there because ""the bad guy"" messed everything up with either hacking/murder.Final Point- So for a $60 Price tag i cannot recommend this game. i really liked it felt like i was playing dishonored again one of my favorite games ,but with the predictable story and how everything went down so far in the game i cant even give this above a 4/10 in my book of how games should be with all the increased talent we have now. (note i have not finished the game but with almost halfway through it feels like i wanted to put my ideas to paper to see how i felt and see if the game changed by the end if it doesn't this review will stay the same i didn't even see this game in my queue or anything about it till i saw it on the front page didn't mind the trailer and bought it with that said i wasn't on the hype train and seeing how much people fan over this game i don't get it since we are fanning over mediocrity especially with game companies increasing prices due to inflation and not even giving us what they were worth before although this is different because it is 60 not 70.)"

2139,Toaster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tktoaster/,1,,1,18.3,February,26,676,0,1,"From the moment you start playing, you'll be immersed in a world filled with a wide range of enemies, including mechanical, biomechanical, biological, and airborne, making every encounter unique and challenging.One of the game's standout features is the crafting system, allowing you to piece together weapons from metal parts taken from robots or taken from loot containers hidden throughout the world. Additionally, weapons can be upgraded using vending machines, and ammunition can be upgraded with various elemental effects using ""canisters,"" adding an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay.Although I initially had some concerns about the comedy elements in the game, I was pleasantly surprised at how well they were integrated into the storyline, and how they match the personality of the main character perfectly. It provides a nice break from the seriousness of the game and adds to the overall enjoyment.Despite the developers failing to deliver on some of the preorder promises, I am still happy to have been a part of the development of Atomic Heart. The game has exceeded my expectations and is one of the best FPS games I've played in recent years. The addition of the Polymer Glove, which grants the player powers such as telekinesis, freezing, and electricity, makes for some truly epic combat moments, and its powers can be combined with both melee and ranged weapons.Overall, I highly recommend Atomic Heart to any FPS or RPG fan. The game is an excellent addition to the genre and offers hours of exciting gameplay, innovative mechanics, and a unique story.If you enjoyed these games, chances are you'll like this one: Prey is a first-person shooter game with RPG elements, and players have to explore a space station filled with alien creatures. Like Atomic Heart, players have to scavenge for resources to craft weapons, and the game also has a crafting system to upgrade weapons and gear. Metro Exodus is a first-person shooter game with survival elements set in a post-apocalyptic world. Like Atomic Heart, it features a semi-linear storyline where players are encouraged to adventure away from the standard pathway, players have to scavenge for resources to survive, and the game features a crafting system to upgrade weapons and gear."

I have also had the situations where the game just stops allowing me to interact with objects and I again have to reload. I finally gave up as the platforming is super buggy and I have had what feels like invisible objects/walls push me when I jump, or momentum get set improperly on jump. That combined with the game being extremely finicky about where and how the character grabs a ledge makes the platforming mostly just frustrating. Ultimately the above average combat don't make up for the extremely poor platforming (which makes up a large number of the ""puzzles""), the obnoxious writing with a character that just won't be quiet, and the oddly over sexualized female robots."

Runs laggyMy rig is old, using a 980 ti, 16gb ddr3, non SSD drive. My resolution is 344x1440 and  75% of game is maxed out, except ambient occlusion and motion blur, which doesn't bother me, lowest AA etc. Still very playable (30fps or more) some learning curves when introducing the puzzles etc,, but it's fun. Enemies drop goodies to help you craft things. The open world is slightly linear, stuff off basic trails is possible, usually find goodies. Some of the boss fights are F******* frustrating at first.I recommend this game, but needs a patch still for minor bugs."

Not in an overwhelming way, but it demands your attention while playing. The themes are appropriately adult and very enjoyable. My only advice is DO NOT RUSH.

A lot of people will try to compare this to Bioshock, and while there are similarities, it is weaker because of how it is different. The game has excellent graphics. They have done a lot with the unreal 4 engine to give a realistic feel. The beginning of Atomic Heart feels like a near ripoff of Bioshock Infinite. Parade, celebration, then everything goes wrong and you get into the action with very similar combat mechanics even. However... The game is very strong in its exposition. The acting is terrible, and there's so much dialogue between you and your glove that its actually kind of jarring and takes you out of the experience. The utopian USSR turned dystopian future isn't really imaginative enough to maintain interest. The combat mechanics are ""OK"" but mainly because they mimic Bioshock's, but worse. They don't improve upon much in combat. The game cant decide if it wants to be a FPS or a First Person Adventure Puzzle Game. The puzzles are so drastically easy, that the amount of puzzles is more an obstacle. A lot of the quests aren't very satisfying. If you are trying to get from a to b and its not some basic puzzle, basically they send you on a fetch quest or hide and seek to open some ""master gate"". Basically, the story needs me to move into a new area, but theres a MEGA-locked door. To unlock it you need 5 keys. Go search 5 giant wings of 5 complexes, kill enemies in each wing of each complex, return and put each key in 1 by 1. Then the door unlocks, leading to a very similar area. There are no interesting characters, there is no interesting plot. There are lots of upgrades, though you always seem to be just short on parts to get the upgrades you really want. The game also incorporates quicktime mechanics into the middle of a shooting fight. So if you are using your special ability (like a shock or frost burst from your glove) and shooting, you might get attacked and grab and have to stop doing that ability to make sure you hit a random unknown quicktime key. Even with full health, if you miss twice, you are dead, thats it, no second chances. You then reload from the last save. Since this is the future, there's no fantastical period piece design. Its a half assed robot zombie shooter with a dash of bioshock,  garbage mechanics, and bad game design. On multiple occasions there has been collisions that were too large, or ledges that made for rough jumps, even with dash. The tutorials will also prompt you like a million times, even after full well knowing the key for it. To be fair to the game though, most games are terrible by comparison, and it barely holds interest. Get it on sale for 20 bucks. 5/10"

2186,Melon Man,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MeloniousDeeds/,9,,0,1.9,February,21,542,10,1,"My hopes weren't extraordinarily high for this release, I followed it back in 2017 when quite a few people, me included, thought it was a scam. Six years later here it is. The first impressions were very, very rough.First thing I noticed was that the screen felt zoomed in and looking around in the reviews this is being explained by a low FOV of around 55 without the option of a slider in any settings. This part is somewhat subjective to some, but I feel like it should be a standard practice to at least include the option to increase one's FOV.The sound design felt off as well, made it quite difficult for me to get into the experience. Often times it would feel that things lacked impact. The sounds of explosions were next to non-existent and lumbering metal behemoths that crash to the earth made the sound of a feather that had gently drifted to the ground. The voice acting combined with the dialogue is...Odd. To say the least. It gave the atmosphere of a light-hearted comedy, and while I haven't quite played enough to understand quite what this game would like to go for, I know it would bug some people enough that it's worth mentioning. The dialogue was off as well, though that might be due to translation.The protagonist seems to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well, though I didn't play long enough to see if there's any character development in store.The art direction, which honestly is what grabbed my attention to this game back in 2017, is phenomenal. Lovely, great, good, nice. Not much to say here, it's simply very good. World and enemy design are great. Graphic fidelity is nice as well. Playing on maximum settings, the lighting is lovely and most of the texture work is solid as well. Nothing groundbreaking, but still very pleasant to look at. There are a handful of visual glitches, and while that sort of thing doesn't bother me too much, I know others might take issue with it. Gameplay at the moment of this review, and with what limited time I had with it before the solid cutoff for a refund arrived, did not feel the best. Movement felt janky and combat felt floaty and at times disorienting. Melee had little satisfying feedback, even with it's heavier swings. If you're still on the fence about getting it after this read, try it and just keep an eye on the time, you might like the game anyways. I might come back in a few months or a year to see if any if this changes, but for now these are my feelings on the game."

But the first section was frustrating. I feel the fault for the frustration lands on the dialog in the first section of the game, as it was super annoying. There was too many cinematic scenes where you get thrown which cause them to feel boring as you sit there and wait for an ex machina to save you. Lastly the game feels sleazy at times, as the frequency of sexual situations, jokes, etc, causes them to become less amusing and seem more like the developers fetishes.Could recommend getting this game if it is on sale.Pros:Great visualsCool WeaponsGood Skill TreeUseful weapon upgradesGreat attention to detailCons:No Ray-TracingThe mass collecting can be buggyOpening dialog mood feels off quite oftenOpening dialog can be super annoying at timeSafe rooms are a bit too common in the beginning and kills the mood"

2199,CameronBobGaming,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CameronBobGaming/,No,,0,19.9,February,22,456,0,1,"Yeah nah, she goes alright.I lost interest in the story after you finally enter the 'Open World' almost a hour later. There was some moment that got my attention but most of it nah not really. It was very lacking and not a very good build up to the finally outcome.  and most of the story was very predictable anyways as you play the game you start figuring it out in no timeGameplay/combat can be a bit repetitive but also enjoyable. it nice to hack and slash some bot/mutated plant things into ground and dodge there heavy attack on you and it's good that there are different varieties of robots/plant things that all have different move set that you will need to learn. but when there is more then 3 enemies that will use a heavy attack, it can be annoying. you will get knock down and it takes a while for you recover from the knock down but that means while you're knocked down the enemies can get free hit on you which will tank ya Health. even worse if you got back into a corner and you get swarmed my enemies. you can't dodge out of that corner you need to hack and slash out of the corner. I find the best weapons to use within the game is Melee weapons instead of the firearms you can get. as i find that melee weapon do more damage overtime then guns. Especially when you get machete looking thing and attach the magnet heavy attack and then watch you sweep the bot/plants in to time. It nice that this different varieties of Gun/Melee weapons that all do different varieties attacks, which allow to upgrade them to make them more powerful by finding different materials around the world or by looting bots/plants that you kill.Look i am aren't a big fan of the main protagonist on how he goes about with everything that come into he's view. most of the other character within the game, i didn't feel like i had a deep connection/invested with beside one.  Most of the time that you see the other character within the game they're aren't giving a build up to anything to make you have a deep connection/investment with that character so idk when they die or something you can actually feel something OMG they're gone or something. The only other character i can kinda say i felt invested with is Granny simply due to story reason. Not gonna lie here this game surprising RUNS GREAT. Which really isn't said in today gaming. The only problem i had was the FOV setting which isn't present to change. Now i am a person who has a 2K ultrawide screen so the FOV for me in this game was BAD. But easy fix, i started downloading a software called Flawless WideScreen which fix my FOV problem. But this problem is only for people who have ultrawide so don't worry if you don't own a ultrawide. The animations are great and smooth. nothing really much needs to be said here and the World look amazing the opening gave me Bioshock vibs.In my personal opinion i truly believe that this has under gone a change withing the 5 years development at some point from what it was really gonna be if you look at the old photos of the game you will see what i mean. It's really sad that i have to give this a negative review but the developers said that there was gonna at least 25 hours of gameplay at each facility you visit but let be real here. this game has 10 hours or less of story gameplay and the rest is just menus/running around exploring which isn't really necessary as most of the materials you need for upgrades you can grab while on your way to the next mission or while doing the next mission so exploring isn't really needed."
2200,notKieth,https://steamcommunity.com/id/karma_chaos/,1,,0,58.0,March,16,319,0,1,"things i don't like:the open world kills the vibe. Traveling point to point breaks the momentum of game play.I quickly got tired of the enemies. Every boss variant was a lot of fun to fight against but the common enemy's became more annoying than fun to fight. If the enemy's had more attack variants like the bosses, instead of being bum rushed by 30 of the same enemy; it would have been much more engaging. First and third boss could have been a great inclusions for overworld enemies you could discover much more rarely, but are absent after their death. In previous trailers, It looked as though organic and machine enemies could interact with one another, but are shown to either never be placed in the same vicinity to each other, or don’t care to interact when they are. Some enemies depicted in the trailers aren’t even enemies and are just plot and decoration; the ‘clown traps’ only appear for one segment and disappear, ‘daisy’ never makes an appearance beyond the intro of the game ,’burav’ is seen to appear as an upcoming boss or enemy but disappears after a confusing plot point. Many of the robots and “zombies” from older trailers are also scraped. the ‘tree boss’ is shown only briefly before blowing it to bits.gameplay its self is quite breakneck as well. But instead of defending against the hoard with fast paced abilities and weapons, it can feel as none of which really matter in terms of gameplay, as your abilities are merely used to stall as you chip away at enemies little by little; causing a large stall in sections of the gameplay. The customization shown in older trailers has been scraped, As well as a couple weapons shown in resent trailers are nowhere to be found in-game, glory kills are scraped and replaced with a stealth kill function that has no focus in this version of the game, exclusive deaths scenes are scraped and used with only plyusch and lab techs. Despite talking about stealth and the use of silencers on weapons, stealth in not a focus of the gameplay; as many of the robots will hear you coming or walk to fast for you to even attempt to kill; there’s only one animation per robot, and organic creatures are far to hostile to sneak up on; so if you wanted a cool kill-animation with the weapons, they no longer exist. the beginning alone leads to show horror-esk themes but are ignored in later parts of the game. It also appears there might have been more to the story in later trailers were also scraped.much of the story is a mess, there are plot points that don’t lead anywhere, the ending clearly exists only for DLC to come out and wrap up the story, as well as not letting the player to come to their own conclusions. Lore can be discussed in dialog in short bits of “what trivia does my left hand know”, pocket watches that record conversations, and e-mails on computers; All of which, mostly nudges to be joking and lacking in world building. There’s one section of the game showing portraits of random characters, that provoked the uncanny valley in the back of my head, when it hit me that they were made by AI. Leading me to wonder what other filler was created by nodes and AI; as well as some of the poorly written lore segments in emails."

We haven't seen a lot of products from our motherland before, and AH was a big step forward to such universes.I think the upgrade system and weapons variety were quite cool and balance. I'd really like to see more of it in future.Those...

Once in awhile I could tolerate, but the lousy save system ensures hours of repeating game play due to these crashes to desktop, which always seem to happen deep into a mission and far from any save location. Game play on dx11 is choppy and the game stutters but there is no choice, the game will not stay running at any graphics setting with dx12.I finally got frustrated and quit the game attempting to get the AK weapon blueprint, I fell thru the world and restarted again, replaying a half hour of game play, only for the game to repeatedly crash at the same point on the map. I'm already in medium graphics settings and dx11 on a system capable of maxing out this game graphically, there is nothing I can do to keep this game running. I'm sure it works fine on consoles, that's the only game videos you will see on it. Don't buy this game YET, it will only frustrate you when you have to castrate the game graphically to play it.

For me personally (as someone from Eastern Europe who lived through the communist era) it's not so much a celebration of the USSR (as some claim), but rather a mockery of their megalomaniacal visions. I understand all the controversy about the game's creators and its funding. This is a matter for each individual to consider.

Here, you get the damage but also the tactics. If you use your brain and avoid getting cornered, you will have a good time. If you attack withouth minding your surroundings, robots gonna run a train on you and it's all your fault.Upgrading is mandatory, and understanding what works best to interrupt the enemy combo attacks is very important.Overall, in 4 hours i already fell in love with the game.And mi sleep schedule is messed up again.Update: So, i ended up with little to no sleep and finished the game. It's REALLY good and one of the few cases in existence where there isn't a clear cut answer and the player is VERY rewarded for being indipendant and not a simple automaton following orders, be them from your ""allies"" or your ""foes"".It asks politely to use your brain to make decisions on who to trust, and it's a positively refreshing take on what could have gone the ""clone bioshock"" story wise.

I think I kept getting it mixed up with Redfall or something else that was also way off down the road. And I had this anticipation despite the fact that I was doubtful they would give me anything like what the short teaser trailers looked like. Well I wasn't disappointed in the least. The gameplay was solid, the graphics were great, and though it did crash a couple of times, I have come to accept that as part of PC life in new games. I don't know if I will play it again without new content but I did finish it with both endings. There are flaws though. Not having fast travel is one of them. There were things i did not do because I was so terrible at driving and fast travel wasn't available. And it is either stealth or Armageddon fighting for huge distances between zones. The ideal fix would be side missions to repair rail lines or other transport services so you can visit places after the main story is over. Overall, I am glad to have this addition to a dying genre. All of the people reaching way back to Bioshock as a comparison point do so because we aren't getting as many games that are meant to be played through for their story once and maybe some achievements. And all that probably has to do with money. Deathloop is probably the only game from the past couple of years I would put in this sub genre and even it has multiplayer features.But after playing two games so close together where the protagonist has ongoing conversations with their glove, even knowing the eventual outcome of both gloves, I still stand behind the basic point that most people would be nicer to their ever present constantly life saving hand garment."

I went in a little cautious given the mixed reviews at launch but if you don't go in expecting a revolutionary Bioshock experience, you should have a decent time with this. The combat is fast and frantic. I had a lot of fun smacking these iRobots and other robot variations throughout the game. I think the issues start coming in when you get overwhelmed by so many enemies and how fast that can happen. I felt super pressured in the open world parts to just book it to the next linear area instead of taking my time and exploring the world because again, unfortunately, you get swarmed very easily in this game. You also don't move very fast and even with the upgrade later on, you still move relatively slow compared to all the iRobots running after you. Thank God for the dash.Also, some of the puzzles kinda suck. I admit, I'm not great at puzzles but the laser ones and the door locks where you need to match up the colors and you have to rotate the lock around to get them right took me forever....Fun little soviet shooter with a simple plot and it doesn't need to be the next Bioshock. It is fun. That's all it needs to be. 7/10"

Playing off an RTX 3070, I played on Atomic settings and it ran smooth as butter.  It had a couple minor frame drops that were barely noticeable but that was it.  No crashes, freeze ups or chop.   Story was entertaining and the characters were good, including yours.  Combat was awesome, weapons had a good amount of upgrades including your abilities.  I completed the story only doing one side objective in 22.5 hours.   The side objectives are like dungeons and doing them rewards you with additional upgrade blue prints that are't found anywhere else in the world.  It's a semi open world game with plenty to explore.Now with 3 difficulties, and I played on medium difficulty, It wasn't much of a challenge at all including the bosses.........like I did't die at all to a boss.  In fact I only died when I fell to my death due to the, at times, weird platforming which is really the only gripe I have for this.   That being said next time I play it, and I find it enjoyable enough to play again, I'll play it on the harder difficulty.So if you loved Bioshock like I did, you'll love this.  This is actually the best shooter I've played in years.  Good job Mundfish, may I have another."

The most voice acting I've ever heard in a game in the three and a half hours I've played. There's constant chatter from the hero and allies. One of my early complaints is the amount of crafting materials you have to loot all the time felt cumbersome in the beginning but has evened out later in the game and doesn't feel so overwhelming. I play on a 49inch ultrawide and didn't even try the game without flawless ultrawide but at the 85% fov it looks great! I always play motion blur off in every game some that might make a difference on some people saying they are getting motion sick on the ultra wides I am not experiencing any motion sickness with the increase fov from flawless ultrawide and motion blur off.

It's turning out better than I thought, and I've been waiting for a game to satisfy that need for a BioShock/Prey/System Shock title. It also runs surprisingly well for something that released with trash-ass Denuvo.  My major gripe is the mouse acceleration; there's no option to turn it off. A lot of people seem to be bothered with the reduced FOV but it isn't something that's been a gamebreaker for me personally.  All things considered, it's a solid Day 1 release, which says a lot in an industry that's been rife with disappointing releases over the past few years.  EDIT: And after about two or three weeks from release, they patched out the mouse acceleration and fixed the FOV, among other improvements. You won't see too many other devs getting a jump on things that quick. Well done, Mundfish."

2268,Azure Statison,https://steamcommunity.com/id/azstat/,No,,1,18.2,March,1,214,0,1,"While I enjoyed this game I had certain gripes and feelings about it. I'm going to write this review as more of a short essay on the things that the game got right and the things that felt like copies or imitations from other games. I'm going to do this using games like Bioshock and System Shock 2 as pieces to compare with. This will have spoilers that will be marked throughout. I'd like to start by making a broad statement that this game feels as if it were created on game play and the story was secondary and rushed, despite this I, for the most part enjoyed the story as it felt like it was heavily influenced by Bioshock to the point where certain things feel copied almost. I have little qualms with this however because the environment is in stark contrast to Bioshock politico-economically. Bioshock was placed in a purely laissez faire capitalist society, we watch it crumble from the inside. In Atomic Heart we see this story arc applied to an early stage communist dictatorship, I find this to be very interesting as it shows the differences in the political systems, but how the same results can come from such polarizing yet extreme opposites. In Bioshock we find the perils of money and an uncontrollable economy based on Adam. In Atomic Heart we find the perils of a few people being in power under an all adoring public. This comparison to Bioshock does not comprise the entirety of Atomic Hearts story as there are sub plots that attribute to the main story. However in the sense of moving the plot the game utilizes the Bioshock formula and sprinkles its own incredible lore in, as well as creating new character dynamics not quite seen in Bioshock. However most characters are clearly identifiable with their Bioshock counter parts  , but again I found this to be intriguing with the difference in socioeconomic stances the games take and how the characters interact with their world. One thing that starkly differs from Bioshock and SS2 is the voicing of the protagonist, I'm sure this has been stated plenty of times, but the voicing of the main character is downright annoying at times. His catch phrase of ""Crispy Critters"" is said so many times that it looses any meaning and dissolves into a useless chant from the protag whenever he feels slightly annoyed or inconvenienced by anything. If the man could just shut the heck up the game would be like 10% better. There are artsy cut scenes that feel as if they're trying to capture some whimsical essence of godliness or at least constructed faith on the robots end. The robots at times perform ritualistic acts and this feels almost comparative to a religious moment with a good chunk of the odd cutscenes including some one dying or robots sacrificially stabbing each other."
2269,⚓Zalabit🔆,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076073950/,No,,1,21.6,March,1,153,0,1,"So, Atomic Heart.I've been looking at this game ever since the first demos and other videos came out (Yes, the twins enforced the interest). It took me about 20 hours to beat on the highest difficulty, just for rushing through the main path, no exploring or doing anything else. So there's content, that's for sure.Gameplay is pretty good, feels great crushing metal and flesh to pieces with melee weapons, but at higher difficulty it's just better to save as much ammo as possible and learn to dodge, a lot. There are times when you get surrounded and i got myself killed in a blink for that. Looting is pretty unique, you use your glove as a vacuum to empty desks and lockers, and even on the hardest difficulty it's easy to get stocks of ammo and materials if you take your time to loot.Now, if you expect a great story well...yeah it's decent i guess. It's an average Bioshock type of story (the game even makes a little reference to Bioshock at one point). My problem is mostly some ofthe dialogue and the way the twists and info are delivered. The story isn't anything special, and i wish it was handled different.The one thing this game delivers very well is on style tho. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ those are some awesome robot designs in action, from the moustache guys to Natasha and the Belyash (Yes, the twins are hot asf). The game puts all its heart on its robot designs and the way they fight (even if some are incredibly annoying).I just wish they put their heart on the story and characters, because other than the concepts and goals i just couldn't care less for anyone, even the main character.Except granny, such a sweet woman🗿"

( The Twins are big plus.) Performance and graphics wise this game is great. My Frames barely ever dipped below 100 and no glitches or crashes occurred.The Gameplay is fun, the guns feel good, but some sound rather weak. The powers are fun and interesting and allow many for combinations( Apart from the shield). The stealth mechanics are woefully under developed and should either be refined or removed entirely going forward. The Story is interesting and engaging, mostly. There some parts that feel a bit contrived and unnecessary. There is a good amount of mystery and intrigue, and the ending is okay but clearly a deliberate cliffhanger and they had better expand the story in the DLCs. The main character's dialogue is cringe and annoying at times and the voice work is average.My main criticism is that the game doesn't feel very focused, it seems as if they tried to do to many things at once, and while they didn't create something bad but it isn't all that great.PC specs: Intel i7 11700k                RTX 3070ti                32GB RAM                1TB SSD"

But in the later stages you can just tank them.Story: Sucks ass, especially the ending, I did not like it, I think they did this intentionally to sell more DLC. Story starts lacking over time, especially towards the end. Main character gets more annoying over time, but I guess there is plot support for his actions, still annoying tho.Performance: I had one time of memory leak when I had the game open for about 6 hours. Sometimes the dialogue and subtitles bugs out, some emotional plot points only have dialogue with 0 music, I don't know if that is intentional.Overall: 6.5/10, not worth the 80 bucks.

However im afraid thats the only good thing i can say, I was only 80 or so minutes into the game before i had to refund it due to the fact that the game is so random. The game starts off very slow trying to give you a sense of the setting and so the player can look at the graphics. Yet the second the slow part stops the game picks up very very fast. Almost 4 times do you get injured in events where you would have died only to live with barely a scratch, then once u pick yourself up another colossal event occurs ,and i get that the robots have turned and its supposed to be impacting but it is so extreme it takes you out of the immersion. I didnt experience any hiccups in the game like stuttering or any graphic issues and i wouldnt expect to from a game like this. The other big thing was the dialogue. Your character is a prick and he and the glove go back and forth so often durning times where your character is about to die it again takes you out of the immersion. The script is very edgy and sometimes unfollowable, this isnt a spoiler but theres a puzzle you have to solve and after finding the piece no thanks to the very useless guide prompts he says ""put the cookie in, look it even fits like a cookie, glove do you like cookies?"" I tried to enjoy the game after but the game doesnt have a balance of humor it seems to be nothing but it. And even the combat is iffy, the dodge is unresponsive and you cant block until your done with the first half of the game. You get guns but u might aswell not because the ammo is no where to be found. you will probably only have 1 shell in your shotgun at all times and maybe 10 rounds in your ar. Overall i would rate the game 4.9 stars out of 10"

The story is honestly dry and none of the characters are entertaining at all. The main character and his side kick are very annoying and I'd wish they'd just be quite so I can play the game. Not to mention ,most all the female characters are hyper sexualized and unrealisitc. Just look at Halo or Doom, they know how to do a silent protagonist right. The Game play was fun for the first few minutes, but they didn't really add anything new to it, after the first few fights, the combat loop becomes very repetitive and same-y. The game felt like the first several hours was a tutorial that you couldn't escape from, doing fetch quests and collecting items with nothing else to do. I really think there could be a good game here, but there just needs to be more depth to the combat and enemy encounters and more freedom for the player early on instead of being trap in tutorial after tutorial disguised as missions and objectives. I think the only reason this game became as hyped up as it was was for the insane art style and music which are both great positives. If you're just playing for atmosphere then I could recommend the game here, but for everything else, I'd wait for a sale. Personally, I plan on refunding the game and never buying it again, just not worth it."

This may not be for everyone but I do like it myself.Atomic Heart has alot of heart, passion and potential and you can see it really punches above its weight, for a first time studio release you can really see the key details and that take you surprise.  Only some things fall by wayside, but there should be no shadow of doubt the that next possible game you could see from Mundfish (if they do make another game) would hopefully learn from this and make an even better game.  I do believe the hype train was a bit much but so far it has not disappointed, the mixed reviews are possibly a result of this, announcing a title that people have to wait for years on brings on alot of expectations and then finally broken promises, somethings just don't work out as i have seen during gameplay and trailers.As I have waited years for this it does bring a breath of fresh air, the controls take a while to get used to but after a couple of hours you will be blasting robots sending them backwards into pieces and it does not get old.8/10 Good effort chaps certainly better effort from what has come out at least in the past 2 years by massive developers and publishers companies.After finishing the game it only occurred to me when watching previous trailers that the game seemed very challenging, however (minor spoilers) the first arena boss you go to take out I did not die once and on hard mode, its seems to me that the devs turned down the difficulty massively after reading a lot of comments on how ""squishy"" the enemies are (even though they are robots), the devs did mention on how you have to learn a dance with them and that sort of thing i do enjoy, but was a bit let down when i mopped the floor with it.   If you are looking at comments Mundfish please add a new game + with the original difficultly because mid to late game I  hardly had any issues smashing may way through the game."

The gameplay kept me hooked, but the protagonist made me refund it.Honestly, It's pretty solid. Shooting feels good, as far as I could tell. Ammo was on the scarcer side, which meant I couldn't just rely on my guns. Collecting, scanning & getting around was pretty fun.Melee is a bit of a mixed bag, the axe is a fun to use weapon, it feels like there's a ton of impact. The knockdown mechanic is pretty annoying, until you learn to dodge it properly. It will get you wombo-combo'd at least once.Honestly, ran quite well. It did take a bit to install the shaders, but just leave that to do it's thing. Looks amazing, effects are believable and I was very immersed. The landscapes, architecture, NPC's, foliage, I could genuinely go on. It is a stunning game.The main. F-cking. Character.I'm willing to accept that not everyone is a bundle of joy, spewing the most vile form of happiness over every piece of dialogue they encounter in life.But this man is the opposite side of that coin.I could hardly count the number of F-bombs he dropped in the span of my playtime, constantly insulting & berating every-single-animate-thing around him. He honestly sounds like a 15 year old, who just discovered what swearing is.Combined with a completely asinine attitude for everything around him, even if they genuinely just try and help him, is annoying to such a degree, it made me return this game.

Despite minor shortcomings in game design, the story is amazing with its twists and is something worth experiencing in its native Russian language to fully appreciate the tone of the storytelling (avoid the English dub).The game is one of the best showcases of art direction in video games that I've seen. It's a great blend of old Soviet-era architecture with modern brutalist design that really fits with the aesthetic the game is going for. Not to mention the many creative choices the game makes.I can't praise the soundtrack enough. While Mick Gordon deserves high praise for his frantic riffs and jaw-dropping beats, the game also showcases remixes of old Russian era artists and utilizes classical music choices in creative ways that were really surprising at points in the game.In conclusion, I commend the developers for their effort in creating this amazing piece of work.

2349,John Titor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hendrix777/,No,,1,39.2,February,25,293,0,1,"So far it's a great FPS. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but maintains the course over a bumpy road. Graphics are slick, impressive visuals (even tho the promised RTX Ray Tracing is not available upon release), and an amazing atmosphere. Atomic Heart has a great theme, environment, enemy design and soundtrack. It's got me hooked and I'm enjoying playing it.I love the environment (which is what hooked me since I saw the original concept trailer many years ago). The atmosphere and overall theme is a great addition to the FPS genre.Sound is alright, nothing mind blowing as in new sounds or audio. The tinny sound to the robot voices has been done before in the sci-fi genre. The music is awesome tho.Puzzles are nothing too complex or stroke inducing. Sometimes it's kinda confusing as to what needs to be done, or how to traverse the next obstacle. The jumping mechanics and platforming could of needed some more tweaking, but it ""works"" as is. The game does have it's minor bugs, being mechanical or visual. I've seen reports from others about some being game breaking, but I have yet to encounter one. I can't tell sometimes if some of the ""bugs"" I run into is actually intended. Like the TV's not playing any video on some TV's but working flawlessly on others. I mean is the TV broken or is it just not properly playing the video. Also the videos on some of the skills and items say ""no video available"" or ""cant play"" or whatever. Is this intentional? Also the  item collection can be janky. I know there are items I can't grab and left in filing cabinets due to this mechanic. i wish there were more weapons than the . Would be cool if the future DLCs include some more flashy advanced guns or lasers. The powers are cool tho. The English voice acting is horrendous. I suggest switching it over to Russian w/ eng subtitles. The dialog still leaves something to be desired tho. If they plan on in the future doing a sequel or another game I hope they hire new writers. I can't stand this quirky soyboy persona in the main character. At least the Russian voice lines ""sound"" tougher. Overall it's a great game from a small studio. Good job!8/10 - would fund war-crimes again."

It is dumb that the devs don't have an FOV slider in the game, but the solution is to download a program called Flawless Widescreen. Fixes the problem pretty much immediately.POST GAME UPDATE: Review will stay positive. The combat is very fluid and fun, the music is amazing with tons of different styles of song, and the story is pretty good, but brings nothing new to the table. The biggest complaint I have is that sometimes dialogue will be cut off when you walk into another room with something scripted, or more important dialogue. I played with the english dub, and the lines in the beginning are somewhat cringe-worthy, I found it grew on me quite quickly, and found myself laughing at his ""Don't give a ♥♥♥♥"" attitude and dialogue lines. Will do another play through and will return for DLC.Edit 2: Since the latest patch, you do not need to use flawless widescreen anymore. They have added an FOV slider."

Art direction, stellar! Gunplay, very fun! World Building, very good! But where the game drops is in its lack of polish, variety of enemies and abit of a lacklustre story. I know the bad voice acting gets alot of funny clips but I was kinda numb to it by the end of the game and it almost became an unintentional comedy. The game doesn't offer much in terms of replay value so I wouldn't recommend it at full price. Hopefully if they add a NG+ I will come back, but for now its unlikely."

As you play through, you may have to make few judgement calls by yourself, and you have ""choices"" that will matter with the ending as well. Decision-making can sometimes be difficult, but that's why you should talk to every corpse and read every mails. Yes... I am serious, you can talk to corpses, gather clues or have a bit of chit-chat as your journey is mostly filled with robots that do not want to be intergraded with you, while some leafy-faced monsters want to have a fresh lunch.Combat systems are smart and exciting, and your enemies, aka, robots, they're not on power-preserve mode either, they're smart, they will dodge your heavy attacks, etc, but as humans, we must play smarter and better. Before you mindlessly swing your melee non-stop and gun blazing, observe the robot attack patterns, and make good use of dodge systems.Music pace will change as you go full commando mode in open area with high alert levels or multiple enemies, and boss fight music will get you in full adrenaline mode.Crafting systems is just as good as Fallout, every resource, from ammo to metal pieces you've been collecting, they all will come in handy and you always can't have enough of them. Be sure to pay visit to the fridge mommy, aka Nora, to upgrade your arsenals.Unlock abilities while improving your character, as you walk past trails of robot junks, be sure to always salvage anything from them with your Glove. I managed to max out my character's hp and get him deep pockets, turning him into a freaky god-mighty Jedi.Inventory systems is similar to Resident Evil 4, as you can manage your consumables, ammo, and guns in a limited space, which can be increased thanks to fridge mommy. Do not worry about carrying too much items, as any loot you collected when you have no pockets, they will be automatically sent to fridge mommy's storage.Smart saving systems, they will always be near Fridge Mommy, and always save for you before a boss fight.And no, you Cripsy Critters! YOU CANNOT INTERGRADE WITH THE TWINS, STOP!TWINS ARE TEMPORARY, FRIDGE MOMMY AND AK NANNY ARE FOREVER!"

The level design, while straightforward, has a lot of really cool details. It's very immersive and engaging......which is what I WOULD say if the game didn't have NONSTOP, CONSTANT, AWFUL CRINGEY DIALOGUE. Like, LITERALLY non-stop. The main character and his assistant (think Navi from Zelda, or the Cuff from Forspoken) DO NOT EVER SHUT UP. In fact, the main is literally constantly telling the assistant to please just shut up. BUT NEITHER OF THEM EVER DO.It's just constant, empty prattling. It's SO, SO badly immersion breaking, SO disruptive, SO unfunny, and just SO unnecessary! All of it! The game would literally be 100x better if they just hit ctrl-a on the dialogue and deleted all of it. Let the player figure out things for themselves, let them just explore and play the damn game. I wanted to like this game, but the constant dialogue was so distracting and downright stupid. The devs actively shot themselves in the foot with this horrible design choice.Beyond having a literal THIRTY-MINUTE INTRO SEQUENCE (which is gorgeous and really cool at first, but its luster very quickly wears off), the game itself is fine. Quite enjoyable. But I absolutely could not get past the non-stop distracting dialogue. It actively ruined the game for me."

2369,Jonnii,https://steamcommunity.com/id/EatABagOfDice/,No,,1,28.6,March,21,833,0,1,"Honestly conflicted as to whether I wanted to give this game a yes or no recommendation. The game has its upsides, but it honestly feels like it has just as many downsides. This review may change depending on how the eventual DLC handles any post-story content.The pros:-Interesting setting-Somewhat fun and gory gameplay/story elements-Thicc ballerina bots-Some actually interesting puzzles built in as proving grounds-An eerie atmosphere that actually made me jump a few times when playing with headphones on-A protagonist that is completely hated by everyone but starts to make sense as the game progresses (I know, he annoyed me too at first, but the story started to make sense of why he acts the way he does. I'd be interested to see if his personality is any different in DLC since he sort of grows as a character over time.)The cons:-A handful a overly repeated enemies and mid-bosses-An ""open world"" that's really just a hub world to ferry you from one instance to another and mostly acts as bloat, only being useful for trinket collecting since the rest of the world is void of life outside of bots.-Weapons that end up becoming either useless immediately, or OP too quickly.-Whatever the first limbo experience is - no seriously, why am I collecting floating apples?-A story that does have interesting parts and twists, but is overall predictable and overdone.-Weird bugs. For me I literally got stuck on anything and everything. Bots could force me into walls, jumping over anything almost guaranteed I was trapped in a jumping/running animation until enough button mashing/RNG decided to free me from the object, etc.Final verdict:Play it if you can get it for a bit of sale since the main story is really only around 15 hours and fully completing the game is both exhausting from the bloated collection achievements and the bugged atomic heart ending (as of this writing at least, look it up.) Also play it if you really are a fan of Bioshock games. Is it Bioshock? No, but it feels pretty close to the games which is what kept me going. Final thoughts:Honestly, I think this game would have been even better had they done away with the weird hub world and just hid the proving grounds in various levels that you progress through. Not every game needs an open world, especially when the open world feels so empty and boring. Also, do we really need multiple variations of the same enemies? Even just using an actual different skin on some of them could have helped the game feel a little more robust. We also get left with some unanswered questions which wasn't too fun, maybe DLC will explain it, things such as   Either way, the game was interesting enough for me to beat it, but I don't think I'll waste time collecting everything for the achievements."

2380,TheDaemonAuriel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDaemonAuriel/,13,3,0,24.8,February,25,336,0,1,"The game barely scratches the surface of fun in some areas. But don't be fooled by the screenshots and videos. This isn't a shooter or a hack and slash. This is a puzzle game with some combat mechanics thrown in. It forces you to play stealth transitioning between area's because there are with tons of camera's and repair bots that spawn endlessly and manage a GTA type threat level, leaving you with the only option to sneak to your objective at which point you can go back to playing the way you want to e.g. Stealth, melee, shooting. I think the Video previews and stuff did a bad job of presenting that and making the game look a lot more action packed then it actually is.Story and dialog seems very dry and not engaging at all at some points your forced to follow bugging bots rambling on about nonsense you can't even loot or upgrade while they blabber because it will pause them and they will wait for you to return. Talking to the dead seems dull and meaningless as they rarely have anything useful to say and again just seem to ramble on and on about nothing important or engaging."

Its clear they've moved on from that focus towards a more open ended and maybe linear approach. 25 hours of content and calling itself a open world seems odd. The game looks very nice though! But in the end, i think i've seen more then enough apocalyptic games that either feature Russia/or soviet. America. Etc. Theme wise its not that very unique.The intro lasts quite long, even if you want to walk straight through it. It actually just got me bored to play the actual game in the first place. When i finally met the actual gameplay. I just somewhat noped out, its too arcadey . Maybe in the far future i'll get it.

Even if you switch to easy mode, this game is for able-bodied people only.To get new weapons you have to build them, but coming across the parts is so slow that you find a schematic, but can't build it until well after it would have been useful in your progression. You either get enough parts to build weapons, or enough to keep your ammo stocked, but never both.You can't run, only jog with a half-jump forward every other second.

However...Be prepared, this game is a console-port guys. The PC controls are lazily designed, you can't even remap some of the keys, there are quicktime events during combat, the game explains to you some of the combat mechanics, but it does not explain to you the puzzle mechanics at all. The FOV is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage.It runs fairly well, some frame-drops, but it's fairly stable.No exclusive fullscreen mode ofc, so the performance will be already worse because of that.The numeric keys display some performance meters I don't care about, that should not happen.There is no sprinting. In an FPS in 2023...These guys need to take lessons before developing their next game.The dialogues are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible.This is nothing like Bioshock, well, except the festering pile of ♥♥♥♥♥ controls, it's more like Prey and Half-Life.If you can endure all these very lame and lazy design-decisions, or I guess oversights, buy the game.Otherwise do not buy this game, the game-design is terrible, the controls are lazy, the dialogues are annoying.Just finished the game.The WASD keys for driving are non-rebindable, and the , which means you  with a vehicle!There are , the last boss-fight , and if you fail it, you die, you need to load your last save.There is no run button with keyboard, although sometimes I felt I was running, sometimes I have walked.In terms of mechanics, this is definitely one of the worst fps games I have ever played.

I was totally flabbergasted by the amazing intro and the sheer detail of the game world.  Atomic Heart is not just a shooter but a puzzle game too with stealth elements.  Between the clever lever, candle and magnetic switch puzzles to the mini-game locks on doors there is no shortage of having to use your brain.That being said the FOV is an issue for some, not for me.  Melee combat is clunky and the constant need to collect scraps to upgrade weapons faster can be a grind.  Levels inside buildings are pretty linear but outside that we are gifted with large, well rendered environments. The game suffers from brutally written and poorly done protagonist. Personally I find glove pal Charlie more entertaining.  They just had to make P3 into that cliche, duke nukem type figure that almost every other FPS game is guilty of. Some of the beginning game is a slog fetching canisters and various keys to progress but the concept more than makes up for it.  So while Atomic Heart does have its share of flaws like any title, its a great game that I would say brings something new to a gaming segment that I haven't experienced before."

Combat is a constant chore, none of the powers so far are that interesting, or seem to have great affect, and though I usually seek games with dodge mechanics, the one in this game is just frustrating. 6 hours in and I cant say I've had ""fun"" while playing. Even the protagonist is constantly commenting about how frustrating the game is. The world building is alright, and the setting is fairly interesting, but comparing this to Bioshock would be an insult to Bioshock.So far the story is mediocre at best. The protagonist is pretty unlikable, and seems to have a constant stick up his ass, which makes it hard to relate and get into the story or whatever mission I am supposed to be doing.Gonna keep slogging through over time, but only becuz I've missed the refund window."

If you can get past the absolutely stupid political stuff, and take the game and story for what they are, a game about an alternate reality, it's a very fun, fairly bug-free good tribute to Bioshock. With other game inspirations mixed in. There's a TON of corny references to everything with equally as many cringy lines that I could personally give or take, but it definitely gives the game it's own personality. As for the political garbage, feel free to try to debate it here. But personally, I think it's a game.  So politics shouldn't be a part of it, you should just have fun and play it. I'd definitely pick this game up, because for the 16 hours I've played it so far, it's really fun."

Just so much more talking compared to what was shown. Almost feels a lil weird for me to say that but I wish it had less talkingAlso it really holds your hand. So far its opening is taking twice as long as bioshock infinite. It's not even teaching you much, just very slowly teasing you with the world to the point where you get bored and just ignore the dialogAnd the FOV is trash. Had to use flawless widescreen to fix it a lil but tends to make it crashOh and jesus the main character says ""Crispy Critters!"" whenever something happens. Its so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying.

Also the fact that the upgrade machine is constantly acting like I'm its ""master"" and its just down bad for the main character is definitely an interesting choice but still quite funny none the less.now I know a lot of other reviewers have had very mixed feelings about the game and I mean, some of them I can understand, but a lot of them are just kinda dumb and more down to personal preference or the fact they kind of just rushed through the game and didn't pay attention to most of the dialogue that literally tells you everything you need to know and especially when it comes to the puzzles which by the way, aren't as hard to do as a lot of people say they are and if you can't figure them out then clearly, you are potato brained.But anyway I am really enjoying this game and I hope you do too :)Update: I finished the game today (22/2/23) and man what an amazing and weird experience it has been, I had so much fun and I'm definitely going to be replaying it a bunch!"

The flow of the game is solid though some achievements only seem to track from session to session as in they reset like the chirpers and or talking to the dead folks (I am hoping this gets fixed as I would like to perfect this).

There are too plenty of enemies who soak way too much damage and get constantly repaired by flying bots, so fighting is completely useless.The testing facilities started of nice, but for me, they got too frustrating over time as making a minor mistake when climbing or now being sure whether the character can make a jump can lead to having to repeat a prolonged section of a climb over and over again. I once even failed to to my character randomly rolling after landing and therefore falling over the ledge. The story is not interesting enough to continue for me."

2549,Https://BeaverFeaver.com,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198176027445/,2,,1,19.6,March,4,67,0,1,"Overall This is one of the best games I have ever played, followed closely by Dying Light, it has a very open but a very constructed story line with little choices but still overall a very good game. The game is enough of a challenge where you wont get bored, and at most a heavily packed area, or a boss fight, should only take you a few attempts to beat, which keeps the game engaging. During my entire play through of the game, there was so much more to explore than just what the campaign leads you to do. Overall a very good game. To mention also, that the game was ""canceled"" for being pro Russian and anti-Ukraine, I saw nothing that was pro anyone in the game, despite the setting of the game being Russian, if anything they should be praised for what they have done, and the way they set it, call me a crazy person, but this game has meaning.--Its a good idea to keep in mind that there is no level system, but there is a progression system, in which you are rewarded certain weapons, for exploring certain places. Which leads into scavenging, a very important part of the game, which without, makes the game very difficult, as its the main way to get good weapons, and a variety of resources to craft upgrades, bullets, weapons, canisters and much more.-- Atomic Heart's settingThe setting that is used in Atomic Heart is INCREDIBLE to say the least, their attention to detail is top notch, and unmatched, they have easter eggs hidden everywhere, and every detail is to the finest quality. They, unlike many other games, don't go for a grand huge approach, but a tight and cramped, dystopian feel. It is a good point to mention that it is not necessary to play this game on maximum quality for the game to have the same level of detail and immersion, as most of the changeable setting effect the shading, and other small details, like blades of grass. Another fair point to mention is that as you progress on in the game, that the level of detail only increases, and never decreases, unlike Disney movies. --Click bait in ATOMIC HEARTWhen recommending this game to friends, many of them inquired about the twins, Left and Right, and their appearance in the game, without trying to spoil, the twins don't show up all that much in comparison to the amount of time that the game takes to complete. Although the twins have a lower screen time than other robots, they were still heavily advertised.--Action in Atomic HeartI was at first hesitant to spend money on the game as I saw the ads, and some other people playing the game and I didn't know if I would like close quarters combat, but in the end it turned out to provide a level of difficulty that is very different from other games that I am used to playing. A very important to combat in this game is resistances and weaknesses, every enemy that you fight will take more damage from specific weapons or skills, and less from others. Which leads into the next point, which is Charles, your custom glove, that has lightning powers, and many others, like freezing, shields, levitating enemies, and more. Its also a good point to mention that as you install mods (or upgrades) on weapons, they change their appearance, damage, recoil, aim speed, fire rate, plus some.--Puzzles in Atomic HeartThey are easy once you figure them out, its just a lot of trial and error, but each one is made very well, although the same type of puzzle is used multiple times, its a new adventure after and every puzzle. --Post Campaign in Atomic HeartAfter you beat the campaign in Atomic Heart, there is still a LOT to do, for example, there are factories that you can ---After wordsI highly suggest that you should but this game, streamer or not, this is one of the best games that I have played and the threat of being ""canceled"" is not worth skipping out on this game. If we want more games to be this real, and immersive, then we need to support the people that make games like it. This is a masterpiece of a game that I had been following for quite some time. This game is one that hits different, and is one of the only fps games that have what I see to be meaning, even in both of the two endings.My specs while playing gpu - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080cpu - Intel Core i9-10900F -2.8GHZram - 32GB DDr4 3200MHzssdOS - windows 11 pro"

It's a real shame that it was released at a time where actual Russia is doing some very unspeakable things to another country ( Ukraine ) but I can't find it logical to hold a Game Studio responsible for Russian Misbehavior ( Putin ) therefor I give this game a 4 out of 5 star rating and very much enjoy almost everything. The only thing I find lacking is ( RTX ) and ( FOV adjustments ) which you would think a game of this magnitude would offer both of these options.We are now living in an RTX era like it or not and we are also in an era where at least 1 out of 5 gamers are gaming in ultrawide so It really blows my mind that game developers aren't giving more support options for ultrawide gaming like ( fov adjustments ) other than these two gripes I found the game to be extremely well optimized and very very fun!!!Just be clear Atomic Heart does offer Ultrawide support just they do not offer FoV Adjustments. If you want any type of FoV Adjustments you have to download Flawless widescreen which is a 3rd party software. Don't get me wrong flawless widescreen is a great software for many games I just personally don't understand why in this day and age we aren't getting these settings in-game with the amount of money I spend on these games ( $70 minimum ) I should get every damn setting necessary to run an ultrawide monitor with ease and I should not have to depend on 3rd party software devs to make my gaming experience a better one. But thank god they do care and they do develop these settings for gamers everywhere.*Shout out to Flawless Widescreen*
2568,Bob'sTutsiRolls,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSickestTurtle/,13,,0,9.0,March,5,306,0,1,"Game starts off fine, but quickly falls off. Eventually you get to a pretty open area that you can freely explore, but the game has almost no checkpoints anywhere. They're almost entirely fixed locations that are too far spread out, so dying means replaying 20 or so minutes of the game all over again. This wouldn't be such a big deal to me if I wasn't constantly dying to things that are out of my control such as getting stuck on the environment. This happens a lot. Try to climb a crate or over a rock? Get stuck in mid air and have to reload that checkpoint that was 20 minutes ago. Fighting enemies can cause similar issues. They can either pin you somewhere that you can't get out of or they can knock you into a pile of chairs where you get stuck in mid air again and then have to reload or die. It didn't feel so bad in the early game because the manual save stations are close enough. It becomes so much worse in the open world sections. Atomic Heart has other issues as well such as the main character and pretty much most of the dialogue being painful to listen to. It feels like if Bullet Storm tried to take itself seriously at all. That's this games script. Just immature, cringe worthy garbage written by toddlers, but expected to be taken seriously in most cases. Only positive things I can say about Atomic heart is that while the game isn't being annoying, the combat is pretty fun. Also, it's super well optimized. This game just runs with no issue at all. It's a shame I can't be bothered to finish it. I'd be interested if they added more checkpoints and fixed collision issues that led to me losing so much progress constantly"

For those of us actively participating in the ""Cold War"" conflict can appreciate the sentiment and artwork reflective of that time, even though we were the opposition.

Only other gripe is the constant repairing of enemies as you kill them from the little flying guys. Doesn't feel like the game really gives you a chance to explore and forces you to move as fast as possible to collect what you can before you run out of ammo. And if you have played this at all, you'll understand that melee works well, but when there is 15 enemies that are tanky af and resistant to melee, it becomes a constant dash, smack, dash fest. Not really that engaging. Hopefully this game gets some DLC or some kind of revamp as time goes on. Not too confident in that though."

Immersion, world building, concept, and sound design are pushing the envelope to further reaches. Cool psychic abilities combined with guns are fun to use. Are you willing to overlook it not being a billion dollar Assassins Creed reskin? Might you want to enjoy some innovative and aesthetically fascinating world immersion designed by passionate and creative PC up-and-comers? Are you interested in games that really test around the limits of what is possible in this medium? Check it out.I personally loved it. Played through it, not perfect but still enjoyed it more than most things. Some people say it's janky garbage, too talky. I'm going to just kind of let my hair down and say... yeah... big disagree buddies. Big disagree. Kinda seems ""tasteless tier."" I loved the art, the sound design, and found the gameplay got a LOT more fun once I had some more polymer skills unlocked a few hours into it. There really aren't many games like it... Metro? Bioshock? This game is operating on a large, outdoors+indoors scale. Bioshock aint. Metro is great, but it's extremely on-rails.I can't help but already feel a sort of nostalgia for my first time roaming around the outdoors... the sounds of the robots... the bizarre flower cameras... just trying to see if I'd survive to the next area. So much mystery around every corner. It really is one of those ""man, I wish I could experience again for the first time"" things. What I'm saying is, don't take it for granted. The FUD around this game seems to be very amplified and overstated - don't listen to it. It's a great game and if you're enjoying it, let yourself go all out with it. Explore, take your time, and recognize that you're playing something pretty special.Seriously, I can still feel that feeling I first had going outdoors and hearing the bizarre sounds of the robots in the distance. There's nothing quite like it. Bioshock, System Shock 2, Prey, Deus Ex, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Thief 2, Fallout NV, Half Life 2, Far Cry 1-5... I'm seeing Atom Heart contrasted (often negatively) with some of these. These comparisons are fair, but missing the mark and selling Atomic Heart down the river. What I'm trying to get at, is that Atomic Heart is something just a lil-bit new. Sure, it's no genre revolution. That said, it ain't no copy-paste. It's more of an evo-lution. And that's a fact.OK, Dying Light is a solid comparison. But Atomic Heart is intricately and passionately designed in every detail. Dying Light is a solid if not excellent series, but I do think it suffers from ""Far Cry Syndrome."" Atomic Heart has more in common with the Half Life philosophy than the Far Cry philosophy. And that's a really, really good thing.Overall the entire experience is pretty grand. It's kind of like the film Children of Men, or 28 Days Later, for reference. You go through a large world, facility to facility. Much of it is indoors, much outdoors, but all tied together very well. You grow to be very IMMERSED in the experience and the design of the environment and world-building becomes somewhat unparalleled.That said, I do have a big personal soft spot for this kind of aestheticism, as well as for the immersive sim genre overall. Atomic Heart is a mid immersive sim in terms of the game mechanics, but it's overall world building and atmosphere is so well thought out and executed that it somehow catapults it into the upper echelon of the genre.If you are the sort of person who doesn't care if something is ""muh janky"" so long as it excels in certain other areas - particularly immersion and world building - and you love a good bit of futuristic science fiction ... what are you even waiting for, man...*that said, it is flawed. there are some parts that actually kind of suck, a lot like parts of Half Life 1 that suck, and pretty much every classic game. I'd say the parts of this game that suck are the ""doggone"" hallucination climbing sections toward the end. No fan. The story falls off slightly at times (the ending is ok), but overall the first 2/3rds of the game are significantly better. The open world is somewhat under-used but I don't really care... it's kind of like linear.5, if you know what I mean. The game opens up into large areas that you can explore, but its ultimately linear. the ending is too abrupt. gameplay gets a touch repetitive in areas toward the ending. Those are my primary criticisms. I actually like that the game is streamlined and not bloated open world crap, though. Better that way. I'd replay it."

Fun, check.While this has a few rough edges it's overshadowed by fun game play and somewhat rewarding exploration. really my only issue with the exploration is that I wish there was more of it, like being able to enter any building even by puzzle would have been nice. also, the puzzles were pretty good to be honest, not too hard but just hard enough to make you think. I also really love visual weapon upgrades in games and I'm so happy that's all here. I do however wish it would have ditched the open world design for more of a linear path maybe with backtracking à la metroidvania.Now for the only thing keeping this from being a 9 out of 10. The dialog is almost so bad its good with most of it being ok and other times being just downright obnoxious. but over all I found myself entertained by it. As for the Bioshock comparisons, I would say its very inspired but not quite a spiritual successor, it is a pretty good immersive sim at the very least. while it will occasionally stray from the immersive sim format is starts to get back on track pretty quickly to where I hardly even noticed it straying. All in all I loved it and I really hope there will be a sequel."

Sort of, the game is fun but it does suffer from some flaws. First of all i wanna start with the good parts, the game looks very nice and runs very well which is the first game that released this year i played that actually did (Dead Space and Hogwarts both had pretty big performance issues). The gameplay itself is fun, at least for me, i know some people find it repetitive but for me it does capture the feeling of the old bioshock games rather well. That being said i do have to mention that the only gripe i have with the gameplay itself are the plethora of jumping puzzles and the checkpoint system because both of them are GOD AWFUL especially in combination with each other, make sure that you save often and use every save station you find.Something i have no problems with at all however is the music and overall design of the game, mike gordon and the rest of the music team did a fantastic job creating wonderfully fitting tracks for combat and the over all environment. Same goes for the artstyle of the game, its very atmospheric and immersive, really nailing that future soviet union look. Now if the gameplay and design are fine for the most part what about the story? Its not terrible but also not great, just very very average, predictable, full of cliche and tropes with a rather unsatisfying ending. The voice acting can be hit or miss, personally i did not find the main character as annoying as some people claim him to be but other voiced characters could definitely need some more work alongside the cutscenes which often seem stiff and a bit unpolished at times. Now i certainly had fun with the game but even going around trying to explore everything and grabbing as many achievements on the way as i could, it took me roughly 24 hours for my first run, ive heard some people say it took them between 12-15 hours to finish a run when just doing the story so i dont think its worth the 60 dollars asking price, if you can grab it on sale i would recommend it and even more so if you are a bioshock fan. For now though just wait, its good yes but nothing world changing so you wont really miss out if you dont play it either."

It did give me directions, but I felt like they're oftentimes wrong; I haven't had to check the proper way of advancement on YouTube this many times for ages, simply because in many cases, the game didn't explain correctly what to do. The lock picking sequence for instance was a nightmare. And my biggest problem with the game, the protagonist himself, who's practically the same character as the girl from Forspoken and should get the same treatment. He's constantly talking ♥♥♥♥, spams ""♥♥♥♥"" because that's hahasofunny, and repeats a cringey phase over and over again, hoping it's gonna stick into the player's head like certain catchphrases from a '80s action movie, but no, it's just annoying.

It's campy as hell, awkwardly timed (sentences often cut off as game events play out and some dialog initiates strangely - almost as if there should have been something said just prior that was cut out.)  Additionally the constant praise of communist Russia is quite cringe.Platforming controls are not great either.  Climbing is sluggish and leaping to other ledges does work, but it just feels off.Unfortunately steam ratings are only recommend or don't recommend.  I don't believe the game is terrible, but it's not great either.   A 6.5 on a scale of 1-10.  With a silent protagonist mod, and maybe removal of some of the heavy handed propaganda praising old world fascist regimes, it could be an 8.  Or hell, maybe even just a re-recording of voice lines so they arent so awkwardly paced.  (Though beating up robots that resemble Hitler and defiling the corpses of communist rats IS pretty fun!)"

With your main character being a persistently-furious man who lashes out at friend and foe alike with endless streams of insults and retorts, you have little room to feel attached to him. The story itself also follows a rather linear (for the first few hours, at least) path of pursuing one man who's branded himself the enemy of the Soviet Union.Perhaps the game develops more down the line, and maybe the plot grows more interesting, but I sadly do not see enough here for me to find initial investment in."

The gameplay itself is tedious and boring. Combat feels janky and gets old fast. Its like the devs spent most of their time making sure the ballerinas were hot instead of actually making the game good. The story itself is so dry and its conclusion leaves much to be desired. Sounds good in concept but completely fails in execution.

(it was the walking nervous system boss) all in all 9.5 out of ten my only complaint is that this game didnt have the 6 hour robo mommy s** cutscene.ps its cannon you can ♥♥♥♥ them. listen to dialog in the theater"

From the moment the game gets going it throws you into the thick of it bathing us in blood and gears from elaborately designed robots to solving ""first-person"" puzzles. Atomic Heart has many things going for it right now and sadly... a few bad things. Below I will state the goods so far and the bads, so let's get to it!So far, I think Atomic Heart is not a let down. It has been a bit ""overhyped"" in my opinion but that does not stop me enjoying the game. I would personally rate it a solid 7-8/10 so far. I also recorded gameplay and uploaded it to youtube:  I am looking forward to playing more and ignore all these people saying the ""money is funding a war""... fake/false news.⚫Its somewhat of a tough game, atleast... for me it is and that is good. Means I have a challenge and not just some easy, lean by game that I will breeze through in less than 10 hours and feel depressed that I spent £80 on.⚫There are elaborately designed enemies, both biological and robotic to keep you on your feet at all times⚫You can play how YOU want to play and if you make a mistake buying a ""skill"" THERE IS NO PENALTY for refunding that skill to try a ""different build""!!! FANTASTIC!!⚫The Story is cut from the same cloth as BioShock and Wolfenstein - an Alternate-History shooter. You can also see the inspiration from Half-Life and the puzzle-solving from Portal in here too. (and an attempted first-person stealth from Arkane, which kinda falls short)⚫The visual design of Atomic Heart is astonishing. From ballerina bots to moustachioed evil terminator like butler bots that never leave you alone. Also, you can see one that looks like BAYMAX cosplaying a tank hahaha.⚫The aesthetics of Atomic Heart is also outstanding. The details of the ruined labs, facilities, transport hubs and just in general buildings make the world feel real. E.X each gun has different reload animations based on bullets in the magazine too, one flicked away and the other grasped and then replaced with a fresh one.⚫The main character P-3 is so foul mouthed and amnestic... its a bit of a relic of games gone by. He is funny but he falls short also, its this and his glove charles that kept me interested in him.⚫I do not think I personally had any technical or graphical issues whatsoever. I am playing on a 4090 so that could be why but then again... 4090's are new and unstable on majority of games just now.⚫The main character P-3 is very weak alone.  Its ""tone deaf"" for weak game design. He rubs off as the ""cookie-cutter American lead of every shooter ever made"". P-3 constantly swears with the gusto of a teenager testing every single curse word he has recently learned. Its so exhausting sometimes and the fact that it is supposed to be 1950? correct? It ruins the immersion into this ""cold war era"".⚫The melee combat needed more love. It is kinda slow and clunky at times, felt like I was dragging a sledgehammer around at all times with me. Like, no combos for melee at all and NO BLOCKING???? WHAT????⚫Some things in the game are indestructible. Like balloons. How can my 10 tonne axe not destroy a balloon? ⚫The HUD... sometimes this was completely cluttered with USELESS nonsense that ruined the game for me with pick-up notifications and the health bars from ""mini-bosses"""

The loot mechanic of having to constantly hold F is horrible design, with lengthy animation and slow walking, having to constantly press it again for missed loot, as well as control is taken away from my character way too often through attacks or constant cutscenes. It feels cumbersome to play, if the experience keeps up I hope it's a short one. A few different game design choices would have made a huge impact in experience."

Gameplay wise it's decent, even good at times. But the world is a lot smaller than I anticipated for a game that has been in development for this long. The direction you are given in the world is also lackluster and I missed an entire area because there was no reason to go there at any point and it was quite far from the ""main path"".Now to the spoiler heavy part which also is the reason for me making this review and it being negative. The 2 ending choices you have are essentially no ending at all or ""the guy who tried to wipe out capitalism was the better choice for humanity after all"" because of the twist at the end. This is actual USSR propaganda. The entire game is littered with it, mainly with the main character bootlicking it througout the game which I first didn't think much of since I assumed the plot would be about him realizing how everything that's happening is the fault of the whole secret atomic heart project that revolves around communism vs capitalism and turning against the communistic bootlicking at some point but it never happened. I don't care for either side of the politics or whatever, I was just not expecting to end up spending 60€ on USSR/communism propaganda."

The weapons and powers you obtain are all fun to use and the customization is nice but where the game falls flat is literally everything else. The ""open world"" isn't particularly rewarding or fun to explore. The English voice acting, translation and delivery of said lines is VERY rough combined with the random bits of missing audio.

My gripes are with dialogue as it feels like its all was spoken as line reads and not conversations. Ive had alot of audio just abruptly cut off mid sentence, subtitles dont match hardly at all and I have ran into a few bugs now that have lead into soft locks (most recent is the throw function just not working in a puzzle you need to throw things) Im hoping they fix the obviously fixable issues and take the skills they learned into their next game.

2749,SynDyne,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Syn-Dyne/,4,,0,9.5,March,1,424,0,1,"Premise neat, setting neat, game beautiful... mostly.This game is infuriating. I can kill any enemy I can encounter on Armageddon difficulty, it is hard, but I can do it. But what's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ point of doing that when the enemy just gets revived in less than 20 seconds in Open World sections? Ammo is most certainly not plentiful, so using it sparingly would be the wise thing to do... that is if you weren't constantly swarmed with flying enemies, just out of harm's reach of your melee. And it doesn't help that resources needed for crafting (the more advanced resources at least) are not common enough to make upgrading weapons AND crafting ammo viable. And why so few resources? Am I playing the original Resident Evil's?Guns are fine, just not enough ammo for the spongy enemies, and melee kinda sucks like most games, so that doesn't bother me too much. Powers are kinda meh.The movement kinda sucks. You are restricted to a decent jogging pace, so if you enjoy the freedom of movement, stay away. The closest you will get to running are the dashes that are meant for dodging attacks, or cheesing the parkour (if you can call it that?) system.I read the Digital Artbook at the very start when the game was compiling shaders, so I kinda knew why the player character acted the way he does before I got into the game, which probably helped me from hating him.There is no FOV slider, so if that's a thing you want, you will have to wait for the next update.The Premise and setting of the game are fantastic though, everywhere looks beautiful... However it is ruined in my opinion by Temporal Anti-Aliasing. I don't know why developers are moving towards this system, is it cheaper? easier? or uses less computer resources? Either way it makes all movement blurry as ♥♥♥♥, and I have motion blur turned off. And turning it off makes the textures of everything look like ♥♥♥♥, so leaving it off doesn't help either.I would say try the game and refund it at the very least if you don't like it. But the enemies getting revived extremely quick, causing swarms is what made me stop. ♥♥♥♥'s just too infuriating."

Lost all my progress yesterday because I thought I'd let my sibling give this game a go.I was more than willing to spend a minute scrolling for my save but found neither mine or my sister's saves from yesterday were left. That's just baffling. I know it won't affect most people since they'll play the game for themselves but it kind of makes going back to certain segments impossible without a fresh playthrough, which is hella annoying.

The game play is ok, but gets old after about 3 hours. There's no point using anything other than the shotgun and pistol, player movement is atrocious, the polymer abilities are worthless, and you really only fight 3 of the enemies on a regular basis.

However, after an hour of incessant, ceaseless, mind-numbing dialogue that will just never shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and keep droning on and on and on and on and on, I had enough. The game dumps its entire world and backstory onto you within the first 30 minutes of game time through relentless telling and not showing, then starts you off with a melee combat system that is somehow worse than the one in Cyberpunk 2077. The game feels like Bioshock only in passing. It lacks any of the tight writing, gameplay design, and worldbuilding that all of the Shock games have. The people who can somehow claim this game is better than Bioshock Infinite or any of those games are either people who huff paint during their spare time or are literal fetuses that have not played any videogame other than Fortnite and Friday Night Funkin."

It is exactly that. The enemies are in your face and you have some pretty fun skills and weapons to choose from. They all feel different so mixing it up is refreshing. The game is quite puzzling at times (some of the puzzles seem way too easy). The atmosphere is refreshing and wrought with perils. It is a very sexual game so if you are easily triggered by incest, robosex, or personal pronouns, please look the other way, furry. There are quite a few bugs, especially environmental. During a play session I easily get stuck in between something at least three times. This doesn't deter me from playing it, though. Mainly because there are alot of save spots in the game so you don't lose tons of progress if you do have to reload. The achievements work sporadically and make you scratch your head, for sure. Especially the talking to all dead animals one. I talked to one dead animal and got the achievement. The game is still fun, though!"

Be it a cutscene or gameplay.Frankly this game is beautiful and probably has very good gameplay; If it was playable. Constantly diving from 60+ to 5 frames per second while in the middle of fighting a singular enemy or having a cutscene that's as simple as an elevator falling running at 6 frames per second is just appalling.

I wish i could restart this game for the first time and play the side missions while following the main mission. fun game. id personally wait for it to go on sale and fix the issues with the game, unless you have nothing else to play."

Atomic Heart feels like it was written by a high school junior in their creative writing class after they briefly learned about WWII. The story is shallow, characters lack backstory and context, and the MC feels like someone's attempt at writing an edgy fanfic protagonist. All of the dialogue sounds like it was written out but never actually spoken out loud until they recorded the voice lines. Character voice lines overlap each other, but in a way that feels like their voice lines were just overlapping in the edit of the timeline.The MC is one of the most unlikeable, shallow, and self-righteous protagonists I've ever played in a game. They are aggressive to everyone they meet. Their vocabulary feels like it needs to include an expletive in each sentence. A literal line in the game makes the MC see a certain scientist as the ""Messiah."" There is nothing redeemable about them as a character, and since they're the protagonist, we are stuck with them the entire game. Don't get me wrong, you can write a character with glaring flaws and issues, but you need to give us as the players a reason to be in their corner and a reason to justify their actions.From a purely gameplay perspective, this game is decent, but doesn't do anything innovative or mind-blowing top set it apart from other solo FPS games. Atomic Heart feels like its trying to do a lot and include a lot of different mechanics in the game, but ends up lacking that bit of polish to make it truly special. In terms of combat, the game wants you to be quick swapping between melee, ranged, and your glove powers, and they do this by limiting ammo, having powers on CD, and utilizing melee as your default when you're out of luck. A cool idea in concept, but it falls flat when movement is relegated to a slow walk, strafing (which has a cooldown), and an even slower backpedal. Crisp, clear, reliable control of the character is essential if you want your game to feel more fast paced. Additionally, there is a small amount of climbing/mantling on ledges, but the controls are clunky and the character doesn't snap to ledges as much as you'd expect from anything in this generation.Now for a few redeeming qualities:-Exploration is rewarded by allowing you to upgrade weapons/yourself quickly. -Lots of save/upgrade spots-Upgrade trees aren't locked in, so you can respec at any time to shift gameplay style.-Setting is unique, beautiful, and colorful. Overall, I'd wait for this game to be on sale before you pick it up. The game doesn't shift the needle in any significant way, and is a decent game if you don't pay attention to the story."

The Communist atmosphere in this is strange because it challenges the terrible ideas put forth in the past. Although some of this still remains (It seems as if Stalin in this game is revered specifically because he showed what not to do), as weird as it sounds this is a rather unique take on it and for once, a futuristic unified paradise actually looks really good to live in - not that I would after seeing how events transpire ingame, though, and many audio logs will show that not everything is perfect in this world, as typical with communism nearly none of it can reasonably exist. The universe aside, I can tell you that this game is challenging if you are trying to go through it quickly, you actually have to use resources wisely or you'll never get anywhere. For the best experience I highly recommend playing on the hardest difficulty. These are robots, their punches should knock you flat, and taking hits is never advised. There is a lot of QOL too, like how everything you craft can be dismantled for the exact value you made it of, as well as skill respecs being a thing from the start, free forever. There is one warning I will give, and that is you really should be prepared to completely clean out the entire game of resources. This is a crafting-heavy game. You need absolutely everything you can get. Every house, every bathroom, every single underground facility, is full of stuff which you can see through walls at any time, so it won't take too much time to grab everything. All in all, absolutely amazing game, perfect presentation, not much bugs, great optimization."
2816,InBystander,https://steamcommunity.com/id/InBystander/,1,,0,15.3,February,23,213,0,1,"I've got mixed feelings about this game. The game looks and runs great, first of all; I've got no complaints there. The combat is fairly enjoyable, if a bit repetitive. The story is interesting- though at times hard to follow. I thought the setting and lore were fairly intriguing, but the messages on the computers were boring to read though. The boss battles were cool as hell- but I did just end up killing almost every single boss with a whole lot of rockets. I played the game in English, and the writing is... bad. Its hard to tolerate a protagonist who acts like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and keeps spouting one liners and an annoying catchphrase. I'm told that the Russian voicing is better, so if you decide to play it, do it in Russian with English subs.You have the option to explore a bit in game but there are no side missions or anything. The only reward you get for exploring is a few sidegrades for your weapons that you don't need and probably can't afford with the resources you manage to forage.Exploration itself is kind of a drag since any time you're not in a massive underground facility, there are repair drones that will fix anything you break, and you can set off an alarm if you're seen by any cameras. It encourages stealth, but you really don't have any stealth options in your arsenal. Your only real options are to slog through an endless battle or run. And if you do decide to fight, your reward is scraps for your weapons or consumables.There really isn't a lot of replayability with this game either, the story is fairly linear and you don't gain anything new from playing again. The endings won't change based on your decisions or anything. Speaking of the endings... they're not , exactly, but they are a bit disappointing. For the story it makes sense, but it just made me feel a bit let down after everything."

Now that I have played 5 hours all I can say is disappointing. I understand the game opens up at a point I have not reached, but I am finding it hard to want to keep playing it at this point. The combat is okay at best. The controls are clunky. The puzzles are either stupidly easy or weirdly confusing. The pacing is probably the second biggest issue... the main problem I have so far is the dialog seems written by a 13 year old... truly this is like something a child would write. Maybe that's down to translation issues but my god its grating. It wouldn't be so bad if there was less of it. The constant banter between you and your AI glove thing is extremely annoying. I want to push on in a hope that there will be some fun to have but I honestly don't know if I will find the will to do that.

It's not one I'd come back to, even though I enjoyed it. The open world is bland, and all the important locations are pre-marked and show exactly what you'll find there. The weapons are kind of cool, but the pool is small and it does not matter what you use at all. The railgun was personally disappointing to me, as it has no upgrades and is objectively the worst weapon in the game, so I can't understand why it was even included. The game is short and the world is small, which I prefer a small open world if it's quality over quantity, but this game has neither. Is it a good time? Yes. Is it worth owning forever? Absolutely not. Thus I cannot recommend you buy it. Save yourself some money and subscribe to a month of game pass if you want to play,"

It has great lighting, textures, sounds, and pretty good optimization. It handles very very competently as a first person game.Everywhere else it feels like a mediocre A.I. was told to write ""scenes from bioshock"" and then specifically told that they can't connect in any way.Stuff just HAPPENS for no reason. Nothing makes ANY sense in the slightest. We get characters introduced and named that seem important and then they just die or you never see them again. There are obstacles presented as ""puzzles"" that are literally just hitting the single button and poof you solved them.If Bioshock is a 2018 Ford Focus then Atomic Heart is a 1960s Lada. Technically they perform the same basic functions but one is infinitely (heh) more coherent and well put together than the other.THE THIRD TIME THE ONE GERMAN CHARACTER SAYS WORDS IN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES THE MAIN CHARACTER MAKES A HITLER JOKE.This is not worth $60. I wouldnt pay $30 for this. I would wait until it's on sale for $10 and then buy it as a joke for a friend."

Atomic Heart is a fun time, the game play is engaging and the story is fairly straightforward yet intriguing. My main critiques for it would be just little nit picky things such as when walking through areas and Charles is talking with P-3 sometimes the dialogue will just cut out or not play at all. The English VA could also have been ran a little bit better along with cutsenes and such but overall the rest of the parts of the cutsenes were fine for how they were programmed and edited. But overall the combat, semi-openworld exploration, resource gathering, etc. parts of the game were good. About the only thing I mostly recommend is that for the kind of lack of replayability and the fact that on normal difficulty it only took me just under 16 hours to complete the game I would say wait till it goes down to $40 or better to buy.Overall still a better game that League of Legends!"

Yes, it is.You can just stop right here and buy the game.It has a lighthouse, it has a Man in a city, it has flying cities, it has underwater facilities, it has polymer, which is like the Salts of infinite or ADAM of the Original Rapture Bioshocks.

Just play it, it's great, it's fun, and you'll get some solid Soviet aesthetics and cozy vibes. The endings were a bit lack luster and I feel like there were missed opportunities to include the twins more, and draw out a more interesting closing act, the end seems to kind of just rush everything out in front of you and all for a slideshow. Could have been better, could have been far more satisfying, but the game itself is quite satisfying so it's still an easy 8/10. I hope they release more story expansion packs, there is plenty of room to expand from here."

While these kinds of companies say they are private, in countries like Russia, they are totally controlled by the government. Yet these are the companies that support Mundfish.- When you read the user agreement presented to you when playing Atomic Heart, it specifies that “Your personal data will be shared with FSB”, aka, ex-KGB. I’m serious, look into it! They even removed the page when people started calling them out.- Their office was originally in Moscow, but due to the war in Ukraine and the attention they were getting, they decided to cover up their “origins” and relocate to Cyprus.- When confronted about the war, they will ban/report you, labeling you as a “spammer”. I even double-checked their official discord server and it is FULL of Russians who blatantly post memes and conversations about how “Russia is amazing” and “Ukraine sucks”, yet they dont get banned.- Robert Bagratuni (CEO of Mundfish), used to be a top manager of MailRU (VK). Currently, VK actively supports the Russian Army through its social network and has deep connections with the Russian government. The current CEO of VK is Vladimir Kirienko, who is the son of Sergey Kirienko. Sergey Kirienko is the First Deputy Head of the administration of Russia, and he himself was one of the people that helped Putin start the war in Ukraine.- The fact that the game is releasing on Feb 20th, near Feb 24th (The Invasion of Ukraine), is VERY ODD. The idea that out of all the 365 days they could’ve chosen to release the game, it was just a few days before THEIR country invaded Ukraine, feels like an odd coincidence.- If they truly supported Ukraine and were against their oppressive government, they wouldn’t just create a half-@55ed tweet that keeps the announcement “neutral”. A good example can be the company WarGaming: a Russian/Belarus company that openly protested against the war in Ukraine, relocated its offices to Poland AND earned over 1 million dollars of donations to the Ukrainian AID organization.Save your money and support Ukrainian devs, they’ll need it more than these RuZZians.Go pre-order instead STALKER 2, REPLACED, or the War of Mine."

Maybe I shouldn't of used telekenesis like a crutch but its apart of the game so ill use it. This game has no incentive for replayability what so ever. Denuvo has made this games optimizations on FPS tank so much. The combat/gameplay to me is press button to lift eneimes use ranged/melee weapon to shoot/smack them down, then rinse and repeat until there dead.I like some of the music. I will not compare it to other games, cause it takes so much from other games and still failed to make it exciting or fun.

No need to mention those extremely hot ballerina Twins - tons of artwork, dedicated to them, speak for itself.It's sad that all contemporary art is bending under the pressure of agenda (inclusivity, diversity, cancel ""culture""), when all kinds of really creative ideas and freedom of imagination can be thrown to trash, 'cause literally any word, image or concept can considered to be offensive. The logic went smoking, when the public was offended for something they found in the game: now it was one of the episodes of Soviet cartoon, released in 1978! Seems like any historical event, person or artifact can go to hell, because it's impossible not to hurt anybody's feelings by mentioning them.Looking at all of this obscurantism, which surrounds the game, I want to show deep respect to the game developers, who dared to bring us such an entertaining and amusing piece of art in this troubled time."

2849,DarkEDork,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dumbass9000/,3,,0,13.8,February,23,835,0,1,"TLDR: Worldbuilding good, graphics good, optimization good.Exploration meh, combat very meh.Enemy variety bad, story bad, crispy critters.I'd been waiting for this game to come out for years on years, and it finally did! Unfortunately, after beating the game, this is another case where I (and everyone else) wished Steam had a 'Meh' option for their reviews. Atomic Heart does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. I'm setting this review to negative for the time being, simply because I feel the game's positive traits have been getting a lot more genuine publicity than its negative ones. We all know that the graphics are stunning and the setting is inspired, but here are some of the things that haven't gotten a ton of traction. is kind of neither here nor there. It's clear the game was much more focused on the player's narrative experience, so while the world technically does open up into an expanse that you have free reign of, there's very little to entice you into actually traversing it. Aside from sort of ""mini-dungeons"" that house additional modifications for your weapons, there really isn't much for you to find in the open world outside of stunning visuals. It's patrolled by the same fairly limited selection of enemies, the camera/alert level system is so oppressive that you can't really comfortably look around, and the campaign is easily completable on any difficulty with the resources given to you in scripted dungeons. The open world functions as a tool for the narrative, but if you're specifically looking for an exploration/discovery game then this is a miss. Also, door puzzles fun at first but get annoying when they're on every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ door lol. felt kind of all over the place for me. The dodge mechanic is pretty fun to play with, but your character just moves so damn slow outside of it. Enemies lock onto/close the distance to you so fast that cover isn't much of an option. It felt like the game was trying to emulate more bombastic movement shooters like DOOM but multiple design decisions kept that from really coming together. For one, the mobility. Your character moves pretty damn slow, even with upgrades, and this makes grappling with much faster/more mobile enemies feel awkward and clunky. The game also loves to put you in environments where getting stuck on terrain/enemy models is incredibly easy, and you'll often find yourself dying because you were tripping over some weird piece of detritus on the ground. The ammo economy is very clever (ammo/melee/energy) but unfortunately also kind of falls on its face due to balancing. The amount of ammo you find/are allowed to carry is fairly limited and makes it a precious resource, discouraging you from playing in the fast paced 'guns blazing' style the game seems to want so bad. Energy weapons are fun to use, but unloading the entire resource bar into your opponent barely ever seems to tickle them.Finally, enemies are just SO DAMN TANKY. This one was genuinely baffling to me. The impact of the weapons feels great, but even your most basic mook enemies will require you to pound a significant chunk of ammo into them before they go down. This definitely hurts combat satisfaction and makes fighting enemy groups feel more like a chore than something you want to do. The tight dodging mechanics and huge enemy health pools make it feel like the combat was designed for tight skirmishes with two to three opponents, but the game will usually be tossing you into massive pools of robots and mutants where it just feels like a slog. For better or worse, the most effective tactic I found was simply easily stunlocking opponents with special abilities and lopping their heads off. I tried not to use it, since it sort of ruined the fun, but it's by far the most effective method to deal with the game's swarms and overlapping attacks.  was also a fairly huge disappointment for me. The game's trailers all showcase a bizzare and sprawling cast of wild, insane, and inspired robots and mutants. Unfortunately, the way they were shown off in the trailers feels slightly disingenuous after playing the game. Enemy variety is incredibly slim. Ninety percent of the time you're going to be grappling with one of the following: Basically all of the more creative ""wow!"" robots/one mutant from the game's promotional material are sectioned off to being boss fights. And while this isn't a travesty, it does mean that your time with them will be short and completely scripted. This is understandable, but also a letdown for myself, who was deeply invested in what appeared to be incredible enemy variety. Lots of gunning down zombies/humanoid robots. :( is, well, just kind of okay. The protagonist and his sidekick will not shut their mouths for even three seconds, which really hampers the game's atmosphere, but you kind of learn to tune it out. Playing the game w/ Russian voice acting certainly improves things, but as others have stated, the subtitles aren't very well made and sometimes just break completely. Pacing is pretty weird and I really had no idea where I was in the story until about two thirds of the way through. Things escalate pretty abruptly and a lot of the game's big reveals are either painfully obvious, make no sense, or come out of nowhere. I also found both resolutions to be pretty unsatisfying. Worldbuilding is exceptional but if you're here for a gripping drama I have unfortunate news. Also, whoever is responsible for Crispy Critters might need to be canned.So yeah, it's by no means a terrible game. But it's not everything it's selling itself as either. Tons of great ideas that either feel a bit unfinished, or just don't quite fit together right. I hope it sees continued support and look forward to new Mundfish projects."

I even had the opportunity to preview the Ray-tracing Gameplay back in 2019, which was fantastic. However, I can not say that this game is amazing. Unfortunately, I can not say that this game is even good. Though it does hold a lot of potential, I do not think this game will ever get better like Cyberpunk did.. and HERE IS WHY: The Good: Despite all the bad reviews and millions of bugs the game has, I have to say this game introduces a lot of new, potentially ""Game changing"" mechanics. One of the mechanics that really surprised me is the procedurally generated ""Dismantling"". The amount of detail of how you can kill your enemy is mind-blowing, but what is more interesting is the way that every single attack registers incredibly accurately on your enemy with every scratch appearing EXACTLY where you hit the enemy. Not to mention the broken parts being left lying around even after you quit the game.  The other part, that was quite impressive was the enemy AI. I liked, that the enemies found ways to get to you, even when you try to run away and hide in a safe area. They would literally  Jump, Climb up on objects and leaders, and even walk inside rooms while chasing you. I was very impressed, since I played Generation Zero I know what it's like to have ""DUMB"" AI robots. Atomic Heart AI seems to concentrate heavily on enemy engagement in the game, which is very impressive. Overall visuals are pretty good, though I expected a much higher level of details on textures. Of course, I really enjoyed the USSR Lore, especially the music in the background. I can't believe they actually have those songs playing in the background. Nostalgia :)  The Bad:As soon as you enter the game you are faced with very poor storytelling and very bad game coordination. Like for example at no point in the game, you are given any direction as to why you would need to seek out Polygons (Which are secondary objectives in the game)  And by the way aside from a handful of other side quests that is it. The story itself is incredibly bad. I played the whole thing in Russian and I have also seen the English translation. Though the Russian version is better (as the English version cuts out a lot of Easter eggs... I guess in relation to the war) The whole thing felt rushed at the end. In some places, it felt like whole scenes have been cut out from the story. Moving around the world felt unnecessary and linear. It felt more like a giant room instead of an open-world game. There were cars in the game, but they were useless, as you drive them for 100 meters before meeting an enemy. The car would easily get damaged and blow you up, so I never seemed to need it. Or you could move some objects ( like not every object or not even a few just random objects for some reason) like some chairs, but not other chairs or cardboard boxes. you couldn't really hit an enemy with it or use it in any useful way... I mean if it was there decoratively, why not make more objects like that...  I  really don't understand why these features were there. It seems like there were a lot of unnecessary things that were more in your way rather than helping you. This brings us to the UI of the Map. What a mess that was. not only you couldn't switch off unnecessary items (Like you would in any normal open-world game map... Cyber Punk, Horizon Down Zero, Red Dead Redemption 2 ) But most of the items highlighted would not even have names next to them, so you wouldn't even know what they are. Also, you could never tell where your location was, as your icon would be very similar to the background color.The UglyTHIS GAME IS BROKEN. In the state it is now, despite poor storytelling and the numerous flaws in uneasy items, that ruin the game and things that make the game very boring to play, I would have still liked it, BUT it's the many MANY MANY bugs that put a nail on a coffin. It's really sad to see this, as the game has a huge potential to be great, but it is simply unplayable in the state it is now. The many bugs I encountered:- Clipping - This one happens almost right after you start the game. Most of the time you would see through the wall if you come close, some items will be stuck in the floor or walls and even some of the key objective items will be stuck in some prices of geometry making it very difficult to proceed with the game. Not to mention the Character getting stuck in geometry all the time.  - The loot does not empty in full -This one comes later on in the game and at first, I ignored it, but the more progressed the more I noticed, that I could only get 1-2 items from any loot bag.  While it would still show the ""Collection "" circle and the action button F, I could not collect it- Things stuck in midair - Sometimes pieces of geometry would just be hanging in the air and not disappear after you loot or even after a big fight.- Enemy animations Stagger -This one is quite odd. It happened to me almost toward the end of the main campaign. I have never seen anything like that in a game bug before. Basically, the game would run at a normal FPS (*like 90-120) and everything would feel like it's 120 FPS, but the enemy will move as if it's moving at 1-5 FPS. This gives you an opportunity to kill an enemy without effort, but it breaks the immersion completely. This also happens when you try to unlock doors (The animation of your character will slow down to 1-5 FPS)- The Balloons-This is a personal one. I think one of the first things that put me off from immersion was the STATIC balloons. Everywhere you found them they would appear to be motionless. You would be able to go through them and they would act as a cement block when you shoot at them.- Textures missing - This one does not happen that often and it seems mostly on a very specific object throughout the game. You will basically see your standard black-and-white checkerboards on geometry instead of the texture.- Resources stop collecting - This happened to me toward the end of the game. Two of my resources just refused to show up even when I collected them, which made it impossible to upgrade or buy anything in the game. I ended up dropping a lot of options and my weapons just so I can move forward.This game felt like a very interesting experimental prototype or a BETA, with many bugs and unfinished work. I would not recommend it in the state it is right now"

This game world is very immersive and looks absolutely beautiful on high settings. I love alternate reality stories like this and find Atomic Heart's lore very intriguing. Soundtrack is high-tier.I've only played a few hours so far, but I have had a taste of the actual gameplay beyond the intro. Movement is quite slow-paced which I don't mind because there's a high focus on melee combat, which controls pretty well. Battling the robots with the axe is fun. You often have multiple ways to solve a problem which is always nice. The glove abilities are similar to BioShock's plasmids, which is honestly a good thing. As some have highlighted, perhaps the English dub leaves something to be desired but I've heard much worse. For the first playthrough I've chosen the dub because I don't think it's terrible, and unfortunately the subtitles are tiny.Oh and a refrigerator felt me up.

I mostly play games for the story aspect of it- of course, actual game play is fun too but i judge a game not by what cosmetics you can get, but by how much lore and cinematic moments you can get from it. Atomic Heart was a perfect example.My Verdict:If you want to play a game with a great story, insane graphics, and even better animations and robot designs, play this game."

Fun challenging enough and most importantly complete. In a day in age where everything feels like it's missing a part for future DLC or for a monetization later on, Atomic Heart feels like a game that knew what it wanted to do and did it, giving you a full experience in one go. Gunplay and melee felt good, bit different at the start but quickly adapted. Enemies have enough variation of types without going to far and while some might complain that there's not 100+ enemies I think it's to the game's benefit as each enemy feels fleshed out and in a game where you're suppose to figure out what to expect and how to approach different enemies (especially on higher difficulties) it feels like the better choice. Once again I felt like there was enough enemy variety. In addition to the combat the puzzles where fun and enjoyable, yes this game hides a puzzle game inside it with some platforming. The story I also enjoyed with enough twists that I legit didn't know where it was going at times. So I won't spoil anything and say experience it for yourself. The art direction was also refreshing as this world felt DIFFERENT then the usual alt history romp or even sci-fi ventures in general.Thank you Atomic Heart."

So far the story line isn't god-tier, but it is entertaining enough to keep me playing. The English dub is painful to listen to and ruined the immersion for me. You can change the settings so the voice lines are in Russian and the subtitles are in English, but the subtitles are very small and it's hard to read them during combat. Also, any dialog outside of the character, the glove, and direct intractables do not provide a subtitle for translation. I really enjoy the mechanics in the game. It was like they took pieces from all my favorite games and put them into one. I also like that there is an option for aim assist AND auto aim on controller. It is a personal preference, but I like to play games for their stories and can be deterred by their combat. This games has options so that there is still combat, but it is not the bread and butter of the game. That being said, for those who crave a heavy combat game, you can change the difficulty and settings to meet your preference.Overall I would give the game a 7/10."

2909,Buckaroo Banzai,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nevergiveupneversurrender/,No,,1,33.9,March,2,467,0,1,"Atomic Heart has an incredible atmosphere, fun gameplay (when it's staged right) and entertaining dialogue. A lot of the dialogue is satire and will fly right over people's heads, but I didn't mind the constant chatter between the protagonist and his glove, or the rather erotic refrigerators.However, some of the puzzles are downright obnoxious to figure out, destinations and objectives aren't well explained, and while there are plenty of side quests, it's really up to you to waste resources trying to finish them, often with subpar rewards. Side quests felt soulless in that regard.I had to keep abandoning the game for a few days and coming back to enjoy it again, as the checkpoint/save system is atrocious. There were times in the story I'd spent 20 minutes just getting to an objective with very minimal, if any combat, only to die during the main objective, and roll back 20 minutes to the last save room. For the love of god, increase the number of save rooms (without loot) or give me a 1-time save here and there.While the game is visually breathtaking, the dialogue and story entertaining and intriguing, it's the gameplay that will often fall flat on its face. Tack on the inability to modify your FOV without running third party applications like Flawless Widescreen, which shouldn't even be a thing in this day and age, and the lack of RTX support (which I personally don't care about but the game is advertised as having it), kinda add salt to the wound.The whole thing seems like a stylistic Bioshock ripoff that's entertaining at points and incredibly frustrating the rest of the time with a cracked foundation. I want to love it, but simply can't. It's like no one on the dev team truly playtested it from start to finish. I'll still recommend the game as it draws me back in every 3 or 4 days, but I wish Steam didn't give such a Yes/No rating - I'd give atomic heat 3/5 stars, for example, were a real rating system implemented. Oh - performance wise, zero issues both underground and in the open world. R7 5800X, 64gb of DDR4-3600, a PCI-E 4.0 M.2, RTX 3080, everything fully maxed at 1440p.TLDR: Wait for a sale."

Decided I would try some of the dungeons they put in the game.  I have never played a worse dungeon in any game.  In a combat based game I spent a majority of the dungeon trying to get past a ridiculous climbing section (If I wanted to play Assassins Creed I would simply go play it).  I think I died 7-8 times at this section, most of the time because the climbing didn't seem streamlined.  My character would simply not grab onto a ledge sometime.  This dungeon wouldn't have irked me so much if there wasn't such a huge number of inane puzzles in the main story.  I liked them at first, but after having them repeatedly shoved down your throat it was a bit much.  Game not worth full price, get it on sale."

All the enemies you face are service robots its an interesting twist.-Great mix of linear and open world environments. This helps keep gameplay fresh.-Piggybacking on the previous point combat is exhilarating the mix of ballistic guns, energy weapons and melee keeps each encounter fresh!CONS:-Yes its true the dialogue is bad. It ranges from cringe to juvenile to downright asinine. Still it can be funny.-Story/Lore requires exploration and lots of reading so dont expect to just be handed all the facts.Im not done yet but id give the game a 9/10 definitely worth the buy and you have to remember this is Mundfish first game. Very impressive all things considered!"

Atomic Heart has some really interesting ideas, but it's brought down by truly abysmal writing, a baffling open-world design, and a main character that I completely don't want to listen to anymore. Having a main character that doesn't question a single thing he's told, but whines aloud about unnecessary fetch quests and openly antagonizes every single person he meets is something I could only tolerate for so long."

The power weapons are really cool, but they sap power too fast. Getting 3 Railgun shots before having to swap to melee can beat things' faces in can be annoying, especially during boss fights when getting in close can be a serious hazard.*PRO: Boss fights are some serious fun and are a legitimate challenge even at Normal difficulty.*CON: There isn't a lot of enemy diversity. Additionally, there is an enemy regeneration system in large parts of the world where what you've just killed will get brought back, and No, you can not use that to farm for materials.*PRO: Collecting materials with the glove I personally found entertaining, because instead of Action: Open Drawer, go down list, and repeatedly hit the collect key, you just press and hold F key, and it all gets sucked up into a pocket space. Also, while inventory space is very limited, it can be upgraded to a reasonable size, and any overflow is stocked into an infinite storage space you can access at safe zones.*CON: I found myself burning through consumables at a ridiculous rate that forced me to stop by safe zones every chance I could get to craft and restock.*PRO: If you make sure to secure every lootable area, you will never be short on crafting materials for comsumables.*CON: This game is very pro-communist society. While technically, communism would be the ideal government structure, any amount of research will tell you that human error and greed is the biggest thing that makes true communism impossible. The governing system only works in social groups of 1,000 or less, and even then, it's kinda rough. While I get that it's part of the setting and a key part of the story, I hate politics with a fervor, and the protag ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about capitalist society (Which is also a seriously flawed system) and praising the communist agenda just really ticked me off.*CON: Lastly, the Protag is just a ♥♥♥♥ that I can't stand. his attitude throughout the game made me grind my teeth."
2938,SomePlumber,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SomePlumber/,No,1,1,11.7,February,26,"1,356",0,1,"The first thing I want to mention about Atomic Heart is that it feels like a lifetime since a beautiful game came out and didn't launch unfinished with game breaking bugs. Honestly, It can't be easy weeding out all the junk when you're working with a time frame but Mundfish pulled it off. That impressed me right off the bat. Now with that out of the way... Atomic Heart in my opinion is a masterpiece. It takes a very special mind (or set of minds) to create such a bizarre and gorgeous world like this. I will agree with others that say if you liked Bioshock, you will like this. They have a similar feel, which isn't a bad thing, but this is no rip off of Bioshock. This game is bizarre enough that you really can't anticipate what's going to happen next. The controls are nice, the combat and movement doesn't feel cheap or janky. The weapons are interesting. My ONLY complaint is that upgrading weapons and abilities is kind of a mess. I'm only about 5 hours in but I still don't fully understand the upgrade system and I think the menu could have been done better for that."

2957,MrSir,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RogueLeader-/,No,,1,12.9,February,25,405,0,1,"Atomic Heart is a visual masterpiece that transports players to a beautifully designed Sovietwave world. The game captures the essence of a communist utopia, leaving players nostalgic for a time and place they never experienced. The attention to detail in the world design is awe-inspiring, and the game's performance is flawless, making for an immersive and seamless experience. One of the highlights of Atomic Heart for me is being able to take my time with the exploration elements, which encourage players to uncover the game's lore through indirect storytelling. It's refreshing to see a game launch complete without the need for extensive post-launch patches or DLC. Overall, Atomic Heart is a unique and polished game that's fun and runs really well.If you're wanting to avoid this game for political reasons then remember comrade;There is no such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism."

2959,Ralph Ellison,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bentsea/,3,,0,30.1,February,25,"1,916",0,1,"I was incredibly primed to enjoy this game, but it has unfortunately let me down. It's a fresh entry into a genre I love and its hype was stylish and showed off amazing technology. The final product still has many positive traits that shine despite its flaws.The sci fi story based single player FPS is one of my all time favorite genres and it has been absolutely starved since the astonishing Titanfall 2 was released over half a decade ago. And.. I really want to like Atomic Heart, but longer I play the more and more I HATE the protagonist. Please bring back the silent protagonist of yore. This guy is petulant and ignorant. He has no patience for the world at all and everything that comes out of his mouth is pure trash. I can see the attempt to try to make a quippy and clever hero that always has a one liner, but they missed the mark terribly.The story itself is bland. The world is beautiful, but it feels like a rip off of Bioshock Infinite but without the thought provoking introspection. The combat is passable but too cumbersome to be genuinely enjoyable, the powers seem to have been entirely an afterthought.More importantly, though, I feel lied to. All of the marketing for this game promised life changing RTX. It was THE reason I craved a high end Nvidia card, the example of games of the future that would show off ridiculous lighting and shadows in real time. Unfortunately, this is not included in the game. This feature was dropped without any kind of announcement from the developers, leaving me feeling lied to.The result is that I'm left with a game that's average at best and at its worst is actively annoying that leaves me with the constant feeling of having been lied to. This might be good on the discount isle but in its current state give it a pass, especialy with iits ridiculous price tag that includes DLC."

It's a weird mixture of Bioshock, Fallout and Prey, with a very detailed and nice environment.The part which isn't very convincing to play this game, the protagonist is unfortunately a stupid !@#$tard, and it is a good choice to stop listening to him very soon.The story is nothing new, but okay so far.I think unfortunately they give away the possibility to choose a less obnoxious main character to make it an excellent game, so it stays a bit in the let's make Incels happy game corner.And dear devs, no doctor is running around in high heels during being on duty."

The setting is absolutely stunning on various missions and the characters like the twins and Nechaev are so well designed and interesting.I happen to love the story of this game, and the cut-scenes were phenomenal, truly tied me into the story. The game just came out so I expect a few bugs, as I had one on the blood courier mission but i fixed my way around it. The crafting system is one of my favourite things as it is put together really well (I love NORA best upgrade fridge). I won't spoil the end but the final scenes were so unsettling yet beautiful when you see what has happened.Through my first playthrough it was an insanely amazing experience, I enjoyed every second of it, and I truly plan on playing it again to simply explore the parts of the world that I missed the first time and see them beautiful bots."

But really, if it wasn't then the game devs would have been disappeared by the KGB, and it still manages to be a bit tongue-in-cheek with the bureaucracy, espionage, etc that hints at the grim reality of it all.Plus, is so far a fun game. Good gameplay, weapons are nice, cool abilities, and the enemies upgrade themselves as you go through the game, keeping things fresh. The individual plot points and excuses for puzzles are kinda weak, but there's a fairly compelling main story that you follow, and the world as a whole is fairly well thought out and displayed.The main character could stand to be a little less quick to curse for the sake of it though, as it comes off as trying to be edgy and instead ends up cringe."

2980,Stanlyhalo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Stanlyhalo/,2,,1,13.3,February,22,195,0,1,"I do like this game, from what I've played so far, the story doesn't carry a lot of depth but I think it's starting to actually explore some things. I do love how far they dipped into the USSR artstyle, it matches very well when you go into certain structures. First time going outside the first underground area was a pain; basically got spawncamped. There's no fov slider so I have to use a mod to do so, and the scanning ability fov doesn't get effected so that can get weird, but that's obv since I'm modding it to make it better to play. Performance is amazing for how much detail there is. However, I do think it praises Communism a little too much for how bad it is. It makes it sound amazing and that it can achieve so much innovation and that it's the best system, when in-fact it just never works due to the economic structure being so fragile, the over reliance on distrust, and pushing the common people below even the margin of what we now call poor. That being said, it's really quite fun, sometimes it does get annoying when I just get stuck due to the bots pushing me into a corner and then they just combo me a lot. But in the honest suggestion of the game's overall experience to other players, I do recommend this game, it does give bioshock vibes, it's quite fun, story doesn't have as much depth as other games, and overly praises Communism to what I thought it was going to be before launch, and it makes the USSR sound like the good guys, but it's just a video game so honestly idc that much."

I'm runnin this sumbitch on a 2070 for gods sake at damn near max settings, I really don't understand why people are complaining, whether it's too linear or not good enough. First I'd like to remind everyone that, since it's being compared to bioshock, that bioshock was a linear game, there is nothing wrong with a linear game. Second, I played The 2022 MW 2 not on launch but right after, and I almost physically could not play the game because it would crash so much, so it could be much worse.

The game's overall atmosphere of terror creates an exciting experience for both FPS and Bioshock fans, despite not being primarily horror-focused.The unsettling robots and other enemies add to the game's overall appeal. ""Atomic Heart"" is one of the best narrative FPS games in recent years.

But most importantly, it is a game that manages to give you the feeling that only Bioshock has before. Now, the game doesn't quite give off that same scary atmosphere that Bioshock uniquely captured, but it does have its own very special atmosphere. And most importantly, the combat is a lovely situation of needing to constantly keep on the move and lay into the enemies.That being said, I do feel the game gets too easy on the normal difficulty. It actually started decently difficult but it didn't take long to get simple, though some moments did still feel challenging. I'll be playing the game again on the hardest difficulty."
3019,Peet Fics,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Incideous/,13,2,0,5.1,February,24,"1,972",0,1,"Meh. The thing about this game is it's not necessarily bad but it is dull. The opening sets a precedent as being a Bioshock style game. Even some NPCs drop a 451 reference getting my hopes up that it may be an immersive sim in some way.It tries to do too much. It wants to be an open world game and seemingly cash in on some early concepts of Bioshock Infinite and I'll give it some credit, it really goes for dystopia and nails the aesthetic. The art is fantastic and very unique. The music is absolutely amazing thanks to the Mick Gordon. The combat is janky but has potential. I really wanted to like it, but...The tracking for enemies is all over the place. I constantly lose them after a side dash because they tracked me like a souls enemy and is now in a completely different direction. The dialogue is awful. Characters interrupt each other constantly in English and the main character is trying to be an irreverent modern Duke Nukem and he sucks. The entire first facility you go through looks copy pasted which doesn't help it's practically 2 hours long. Just when you think you're almost done they send you on a Zelda fetch quest except all it is is shooting the same 3 enemies over and over. Save rooms are all literally identical to each other. There's some climbing which feels like a terrible version of Dying Light's climbing and barely functions half the time. The ""stealth"" is running up behind an enemy, hitting a button then mashing the same button continuously til you kill it. Just make it the one button. Outside a few actual NPCs you get world building from audiologs and dead people for some reason. Nothing like having conversations with a corpse to live up a world. As soon as you're out of the first facility you get dropped into a slightly more interesting Far Cry game. Really, the game is just dull which is worse to me than being bad. I pre-ordered this years ago on their official website for half price which preordering is always dumb but I treated it more like a Kickstarter where I believed in the project's vision and thought Star Citizen already got $30 from me, what's the harm in giving the same to a Soviet inspired Bioshock? I got a finished game but surprisingly it just bored me. It might be up your alley but I advise you pay the same that I did later down the line. I thought this would be for me but it's clearly not anymore."

In my opinion, different levels of difficulty should add new types of boss attacks, which would be interesting in my opinion. Story, mwah, ""konfetka"", I've heard complaints from different people about the voice acting, but personally played with Russian voice over and my god, it was good...For this who think that this game glorifies USSR, it does not, it just shows that there are conspiracies and power hunger people, which actually really reflects well on real Soviet Union.

Looting is also fun and different. I also don't understand why the playable character is such a jerk to everyone? Considering some of it constantly helps and such it makes no sense. The main characters sometimes just go on and on with an conversation that you cannot skip. Then you keep playing and suddenly the voices are overlapping because you trigger another conversation.

There's been 2 (or 3 maybe?) patches since release and they still haven't fixed some major bugs and issues. Some of these issues should have never made it to release. Some simple  stuff that would have been caught in the most basic of play testing.It all shows a real lax and not caring attitude.

Every Gameplay Decision Feels Well Thought Out And Intentional Thus Far. I Love The Variety Of Areas To Explore, Each With Their Own Twists And Beautifully Laid Out Sections. The Game Is A Sight To Behold Visually. It May Even Top Cyberpunk 2077 If I'm Being Honest. The Upgrade System Feels Unique Compared To A Lot Of Games These Days. Suck Up Resources With Your Power Glove And Insert Them Into A Horny Vending Machine And It'll Give You Game Changing Perks And Weapons/Upgrades. I'm Playing The Game In Russian With English Subtitles So The Voiceover Work Isn't Cringy For Me Personally And It Fits The Theme Much Better (I Did The Same With The Metro Series), It's Much More Immersive Than Hearing English In A Russian Setting. So Far This Game Is Excellent, And I'm Really Enjoying It. It's One Of Those Games Where You Start Off Powerless And Slowly Turn Into A Beast As You Progress And Explore The World. Exploration Is Rewarded Well Too, With Unlockable Weapons And Attachments Needing To Be Found In This Game's Version Of Dungeons. I Love It! This Is The Most Addicted I've Been To A Single Player Game Since Elden Ring, I Played For 9 Hours Straight All Night And Can't Wait To Do It Again Tomorrow!Edit: Just Finished The Game In 3 Days And I'm Really Impressed! The Story Definitely Caught Me By Surprise And I Love How You Start By Getting Demolished By The Weakest Enemies And By The End, Through Crafting Upgrades And Perks, You Slowly Become A Super Soldier! My Personal Rating Is A 9.2/10! It's An Amazing Game If You Enjoy Atmospheric Open World Shooters And Enjoy Exploring!

I originally found this game the same week I met my wife and over the years I’ve followed the progress then all of a sudden there was a RELEASE date. The game is beautiful and with a recommended setting for “Atomic” graphics the game shines. The game gives me dying light story driven feels but the art and story line are unique in their own way. Fighting mechanics seem a bit challenging but I’m prepared to waste a couple months of my life completing this game with a fine tooth comb. Great work devs! Worth every single second of waiting! Also I don’t ever review games like ever. This might even be my first but it was earned. Thank you for only charging me $70 for this million dollar masterpiece 👌🙈😂

The comedy is good but sparse to the point were it almost feels out of place the odd time it shows up. The robots spawn infinity on the over map so its quickly turns into sprinting from point to point because there is 0 reason to engage in robots not in a building.The story while interesting to start kind of just ends on the expected twist without filling in the protagonists actual story. It feels like a ton of story is missing or cut out to just end the way it ends. Maybe its an attempt at a cliff hanger, but it just ends up feeling unfinished. the puzzles are simple as can be and the various door unlocking mini games are not bad but do not get more difficult over time. the combat is good for the normal enemies but it all amounts to spam the shift button. All boss fights are the traditional 90s style run in a circle while you shoot and reload unless you have the big saw disk melee weapon then you just right click and the boss goes poof.Overall its a neat attempt at a modern bioshock style game but was released way to early and misses the mark across the board."

It's surprisingly good performance-wise, and I haven't really encountered any bugs yet.Update: I think that this overall a very good game. Sure, the story may not be on the level of Red Dead Redemption 2, but it's still entertaining. The combat is satisfying enough, and the sounds are pretty good. The soundtrack slaps. Graphics are also really good. What makes this game really shine is the creativity. It's not like some standard 70 Euro AAA game from certain studios, which are fun for a good 15 hours, then get stale and have you realizing that it's extremely generic. This game is daring, creative, and honestly quite bizarre. Hot robot women, a horny crafting machine, a melee weapon that can cut enemies up with sawblades, goofy dialogue from the protagonist, the whole world it's set in, including it's characters... it's all just so unique and new. What I also like is how difficult the game is. I'm playing the game on Armageddon difficulty (which is the hardest difficulty, at least on the first playthrough), and it's seriously hard. I even had to shamefully lower the difficulty once because I was stuck in an area. It's been a long time since I've felt so challenged and satisfied by a game. 9/10. Not perfect, but close to it."

To me, Atomic Heart is a cautionary tale about user reviews. I had never heard of it until it popped up on Steam one day. I read the previews, which were almost universally good. Even now, the reviews are positive. HOW? I don’t think I’ll ever trust reviews again after this experience.First, the (very few) positive aspects):-Great visuals; most of the time it runs well on a mid-level system-Interesting ideas on display (though, as I detail later, not many of them are original)Now, the irredeemably bad:-This game reminds me of a cook who takes every ingredient he ever loved, throws it all into one pot, adds every available spice, and hopes for the best. Predictably, the result is a hash that retains none of the value or flavor of its component ingredients. For example, this game is set in an alternate history version of Russia. Um, didn’t Wolfenstein already do that with Germany? (I don’t mind someone being derivative, as long as they do it well. Atomic Heart doesn’t.) I’ve seen the game compared to Bioshock, which is laughable. Bioshock was a masterpiece; this game was, to me, a grave disappointment and a complete waste of money.-Speaking of bad derivations, the main character converses with a sentient glove. Sound familiar? Forspoken, another recently-released RPG, features a protagonist who converses with a sentient cuff…though the motif is handled 100% more effectively in that game. And, on the topic of Forspoken, it got mixed to poor reviews, but I personally thought it was one of the best games I’ve ever played. People complained about Frey, the game’s protagonist, being annoying. Really? But Atomic Heart’s “hero” isn’t?The last time I hated a game protagonist this much was the Duke Nukem remake. Yeah. Think about that for a second. Atomic Heart’s “hero” is an unsympathetic, cardboard cutout cliché—a thick-headed, ignorant-sounding fool who vacillates from being mildly inquisitive to incomprehensibly antagonistic towards his little glove helper in the space of one sentence, and for no discernible reason. He’ll sling a dozen f-words, then resort to ridiculous epithets like “crispy critters.” REALLY? What are you, four? The other characters are no better, from the blank robotic glove to the crazy granny to the idiot who thought it was a good idea to make killer robots, no one in this game elicits sympathy or even interest. This, my gamer friends, is storytelling at its worst.-The much-vaunted combat is HORRIBLE. The weapons are clunky to use, ammunition is scarce, and upgrade opportunities are few and far between. You constantly feel outgunned, even against single, early enemies. The iron sights reduce your FOV so much that you often miss what you’re aiming at. And don’t get me starting on CONSTANTLY being knocked down. So, so, SO annoying. Later in the game, this clunkiness gets far worse as you face even tougher enemies that often swarm you. What do you get for your troubles? A bunch of garbage that supposedly allows you to craft but which, in reality, is insufficient for your needs.-Movement is similarly horrible. When I push the move stick on my controller, the game rarely knows if I want to sprint or walk, so I end up moving in a kind of herky-jerky dance that sometimes causes me to die because when I think I’m springing, the game thinks I want to creep along. Ridiculous.-The writing and dialogue as every bit as bad as the mixed and muddled accents. The protagonist is Russian, but speaks in a clumsy, action-hero American accent. The other characters speak in a variety of accents, which includes a couple forms of English, German, and whatever accent Granny is using. I get that Russia is more internationalized, but it’s still jarring. The written dialog “choices” make no difference to the outcome of the game, and are rarely worth the time it takes to go through every response. Likewise the e-mails and the incomprehensible employee directory, which shows all the people who work at this fictional facility, but never tells you why this info might be relevant. As I play this game, I get the strong sense that this was written in a language other than English and then very poorly translated (which would still not excuse the horrible plot).-The puzzles are the worst kind of platforming filler. They would be more bearable if the movement and traversal systems weren’t so stiff and unintuitive, but even so, they’re tedious and do nothing more than stall the already tedious story.-Like every other aspect of the game, crafting is also terrible. First off, the crafting computer constantly makes filthy, sexually-oriented comments that would be distracting and inappropriate from an actual human character, let alone a robotic one. In this case, it’s just weird. It’s also unclear what audience the game’s designers are targeting with this kind of dialogue. But that aside, crafting itself is useless. You NEVER have enough materials to make the best weapons because you’re forced to use the mats for crafting things you need right now, like health and the all-too-scarce ammo. So, I can SEE all the weapons available to me, but so far, have only been able to build a useless ax, an effective (but poorly-supplied) shotgun, and an electric popgun that gets me killed as often as it saves me.-The soundtrack, which is often a high point of games for me, is as bad as any other part of Atomic Heart. It varies from grinding metal rock to a weird fusion of European-sounding pop songs that neither fit the story nor resonate with me personally or musically. Worse, you can’t even shoot the radios like you can in other games, and at least give yourself some temporary peace.The bottom line is that I’m very sorry I bought Atomic Heart. It offends me as a long-time gamer that a game would be released with so many glaring flaws, but even more so that it was released to such positive feedback. It’s certainly shaken my faith in online previews and user reviews."

Had to look up why, and it turns out there is no HDR!!! Like what the actual fig newtons??? Only 90  minutes in but it is so distracting that I thought about refunding the game until they can have this game actually ready for PC audience, but game play is good so far. I do not play through games a second time, don't have the time. So when I buy a game I've been excited for for years to get here to see it look nothing like I expected bums me out. Yes graphics are good, but when I'm on an OLED with a 4000 series rtx card I expect the best, not mediocre. Hogwarts legacy did it right, played through that for 12 days and will probably never play it again after beating it. I am pretty Disappointed..."

If you are fine with a few super annoying bugs and don't need accessibility, buy it. Otherwise wait a bit until these issues are resolved.Pros:-- This game has a unique old/futurism/steampunk vibe which makes the experience super fun. Love all the customization and options plus the ability to respect and recycle resources 1:1.-- Combat is hard and rewarding. I'm playing on the Armageddon difficulty and it's a challenge!-- Scenery is beautiful.Issues:1. Bugs: -- You can get stuck...I'm only at the beginning but I've had to reload my save in the trolley section and a few other areas due to being frozen in a object and unable to escape. Dodge should be a way to get out of that mess, however it does not help when you are suck. Only option is to reload a save. 2. The game needs some polish for controllers. - There is no control map or way to look at controls for Xbox controllers on PC. So if you have an elite make sure you rebind the paddles to a PC equivalent command.-- 14 Many keys are missing such as swapping the healing for controllers-- controls are a bit limited for a Xbox controller, having options to remap the scanner would be nice.3. Accessibility is missing. Not sure how lawsuits go with games, but for websites / apps its required to be inclusive.-- (EDIT: They added it!) Missing text resize (the font is small for subtitles)-- Missing colorblind options4. (EDIT: They added it!) No FOV option, an issue for ultrawide monitors. Requiring tools such as wemod or flawless widescreen is a backwards approach. It's 2023, there are a ton of ultrawide monitors on the market, please support more FOV options."

Although the devs definitely put some effort,  I can't say I like it. The price is too expensive for the current content, considering Cyberpunk 2077 has a similar price tag but double the content. Too many puzzles, at least 1/3 time I spent is on them. Some hints of these puzzles are not very clear. And the max jump distance is not consistent. In certain design, if you failed couple tries, you would think this is a wrong method to solve the problem. But actually it's a right way. It is really hard to identifying space in the first person mode.The story, is also mediocre. It could go much deeper. Communism combine with highly collective societies like Bees. This could be a very interesting topic. But it end up with some old mad *spoil censorship* cliche. Can't say I should complain about it. After all you can't expect every video game can tell good stories like Cyberpunk 2077 or even RDR 2."

BUT Cameras are everywhere that call enemies upon sighting you and call even more reinforcements upon seeing you fight the other enemies. Then there are repair bot that repair/resurrect enemies over and over again, with an frustrating amount of repair bots. Then Outside the ""Tutorial Zone"" the game gets really unstable with frequent crashing.  No Problems In the Tutorial Zone (OK 1 Blue-screen for memory access violation). Those Crashes set your Progress way back as the game does not feature as many Saving Stands as it should and it doesn't auto save unless you rush through the main objectives without exploring. Those crashes and setbacks ruin the fun of exploring as you got to do them multiple times.I was tempted to leave a negative review but i have hopes in the devs fixing those Stability problems as the game was officially released 20hours ago*Edit: Regarding Stability and performance... i have a I9 -990064Gigs RamRtx 3070So the crashes should not come from my computer not being able to handle the game"

I'm a sucker for combat in games and while the combat is pretty alright in the game. I feel like if they put more focus into the combat instead of the story. The game would be a lot more fun in my opinion.-VisualsThis game is really pretty and quite insane with some of the monuments and architecture in the game. The game is aesthetically appealing as well. I love the 50s style that they went for and just being really retro looking.-MapAt first I didn't even know that this was an open world game. With the map and the swarms of enemies that you encounter every step you take, this makes exploring more of a hassle than enjoyment. I was more focused on the story of the game just because I didn't want to have to deal with exploring. I never even got to do any of the polygons that were in the game because there was no direction or no need to even do it.-StoryThe story in itself is very ""eh"", it was nothing surprising. Some stuff just happen for no reason at all, or some things will pop out of nowhere just to fill in gaps of the game. Some cutscenes happened unexpectedly with no build up or heads up. I have 15 hours in this game which I mainly focused on the story, if they cut and shortened the cutscenes and dialogue. I would guess that the gametime for just the story would be almost half of the original time you take to finish the game. A lot of the cutscenes are drawn out so much more longer than it needs to be, the dialogue is just way worse. Sometimes conversations would just happen out of nowhere and I feel forced to sit there and listen to get in on the lore, when the lore explained in the dialogue had no influence to the actual story. Finally, the ending, it was the most mediocre, unsatisfying ending I've experienced so far. Not going to spoil it, but don't have high expectations for the ending.-GameplayThe combat is pretty alright, you got a nice selection of abilities you can use. But there is just something awkward about most of the game mechanics being used by one hand. You can heal, use abilities, scan. Pretty much you rely on this hand most of the time and not the weapon selection. The fighting does become tedious and annoying when every enemy is on your ass all at once. The weapon selection is very basic as well. Pretty much all you would need is a melee weapon, shotgun, and a AK then you're set for the entire game. Boss fights don't really feel like boss fights, in fact the first and last  boss fights are possibly the closest actual boss fight you'll get in the game. Every other boss fight just seems like every other enemy in the game. The puzzles in this game are okay, they kind of just throw you every kind of puzzle they have in the beginning of the game and whenever there is a puzzle I solve it in like two moves or less than 30 seconds. Barely a puzzle game. Most of the ""missions"" or objectives is just fetch objectives, there's a lot of them that even the main protagonist in the game makes jokes out of it several times. Now bringing back the polygons, I never did them and I never had the need to do them. The game punishes you to the extreme when you get hit but the damage you deal is just enough to take out any enemy.The only thing keeping my score above a 5/10 or below is just me being an absolute fiend for Nora and the Twins."

After the first one I attempted to validate the game files but the next fight was no different. Awful way to end what was an otherwise fun game.There were several graphical glitches too. The first person cutscenes had my belt clipping through and my pants/shirt would be shown on the screen while in first person during some of the last fight scenes. Sometimes the scanner wouldn't pick up enemies. It was a real mess, and the problems seemed to start with the patches. Also, the steam achievements were all broke, so now I have to replay it if I want them to show. Annoying and I don't even know for sure if they fixed them.

Although there is solutions for this problem which means cutting off power to an area, its kinda annoying how everything rebuilds itself, i guess the plus side is easy farming although i haven't really gone out of my way to farm just noticed how easily you can get loot from this. During combat you sometimes get stuck in props/cornered which could lead to massive health drops from constant attacks/death. Although i only died once to this and a fews times annoying cornered, a shove mechanic could help.Would be nice to have save slots to e fights bosses. I've noticed countless environmental bugs but none game breaking but can be immersion breaking, at least for me.The testings grounds (Dungeons) are kinda annoying, wish it was less puzzles and more environmental story telling. Kinda like Fallout. It does do a good job already but wished it focused on it more rather than simple and easy yet still time wasting and annoying puzzles. I guess this could be a plus but the limited weapons kinda make it pointless to ever use whatever you favor. They should've been incorporated to damage and weakness like the elemental damage. Maybe i'm not far enough yet (just crossed the bridge) but i wish there was more mini bosses/ larger enemies throughout the map. Maybe some of them guarding big loot rooms, etc. Most of the liter across the map are (personally) weak enemies. It would also give a reason to re explore areas you might've been too weak to explore/ to challange yourself and recieve good rewards.I could go on with my issues but this is pretty much the ones that come to mind. Its not a bad game but personally i would just recommend Bioshock/Prey before playing this. Owing/have played both of those titles this seems like another clone (not a bad thing, kinda like a genre, like how souls-like are thing) is why i decided to gives this a try but i would buy and play those first if you haven't. One thing i dont understand is the drama about the character and glove talking to much, i just think Forgotten, oh no i mean Foresaken has left a bad taste in every ones mouth. I thought about how boring some areas would be without their talking so its kind of a plus most of the time."

I played it for roughly 2 hours, and in that two hours, I was only able to actually play for one hour, as the other hour was completely overtaken by an on-rails, little-to-no control opening that attempts to set the scene in one of the most ham-fisted ways.Additionally, during my hour of play, I encountered several game-breaking bugs that required e to load a save and replay portions over and over again. And this doesn't mention the obnoxious writing for the dialogue.This game was an abysmal experience for me, and I barely think it would be worth $20, even if the bugs were fixed, let alone the pricetag it has now.

The games writing  and English voice acting is terrible. Your character and stupid ai glove just won't shut up.  There like three four different types of lock picking min-games and they all suck and extremely boring and frustrating. The pass code doors are also annoying as you have to remember the pass  code by memory as it doesn't simply give you the passcode for finding it. and they aren't normal passcode they dot pass codes. Most of the puzzle in this game suck and aren't fun. The only puzzle I liked was the magnet platform puzzles and even those kind of suck because platforming in this game is incredibly slow and is just bad. The games gunplay and melee combat is fun when combined with powers but so of the games enemies are just way too bullet spongy. The so called open world section which feels completely unnecessary  feels even worse when there is no way the permanently disable cameras and these section just swarm you with enemies and those enemies are immediately repaired after you destroy them. the games bosses are kind of cool but there is only like three of them in the entire game and they were already show off so there are no surpises when it comes to boss fights. the other boss fights or more like boss enimeies since they are used multiple times. I couldn't find a way to switch the game to russian voice acting with english subtiltes which was extermly annoying because not only does the English voice acting suck the characters don't even have russian accents even though most of the characters are russian with exception of one character who is German. It must be possible to do so because I saw someone on youtube using this option but I have no idea how. The games story is painfully predictable with exception to one of the games endings that come out of nowhere. The positives of this game is the world, the art direction, and the enemy designs and the combat can be fun. But having such a cool world and premise and for the games writing to be this bad does a huge diservice to this game and makes the game a tad disappointing. This game is certainly unique which makes the game worth getting eventually just not at full price. Just play the game on game pass and then get it when all the games expansions come out and hopefully the things I have issue with they fix or address.  The game is probably a 7 out of 10 but it kind hurts because it come have been on the level of bioshock in terms of a 10 or 9 out of 10 game if the games writing was better and ddn't have those annoying issues I addressed. I do get the game takes influnece from bioshock but did it really need to rip off the opening of bioshock infinite or make a rapture reference it was just way to meta and kind of gave me the impression the the games direction was all over the place. There were certain enemies that were cut as some earlier robot enemies shown in the very early trailers aren't in  game and neither are the creepy mutant clowns or zombie clowns. The games story also seems to have slight alterations as the facility you are no longer investigating because it went dark because the robots attack as soon as you get there so their really isn't much mystery to it.  Also I would have liked more in terms of level variety as there really isn't many levels that stand out except the games opening and that theater level. Just reminder don't preorder games especially games that are really hyped up as I even need to take my own Advice as I keep getting burned with disappointing games with Callisto which sucked and Atomic Heart which is just decent and not great. This also seems like a trend of games that are in development hell then eventually end up releasing to be disappointing and not living up to the hype. This could most likely be to poor management and scope and feature creep. again wait for sale or play on game pass."

One, no fov slider. I play on 21:9 (ultrawide) and this is necessary for this game/ It's an fps for crying out loud and doesn't have any way to change it unless possibly in the ini files, but that shouldn't be the case, and on top of that, some of the animations from what I've noticed, are running at really low frame rates for some reason. I like the game, I really do! the visuals are amazing and it's not like it's graphically intensive to run like I thought and that suprised me a lot, but there's a lot of just missing things in the game like animations being a little off all the way to once again, the FOV. Ultrawide is just zoomed in and unplayable and if anybody wants to play this game, those need to be fixed. TL;DR, good game, but with how it was released, it's half baked. It isn't worth buying until they fix a bunch of stuff."

This was enough time for me to complete the introduction and get to the quirky upgrading kink bot. Besides the initial interaction with the upgrade machine I have to warn that the voice acting is a bit too much for me to bear for a full story run of this game.Let me explain. I feel as though the voice actors themselves had the chops to deliver the lines well but whomever the director was didn't sit down and evaluate the delivery of the lines and think ""Okay the person is stating the line clearly but it doesn't feel like they are selling the actual emotion of the line stated."" P-3, your character will call someone an ""a**hole"" but it feels like he simply read the line from a script as opposed to trying to sell the line. I don't expect 5 star above and beyond effort but it's jarring when that's the delivery throughout the whole game. This was the only thing that made me refund the game for now since it's pretty taxing to deal with it throughout my whole potential play-through.The positive is that if you are a huge Bioshock fan (Like myself) then this game is right up your alley. They have the adorable preview animations of special abilities, the ability to do a dedicated melee build in a first person adventure and an decently paced combat system. It's just that the voice lines which also serve to dispense plot is delivered in such a way that's annoying is all."

It's way too rough around the edges. The animations are janky, the melee combat feels weird and lackluster, and the overall feel of the game is not something I'd be willing to spend 60 EUR on. Also, the constant back and forth between you and your AI companion is absolutely atrocious. Way too many snarky remarks and edgy humor on part of the protagonist. The game would've been much better without that. It adds literally nothing to the gameplay, it's just there to avoid those moments of silence between scenes.The game has its merits though. The music is usually banging, props to the composer. The graphics are also quite nice I have to say. I'm stumped by the lack of a FOV option though, such a bizarre decision.I had to refund this. Might get it at a 20 EUR price tag, but definitely not 60."

The graphics are good and the story is interesting with its plain humor. After a few hours you'll find out that's everything. Fighting is always the same and you get punished for avoiding, sneaking, hitting, etc. It is really clunky. Bosses are a waiting game until they show their weak points or they are just like normal enemies. Circle and hit them....Exploring is not really worth it. It seems like you gain a lot of ressources, fun fact: you don't. The moment the world opened up a bit, I personally started speedrunning it. I must praise the developers for one thing: performance and bugs. I had one single crash, but no performance issues (even with a lot going on) or any bugs. *thumbs up* At the moment I can only recommend it for a much cheaper price and just play it for the story. Better go back to Bioshock or if you want a hidden gem, give the new Prey a chance.EDIT:Now that I finished the story. I want to add something. The further you progess, the worst it gets. Instead of giving you time to explore and enjoy the universe you are stuck with the horrible fighing system. This game would be better without enemies or at least much less. Gosh I really enjoyed the grotesque story and facilities, but you don't have time to take a breath and explore. I hope for a sequel that focusses on puzzle and exploration. At least be more like Prey (stealthy/use the enviroment to avoid enemies) or Bioshock (fluid gameplay)."

The enemies are boring, the weapons are boring, the fighting is weird (and boring). I thought we were well past linear games like this too. I admit I have a high bar for games these days as time is so precious a game needs to be properly good to be worth playing.

3253,Ahriman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AceDetectiveUmiGouda/,2,1,1,33.8,March,5,452,0,1,"I was skeptical of this game but was very positively surprised by it. What I'll say right off the bat though is that if you're looking for a boomer shooter you would be sorely disappointed by Atomic Heart, look elsewhere. If you're open for a slower experience that is more akin to an immersive sim I definitely recommend this game. - -  The glove abilities are all powerful and fun to use, the gunplay is good, all weapons have their own strengths and several upgrade paths, some of which significantly alter how you use the weapon, for example turning a regular pistol into a high power revolver that shoots 4 bullets at once. Almost all the boss fights were awesome spectacles.-  I feel like I need to highlight this because so many AAA developers nowadays seem incapable of delivering functional PC ports and an unknown Russian studio just comes out of nowhere and shows how it's done. - - -  Facility 3826 and it's robots/mutants are impressive and a joy to explore. The world is beautifully realized and this combined with the music is what makes this game a truly unique experience that will stay in my memory.-  If you did every testing ground in the game to unlock all the weapon upgrade blueprints you will find yourself spending more time solving puzzles than in combat. You could say it depends on your preferences whether you think this is good or bad but it certainly did start mentally exhausting me at some point. I think a better balance between combat and puzzle solving would have benefited the game.-  While I wouldn't call the story outright bad it is nothing special. It is perfectly serviceable until the last stretch where it flubs it, the endings are quite bad. It felt like they ran out of time and/or budget. What exasperates the issue is the dialogue. P-3 and CHAR-LES like to talk; they like to talk  And most of it is just banter or quips. Some of it did make me chuckle or even laugh but it doesn't feel fitting for the situation you're in. I think the world of Atomic Heart is far more interesting than it's story, therefore I would have preferred if they just let the world speak for itself rather than having my main character constantly talking to his glove."

I would not recommend this game unless you like ripping your hair out out of frustration even on easy, I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on this piece of trash. Should have gotten the Dead Space Remake instead instead of taking the chance, at least that game had all the pros of this game and was fun to play as well. Also, there is a section of the game towards the end that you can tell takes inspiration from Bioshock at least in my opinion, but Bioshock was a masterpiece again in my opinion and this game couldn't ever be. Not even the never ending waves of robots but if the game play was just better I would say it was close at least but no not in it's current state. I realize that some gamers consider it a badge of honor to see how far that they can get on hardcore difficulties but I like to just relax and enjoy a game, with a bit of a challenge but not so tough it's nearly impossible even on easy and I believe that if I pay my money for a game I should be able to choose at least give me the option under option's to play the way I want instead not even being able to reverse or get past the obstacles in the terrain and dungeons but no had to turn it off. I feel ripped off, especially sense I bought it via green man gaming and can't apply for a refund through Steam and even if I had bought it over Steam I kept pushing myself to try to get through to the point where I have too much game play time logged to get a refund anyway.

In case anyone else is tricked by bad reviews/misleading marketing: The vast quantitative majority of the playthrough is a puzzle platformer closer to Portal than anything else. The original half life would be a much better parallel than bioshock, fallout, or anything else this is unfortunately compared to. The multiple hour long linear puzzle dungeons are separated by brief above ground ""open world"" areas which while pretty may as well not exist and are in no way interactive. The ""story"" is tenuous at best, it is in no way an RPG, and character design/choices are irrelevant. Gameplay is clunky and bugged, which for a game that is almost completely a puzzle platformer is kind of a big negative.

I loved the atmosphere, the characters, the interactive environment, and the combat was exciting. However, it all just seemed to slowly fall apart.1) The missions were so incredibly drawn out and got boring very quickly. Starting with 'In An Overgrown Park', getting those 4 canisters was annoying as hell and felt so unnecessary. I let it slide a little bit considering it's towards the beginning, but then 'She Sells Moustache On A Seashore' happened. I didn't give a damn about ""Claire"" and putting her back together and the fact that there was a body part on every single floor was incredibly boring to play through. In addition, the 'Morning Express' mission with the ticket was so infuriating and felt like a waste of time. 2) The mechanics of the canisters were monotonous.The frequent use and crafting of the canisters felt like a waste as they never lasted long (even though I upgraded my weapons) and I wish that I could have stacked them in my storage spaces to utilize more room. 3) The world itself was not as open as I thought. It was really frustrating to finally get a break from the main story line only to have to fight everyone and their mom while just trying to explore the world a little more. If you couldn't find a car, then you were screwed. 4) Nora.Bro. What the hell is up with getting sexually harassed every time I try to upgrade something. Also, it felt repetitive to get ""kicked out"" every time I crafted something, then had to go back and keep opening the arsenal. 5) The plot felt like it was trying to accomplish 15 different things at once. The character dynamics started to fall flat about 40% into the game, which was unfortunate. Also, it was a little irritating to have important dialog between Charles and P-3 in the middle of combat or puzzles. Bro, I'm really focused on what I'm trying to do at the moment and cannot try to dissect who said what rn. 6) The game froze.Unfortunately, my game froze right as I defeated the twins. They were frozen in the air and there was nothing I could do except beat them all over again. That was incredibly frustrating and hopefully just an issue that occurs seldomly.  7) The one redeeming quality.... Mick Gordon.The music was perfect. Duh, because it's good ole Gordon. The DOOM franchise is incredible and a big thanks to that is because of how good the music is. In summation, the idea was there but the execution fell flat. It was an exciting introduction into a retro futuristic Soviet Union, but a tiresome world to navigate and succeed in."

But it just didn't hit the right notes. First, the good: this game runs well. 2K/Ultra at 120 FPS on a 3090/12700K. No frame dips even when excessive particles on screen. Shaders were loaded at launch, so the devs knew what they were doing there. GG.Then, the bad.Right off the bad, no FOV slider and mouse acceleration you can't turn off. Aiming feels incredibly floaty because of this. And lack of FOV slider will make this game a nightmare if you get motion sick. The thing that officially turned me off was the writing. It just felt...stilted. Audio logs felt off, the voice acting of them and a lot of the characters I encountered felt wooden, and pacing was just off. There was cutscene early on with some back and for with the MC and another character and it was just rapid fire when there should have been some pauses where a few things were said. Also, the market bot managed to make me a bit uncomfortable, and that's pretty difficult to do. Lastly, the MC. Unlikable and not in the good way. I've played plenty of games with unlikable MCs but it just doesn't work here. Partly due to how much he complains and is just angry at everything, partly due to the delivery of the lines.All in all, this looks like it's reaching towards being like Bioshock, but it's not quite going to hit the mark. I don't believe this is worth the money at full price, but on sale it might be worth a play if you can get past the dialog and the BDSM bot."

The only issues I have so far are rather minor, with 8 hours ingame, is the 72 POV and some of the twisted history in the game is really outside the bounds of possibility. The game takes place in 1955 USSR, after WW2 where the Nazis released a Brown Plague that killed off most of Europe as they were defeated. The USSR reemerged a renewed super power with incredible new technology based around ""Polymer"", all of this is explained to you subtly (no monologue needed, its on displays that you pass within the first few minutes). The issues I have, which are just really petty to be honest, are the first shotgun you get is labeled as the KS-23. A real life 4-gauge soviet shotgun... developed in the 1970s and not even mass produced until the 1980s for soviet police. It used old 23mm anti-aircraft barrels, sawed down, as its own heavy barrel. However, these anti-air guns were not produced until 1960 (the ZU-23 23x152mm autocannon). So this gun could literally not have existed in this timeline at this point (every other non-techno-scifi weapon is about right, with AK-47s and 9mm Makarovs). Other than that, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ great game, and I really recommend it."

The problems start whenever the main character opens his mouth. The profanity fueled ramblings of a horny teenager. Shortly after the set piece you are sent underground to a drab, gray place. Every time I got close to being immersed in the world the MC would say something rude and cringey. There are a lot of cool ideas on display here that get crippled by an insufferable player character. After just over two hours I had had enough and requested refund. I guess I just want bioshock again, not whatever this is."
3309,whyyaskkwhyy,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041002512/,5,1,0,21.0,February,24,509,1,1,"Let me say I REALLY wanted to love this game. I really did but there are just a lot of small annoying things that add up to an experience that it at best OK and at worst annoying. First, I HATE the sound the cameras make. The constant sound of metal bending back and forth is just SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ANNOYING. This can easily be fixed by just taking out the cameras, of course, but then a whole swarm of repair bots show up and you're getting to listen to that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SOUND AGAIN. Kill the repair bots? More show up. And of course it isn't just one camera most of the time, it's 3 or 4. Just make the cameras sound like a crying baby why don't you?Next, the voice acting is bad, at least in English. About half the time it sounds monotone  and is reading off a school assignment and the other half it sounds like an action movie from the 80's, which wouldn't be bad if it didn't feel like I was having to listen to Duke Nukem if he was bored but wanted you to think he cared. The amount of times I've heard ""crispy critters"" is to the point that if I hear someone say it in the real world I will snap. The melee combat also kinda sucks, which is weird cause it feels like it's what they want you doing. It's super easy to find yourself stuck in a corner with no way out just getting hit over and over. A lot of the bots also feel way too strong for what they are. Looking at you buzz saw robot. You can dodge, of course, but at least in my experience it feels like it only works about half the time and can sometimes just stay locked on during the dodge.The story is weak, or at least weaker then it should be, which is weird cause the world building seems solid. If you can't pick up who the big bad is before you leave the first complex I envy your naivety. It's also kinda confusing, everything points towards the USSR being this economic powerhouse, but then they'll say something that makes it seem like they're not an economic power house and global leading super power while also funding flying cities?The subtitles are also janky. Sometimes the character will be talking and the subtitles are like a paragraph behind and don't actually say the same thing. Last, the search and scan function seem broken. You'll be scanning one second only for it to suddenly stop, do the hand down animation and go back up and again. Sometimes enemies can be seen through walls and and then sometimes they can't, same wall same distance, but one second they're there and then you check again and you can't see them only for them to reappear the next. The search function has a similar issue in that you'll hold down the button only for it to stop searching and force you to watch the animation end only to start again to get that last polymer. I want to love this game. A soviet-punk world with killer robots is a world I want to play in, but it feels like the game is trying to do a lot and leaving the ideas half baked rather than hammering down on the things it is good at to make them great. I am going to keep playing it, and if it gets better I will adjust my review, but all I can say right now is as a whole this experience is as enjoyable as a vending machine constantly sexually harassing you."
3310,werdo1756,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198105666561/,1,,1,29.8,February,21,239,1,1,"So far even after just the first 10 hours of this game I already love it. It has a lot of personality and I personally really enjoy the two main characters and their constant almost brotherly bickering. I can get why people might not like the main character and his lines but I view him as a Dempsey-type character. I'd much rather have a main character that's constantly berating science and wanting to brute force everything than a generic nothing character that brings nothing unique to the game. Having a character like P-3 that's almost the complete opposite of the environment he's in makes room for a lot of humor and irony. My guess as to why so many people dislike him is because they want him to take the plot more seriously, but this game doesn't take itself super seriously and I like that. You have a talking glove that argues with you, you can get killed by forklifts and chickens, half the robots have mustaches, the vending machines are sexually perverted and on and on. It wouldn't make sense to have a serious main character in this world and the game would be far worse if it did. This is a sci-fi world that doesn't take itself super seriously and it's better for it. Also, the combat is satisfying and so far I can't get enough of it. The crafting system is an interesting abstraction of a skill tree and the actual skill tree is good too. I really appreciate that you can freely change upgrades, weapons and skills whenever you want, never having to commit to one play style and invest all of your resources into it without being able to go back if you change your mind. There's also a good variance of puzzles that are easy to understand but also easily get more complex as the game goes on. Most of all though the enemy and world design is amazing and even if everything else about this game was bad just getting to look at the world would probably be worth it. If anything about this game interests you at all, you'll enjoy it, I think."

It has a similar mix of weapons in one hand and 'powers' in the other but none of the weapons or powers felt good to use. Even at the end of the game when I had everything maxed out combat felt clunky and I could still die simply because of QTEs.There are 'testing grounds' dotted around the game which are basically secret levels with lot of puzzle elements. Finding and exploring these areas rewards you with blueprints to upgrade your guns. The testing grounds feel like playing Portal and Ive played both Portal games but these were at times frustrating - imagine playing Portal if the gun sometimes misfired - thats what it feels like to play AH.The story is weak and the player character unlikeable. A lot of the dialogue is juvenile .  There is a good and bad ending - I short the quickest one just to get it over with. I explored the game fully in 80+ hours and have no desire to replay it even for the alternate ending.The only upside is that I only wasted £38 buying a key and not the extortionate Steam price of £55

3339,Quirky Robot,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AnonymousXeno/,33,1,0,12.5,February,24,191,0,1,"Avoid it. This game has so many problems and the only redeeming quality is the world-building.Atomic Heart forces you into a stealth playstyle while having the worst stealth system in the history of video games. No sprint, you crawl at a snail's pace, stealth kills require a pointless QTE, enemies notice you even in stealth, and on top of it all...This game has constantly re-spawning enemies and cameras. The cameras, when seeing you, spawn more enemies. Sometimes the enemies it spawns also have cameras, which in turn spawn more enemies. Meanwhile, the game endlessly spawns repair robots that go around resurrecting every enemy you fought. This insane design makes it impossible to clear an area.This isn't even to mention the myriad of other problems:* Protagonist is annoying as HELL. He never stops talking, constantly saying the most inane ♥♥♥♥. He's a straight up douche bag that the developers should be paying ME to listen to, not the other way around.* Writing is PAINFULLY self-aware. The main character complains about having to do an annoying section of the game where you need four canisters to unlock a lock. YEAH, I ALSO FOUND IT ANNOYING. WEIRD HOW YOU KEPT IN.* Awkward, jilted movement that actively hampers the flow of combat. * Melee combat that feels weak and weightless - you can wail away for days on a robot or charge a 6 second power attack that may or may not even land due to janky movement of the player and enemies. You can release a power attack earlier but have fun when it does practically nothing to even the earliest robots, which still require multiple hits to kill. You're nearly forced into playing melee, too, because ammunition is limited and the enemies constantly re-spawn and call reinforcements. * Boring, uninspired power system. Bioshock showed us how to do this right. Instead, the game developers have extremely uninspired powers - freezing, shocking, lifting enemies - and gives them long cooldowns. There's no resource management, the ability is just on-cooldown or off-cooldown."

The combat is literally the worst I have ever seen in a game of this type. All the enemies are a joke. It is beyond easy. There is no actual survival management at all. I have so much ammo I don't even have room for it anymore. The levels are bland, the enemies are already repetitive after just 2 hours.The abilities are pointless and poorly implemented. The platforming is way too clunky. My character constantly climbs on things he shouldn't.The narrator/protag is a cringelord who never stops being aggressively anti-intellectual. It is actually at the point of your wrist (AI Pal) being helpful and the protag just yells 'OH YEAH ♥♥♥♥ YOU' and that happens every 60-120 seconds.The game about 10x too many cutscenes. The looting mechanism of holding the loot key doesn't work and often doesn't fully loot a container so it's basically broken and you end up relooting rooms because it literally does't suck up what's in front of it sometimes.Bad bad bad bad.

You sort of have to try it to know it, everything feels off.- Constantly out of ammo while being stormed by enemies, you never feel like you have a fair fight and often end up avoiding or trying to run away from enemies because your out of ways to fight back.- Lackluster enemies, that white android robot you see - you will be killing waaaay to many of these.- Feels very unpolished, I got stuck in the environment forcing me to restart a few times. Sometimes you spawn in to the game only to be instantly attacked by some enemy. Other weird bugs happen quite frequently.- Weapons are given way to slowly to keep it interesting, 9 hours in and Im still using that laser gun and a shotgun (most the time I cant use the shotgun because Im out of ammo).- The main character (the one you play) the game feels like a total douchebag, he talks constantly and always has the moste cringe stuff to say.- HUD/GUI is poorly made, its all white blending in to the environment making it hard to see where your suppose to go and what abilities you have selected.- Weird movement with controller - when you sidestep you move at a different speed as to when you move forward.- Lighting in the game is very hit and miss, mostly it looks quite bad and un-natural.I’m a big sucker for old soviet stuff, but this unfortunately is just not good enough despite the cool setting of soviet era. The absolute worst thing is that the combat is so down right boring. Constantly under powered and unable to fight your enemies in a fun way."

The beginning commentary between the protagonist and NPC's isn't funny, it's simply annoying. I was more inclined to skip through any dialogue during the introduction so that I could get through what felt like was completely unnecessary and borderline irritating. I find it troubling that for the first 20 minutes of the game you are held hostage (no sprint or skip) to parade through the streets of an unknown parade with no back story.  Even after all of this I still gave it a chance since I still had an extra 20 minutes before I could NOT refund it, because I am used to weathering horrible game-play to at least give the plot a chance. This too was a let down, as I was forced into yet another completely idiotic puzzle. In conclusion I would go buy all of the resident evils to equate to the price of this game, not including all of its promised DLC's to suck you in. Even the DLC's for one of he Resident Evil games have a better story line than this piece of trash."

I keep seeing this game has ""it bites off more then it can chew"" But honestly? I haven't found anything that takes me out of it.Puzzles are fun,Combat is fun,Upgrading/crafting works along side you as you progress and up to you if you choose to upgrade which you should constantly do as enemies get harder/tankeir you need to upgrade your weapons accordingly. If you see criticisms that enemies are tanky in this its probably cause they didn't upgrade that much or they are referring to the bosses which even then if you upgrade before they can be super easy. If you going in to this dont expect some tear jerking story.The story breaths like a 90 action/spy film so much that when u see the scene with the main character the boss and the governor it feels almost like its a bond movie ( at least to me it does). The voice acting is horrible though at least for English but i still find it honestly really fun shoot i even laughed at some of it cause of how dumb it is.Story is easy to get and grasp and the world building is great as well. The game at least for me is a solid 9/10 but for some others it might be closer to 6-8/10 as their stuff that might bug people!"

Maybe it would be more fun with more advanced weapons but in after 5 hours of my first (and only) playthrough I unlocked only additional axe, didn't have resources for more- Gameplay: fun at first but after ~3 hours turns into a chore thanks to combat (see above)Overall: played for 5 hours and now I'm uninstalling it.

I'm running out of things to say but overall this was a well-rounded, polished game that I'm happy to have paid full price for. There's plenty of content for the player and it allows people to reload the game at any time at save points. This game even lets you head back to the facility to continue exploring and replay the additional content you might've missed out on.Easily one of the top games that I've played so far in 2023. The game's ratings on Steam honestly reflect on how I would rate this game. An 8/10."

I would argue same level of awful in the ending as there. Not worth full price. Or if you love m night shymalan then for sure play thisOpen world sections are terrible. And that hog 7 boss fight... What where they thinking, you have a ball that flies across your screen constantly and you cant even see it because of the 55 FOV, and no running means you cant even get distance on it. BlehEndlessly spawning enemies in open world sections awful design, combat becomes completely pointless and just a waste of ammo. They should have made the gameplay Facility=>Route to next facility=>Optional looting puzzle section=>Facility. But no lets just put in an open world section because why not. Just a massive waste of time. And the car breaks down after one hit from a robot lmao, and every 2 seconds you have a robot horde in the middle of the road so cars are not really an option. WHAT WHERE THEY THINKING???except for the bridge section lmao. Bridge section had 2 boss fights, dozens of infected people and to kill them would cost hundreds of bullets. Maybe even a thousand. Not to mention probably half an hour of your time. OR, you can just drive on the sidewalk and pass all of them in a minute. What?.... Im just driving down the side walk and on my left hordes and hordes of enemies just standing around as i pass by. It was comical.Open world sections will feel like playing call of duty zombies. Except killing the zombies is pointless. You just hold down shift and run. So much fun. notBut the facilities are so damn good. Especially the ones with the infected. It is so much better when you get to kill humanoid enemies, the robots just feel bullet spongy. Running through the corridors mowing down everything that moves, great stuff. And the russian heavy metal soundtrack playing in the background as you blow everything up, fantastic stuff. And then the facility section ends and the realization dawns that you will spend the next hour running around like a moron in the open world dodging the hordes of robots. blehThigh gap, arched back, pointe stand, dommy robot mommy jiggle physicsAlthough best girl isnt twins or nora. It is tereshkova. 100%. Always positive, perfect body and face perfect.After playing it through I can also say, the endings are terrible. Completely blue balled. I dont know if they plan on making atomic heart 2 or something but thats the way it smelled. Also the final boss fight? Lasted a minute. Just spammed rockets, didnt even have to use a healing item once. Laughably easy even on hardest difficulty. The way the game scales is that the beginning is quite difficult and then in the midgame when you have all the guns it becomes a breeze (except when fighting those red plyuscha guys). Shotguns start of really good, but once you get AK it becomes obsolete, unless if you dont have ammo. The push effect the shotgun has just isnt strong enough to warrant going close distance, just stick to AK tapping instead. Also the rocket weapon is the most powerful weapon in the game easily especially for boss fights. The rockets have a stun effect and you can just spam them at enemies and perma stun incredibly easily as long as you have rockets(they are quite cheap).And the abilities are terrible as well. SHOK for example doesnt down a single robot. Not one, even when fully upgraded. They just arent powerful enough to be worth using especially because the range is so ♥♥♥♥ even when fully upgraded.Also the main character is kinda annoying. People say he is cringe? not really, just annoying. He is ""class clown"" type character. Should have gone with violent angry dude that is just really annoyed that everything is happening. Instead you have this goofball going: ""wow this is weird lol"". Nah just get alex jones going ham mad about everything and it would be better. But the cutscenes and dialogue in general feels off. I dont know if its the translation from russian to english that lead to this but you have intense scene like titanic sinking and they are in the boiler room but they are acting like they are on a cruise ship but its really windy and their hats are about to fly off. For example the massive plant dying and you having your leg trapped. That whole scene is just strange to watch. Dude next to you is freaking out and you are just kinda chilling.  All in all its like 6/10. Around the same as Prey. They took best parts of bioshock (the facility exploration, fast combat), worst parts of Prey (the ending, bullet sponge feeling enemies), and worst parts of Far cry (♥♥♥♥♥♥ open world exploration for 0 gain). But the ending... What the ever living ♥♥♥♥ was that?? The woman whispering narrative got completely forgotten basically. Why was she whispering to me? HOW was she whispering? Not explained. You are just a crazy guy thats why. ALSO, the ending plot twist ONLY makes sense if you assume one person is a complete and utter moron. Everything relies on that. Because if that one person has a lick of sense the whole narrative would fall apart (not talking about MC)."

Can't put down map markersMap bugs out and have to reload every time this happens and it happens alot.Enemies crowd you instantly with their knock downs to the point of being stuck against a box because they bugged you.Can't jump while holding items in a game where you have to hold items for puzzles and platform.7/10 most of the rest of the game is fun (I played on Normal difficulty), playing with russian dialogue helps. good end boss fight. combat gets better after you upgrade everything to max. bleak ending akin to most russian sci-fi books."

It strives to be this generation's both Half Life 2 & Bioshock. The opening plays like Bioshock Infinite almost note for note. It drops you into a wild-ass sci-fi plot that is high action. The dialog makes me want to self-trepanate. ""Crispy Critters!"" I get that it's supposed to be 1960 or whatever. But the main character says the dialog. EVERY. CUT SCENE.Unfortunately, God of War & Dark Souls have forever broken my combat mechanics expectations. I am no longer sold on the first person combat. To make matters worse, the game invests seemingly zero effort into training the player how to play the game. Don't even think of being a champ and trying to start on the highest difficulty. You'll quickly get dissatisfied with what Mundfish has created here.Overall, the game is not anywhere near as spectacular a flop as Cyberpunk 2077, but it's nowher close to the hype that built up around it.Wait for the game to go on sale if you have an upscale GPU, otherwise just forget this mess. Maybe they'll make an Atomic Heart 2 which will improve upon the failures we found here. Maybe the Mundfish crowd will mature their story up a bit. But honestly who cares."

I'm sitting there, going on a historical landmark tour for NO REASON.LET ME FIND IT OUT MYSELF, I DON'T NEED YOU TAKING CONTROL AWAY FROM ME TO FILL ME IN ON THE HISTORY OF YOUR UNIVERSE.On top of that, the writing and voice acting, or rather the fact that that the voice acting JUST WON'T STOP. When you meet the crafting station (yes you meet it), I'm not exaggerating when I tell you there was over two minutes of completely useless dialogue I had to sit through. It was probably closer to 5 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. I know that may not sound like very long reading this, but imagine sitting there trying to get on with the game and you have to sit and listen to two people pointlessly bicker back and forth for five minutes with a sexually charged refrigerator. Every five minutes the MC's will start bickering with one another (YES THE TWO OF THEM WILL ACTUALLY JUST ARGUE FOR 2 MINUTES WHILE YOU EXPLORE), or the MC will constantly mention about something in the environment, or he'll tell some crappy joke. WHY WON'T THEY JUST SHUT UP, I DON'T NEED COMMENTARY OR FILLER DIALOGUE EVERY FIVE MINUTES (yes I genuinely mean every five minutes), JUST LET ME PLAY THE GAME!It may be bearable for some, but I felt like I was going insane. The bad voice acting, on top of the terrible writing, and how constant it is, it's just maddening. (It's not funny bad writing either. These writers were taking everything VERY seriously, they just suck at writing) If you think you can bear it, then go for it but me personally, I just can't recommend this. At this point I'd rather guzzle a gallon of gasoline and swallow a lit match. If you do buy this, I recommend turning the dialogue all the way down, because the characters literally don't shut up."

The thing that absolutely kills this game for me are the game breaking quick time events.   The final nail in the coffin that contains this stinking corpse is the QTE that locks out what is probably the final fight.  Possibly doable if played on controller but, after re-configuring my keyboard (left handed) I have literally a second to register which key I'm supposed to be hammering - they change with each reload - but, by then, its game over...  What a piece of crap.  Guess I'm off to Youtube to watch someone else complete the final boss fight.  Don't buy."

3510,Fluttershy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BigSchlungus/,3,,1,33.6,February,24,214,0,1,"First off, it's kinda buggy- Nothing game breaking, no crashes, great performance, but there are lots of weird little things that add up. Enemies frequently disappear, robbing you of loot, some containers can't be opened, some items will refuse to let you pick them up, weird issues with inputs not going through at random, and the world map just outright not working plagued my entire playthrough. Additionally, it's not a game for people who want an interesting story. The gameplay and combat are both stellar- Very satisfying and fun to fight with all of the available tools and weapons, of which there are a lot. My actual playtime is probably somewhere around 25 hours for a single playthrough, most of which was the fun combat. However, the story was deeply unsatisfying to my very core, for multiple reasons. I'm someone who needs a good story to enjoy a game, and this one just lacks any plot depth whatsoever (that's not a joke about robot ass- the ballerina twins are present for maybe 15 minutes, you never actually interact with them, it was pure marketing bait). It leads you on with the potential for great plotlines, for interesting dramas, but no, it just goes nowhere. Turned out everyone was deceiving everybody else at all times, what a twist. Completely fails to explore anything interesting whatsoever with regards to robots- just basic, flat, boring politics and capitalism vs communism that's already been said a million times. tl;dr it's buggy. if you just want fun combat vs cool enemies then this is your game. play on Armageddon, even then it may be still be too easy. If you're looking for an interesting story and/or robot ass, this isn't for you, at all. Go play Soma instead.I know this sounds negative, but realistically, it's fun overall and well worth your money compared to anything else at this price point."

There are still design decisions that hurt the game, such as:- Puzzle locks you cannot skip- Clunky movement and melee combat system- Questionable dialogue and voice acting (a lot of it)- Open world that encourages you to run through as quickly as possible instead of exploring the map, lest you expend literally all of your ammunition/resourcesHowever, I believe this game really shines in the non-open world sections, where enemy population is finite and you can actually get some exposition for the intriguing world that has been built in the game."

3535,LordRelentless,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LordRelentless/,2,,0,22.4,February,27,30,0,1,"Honest review time: Atomic Heart is best described as a game that tries to take the nostalgia we might find with similar games like Fallout 4, or the Outer Worlds, puts a pro-USSR propaganda spin onto that nostalgia, and then fails in all other ways. Weapon selection is limited, boring, and underwhelming. The controls, at least on PC (and in spite of tweaking them with mods) are clunky at best and lack refinement. The ""dungeon puzzles"" are far from difficult in the sense of figuring out how to solve them, but rather they're made difficult by said clunky controls. Without mods and/or wemod to augment some things (like jump height), some challenges are virtually impossible to do. Despite this being the proper release game, there are tons of bugs. I've fallen out of the world now about 15 times forcing me to reload. To accomplish one of the missions you have to jump on a security drone called a ""Hawk"" which you can't do because the jump function is so broken it makes it so you can't progress. As far as the story goes, it's okay-ish... To put it mildly, and not to give away spoilers, it's very predictable. I haven't even beaten it yet, and I already know what's going to happen because of the beats hit within the plot. While it's an ""open world"" it really isn't, many of the quests are tedious and boring. The run'n'gun style destroying of robots is boring, and generally speaking if you want to find out what's going on with this game watch one the myriad of youtube videos and let somebody else play through it for you. Overall, it's a very nice looking game, it has some interesting plot bits, but it's a swing and a miss. Missed opportunities abound in this game. Performance: On my current build, AMD 5600 X, RX 6800 XT, 32 gb of RAM; with ultra settings across the board, and ray tracing on, no resolution upscaling at 8k (yes I said 8k) I'm getting consistent 60 hz (locked), without jitter, screen tear, or dips. So I will give them this, the game runs smoothly."
3536,stratzilla,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stratzillab/,No,,1,27.1,March,5,"3,362",0,1,"+ fun and varied gameplay+ great boss fights and combat in general+ moment-to-moment gameplay combines multiple genres+ excellent performance- full of bugs- lacks some PC features like FOV slider- boring open worldAtomic Heart is a shooter with clear inspiration from some genre giants. At times it feels like a Bioshock inspired game, other times the Metro 2033 or STALKER titles. Even some design from SHMUPs and puzzle-platformers like Portal make its way in. It's hard to ignore the inspiration from others because Atomic Heart works mostly as a combination of good ideas originally found elsewhere, and it works to great effect.The gameplay may as well have been ripped right out of Bioshock, with you exploring buildings and chambers collecting loot from shelves and cabinets, finding audio logs fleshing out the backstory. That's how the game plays out but it's more than that, with lots of platforming and puzzles to solve. It's pretty far removed from most shooters in the breadth of gameplay variety you'll encounter.Combat is pretty typical shooter fare with you facing off against androids and other robotic machinery with a small arsenal of weapons. You're given abilities that shoot out of your glove such as freezing or burning enemies, or launching goop at them to slow them down. The abilities may not be as varied as Bioshock but still get the job done as an enhancer to the combat, making it much more strategic (although you can still easily brute-force most encounters).It has a predictable and trope-laden story that can still engage at parts due mostly to the absurdist art direction and excellent presentation. I find most alternate history with accelerated technology plots to be interesting to some degree, and Atomic Heart is no different. The story beats are pretty common in games, though, it's just done here with some Soviet flair and the minor twist here or there. It's not a new story but coupled with the setting, it does stand out on its own.I mentioned the presentation because at times it feels more like a movie with really good cinematography in cutscenes. While they're not plentiful, they do a great job of building intrigue and suspense. As well, the soundtrack is absolutely killer. While I don't know to what extent Mick Gordon contributed, you can tell it has some of his DNA, with tracks building up in tense situations in combat and being more mellow elsewhere. It's mostly diegetic music as heard from radios strewn about the world.The bosses themselves are some of the absolute best I've experienced in shooters and a lot of these encounters employs SHMUP concepts like moving lasers, dodging AoE, giant bullets, or damage rings. You're always on your feet with sidestep dodging and jumping around. It makes combat have a lot of style and quick footwork is not often seen in shooters, so it's a huge breath of fresh air. This isn't just for bosses, but for regular enemies to a lesser extent, too.As far as open worlds go, Atomic Heart is one of the worst. There are cameras everywhere that when spotting you, summon hordes and hordes of enemies to the location, meaning you can almost never stand still to relax and take in the surroundings, you almost always need to be on the move to avoid enemies. It makes the pacing seem very off, with laid back buildings and testing grounds peppered throughout a world just completely chaotic.The testing grounds are great: there's eight in the game world and they're multileveled puzzles that give weapon and upgrade blueprints after completing a series of puzzles. Some of them are headscratchers but they're not too difficult, giving a nice reprieve from combat and exploration. These were my favourite part of the game because not only is it tied to your arsenal but they're just plain fun and make you think about how best to use the systems the game employs.While the graphics and especially the art design are top notch, voice acting (at least in English) is rough, almost as if they took the first take of every recording session. Some awkward language used as if it's not native English speaking, and the subtitles very seldom match perfectly to what is said, with word deletions and sometimes even entire subtitled phrases skipped. It doesn't help that what is properly done is also chock full of obscenities to an unnecessary degree. It makes the protagonist in particular seem very cold and robotic.The game is mired with bugs. It was very frequent I would get stuck on world geometry and a common reason is some enemy attacks do knockback which seem to ignore level bounds, pushing you slightly into world geometry forcing a reload. As well, on a few occasions, riding an elevator saw me shoot out of level bounds also forcing a reload. Driving vehicles in the open world was also very buggy, having you shoot off into the sky if you hit an enemy sometimes.One of the more egregious bugs is the broken achievements. Some achievements don't keep count correctly, some don't increment at all. There was also two achievements I got before meeting requirements and these were at random after loading a game. Frustrating if you're an achievement hunter.My review seems negative but a lot of these issues don't even come close to dampening the excellent gameplay alongside. It's just incredibly fun to play and to see some of the art design they've employed. Everything looks so wild yet sterile, it's one of those games you'll remember for its moment-to-moment gameplay and worldbuilding more than any of these negatives I mentioned.It's at times rough but easy enough to see past its shortcomings for what it brings to the table. It's about fun first and foremost and Atomic Heart delivers it in droves. Most of the systems here are so well made, they just don't often intermingle well enough for a release product. Taken on their own, they work well, but together it's a hodgepodge of ideas that doesn't always deliver. I look forward to what Mundfish does next because all it needed was some more time in the oven to congeal all these systems together more than it has.Works decent with UI elements spreading to appropriate areas of the screen. There is no FOV slider as of writing, and the 65 FOV is way too narrow for ultrawide. To give an idea of how restrictive it is, I would say it's a dealbreaker to most ultrawide users, although the devs have said a patch is underway to add it.You can also use Flawless Widescreen to give a boost to FOV but it doesn't seem like the game was originally made with a higher FOV in mind. Some cutscenes will zoom out with a larger FOV with FWS, and sometimes assets outside the 65 FOV viewport in ultrawide flicker out of existence. The game needs work on the dev side to proper add an FOV slider.On a 5600X and a 12gb RTX3080, the game runs great at maximum details and DLSS Quality at 1440p 21:9. While there's no raytracing despite being touted as a feature in marketing, it still looks spectacular all things considered.I could reach my monitor's framerate ceiling of 113fps easily with GPU utilization headroom to spare, although I did drop things down a touch to high in some places if just because some things I couldn't tell high from max and it lead to more consistent framerate, even if it predominantly was 100+fps throughout the entire game."

As an experienced gamer, I find that the game looks heavily outdated not just graphically but also in terms of its gameplay mechanics.Maybe I'll buy it sometime in the future when they fix it and offer a discount, but not for full price right now. With so many cool games released this year and many more interesting ones on the way, this one just doesn't make the cut. Despite its cool art style and aesthetics, Atomic Heart is just another mediocre game with boring gameplay.But as for me also it includes a bunch of propaganda related to the invasion of Russia into my country, which I find to be utter nonsense.You might not understand it because you're not in the middle of the conflict and don't know ""the lore"", but I've been in it for nine years already.Thankfully, it will be over soon.Several users already wrote to me after this review: they wish my country to fall. they wish me to die and call me sick.Wishing for the fall of any country oppressed by a stronger aggressor is not a justifiable stance.

3576,𝕍𝟜-𝕏𝟙,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thevaxi/,1,2,0,12.1,March,1,894,0,1,"Honestly? This game's kind of bad.I originally wrote this game 1 hour in. After people suggesting I keep playing it, then give my opinion, I decided to do just that; benefit of the doubt.Now I just feel annoyed I wasted an additional 11 hours on this garbage.Sure, the game's decent enough...But on 6...SIX separate occasions, I've now gotten haplessly, irrevocably stuck in random objects or areas of the game, forcing a reload to my last save, which is, given I play on Hard and the save stations are pretty spread out later on, quite a long ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time ago.Each time I've been forced to reload a save. It *just* happened to me again, and frankly, I'm tired of it. Getting stuck in things is about the easiest bug to fix and shouldn't have made it past the initial testing stages. Oh sure one or two is acceptable, but 6 completely different locations, including 2 stairs and 1 air vent you were MEANT to go into to progress the story? That's just pathetic.Game remains at 2/10 as initially rated. The rest of the game's fine, but the fact remains that after just 9 hours of standard play, I've had to reload unnecessarily 6 times? That renders the game borderline unplayable. Terrible game."
3577,corentin,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048978692/,6,,0,17.2,February,25,50,1,1,"First, ignore all the reviews mentioning stupid memes or irrelevant political stuff. This is off topic.I really wanted to love this game, I was mostly interested by the unique aesthetics. And the intro was absolutely great, walking in that city, I could feel great things comings.And then, after a fairly long tutorial, the real game started and it's quite disappointing so far. I have not made it very far (the 11 hours game play indication is literally because the game froze and did not quit while I went to bed; I must have had 4 or 5 hours of actual gameplay, including cut scenes and repeated sequences).The gameplay is really frustrating. The difficulty is one thing, and I could live with that, but having to just re-do a sequence from the beginning over and over again because you have trouble with one part at the end is just dumb gameplay mechanics. An actual example: I'm in a tunnel, two robots drop and I have to fight them (easy fight once you find the trick), then you have to do some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, slow climbing for a while, there are some animated sequences where you must avoid objects, you have some dialogues and explanations and tutorials, and then another powerful robot, and then more avoiding of moving object. What if one of those objects ♥♥♥♥♥ you up? You have to restart the whole sequence, the fighting, the climbing, the tutorials and dialogues and animated sequences, the fighting again. Nonsense.It makes the thing not fun at all, which is the opposite of the experience a video game must provide. I will probably try to continue a bit but this is getting really frustrating."
3578,DieNand,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DieNand/,2,,0,1.3,March,4,468,0,1,"I'm about 1.3 hours into the game, but I can't imagine playing through this.The game launched without the widely advertised RT features. This is was a disappointment for me and caught me off guard. I didn't really research this beforehand so it was a bit of a kick in the teeth when I opened the game and RT is entirely missing. One of the reasons why I became interested in the game in the first place was that it would support RT. The first RT thing I ran on my RT capable GPU was, in fact, one of the Atomic Heart feature demoes from 2019-ish. Despite this I tried to grin and bear and I started playing the game anyway, but it definitely left a sour taste in the mouth from the get go for me.You start off touring through this soviet era utopian world. It is beautiful, it's also quite a unique environment. Then everything is kinda derailed when the fancy robots start going bad. Not exactly the most... umm original idea ever. I mean, they can get some points for the world it is huge and beautiful, but that's about it.So that sounds pretty good so far, what gives, you ask? Well... the first thing that is sorta not for me is the constant bickering between the protagonist and his companion glove thingy. Why do people think this is an interesting narrative device? It's just a constant barrage of verbal diarrhea that I have to tune out in order to play. It adds nothing of value to the experience. Add to that the fact that the game pauses with tutorials or information on enemies etc. in the middle of this bickering and it is almost like the designers were like yeah ♥♥♥♥ it we don't really care about these conversations either. I don't know, I'm wondering why even bother adding it in in the first place!? The game is trying so bloody hard to be edgy with all the characters it added and it is painful to witness tbh. I don't know, maybe this is just an issue for me, but I cannot stand it. Definitely minus points from me here.The combat is alright, but my character sometimes does the sprint dodge thing without me even having pressed shift or double tapped a key and it's just odd. The axe is no fun to swing either, it just sorta passes through the enemies like there is no weight behind it. It's awkward at best. Wait for the game to tell you when to dodge the strong attack. :D (Also a prevalent thing in modern games) Anyway... the combat is fine, but nothing in the time I played seemed standout to me.Another pain point for me is the audio. In contrast to the visuals which are very good, it's almost like half the sounds are either muted, quiet or entirely missing and it just sours the experience overall. One point someone is firing a gun right up next to me and then stuff are exploding nearby and flying close to my head and all I can basically hear is faint pops and then music is suddenly drowning everything out. I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to audio and this game's audio is just bad... very little else to be said on that topic.Performance! The game performs really good, but I had a crash and some occasional stutters in weird places here and there. Nothing too serious, the game is very well optimized overall and the visuals are really good.Coming to the end of this review now, some people will probably like the game, but overall this just doesn't seem like my kind of game. I was looking forward to it, but I cannot imagine playing through this. Frankly I'd rather go play Bioshock again!"

It honestly felt rushed and too short.There's no sprint mechanic so you really have to rely on the dash mechanic button there are times where it falls short and you're stuck trying to jump and dash for an hour. For a main character that is almost super soldier like, how he cannot jump blows my mind.The puzzles are easy but sometimes do not make sense and you'll have to do your own acrobatics and skip some of the parts.The gun customization was lacking and could've had more to it besides looking cool.Overall Atomic Heart really had the potential to have a really captivating story because of the cyberpunk, raw, gore, existential feel to it. It really did have me invested at times and had some very nice guns but ultimately fell short."

The story was not good enough to put me back in to actually get into the game again so i walked through still noticing the little things. in one of the missions it barely told me how to get through like its the tutorial portion of the game i shouldn't have to google things and further more the fighting with the axe against the robots i would rather fight a 8 foot goblin then one of those robot i had to restart my game because in the save point were i died i just spawned in and got absolutely jumped and molested by 2 robots. Hope fully they fix the graphics and the frame drops and possibly put more fixes for the beginning and further down the line in the game overall for my 2 hours i give this game a 5/10 being generous because not only does the protagonist say some of the stupidest things ive heard he also says them wrong somehow like in his tone. The audio portion of this game is again meh 6/10.

I just kept feeling like every element in the game was not quite what I wanted it to be and left me disappointed. The STORY is meh and short leaving off with sort of a lame cliffhanger. Concept's already been done many times. Had a couple twists which I guess some ppl could appreciate--it certainly didn't hold my interest. I barely touched all the recordings, dead ppl dialogue, and such. Too much talking with such little substance. Beat it in 15 hours and it really wan't that rewarding. VISUALLY it's alright. Again, if it came out like 5+ years ago it would have been stunning. It ran great at 4K with my 4090, but the lack of some RTX features and HDR was sort of a surprise. COMBAT barely scratches the itch. Definitely wanted it to feel more like Doom. I wanted kill animations for the different bots--ripping off limbs with your tech etc--but nay, just shooting and slicing at what felt like nothing. It just wasn't visceral enough for what I assume the game wanted to accomplish. The open WORLD and map felt kind of confusing and pointless. Cool set pieces and the like but I would rather have had it been non-open world structure and be more linear. You can get a car but many of the routes force you to crash through enemies, which initially felt fun, until you realize the lil car can only take 4-5 hits until it will catch fire and explode. lol The SOUND DESIGN was really weird. Some parts were great and others there were literal SFX just plain missing. Some big flying machine would crash into another and there were just completely missing sound effects. It was really odd. This was throughout the game. Pretty poor sound design and it definitely detracted from the experience. The MUSIC: I was really hoping more of Mick's stuff, but honestly, the combat music starts when you fight enemies, and most of the time I'd kill them too quickly and the music just fades out immediately once you defeat them. It was really anticlimactic. The soundtrack as a whole I'd imagine is better than the actual game, but hardly got to hear it. All that said, it still had fun moments. I'd suggest buying it on sale as it's not worth the full price tag IMO. I rarely give a thumbs down review, but idk...my gut just told me that I wouldn't recommend this to my friends. Sort of a 'save your money and get it on sale in the future if you want.'"

The story is intriguing, the scenery is neat and all in all the entire game just feels polished. Everything on my settings was maxed out and not a single time did I feel as though I am getting stutters. I will be updating this when I get further into the game, but as for now I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Bioshock and would perhaps like an even more mature experience.Also, this game looked amazing from the gameplay trailers, but I was worried that it's too good to be true. So I held off with pre-ordering the standard edition. Nevertheless, as the positive reviews started coming in, I was just about to buy the standard version, but then I came across this irrational hatred towards Russians as if the entire country's population is evil and I decided to go for the gold edition. Thanks for that ""boycotters""."

First of all it keeps crashing, secondly, I had to install some third party software to hack the FOV to something that doesnt make me throw up on my ultrawide monitor. Apparently the game studio decided they already foiund the perfect FOV setting for you and it is already large enough. Well, it is not. Pretty arrogant of the devs to dictate what setting you are comfortable with.Technical issues aside, some other things that bothers me:- It is a first person game, and the game takes control of what you look at a lot. All this cutscene camera movement when you are not doing the movement yourself is really both annoying and a great way to get motion sickness. Probably the devs were sitting on tiny screens or a TV, on an ultrawide screen this forced camera shaking just make you want to puke.- Save points are far apart. It is really boring to go through picking up all the stuff in the lockers for the tenth time, because you got murdered before the next savepoint. Really a lot of repeating. They should definitively let your pickup be saved the moment you take something, so you never have to collect it again, like in most other modern games. Now finding stuff feels like a chore.- Very hard to play with keyboard. You need to use a lot of keys at the same time to be successful. This is fine on a controller, on a keyboard, I kept accidentally hitting the wrong buttons when the going got tough. Totally regret I didnt get the game on PS5.- The whole comrade Soviet Union thing they got going might be cool when the game development started, but... Well, you know what I mean...- I wish it was more open world, feels very linear so far. Too many cutscenes. Maybe it is better later, IDK, because the game keeps crashing..."

There seems to be elements from other games as well. Now granted there are a lot of similarities between games today as well when a game works well with perhaps the hud, graphics, mechanics, etc. It isn't to say no other game could use such things in their own IP. Here are two examples of games in which I felt I was also somehow playing Dying Light and DOOM. The Combat:The combat it fun and engaging. I honestly think that when you are up against tons of enemies and the music starts going it can a ton of fun. However really to me the combat is its most redeeming quality. I am not the best at going into great detail, but suffice to say if you do get this game you won't be fully disappointed in the combat. Yes the combat at times does have a lot of weirdness to it. Like for instance one of the perks you can get is taking zero damage when dodging. Because when you attempt to dodge sometimes it doesn't really do much because it seems like the enemies when they are going for you, you become some large magnet and they move with you when you attempt to dodge. The Story:Honestly the story was at first really intriguing, but as I kept playing I could get a sense of where the story was going, but the character you play seems to flip flop between whether who is right and who is wrong. Granted for some portions he had a justifiable reason, but there would be times where he seems extremely set in on his decision and two seconds later he does a complete 180 and says the opposite. Even though he had no reason to.  The end seemed the most confusing to me, I mean I understood it, I get what was happening, but for it to be the end just felt off and you get two different endings and the other option just cuts off right as you make it, no final thing to do. Just oh well since you say that THE END. NORA:If it isn't the combat it is NORA who I think stole the show for me. The only redeemable character and honestly the best character, but unfortunately highly unused. From her first introduction as basically a horny refrigerator that makes you smile just from what you hear her say, and how she says it. You expect for such a out there character you'd see her quite often. Well you don't I think I can recall like five times she does appear through the game, and the last one being near the end. NORA is a perk / upgrade station and so you come across one quite often, even to a point they'll leave one obviously right before a boss fight. These would have been perfect times for you to interact with NORA. However nope just some random default robotic female voice. Really wish they had NORA show up more. The dialogue in the game isn't ultimately terrible there is some great lines mainly NORA's, but other times it is feel awkward as characters talk. The game feels like one big fetch quest, cause it is get this to get here and I know that some game are actually quite like that, but I believe others do it much better. The open world aspect of the game feels unnecessary as the game itself feels quite linear, the only real thing you can do side wise from what I could find it just these little dungeon areas which gives you upgrades for you weapons. I only did one after I beat the story so it isn't even a necessity to do them. There isn't a lot in replay value, I have 27 hours into the game. I bought it on Monday when it came out and finished it on Wednesday and I worked mostly Tuesday and Wednesday. So the game is I would say near average length, but feels way shorter than the actual time frame. Granted honestly since I did die a few times it might be even shorter than the 27 hours I have on the game itself due to the extra time I spent getting around and even taking a break with leaving the game on. The game also takes place in Soviet Russia, but all the characters sound like they are from the U.S.. There is no Russian dub either so it slightly takes you out of the immersion of it's place setting. I really rate this game 5/10 probably as low as a 2/10. If you are interested in the game slap it into your wishlist and wait for it to be on a sale less than 50% off. Basically wait for it to get as cheap as possible. It certainly is not worth the different editions of $99.99 and $89.99 let alone the base amount which is what I bought it at for $59.99."

Great story and voice acting (could use with a few less f-bombs imo but still realistic and entertaining).  It's slow to start as it's mostly cinematic for first 10 minutes but I ended up appreciating the time and dedication to the build-up.It's essentially all of what the trailers that they provide show you. People should buy this game.  It's worth $60.  They deserve it.At one point, I was so caught up in the sounds and the situation that I was given a legit jump scare; worse than any horror movie that I can remember in years.Oh... and it's not woke.  It's such a breath of fresh air.  A beautiful breath of fresh air.  Just good fun without the evil garbage of pretending that we're all evil for believing in common sense and traditional values.

Theme and world building are great. Game however feels a bit janky and I'm not sold yet that its an outstanding ""GAME"" - its hard to describe my initial negative felings.For one there is no FOV slider. The developers have publicly stated that the FOV is greater than other games so it will not include an FOV slider. It feels way zoomed in. Another is general combat jank. The controls just feel kind of ""floaty"" and ""imprecise"". Melee feels ""clunky"" and ""oafish"" like your hits don't really connect. Most of the starting enemies are melee types and it just looks odd when they start charging after you and its really not that fun to actually get a kill. Starting shotgun kind of honestly sucks. IMO more bad guys that die quicker would have been more fun to start.Foul language does not bother me, but this game overuses it so much that it just becomes really corny. Also not really a fan of the general gameplay loop of having to craft all your weapons and constantly tend to them.That being said, the concept being partly bioshock partly wolfenstein has me intrigued enough to keep playing - maybe it will get better. 90% of the trailer is first 20 minutes footage which is honestly the coolest part I have experienced thus far - but once you get into the game proper its just kind of dull right now to me."

3637,BlaggyDeCat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/blaggycat/,13,7,0,2.1,February,21,333,0,1,"PROS:-Graphics are beautiful (most of the time), the beginning of the game is like a showcase, and then the devs went ""meh"" later on. Or maybe I just hate the repetitive and somewhat lazy level design. I get stuck on a lot of objects in this game. I'll also never understand why games show off a landscape that can't even fully render at max settings, like.. What are you showing off? All of the clipping trees? The low quality fog? The giant statues I can see texture seams on? What is it? Use those beautiful reflections to show me a man's face being pulverized by a robot.-Game runs like butter for how amazing it looks-Lots of upgrading, but you have to find upgrade schematics. F*** me, I hate fetch quests.-Insanely cool environment-Combat is actually pretty fun and challenging, but sometimes it's only challenging because it's glitchy.-Why is an upgrade station talking THAT dirty? Couldn't tell you, but I'll accept it. Bigshot character doesn't seem to enjoy having a girl tell him that she wants him to squirt his liquid inside of her. I mean c'mon, the way this chick is talking would be enough to turn Lil Nas straight ffs! Grow a ♥♥♥♥, me. Gah I hate playing this character.CONS:-Locked FOV-Forced to play as a hero who acts like a bigshot, has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitude, and even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes. I'm talkin' maximum cringe. His glove lets him do some badass stuff, yet he still bullies the hell out of it for no reason? The best bullying he could come up with is to say the glove's name slightly wrong everytime. If my hand could turn into a pocket♥♥♥♥♥, I think I'd be able to pronounce ""Ana de Armas"" correctly at least a few times. Have some respect, ""war hero"".-Confusing action sequences (Maybe due to not being able to see anything at a 55 degree FOV?) but it's really bad. I'm just lost everytime action starts, like.. isn't my adrenaline supposed to be pumping? It almost never is, and when it is, it last 3 seconds. Usually because bigshot war hero says something stupid. Was the writer watching family guy while he worked?-Badass music, but it's used wrong and doesn't contribute to gameplay or jumpscares.-Story could be great.. if it was written by anybody else.-Game could be scary, but there's so much cringe going on, I was just wincing the entire time. A robot's face opens up for a jump scare, but it's just.. not scary. Idk yo. I'm surprised the main character didn't start tickling the robot, because it seems like something the writers would add. The game feels like it has the same horror level as that one scene from IT where IT just starts dancing. Just because he's doing something weird and off doesn't make it scary.-The intro is kind of long, yet the first climax is so rushed? Everything goes to ♥♥♥♥ in like 5 seconds, but in a boring way. In a COD way.. if that makes sense to you. Basically, instead of you going ""Holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"", you go ""oop, okay, that just happe- oop, there she goes!""-The voice acting makes me want to blow my brains out.-Andrew Tate's Grandma won't give you a weapon despite you being a war hero.. okay. You go grandma, but f*** you. I wanna go ham too, but nooooo, russian babushka knows how to use a rocket launcher and makes me feel like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. I'll drop your ass next time I see you crossing the road, Grandma.-Puzzles are confusing, which makes for great puzzles, except that I accidentally solved a few puzzles (in a row) without knowing how, sooo... Does the game know I have a 28 IQ, so it just lets me randomly click the pretty lights and win everytime? Or am I just getting lucky? Or are they not actually puzzles? Idk.-Looting is fun for the first 10 minutes, then it becomes a hassle. You'd think sucking loot into your pocket♥♥♥♥♥ is better than searching each individual drawer, but is it really? Most games already allow you to search entire desks without having to search each drawer. I guess the best part is, you don't have to sit through an animation.. Unless you pick up a f**king audio ""pocket watch"" and get forced into an animation to stare at it, over, and over, and over. Do majority of players even listen to audio clips?-When crouched, the corners of your screen get dark, which is okay, but for some reason the shadows in the game get WAYYY more intense at the corners and sides of my screen? Wtf? Why should I get tunnel vision just because I'm crouched? Do I have low blood sugar? Does my character need a pixie stick?-The Russian Propaganda is a HUGE oof, but eh. If Wolfenstein had been released while Germany was trying to start WW3, it would have had the same effect, but I still would have loved the game. Also, wtf is with China? lol. I'm not a big politics guy, but you can feel a few agendas being pushed. I even got a large ""Amazon is going to take over the world"" vibe. TLDR:I love what the game could be, I'm just hardly immersed in the world, despite how beautifully creepy it is. The pacing for jumpscares and action is so off. FOV is atrocious and you'll need a 3rd party tool to fix it. The main character is a pathetic, cringe-y loser. Jumpscares are weak. Game just doesn't feel polished, but Gah damn I could stare at some of those textures for hours. Incels would enjoy this game, which is why I have to give it above a 5.6/10 in it's current state, but still not recommended. Might as well get Xbox game pass to play the game for $10. F**k you, Andrew Tate's Babushka."
3638,Klaus Malzbier,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043643865/,31,5,0,2.3,February,21,465,14,1,"Basically a soviet Bioshock. There are references to Bioshock many times. The game starts with a lot of propaganda about soviet Russia and so on. I know all fictional but still weird.The dialogues are unbearable and  the the protagonist thinks everything is either stupid or ♥♥♥♥. Do not support this game. Rather support a game from Ukraine like Stalker 2. We all heard the the developer Mundfish:-The dev’s of Atomic Heart are pro-Russian, and support the war in Ukraine.-The game is funded by Russian oligarchs (Tencent, Gaijin, GEM Capital).-The lead dev’s used to work in Russia’s biggest propaganda studios, so they have connections with the government (same studios that mis spread information about the war in Ukraine).- One of the rulers of GEM Capital goes by the name of Anatoli Pali, he used to be a top manager of Gazprom (a Russian state Energy company). While these kinds of companies say they are private, in countries like Russia, they are totally controlled by the government. Yet these are the companies that support Mundfish.-When you read the user agreement presented to you when playing Atomic Heart, it specifies that “Your personal data will be shared with FSB”, aka, ex-KGB. I’m serious, look into it! They even removed the page when people started calling them out.-Their office was originally in Moscow, but due to the war in Ukraine and the attention they were getting, they decided to cover up their “origins” and relocate to Cyprus.-When confronted about the war, they will ban/report you, labeling you as a “spammer”. I even double-checked their official discord server and it is FULL of Russians who blatantly post memes and conversations about how “Russia is amazing” and “Ukraine sucks”, yet they dont get banned.-Robert Bagratuni (CEO of Mundfish), used to be a top manager of MailRU (VK). Currently, VK actively supports the Russian Army through its social network and has deep connections with the Russian government. The current CEO of VK is Vladimir Kirienko, who is the son of Sergey Kirienko. Sergey Kirienko is the First Deputy Head of the administration of Russia, and he himself was one of the people that helped Putin start the war in Ukraine.-The fact that the game is releasing on Feb 20th, near Feb 24th (The Invasion of Ukraine), is VERY ODD. The idea that out of all the 365 days they could’ve chosen to release the game, it was just a few days before THEIR country invaded Ukraine, feels like an odd coincidence.-If they truly supported Ukraine and were against their oppressive government, they wouldn’t just create a half-@55ed tweet that keeps the announcement “neutral”. A good example can be the company WarGaming: a Russian/Belarus company that openly protested against the war in Ukraine, relocated its offices to Poland AND earned over 1 million dollars of donations to the Ukrainian AID organization.Save your money and support Ukrainian devs, they’ll need it more than these RuZZians.Go pre-order instead STALKER 2, REPLACED, or the War of Mine.If you are down to a lot of propaganda, stupid jokes and firefights then I recommend this game.But If you think its really a Bioshock I have to disappoint you. Its not that great and does not even come close to it."

Keep that in mind when I tell you NO ONE speaks with a Russian accent in this game. The main character is a born and bred Russian but sounds like he's from the American Mid-West. The lack of said Russian accent truly hinders the immersion for the players. Some of the music choices made by the developers doesn't help either.* Synthwave in the weapons/skills upgrade menu as well as computer messages just doesn't fit in a game set in the 1950's. In a game filled with retro sci-fi technology as well as robots, one variety of which I couldn't help but notice looks like a knock off of the Big Daddy of the previously mentioned Bioshock games, the part where I throw my hands up and say ""No effing way"" is the scarcity of guns in a place where there are dead soldiers all over the place. Aside from the occasional instance when the character gets stuck in the floor and you have to reload the game, the level design is fantastic. You can tell the developers put a lot of care and research into it. A shame they didn't put that same energy into the other aspects. If you're going to play this game I highly suggest buying it when it is on sale at 50% off at least.* Very minor spoiler. I am aware In the game it is explained that the scientists have found a way to predict what future music would sound like. Personally I think that  it would've been better for the developers to leave this out as previously stated it takes away from the setting."

The pacing of this game also makes 0 sense for the first good 6 hours youre stuck with the KS23 which ingame is called KC because thats how it looks in Russian but thats not important. What is important is the fact that you have 3-5 weapons that youre stuck with for 80% of the game and then get all the other weapons quickly stuffed in the last segment of the game. And the fact that its a ""free world"" doesnt matter as you never need to visit the other dungeons to even fight the bosses as they are all easier than the game itself / open world segments.

Finally the Russian propaganda was pretty heavy handed at the beginning and totally tone def to the world this game just released into.  They did try and mend that when you are worshiping at Stalins feet and you change the radio in your car and the main protagonist says ""I hate politics"".  I am sure there are some cool parts but seemed like a poor mans Bioshock and had to jump ship for now.  When it is $20 or so I might pick it back up but time will tell."

I do not like replaying an area when you get to a damn boss fight at the end of each long run. Then losing, just to go back all through the same crap again. Just is so damn boring and irritating . Though the game is pretty graphic wise but, it was done on Unreal4 engine. So being done this way was not hard to accomplish considering it does most of the lighting and shading effects for you.I also hated that I couldn't look around in most of the movie like scenes. You don't get the feeling of a big area to explore. They seem to want to make you feel like there is a vast area but limits you like this with no view. Just a very slight head turn is all you get. For me this game is just to limiting . I wish that I had watched someone else playing before I purchased Atomic Heart. I just thought that this would scratch my Fallout 4 itch and it didn't. I didn't want to ruin any experience I thought I was sure to have. That was a mistake.To late for a refund so I will push through playing my moneys worth . I hope."

Thank you for sponsoring bombs shelling Ukraine. Return it back while you can or don't buy.UPD: I played it a bit. Even putting aside my first comment, it is just a mediocre game. It is basically Bioshock Infinite but worse and more expensive. FOV is a BIG mess, you can't see enemies properly, and a fighting system coming from Skyrim with dashes is a joke. The only good part about this game is its stylistics. But even this gives a false perspective to what the USSR is\was.  You are trying to romanticize the second worse thing to the Third Reich. Imagine Blaskovitz was SS officer trying to save Reich from collapsing, would you consider it a good plot? The big problem is that western players just simply don't know what was USSR."

I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

3708,| нsт | Victorino Mora,https://steamcommunity.com/id/blazebby/,19,4,0,2.5,February,22,705,5,1,"Okay.. I don't usually write a review 2 hours into the game, but this game is extremely insufferable. No, just no. Go back to the writing board and try again. Easily a 2/10. World building. The world and scenic are incredible, beautiful colors, deep lore to fantasize and a lot of thought was put into crafting the environment you are playing. Performance: You guys did it, a game that actually performs with excellent visuals and minimal hicks. Congratulations because that's where the entire focus of the game went to.From this point on, I have nothing good to say about this game. In fact I already know the shellers are going to be pissed I didn't find mommy robotic milkers to be enjoyable. As someone who doesn't need to justify their 60$ with Buyer's Stockholm Syndrome I can actually critique this for the piece of ♥♥♥♥ it is. Mechanics: There's no FOV slider, so anyone who enjoys playing at 55FOV this is the game for you. Mouse acceleration is turned on and is insanely annoying. Head bobbing during cutscene's and camera shake nearly got me motion sick (and turning it down does not help.) Ray Tracing looks horrible, it looks fairly decent in the first 20 minutes of the game but it quickly makes everything looked washed out.  Minor bugs that resulted in my death from falling out of the map. Gameplay: Non existent and yet somehow repetitive and boring. The game is a literal theme park ride. You sit down and watch things happen to your character. The first hour (TUTORIAL) consists of you walking from point A to point B while the cuff from Forspoken talks to you nonstop, after finally finishing the walking simulation you witness a cutscene followed by an elevator ride (WHOOO!! FUN!!) And what proceeds after elevator ride?? Watching grandma use Ak47 shoot robots while you hold a key (WHOA!!!!!!!!!) And finally when the game give's you an inkling that it's time for you to play, back to the trolly you go because you'll be watching another cutscene play out as you sit through disaster's happening. Story: There's definitely something there, it reminds me of Bioshock and I wish I could enjoy it but the characters just simply won't shut up. Every 5 seconds it's a statement or a comment about something that's happening or where you need to go. Every time I question why this or why that, it immediately gets fact vomited in my direction. Characters: I hated Jackie from Cyberpunk, and I disliked how the game killed him in the first 30 minutes and tried to make it seem like I cared or should have cared. This game pulls the exact same stunt, why should I care about any of these characters? They show up just to die, and in the little spotlight they are given to give their one liners I'm annoyed to hear them even speak. Just shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.I played it on the hardest mode as I always do. And to sum up my 2 hour experience. I watched crazy things happening that the game refused to include me into, and I swung-dodged my way through Robot Hitler with occasional 4-5 shotgun blasts to the face. Overall even with the magic abilities you get the game still lacked enjoyment. And if I had to give it numbers.   WAIT FOR A DEEP DEEP DEEP SALE IF YOU WANT THIS GAME."

While I don't mind separating the game from the IRL ethics of it. The Game just doesn't play well for me given the amount of time they had. It may have improved over the long haul of the game but I wasn't looking to play much more with the lame dialogue weird serious story telling presented. From lots of taking away from the player character in the first half and quick time events that come off as outdated to me. As an Ultra widescreen gamer being shoved into the elbows and barely able to see around me made melee combat feel sluggish and a chore. I didn't have any enjoyable melee experience and the Shooting was just rough around the edges with the KS-23 feeling oddly terrible. For a game that's supposedly is a propaganda ""monster"" they heavily underrepresented the KS-23 that thing is an absolute unit destoryer IRL and for it to feel so meh felt like a slap on the pp.Pick this up when it goes on sell if you wanna experience Russian Bioshock, I would also recommend you use the Russian Language with English subtitles for a better story experience and to get rid of the bad EnglishVA"

No sprint, no crouch, game wants you to be stealthy and stuff but doesnt tell you how.  3). In game upgrade menus are terrible, explain nothing and are unintuitive.4). Game has unskippable cut scenes that are LOOOONG, you basically play for 5 minutes then watch 10 of cut scenes.5). Visually its not terrible, but something about the animation gives me serious motion sickness. 6). Gives you very little resources, then you waste them, the same button that reloads uses a health pack on occasion, also the shotgun fires when exiting upgrade menu, wasting a round.Looked great in the beginning, had very high hopes.

I really want to love this game, it has all the ingredients to be something special, but what ruins it for me is the combat. You cannot tell how dire a situation is, nor when to dodge unless there is a red circle, and there isn't always a red circle. I've died seeing the enemy swing on the last bit of a fade to black. Maybe if it was even slightly more forgiving, and I'm saying this as a die-hard souls fan, it could be ok. But the damage dealt per attempt in this game is erratic and unbalanced. As much as I really want to love this, I cannot recommend it - it also isn't even compatible with my widescreen, everything is distorted unless I use Flawless Widescreen as a 3rd party solution. Just dumb for dumb reasons when it has so much going for it."

3759,Saugan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/buymyshit/,14,2,0,2.2,February,21,"1,043",2,1,"This game has the subtlety and pace of an atomic bomb. The dialogue and pace of the game moves so fast you'd think that the developers were expecting the players to have horrible ADHD. The exposition is shoved down your throat so quickly that the main character and his companion were beginning conversations just after I entered combat. It's hilarious, considering how at the beginning of the game it tells the player to ""Slow down and appreciate the world around you"".Now sure, the dialogue and pacing may be absurdly fast and written in a way that makes you think that the developers were aliens trying to write a game that humans will think was written by humans, but that doesn't mean that the entire game should be completely written off right?From a technical standpoint, the game seems to be decently solid.The audio seems to be unremarkable from what I've heard so far.Visually, the game is pretty, and interesting to look at.However, the gameplay itself is clunky and disappointing. Unfortunately the gameplay tries, rather unsuccessfully due to the insane pace, to lean into the horror aspects of the setting. Guns and melee feel under-powered against the very first enemies you have to deal with. Despite the game shoving mechanics and exposition down your esophagus, the actual combat tries to be slow and calculated. Enemies take a lot of damage to put down, attack quickly, and deal a lot of damage. Because of the rapid fire speed of the rest of the game, it feels like a slog to fight anything. The game tries to incentivize using different methods to fight the enemies, but the best tactics are always the ones that require the least thought. There is also next to no ammo for the shotgun, despite it taking more than one shot at point blank to kill an enemy. It almost makes the shotgun feel like it isn't worth the effort.All of that was my impression from the first hour. From what I played I was already dreading what playing the rest of the game was like, so I refunded. The experience might change, but I doubt it if this was the part of the game that they wanted to hook players into the rest of it."

I just dont enjoy game and i will not make same mistake with this game as i did with hogward legacy. Refund. Notice this is second game where MC is talking to his glove. Every time i hear them talking i have desire alt f4. MC is borderline retarded or at least suicidal. He just constantly have desire to use this devices controled by feral robots. I have teory that protagonist is robot just because how human characters react to what is he doing.  Anyway this game is obviosly not for me but it will maybe get better later. I am not going to risk it.

Yet these are the companies that support Mundfish.-When you read the user agreement presented to you when playing Atomic Heart, it specifies that “Your personal data will be shared with FSB”, aka, ex-KGB. I’m serious, look into it! They even removed the page when people started calling them out.-Their office was originally in Moscow, but due to the war in Ukraine and the attention they were getting, they decided to cover up their “origins” and relocate to Cyprus.-When confronted about the war, they will ban/report you, labeling you as a “spammer”. I even double-checked their official discord server and it is FULL of Russians who blatantly post memes and conversations about how “Russia is amazing” and “Ukraine sucks”, yet they dont get banned.-Robert Bagratuni (CEO of Mundfish), used to be a top manager of MailRU (VK). Currently, VK actively supports the Russian Army through its social network and has deep connections with the Russian government. The current CEO of VK is Vladimir Kirienko, who is the son of Sergey Kirienko. Sergey Kirienko is the First Deputy Head of the administration of Russia, and he himself was one of the people that helped Putin start the war in Ukraine.-The fact that the game is releasing on Feb 20th, near Feb 24th (The Invasion of Ukraine), is VERY ODD. The idea that out of all the 365 days they could’ve chosen to release the game, it was just a few days before THEIR country invaded Ukraine, feels like an odd coincidence.-If they truly supported Ukraine and were against their oppressive government, they wouldn’t just create a half-@55ed tweet that keeps the announcement “neutral”. A good example can be the company WarGaming: a Russian/Belarus company that openly protested against the war in Ukraine, relocated its offices to Poland AND earned over 1 million dollars of donations to the Ukrainian AID organization.Save your money and support Ukrainian devs, they’ll need it more than these RuZZians.Go pre-order instead STALKER 2, REPLACED, or the War of Mine."

It was a country that copied everything from the despised West. Car manufacturing, architecture, technology, children's toys, the pioneer movement, and even the recipe for ""delicious"" soviet sausages & ice cream were borrowed from the Americans.Years go by and nothing changes. We have received a low-quality copy of Bioshock with a weak plot and very boring gameplay. I think you can only play it out of pity for the developers and if the price is around $5-$10.P.S.

3829,LFP Gaming,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lfpg/,7,2,0,5.2,February,22,"1,072",0,1,"Pros:  The graphics are nice (but there's many things, like the character's right hand, that evidently weren't paid any attention to in the graphics dept.)Cons:  Has Denuvo Malware The game has 5 melee weapons and 7 guns, so calling this a 'First Person Shooter' is really inaccurate, it's more of a 'First Person Hack & Slash' Ammo/bullets are given to the player very, very sparingly. 3 Hours into the game, I had picked up a grand total of only 14 shotgun bullets. It's very evident that the VAST amount of the game (70%+) is going to be played with a melee weapon. The game has copyrighted music in it even when you select ""Streamer Mode"" in the game settings. I still received a copyright notice on my video, eventhough I played the game with ""Streamer Mode"" on. The voice acting is bad and every voice line's delivery is stiff The game has no music to speak of. When I think of the Wolfenstein games, I think of the fantastic music it had, especially during combat, but this game just has none. There's no FOV option at all The game has TONNES of invisible walls. Instead of realistically designing the environment, the devs rather opted to just slap down invisible walls everywhere The game has several bugs, the WORST of which, is that the 'scanning' ability (alt on the keyboard) doesn't actually work 100% of the time, and since a HUGE amount of the game revolves around you scanning for enemies/loot/collectables, I'd say it's a pretty massive issue that this ability doesn't even function in a smooth and reliable way. The tutorial is poor and doesn't teach you a tonne of necessary stuff No colorblind accessibility options You can walk through a flock of birds on the ground and they don't budge, infact you can literally step on them and they don't react. The 'skill system' is pretty weak. There's like 7 skills to choose from. And if you compare this against Wolfenstein Youngblood's skill system, then this game's skill system is absolute dog water. One of the founders of Mundfish, Sedova Evgeniya, spends the profits from the game on massively opulent luxuries, like 24karat gold steaks in Dubai (you can see it on her fb page), and I'm sorry but I'm simply not OK with supporting that kind of 'evil supervillain' type behaviour, which is another reason why you shouldn't buy this game. Instead of donating money to a charity, they're eating 24karat gold steaks (and who knows what the hell ever else they're doing, if they're publicly doing THAT). So your money is literally going into the pocket of some insanely rich Dubai sheikh.Get Wolfenstein instead, seriously... this game is $60 and isn't even worth $30 if you compare it to games like Wolfenstein or Far Cry 5... I can see why they released the game on Gamepass for $1, because that's exactly how much the game is worth... just $1... and the regional pricing of the game is really terrible too (thanks to Focus Entertainment) because the game costs easily 500% too much in many countries (like my own). I just can't recommend this game over other FPS games in the genre.For more reviews, visit my curator page: For my full recommended list of games:"

There isn't any more. :(  (There are DLCs promised, hopefully those will bring more.)- Save often, it is easy to screw up and also there are occasional problems (getting caught of stuff and I had 1 crash so far, so really it is better than most AAA, especially considering I'm playing on linux, which is usually the worst case scenario)(- I haven't finished the main story yet, but ppl are saying it is bad somehow idk, thought I would mention this).Verdict: Is it worth the money?

The metal music during boss fights are epic and the assortment of weapons (Including one that shoots saw blades from a stick) are awesome and fun to mess around with. However the english dialogue is very dry and kind of ruin cutscenes for me. Overall a good game but I hope if they do make a second one they make the story a little easier to understand especially with how both endings are very underwhelming.

The story and environment is pretty good, and the music is top tier stuff. Control wise, it's not ground breaking but it works fine. The only issue I had was only around the character getting stuck on terrain or objects which forced me reload. This happened enough times (since you need to dash a lot) to annoy me but they've somewhat fixed it now (bringing up the pause menu lets you jump again after unpausing).Variety is probably the biggest weakness of this game as you don't have that many powers to use or enemies to fight. It's not a glaring issue since the game isn't that long, but I was expecting a bit more considering the full AAA price."

I would recommend watching it on YouTube though.PROS:The scenery and textures for everything are absolutely beautiful.The concept behind the story is a fresh twist on how people could live with sci-fi technology right after WW2. (like Fallout)The weapon handling is great.CONS:The actual story that they use is broken i.e. sometimes P-3(the player) talks in a cut scene like the conversation right before hand never happened. Then after the cut scene he talks like he remembers both. Almost like there was supposed to be alternate ways of getting to a location where you can skip parts of the story.Way too many mechanics where it feels like they purposely put a wall climb or a long drive just to remind the player that they had said mechanics in the game.The amount of facilities that you have to go to is insane and about 80% of them look the same just with a new gimmick.the amount of stupid locks and doors is so absurd that there is a section of dialog where P-3 even thinks its stupid for a building full of the worlds smartest people to have a lock which is essentially a children's toy.The people in it are like half done models. They have textures but they have almost no correct shading and they show almost no real emotion in the face.(like fallout characters)And last but certainly not least P-3. He acts like hes a soldier then a random civilian that has no previous training. Now all of a sudden hes depressed then gets mad then acts like friends then back to being a soldier. Also if your walking up behind an enemy with a good 30 feet between you, the common thought would be to point a gun at them. Not a glove that can do nothing until melee range. Seriously that is like taking brass knuckles to a gun fight."

The music is super good from the ambient tracks to the songs that play on the radio and during combat. The story is simple, but still interesting and had some unexpected twists.

It looks very nice if not great at times, ran really smoothly (mostly, I had about one crash per 8 hours of play). I enjoyed the gameplay and gun fighting, there are decent weapon upgrade and and ability trees to unlock as you go and they were decently paced with the game though I think they are meant to be a two-playthrough process to complete. There were a couple of weapons and skill trees I basically didn't touch in  my single playthrough and it didn't really matter because I felt like I was outpacing the challenge for the most part. I enjoyed the imagination behind the story and aesthetics, I though it had a lot of interesting social and science fiction elements to sustain my interests on that front. The story and dialog are not the strongest imo. All of that said, there is a element of hollowness this game gave me that is a bit hard to explain, the sum of all of it's parts is pretty good but I also can't help like feeling there are some holes that could be filled across the board.I tentatively recommend this game. If you like a shooter adventure with some interesting elements and sleek aesthetics you could enjoy this."

Graphics are a clear 10/10, story is a 7/10 (Really needed some more subtlety and more/just better general arguments for either side of the characters viewpoints. I do like they argue their case though instead of being braindead badguys.) Combat is honestly the weakest part of the game. Just aim and shoot. Sometimes sap and such. Very limited abilities and the few there are, are kinda meh and seen before (And honestly done better then. However the graphics help make the combat more interesting by making somewhat partially destructible enemies.) So 5/10ish combat. Very average shoot n shoot. Fairly few weapons, pointlessly many melee weapons. But overall the setting is great. A lot of people said this game was like Bioshock, Wolfenstein or fallout. Honestly, I thought it felt more like Singularity but more bloated."

A lot of inspiration went into the game. the hand magnet feature is very cool. . a few bugs, a LOT of Frame issues (the start to mid of the game was clustered with frame-drops, freezes and even crashes), puzzles get complex and pretty annoying VERY quickly. even the main protagonist is fed up with them. No sprint feature (had to get a sprint mod). Game encourages stealth but its harder to kill in stealth plus very slow crouch feature. also the main protagonist gets toxic at everything he talks to (its not his fault, hes fed up with talking to machines). your also gonna wonder why your in the middle of the game and you still haven't unlocked half your weapon arsenal. 8/10 because it was FUN. would definitely play again."

The story is attractive. The USSR style universe with a mix of retrofuturism. A bit like the last wolfenstein movies. It's kind of bioshok-like. The gameplay is easy to pick up the weapons are pretty unique. I'm trying to do the game on apocalypse difficulty at the moment. It's pretty affordable.Apart from the frequent bugs of being stuck in some kind of invisible wall or between 2 crates when jumping that kind of problem there. In this case, you have to save regularly to avoid losing too much time of your progress and restarting when this kind of problem occurs. I hope that the developers will correct this small handicap. The game remains pleasant to play. And we dive into it easily. If you're not too tempted and don't have money to spend, don't pick it up or wait for the sales. This single player game is well worth our time. On top of that, it's a game made by small developers and not the usual big names in video games.FR:Atomic heart.Pour est un jeu que j'attendais depuis longtemps et je ne regrette clairement pas mon achat.

Le gameplay est facile à prendre en main les armes sont assez unique en leur genre. J'essaie de faire le jeu en difficulté apocalypse pour le moment. C'est assez abordable.Hormis les bugs fréquents d'être coincé dans un genre de mur invisible ou entre 2 caisses en sautant ce genre de problème là. Dans ce cas-là, il faut faire régulièrement des sauvegardes pour éviter de perdre trop de temps de notre progression et de relancer quand ce genre de problème survient. J'espère que les développeurs corrigeront ce petit handicape. Le jeu reste agréable à jouer. Et nous nous y plongeons dedans facilement. Si vous n'êtes pas trop tenté et que vous n'avez pas de l'argent à dépenser ne le prenez pas ou attendre les soldes. Ce jeu solo vaut largement que nous nous y attardons. En plus de cela, c'est un jeu fait par des petits développeurs et pas les habituels grands noms du domaine vidéoludique."

The graphics, gameplay, and music are all top notch and I had a lot of fun exploring the open world and encountering all of the enemies the game throws at you. A few game design choices that others had issues with, the ""respawning"" enemies and a couple QTE boss fights, were not too much of a negative for me. You can disable the bots that repair enemies in a region for awhile if you want and I only died to one QTE in the whole game, the game gives you plenty of time to react to each button prompt.

I was definitely hooked but wondered if it would ever see release. It was wonderful to finally have Atomic Heart come to fruition and I was amazed to see it even ended up looking better than much of the pre-release footage! And RTX isn't even implemented yet!!This is seriously up there with the most graphically beautiful games out now, alongside Red Dead 2 and Metro Exodus, the art team should be really proud. The gameplay itself draws most comparisons to BioShock but is unfortunately a lot more restrictive with the special abilities of its main character. P-3 only has three real useful powers - Shok for robots, Mass Telekinesis for lifting/slamming enemies, and Polymeric Jet for Plyushes. Frost and Shield in my opinion are useless/redundant.While the combat is ultimately held back by certain limitations like a small skill tree and minor weapon mods, what is on offer is still a hell of a good time! The melee weapons especially are nicely meaty-sounding and a visual treat! The Zvezdochka fully-ugraded with double saws is the best one hands-down - sending spinning saws to chop robots and mutants apart was every bit as fun as I hoped it would be ever since I saw the Plyush boss trailer.I cannot recommend Atomic Heart harder enough, it is a 9/10 teetering on greatness but has flaws. The story is a bit convoluted but still has a charm and definite sense of style, no less helped by the amazing art team. I chose to play with Russian VA since I've heard how bad the English dub is. While this was more immersive and I recommend it, the subtitles have not been correctly implemented in certain dialogues for gameplay, cutscenes and even more troubling - audio logs on computers. So be aware you may lose out on certain bits of story information with Russian voices.The amount of puzzles in the game is also overkill, but ultimately it was a nice way to break up the combat sections and keep things fresh which I appreciated. It needs more balance but for their first game, the devs at Mundfish should feel extremely accomplished. I look forward to whatever project they tackle next."

HELL YEAH, COUNT ME IN Atomic Heart just became my favorite game ever. I wasn't expecting to be this damn good. Congrats to the developers who did a great job !The story is...something else. I don't want to spoil anything but the idea of a Soviet Union with robots and music from the future is AWESOME. There are some twists here and there that you can't see coming. Phenomenal story.The gameplay kicks ass. Shooting, driving, using a smart glove to fight robots. Sounds insane but it is cool as hell.The music is, as I said earlier, SICK. The Russian people have some sick music that I had no idea of and now I am listening to the soundtrack on repeat. The mix of classical songs with fast songs = mindblowingThe characters are cool. I really liked Comrade Major and Charles. Such a cool duo. Comrade Major's lines are hilarious. Crispy critters, the set of characters the game is offering is really well done.Atomic Heart is a masterpiece, the team behind it did an amazing job. The game is EPIC. I want Atomic Heart 2.

It had some of my favorite elements of the Wolfenstein Games, and Bioshock series with really fun action and gameplay. I felt like the games intensity was really balanced; everytime i thought i was starting to get O.P. the game would step it up a bit by introducing new enemies or larger quantities of enemies but not in an obnoxious way. The puzzles (reminded me slightly of portal), lockpicking, looting, and crafting were all elements that i really like in games like this, and the game was very story rich with excellent voice acting. This game is definately in my personal favorites list. I just really hope they find a way to expand on this universe with a sequel or some DLCs that are worth while."

(Last update did fix a lot and noticed a lot less bugs since)Pros: -The world building is the biggest thing this game has going for it, an alternate version of the Soviet Union is fun to explore and there is no shortage of lore, which for the most part is interesting-The graphics are very good and some of the areas look amazing-Game has a unique look and feel to it, which is rare in the current recycling era in gaming-Dialogue is enjoyable and the personalities of the characters make the pseudo science mumbo-jumbo easy to digestCons:-A lot of bugs-The open world part of the game is boring/tedious and unnecessary-Too many puzzles, which slow down the game considerably and are more tedious than challengingNeutral:-The story is a mixed bag with an unsatisfying ending but is good enough to keep you interested throughout-The combat is fun but towards the middle of the game where ammo management is no longer a factor, it just becomes too simple and all challenge is goneIn conclusion, I do recommend this game since it was a memorable experience that I enjoyed overall but best to wait for a sale!"

3977,aesen1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091452488/,No,1,0,2.4,March,20,164,0,1,"A pretty looking game with a few major flaws. To preface this, I refunded the game a couple hours in, so its possible that these issues were addressed in later parts, but I wouldn't hold my breath.Two issues that compound on each other. First, the main character is unlikable. He comes off as a whiny child when talking to the JARVIS thats built into his hand. Second, the characters never shut tf up. Its like the writers mandated at least one conversation per room between Jarvis and Gruff McGrufferson. The game needs to let story moments breathe so the player can think about whats happening and soak it in instead of having man child complain about every little thing directly into their ear. Both Prey and BioShock (infinite excluded) have silent protagonists which pair extremely well with the desolate atmosphere. Those games, even infinite, are tonally consistent and it works. Even if the protagonist is unlikable, as long as theyre silent for most of the game it doesnt matter too much, but this game has both problems. This is by far the biggest issue the game has and it made my short time with the game unbearable. Which brings me to the next point. Tone. This game is a tonal mess that cant decide if it wants to be serious or goofy and arcadey. You go from watching a guy who risked his life (through dialogue) to save yours get sliced in half by a laser to sex fridge in about 30 seconds. The intro is like an hour long and completely unskippable. Nothing of consequence really happens during the introduction except the devs get to show off the admittedly impressive visuals. I don't think the game even explains what your objective is until after you land in the tutorial zone and get to taste combat for the first time. The english dub is unintentionally funny in parts because of the delivery of some of the lines. Subtitles are often wrong as well, though this is a minor point. The looting system is neat in concept, but using the scanner to check for unopened containers is rather tedious and the loot magnet wasn't very engaging. I like the idea, which is make gameplay faster and spend less time on looting, but it still came off as a chore instead of actually intelligently scavenging for supplies. The loot magnet needs to be constantly grabbing stuff for you to be able to constantly have it active. I would very much prefer if you could just hold the button down indefinitely instead of having to wait for the animation finish and press it again because you didnt mouse over a filing cabinet in the half a second buffer that it gives you.With the flaws out of the way, its time to focus on positives. The game is very pretty to look at, and when the player isnt experiencing tonal whiplash, the atmosphere works quite well. Texture work is quality, with a few odd things here and there that you wont notice unless you look for them.Shaders are precompiled on startup which every game needs to do from here on out. The FOV slider isnt a slider, its an increment and decrement button and it was patched in after release, but still better than nothing and better late than never. Mouse acceleration was also turned off in a post release patch. Other PC features include FSR, DLSS 3.0, and a few other things. About what you expect from a PC port, which is all nice. I didnt play enough to see all the combat had to offer, so im just going to say that its a bit shallow, but still fun and works for the game. This game is probably worth playing on game pass or on steep discount, do not buy it at launch price. Maybe its better if you turn off dialogue volume."
3978,Horny Stepdad,https://steamcommunity.com/id/chinggiskhan/,No,,1,11.1,March,20,246,0,1,story was good. good spin on the soviet unions use of human capital to achieve its goals. however the developers created a really good looking world set in a soviet utopia in the clouds... then promptly sent you to the ground for the entire game. i dunno for 60 bones i was expecting more. wait till its at 20$ at the most. just a glossed up bioshock.

As of this review, I'm dealing with a game breaking bug preventing progression. Another is during the course of the game, you can sabotage towers to disable bots. Which is mandatory for exploration as bots can be infinitely revived by infinitely respawning repair bots. These towers are supposed to be repaired by bots and reactivate. These towers can glitch and don't get repaired. This can prevent you from getting loot, or even access to puzzle rooms that reward you weapon mods (which are the only way to attain mods). You'll face several glitches during your time playing.Next is gameplay.Similar to Bioshock, you can unlock and improve special abilities. The problem here is you're only allowed to equip 3 out of the 5 abilities at one time. One of those being hard locked for story progression. For some reason the Dev's thought it would be a good idea to have NO SPRINTING. You read that correctly, there is NO SPRINTING IN THIS GAME. Your character speed walks everywhere at the beginning and unlocks ""running"" via character tree. The issue here is several boss/mini-boss/enemy encounters require a lot of movement. You're only given a single dodge. There is double dodge, but you have to unlock that too.Lastly is narrativeHere we have another strange decision by the dev team. They thought it was a good idea for your character to talk about important narrative stuff in the middle of combat. Your character also spouts one liners in combat. So your character is talking about the narrative while in combat and will interrupt that conversation with a one liner as well.While I understand it's from a indie dev, but they charge AAA game prices. Higher prices have higher expectations in my opinion."
3987,Shinumino,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shinumino/,No,,1,37.2,March,20,501,0,1,"Atomic Heart é um jogo de tiro de ação com um estilo de arte chamado ""sovietpunk"", que combina temas sci-fi, soviéticos e designs industriais. Infelizmente, o jogo sofreu um pouco com as vendas devido ao preconceito de algumas pessoas em relação ao fato de ser desenvolvido por um estúdio russo. Entretanto, a jogabilidade é excelente, sem bugs ou erros notáveis, o que é raro nos dias de hoje. Embora no lançamento o jogo tenha tido um problema grave com a falta de opção no FOV, esse problema foi corrigido posteriormente com um patch.A história do jogo segue P3 e seu companheiro Charles, que discutem diversos assuntos sobre o governo comunista e como a sociedade funciona, permitindo que os jogadores conheçam mais sobre as crenças e lealdades de P3 ao comunismo, além de aprender sobre os defeitos de tal governo. Os gráficos e o estilo de arte são impressionantes, e o jogo é extremamente otimizado. No entanto, a história do jogo é rasa, com um final decepcionante, mas que deixa aberto para uma futura sequência.Recomendo o jogo, mas leve em consideração que, como acontece com muitos jogos, pode ser que você termine e nunca mais abra novamente. A não ser que a empresa lance DLCs ou expansões com novos conteúdos.Por fim, embora o jogo custe R$200 na versão base, R$309 na versão gold e R$360 na versão premium, recomendo aguardar por uma boa promoção antes de comprar. Assim, você pode aproveitar a excelente jogabilidade e o estilo de arte impressionante sem se preocupar com o preço elevado."

There's a glitch now where if you are running above 90 FPS, numerous glitches happen in testing areas and underground stages. I wasted probably 6 hours of gameplay until I found the cause. One of the most frustrating bugs I can recall in any game. Aside from that, the game play is decent and the story, art style and look of the game is fantastic, without being too derivative (but a bit admittedly). Elements of Bioshock, Fallout and Portal in this game. Phony voice acting, but good story overall. Music is amazing, great synth/synth pop style background music. Metal tracks are good too.So that aforementioned glitch really, really pissed me off, but this game is still worthwhile."

The graphics in this game are awesome and I didn't notice any game breaking bugs after completing the game. The puzzles are fun and interesting to figure out and good enough to be fun without being irritating and annoying to progress. The story and characters are interesting and I thought the concept was really cool. The game is like if bio-shock, fallout, and metro exodus had a baby.The Good: - Fun to Play- Great Graphics- Interesting Story- Finished like it should be- Updated Wide Monitor Mode- Great FPS (I never went below 40 fps)The Bad: - Small bugs (Sometimes you get caught briefly on objects if they're close together)- Not ""Open world"" more like open level (Still linear game play)- The character and glove talk a ton! - Interesting Inventory Management- Sometimes it can feel repetitive initally but it gets better as you progress- Denuvo Anti TamperingSpecs: i9 Intel ProcessorRTX 3080 Graphics Card2TB SSD Storage32 GB Ram"
4015,Frankie Spankie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/frankie_spankie/,No,,1,11.9,March,19,"2,199",0,1,"Atomic Heart is a solid first title for a new development studio. It definitely has its flaws but it shows some potential for what's to possibly come. The story isn't particularly amazing but it's interesting enough. The game looks beautiful though and it has some great music! The combat is a lot of fun as well. You can mix and match the abilities, melee, and guns to fight enemies off as you see fit. That being said, enemies are INCREDIBLY spongy. I ended up dropping the difficulty to easy and it felt like what I expected normal to feel like. The game isn't overly difficult, it's moreso that enemies just take an absolute beating before they finally kill and it gets frustrating even at normal difficulty.The bosses were pretty fun. They were more plentiful earlier and then the later bosses didn't really feel much different than the earlier bosses. The only one that really dragged was the one that you can only deal damage with melee attacks and you run into it more than once!The open world had its pros and cons. There was a lot to loot in the world and you can find new recipes but really going in depth and searching optional facilities. You could also just hold the loot button and it'll grab everything from cabinets or boxes instead of pressing the loot button on each individual chest which was a nice quality of life change from typical games. My main problem with the open world is there are so many enemies everywhere! Like I said earlier, they're really spongy. You'll find yourself just sprinting through areas or getting in a car instead of actually fighting because you'll never take them all out. Furthermore, you can't take them all out because repair drones will come in and fix them up faster than you can kill them all! It makes looting open areas a pain. If you're looking for exploration, just head straight to a facility and loot inside.The puzzles were surprisingly fun. Door locks all had unique puzzles. The timing puzzle was pretty meh but I liked the puzzle where you have to have the colored lights line up with the locks. The pacing was done nicely to break up all the content so you didn't feel too bored between too much combat, too much exploration, too much puzzle solving, etc. It felt very balanced.That being said, there's still more to go before this feels like a great game. First, the main character's voice lines are just terrible. ""Crispy critters!"" What kind of catch phrase is that? He usually says some stupid stuff. The combat while interesting can be tough, especially at higher difficulty. There's a scanner system where you can learn more about enemies including their strengths and weaknesses. The problem is that the enemies will move so quickly that if your cursor goes off them briefly, you have to scan it again. This makes it very tough to learn what enemies are weak to what ammo type. You'll find yourself wasting time with ammo that's weak against an enemy because it's too frustrating to know what to actually use. The storage system also sucks. You can't carry much. The game does a terrible job at telling you that you have a storage system too. It took me 2-3 hours before I realized I was running out of meds so quickly without getting more because it was going straight to my storage... By the time I figured it out, Half my inventory was useless while I had a lot of good stuff in my storage. The game is so unrealistic with tons of looting, let me just carry everything instead of doing inventory maintenance. I would have liked to have more time to explore the open world as well. The stealth system just plain sucks. You kill an enemy and a repair drone comes in to repair it. There's really no sense in going slow and exploring all the nooks and crannies. Just rush to the facilities and play it like an FPS from there...Overall, the game was rather enjoyable. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would but it was still fun. I'd say grab it on a sale. I wouldn't mind looking into the next game this dev team puts out though, hopefully they learn from some of their mistakes and improves from there!"

4022,tubbz.,https://steamcommunity.com/id/proxyinuse/,No,,1,18.4,March,19,640,0,1,"For one, the game is . I even got it to work at a solid 45-60 FPS on my humble Steam Deck, which for a new PC title, is impressive. Environments across the board are beautiful, and are very well detailed. Little Soviet propaganda cartoons, gross & unsettling creatures getting up in your face, and smoothly animated cinematics, all have the looks of a big budget title. It really has lived up to the Polymer-ridden corridors & robotic horrors that were shown off years ago. (This was all before the Twins were publicly shown. I personally don’t care that much for them, but I’m guessing from the internet, a LOT of you are. I found it hilarious when the game actually addressed that.)Music is just amazing, with your classic Mick Gordon rips and really banger licensed music choices (namely, all the remixes of classical orchestra, Russian pop, and folk songs), which I think fits perfect for this type of game. Sound is also really well done, with punchy melee hits, gunshots, robot chatter, and ambience all around. It never feels out of place, and just adds to the game’s bizarrely intriguing aesthetic. Voice acting for some of the English voices could have been better however.Puzzles are a good mix here, and I definitely got more out of them the more I played them. Even if they weren’t immediately intuitive, they were definitely creatively built. It even tries to make use of first-person platforming, reminding me of Dying Light in a way, but it can be a little cumbersome at times, while still being an interesting addition. It still kept a good balance between thoughtful exploration & stressful combat, which I appreciated.Combat is the best highlight, as I found the melee weapons to feel great. Limbs will split, enemies will stagger, and damage will be visible for a majority of enemies, who aren’t always so easy to take down, which can be very rewarding once you learn the systems. Guns & energy weapons are also very effective, yet ammo is limited (based around salvaging), thus it becomes a resource game in how you want to approach (or avoid) certain situations. The game even encourages variety, by allowing you to respec all your materials into other weapons & upgrades at no punishment to you, whenever you want. Inventory management is also quite good, as any spare items are immediately stored instead of walking back & forth to empty your full pockets, and everything can be deconstructed for something else you want to use. It’s quite nice to have this much choice & flexibility, even if not everything is “equally” viable.But it’s not perfect. For one, stealth is … weird or downright broken, as it’s never quite clear how to best avoid an enemy’s vision, and it usually ends up in a gunfight anyway (with everyone in vicinity joining in). In the open areas, enemy balance is not quite tuned in a way that rewards players well. You won’t be able to stealth through them, and trying to kill everything just has enemies getting repaired infinitely (and even when main terminals are shut down, it’s still only temporary). Glove abilities also feel underdeveloped, despite being good complements in combat (Why is there no “hypnosis hack” type to gain temporary robot allies?). Lastly, large-scale combat can feel laborious with bosses being spongy, over being mechanically interesting to fight. I know they can be scanned for elemental weaknesses, but I doubt most players will see that as intuitive, when it isn’t needed much with other enemies. I didn’t hate it, but I can see why others may not like it.Lastly, a very common complaint I hear is the dialogue. Agent P-3 (you), is very chatty with his glove assistant, and is … denser than a block of cheese. I wish I was hyperbolizing that, but it’s true. I wasn’t sure if that was a localization of the Russian script gone bad, or just a part of being a “mentally-unstable KGB agent” part that the game advertised. Either way, I think everyone agrees that he could have been written/translated better, made a silent, gruff protagonist, or that you should play the game in Russian once they fix the INSANELY small subtitles. The story, unfortunately like WHF, starts very strong but leaves SO much to be desired in the end. It is a shame for sure, but I think if it can be viewed as a B-movie Russian action flick, it’s far from terrible. The game as a whole could be considered . (As for the horny fridge, I never thought much of it whether people like it or not. It only happens like 3-4 times in the whole campaign, so I just found it funny.)"

Hit game breaking glitch after theater section of the game towards the end. Started when having to arrange the robots stances to be the correct for the puzzle. Now any animation is buggy. I could live with it except for the fact that the lock picking animation now takes about a minute and a half just to get into it. All while its timer counts down. This stopped my progression and ended the game for me. Nothing I did tried. I would have recommended the game if it was not for this. But I just dumped 22 hours into a game to not be able to finish it. Also sucks there is no way to get my money back either now. Important to not the bugs are not performance. The game runs very well. They are game play. This one bug I listed is just one of many I experienced. Kinda feels like playing cyberpunk when it launched.

It really does feel as if you are mercenary dropped into a robot disaster, they hit hard but so do you. voice lines do get repetitive, and the open world can feel a bit tough sometimes; but what did you expect a walk in the park. The score of this game is amazing and felt very similar to Mick Gordon's Doom soundtracks, in the best way possible [also because Mick Gordon did work on this project too]. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for amazing story telling, fluid mechanics, and a great sound track, while being difficult and rewarding.

There is a lot of potential in the upgrades and different weapons. The open world aspect in between missions allows you to kill and loot as much as you want but its very risky. There are periodic puzzles usually to open doors or such, but they are reused and recycled. That's probably why they're so easy. Overall the gameplay makes you feel like a badass killing all these robots and mutants.Story - I played with russian voice audio and I've got no complaints about the acting itself. Because I'm not as fluent as I thought I understood only about 80% of the story. There was a lot of build up and a lot of individual details that all came together in the end nicely but the endings were open-ended to say the least. I half expected there to be another hour of gameplay but nope the credits roll.Some minor details - I absolutely loved all the references and easter eggs to old russian culture like movies, cartoons and music. This was the first time I played a game in russian in 10 years at least so it was a nostalgic and applauding experience.This game is new so expect a few minor unpolished features.FINAL THOUGHTS - This game definitely exceeded my expectations. Its not too long to finish even with the minimal resources. Combat is the pinacle of this game in my opinion so if you wanna kill some robots and feel good doing it then this game is a buy."

Again calling upon bioshock, perhaps having a more water based level or oil based level and having to change your elemental playstyles to get through theseone critique is that this is definetely dub not sub experience, as every voice over loves long winded explanations, which becomes occasionally annoying when the killer bots decide to flank you as you're focusing your eyes on the techno babble text"

For instance, the colour match door lock puzzles can be quite frustrating to work through, and I feel they are a hindrance to game progression, and quite frankly, a waste of time. Personally, I'd love to see the colour match puzzles replaced only with the finger snap puzzles, so the game seems like it has a purpose and doesn't leave the player frustrated.Otherwise, overall, Atomic Heart is a good game, good story line, the visuals are quite amazing, too!

Overall, the story is filled with twists and turns, lore filled Easter eggs and notes, tons of humor, and fantastic development pace. There are so many details to discover and small interactions to have with the various characters and even dead bodies scattered about the map. On top of this, the visuals and the music in the game are absolutely magnificent and the concept of the story and setting are brilliant. I won't go into depth and spoil anything of course, but this is worth it for the story alone. 8-9/10 easily.Gameplay on the other hand is going to be a 5-6/10 for me. I found a frustrating amount of glitchy bits ranging from being pinned on terrain and perma stunlocked, to having jump puzzles break or have my character simply not want to grab on ledges, to the repetitive nature of the door puzzles that oftentimes served no purpose--blocking of little to nothing. Originally, some enemies even broke and began T-posing and moving about, though, after a recent patch that stopped happening. I think that the bioshock-esque combat system of the game (openly joked about by the MC towards the end) can be a bit stagnant as well.Overall, I think this game gets an 7-8 out of 10 for me and was definitely worth the purchase. I just finished the full story and I have about half of the achievements and have done half of the optional dungeons. I look forward to what possible DLCs might add to the story and would definitely recommend this game."

Having said that, it does have problems. Let me start by some reviews mentioning ""it's all over the place"", and ""trying to do many things"". Well let me tell you what they mean by ""trying to do many things"": It's three things 1)First person shooting 2) puzzles 3) mini games. It's not much.And certainly not the only game which mixes first person shooting with puzzles. So why are they whining? Well, my guess is that either reviewers are so DUMB that they can't solve the puzzles or that they simply don't like them. It could be that it's both, the second reason is derived from the first.The acting is not good. Reviews mention this, and it's true. But, I don't care. I am not watching a Netflix show or a movie. It's a freaking game and I am interested mostly in gameplay. So yeah, the protagonist can be annoying, but it's not big deal if you don't pay attention.POSITIVES:Immersive atmosphere. The opening scene is a masterpiece and serves well the purpose of grabbing you and throwing you in a crazy alternative reality where the citizens of the Soviet Union enjoy the services of advanced robotic AI  which is about to go very wrong.Great combat system featuring (Bioshock - like) glove abilities and weapons.Nice skill tree and upgrades.Great puzzles. That's subjective of course. I like puzzles which are neither so hard that cause frustration,  nor easy enough that pose no challenge.I think the difficulty of puzzles is perfectly balanced. Not to mention their setting: Crazy rotating rooms and metal platforms that rise and descend under the influence of magnets, and more crazy stuff like that.NEGATIVESManual saves. You've got to be extremely careful to save the game on dedicated in-game machines, because the game won't save automatically on every progress.Dialog choices, they are not many but I don't like them.The upgrade and crafting machine menu. It's kinda messy and not very convenient.Some bugs like the infinite jump, or getting stuck in geometry. They still persist even after the latest update (March 17th).You can finish the game and still not find HALF of the available weapons because you didn't find the randomly scattered crafting recipes.Poor and inconvenient map. No key to explain the marks.After you finish the game (Testing Ground included) there's not much to do.You are left to roam an open world with no clear objective. My guess is that a future update will fix this with Game + option or something similar.SUMMING UPA good experience , could be better. I'll give it a 7.5/10."

You will enjoy it if you also enjoyed DOOM, the play style is quite similar.The story is fine, our protagonist becomes noticeably stupider towards the 2nd half of the game but it didn't bother me too much. It is what it is. Only wished it was longer. After finishing the story with still a few remaining unexplored sites and locations, I had very little motivation to continue playing. Take that how you will - but the time I spent playing the main story was quite enjoyable and fun - kept coming back to it when I had free time.The world was also beautiful to look at. Often found myself stopping just to enjoy the various locations. The music is also nice - sometimes the timing of it is a bit awkward though, but when it hits the timing, it's really epic. Also note: Some people complain about too many unnecessary door puzzles - there really ain't that many of them... and honestly I enjoyed them. Wish they would've added more different ones."

Yes, the game let you explore the world even after the final credits, i really love that it s not that easy load the least save kind of thing.I don t usually write a review or anything, you can see my grammar, but i really liked the game.

I don't think anyone did something this great about USSR, or alternative USSR. Loved characters and story is good. Voice acting is also great at least in russian. Sometimes characters speak too much and you either have to stand and listen or be ready to be interrupted because you came to another checkpoint.Not a fan of gameplay, it's okay. Melee sometimes frustrating and even though it has some weight behind it still lacks something. Gunplay is meh, especially rail gun is underwhelming. Oh and ""powers"". Basically never used them. Tried, but on highest difficulties didn't seem to be worth it, invested in passives and character improvements instead. Overall I'd give it 7/10, totally recommended on sale.

4077,Taro Yamada,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TaroYamada/,No,,1,22.2,March,18,527,0,1,"The good: The world building, art direction, music and plot are excellent. But I don't really play games because of that stuff. I primarily care about gameplay. The gameplay is pretty fun.I played over half the game on my Steam Deck where it ran great. The game is very well optimized. For the last third I switched to my desktop, mouse and keyboard VASTLY improves the combat. Dual analog doesn't do the combat justice, even if I love my Deck.Stuff I wasn't crazy about: settings are synced, which is a problem when trying to jump between Deck and Desktop, text size is very small on Deck, if an enemy pins you in a corner you are hosed. Protag dialog at the beginning in particular was rough, later it mellows out and he becomes more interesting. Larisa Filatova's design really doesn't fit the game or world imo, I found her appearance out of place vs any other character in the game. While the game is well optimized there's a few cutscenes where I'd drop from 60 fps in-game to crazy low FPS in cutscenes, like 12 fps. They were rare and didn't impair actual gameplay."

It was so refreshing to witness a graphically amazing game and still achieve great performance; something that is definitely not expected in 2023. I thoroughly enjoyed the world and the enemy design. Throughout the adventure, I found myself stopping frequently just to observe the environments and enemy designs, as I found them to be so detailed. The open world was a little jarring at first, especially with the infinitely respawning repair bots (armageddon difficulty did not help here), but once you upgrade your arsenal and become more used to the mechanics, it is quite fun to just run around, demolishing the enemies and surveillance cameras as you go. There are a few achievement tracking issues in the game currently (armageddon clear achievement, I am looking at you), but the developers are fixing them quite rapidly.I have recommended this game to all of my friends and do not regret the purchase in the slightest. This was a refreshing adventure, to say the least, and I am glad I was able to experience it."

4108,Lawbeng,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lawbeng/,No,,1,63.0,March,16,290,0,1,"It's a great game, but sadly it has its flaws. Let's start with the good things in the game. The biggest strengths of the game are, in my opinion, the worldbuilding and story. They managed to create an interesting world, where you want to learn as much about it, as possible. The story is convoluted, some plot twists seem obvious, but in the end you start asking your self, are the plot twists really what happend or just a way characters wanted to manipulate you, to get what they want. A lot of questions won't be answered in the game, so you have some things to speculate on, atleast until the dlcs and/or Atomic Heart 2 comes out. The combat system itself is fun and gives you freedom to chose how to fight, the only problem (atleast for me) is it's not a hardcore game, it's actually pretty easy after you figure the gameplay out. Now to the bad things. Sadly there are some bugs which can break the game, you can get stuck on objects and won't be able to get out, so you have to reload, which is not too bad but can get annoying. The bigger bug I encountered has something to do with the connection system of the robots. In the openworld you have a floting thingy called hawk, it transfers data between the robots in the area around it. You can use a console and overclock its powersource, a windmill, and destroy it that way, after that the hawk and all robots in the area will go more or less in a sleeping mode and do nothing and smaller repair robots will start repairing the windmill. The problem is for some reason most of the time the robots won't finish repairing the mill and the system in that area will stay deactivated, which is bad because you can't use the system too to open doors. There are more thing which I think could be better, the usage of the soundtrack is kindoff hit or miss, sometimes it just doesn't work other times it's just a great combo of gameplay and music and you wish it won't stop. The openworld is sadly somewhat boring too, there are not enough reasons to explore it, only reasons are some weapon upgrades hiden in on the map marked labs and just resources if you really want to max out everything, which is honestly not needed. The only other reason to explore is to find terminals or audiologs to findout more about the lore of the game. Another thing is the voice acting, the russian one has some little flaws but in general is great, the german and english one just felt way more infirior to the russian one, they couldn't depict the characters way of talking properly (atlest in my opinion).But in the end the issues didn't outway the positives for me, it is a great game but sadly it could have been better."

The dialogue is fine, but the way it's delivered in the cutscenes just seems.....off. If you play it or watch it, you'll understand.Overall. I would be open to giving this game an 8/10.

The instant loot feature is awesome to use but it goes away if you don't have a cabinet to immediately to loot next. The melee combat is okay but there should have been more of an emphasis on the gunplay. The bosses in the game are also not very susceptible to firearms and most of the time need to be taken out with a strong melee attack which often does more damage than the guns do. The story is awesome up until the very end where you need to choose weather or not you betray your boss. And it just feels so rushed. I like the plot twist at the end, I don't have anything against sudden twists, especially if they're hinted at. But as a russian bioshock, I think it does wonderfully, and I see an amazing future for these developers."

It's good because it's better than the english dub in my opinion, but when you're fighting something it's hard to read subtitles. So be aware.In my personaly experience, there isn't a ton of issues with this game, i did get stuck in some wonky collisions in places but it never set me back hours. The real thing that bothered me throughout the game was when you loot furniture in mass, your glove tends to stop midway and do the sound, which is not gamebreaking but it removes a bit of the fun of that satifying task, i would have preffered if you could hold it and it wouldn't stop.I think that it was a bit sad that you don't see more of your abilites be useful outside of combat, shok is used in puzzles and to interact with machinery, but you don't see a lot of use for the other optional abilites, while i understand why its done like that (to not make you have to switch out of your currently equiped abilites) it is a bit sad, i had a lot of fun using them in combat though. The energy guns were really fun, i pretty much only used the shotgun because the other normal guns didn't feel really strong, and i didn't use a lot of different melee weapons, but the ones i've used were nice!Theres a bit more i could say about this game, but it's just little silly complaints, i had a lot of fun and it entertained me for a while!"

Definitely controller.Slow story that seems very straightforward. Main character has such an angry/aggressive personality right off the bat. The first buy station interaction shows a theme, and first few NPCs match it. Loot system - having to hold scan for 3-seconds to locate loot, then the loot button having a slight delay with the animation breaking every 5-seconds, and then repeating that loop to progress gear-wise is a task.Medium difficulty, the main barrier to progressing is just time with the highest starting difficulty seeming to only increase that (because death) without any reward. Damage to enemies seems consistent between difficulties, and the 2-starting weapons (minorly upgraded) don't really help time wise. Combat loop seemed dull and processed in the brain more like ""another enemy...""Stealth option does not seem viable since it's about a 10-second minigame + animation, with patrolling enemies so you really gotta try to make it work. (worth noting that of the my two stealth kills, 1 of those attempts bugged out and made me repeat the minigame)Fantastic futuristic '50s aesthetic turned chaos, but first 2-hours of real gameplay were just copy-pasted mannequin enemies (with 1-2 slightly different elite mannequins) inside a dark concrete office building. From the pics/videos, seems to diversify but I'm not interested in seeing another one of those mannequins.Lots of upgrade systems and different loot types available at the start so it's overwhelming, but if that's your thing then ayyyy game's worth a try. Weapon crafting/upgrading seems fully reversible so you can play with what fits your style once you get the blueprints.Final thoughts: I can see it being some persons' thing for those that like the grind and gameplay loop, but not my thing. Tbh I now just have an irrational fear of sentient buy stations, and that's my main takeaway."

Most becomes prevalent during the first boss or during hectic fights against multiple enemies, where if you're familiar with souls gameplay the same instincts might kick in. Purely from a gameplay perspective, I'd say this is my second favorite game of it's kind, behind Ultrakill. I miss titanfall. Anyways, storywise and themes, I liked it, and the unease and light horror were done really well to not feel like jumpscares because I saw them coming, but they were very unnerving. I am a sucker for happy endings that fit my personal tastes so I would prefer that to the ones we got, but that may just be culture clash. Unlikely, but possible. Feels more likely there's something else in the works, not DLC or a sequel. Just something.Only real complaint is like, ♥♥♥♥ the uh, what was it called? The walking bundle of flesh and nerves that moved around like Vicar Amelia mixed with Stretch Armstrong. Hated fighting that thing, and not because of the five times I fought it three of them were cheesed/glitched and avoided. Oh and driving is a little akward.

The environment and music are both top notch.  The music that plays at upgrade stations is top notch background music.  Listening to it right now while writing the review.  Each area has its own character that makes it unique.  The atmosphere is top tier. The voice acting can be both great and awful at times.  There's timing issues for voice lines, so every now and then a conversation that shouldn't have a pause just has this awkward silence while the animations or voice lines load in.  Weird, but not that a deal breaker.  What  is a deal breaker is that some of the voice lines just feel... off.  Like someone was just reading from a page in class and not trying to do any voice acting.  Enemies are fun at first, then get extremely repetitive.  This game took the ""just change how they look"" approach to create new enemy types when it comes to adds.  When they ran out of variants of base enemies they just throw more at you to make it feel fresh.  It is what it is.  The bosses and mini bosses are awesome, so it makes up for it.  Controls can be a bit annoying.  I'm sure I could have remapped them, but I didn't so its kind of on me.  You have an ""inspect"" ability that is assigned to L-alt, healing is assigned to X.  I've accidentally wasted an ungodly amount of healing items trying to ""inspect"" something.  Character movement is pretty good, plays like a typical FPS with a dodge mechanic most of the time.  There are parkour/climbing aspects of the game that are just... janky a lot of the time.  What I absolutely do not like are the puzzle trial areas you have to enter to get upgrades for the weapons.  I'm not a fan of puzzle or platformer games, and the puzzle trial areas are just chock full of them.  Climb this to go get access to that, then use janky parkour to get access here type of BS.  The puzzles are never too difficult, but janky parkour makes them a nightmare most of the time.  I wish there was an option to either fight your way through waves of enemies, or go through jank parkour to get the upgrades, but no such luck here. The story is solid, leads you to one conclusion then to another different conclusion.  If you're a huge fan of bioshock style of story telling, you'll like this game.  Overall, amazing game.  Definitely give it a try."

The combat system is one of a kind and very fun to use, although the combat, skills, and crafting have their flaws. This game isn't a perfect game, but it's not a bad game either and it does give a bioshock vibe in the combat field and in some instances during the story and exploration. Audio and soundtrack were nailed perfectly. Atomic Heart has some fantastic ideas with an excellent presentation. At the end of the day it managed to entertain me and keep me wanting to explore and know more of what was going on in the dystopian USSR."

But after the first few intro hours of the game it becomes a huge slog to get through.  Little point in exploring anything once you open up to the sandbox area.  Very quickly have access to every weapon and ability in the game with only a few that seem to actually be worth using.  Even the fan service from the robot ladies isn't enough to keep me motivated to keep playing.  Artistically its very interesting looking game.  Story and gameplay wise however its not worth playing.  And this is from someone who wanted this game to be his game of the year after waiting for its release for so long.  Just save yourself the trouble and look up the ballerina twins scenes on youtube and use your free time to play something else.  I really hope the devs can use the money from this game to make a truly great sequel to this game later.

I'm a sucker for retro futuristic stuff and eastern european history, so much to the point I've learned some Russian and have been to the eastern bloc. This game is right up my alley. As far as style goes, this is a 10/10The gameplay is quite enjoyable but there is a clunky thing. When starting the game I would dash into boxes or furniture and get stuck and killed, so the combat feels a bit ""sticky"" if that makes sense. Outside of that, I actually used all my skills and was motivated to upgrade my weapons and glove. The game sort of changes ""gameplay modes"" throughout the game. It starts off like a bioshock corridor shooter and I thought that was the entire game and still felt like it could've been great, but then the game gets bigger. I got to the first open area and just... had a learning curve. No spoilers, but once you get off the train you might possibly hit a wall like I did where you just don't quite know why you're being attacked nonstop. I REALLY dislike the respawning of enemies in the open world. Oh yeah, the next gameplay feel has an open world meant for exploring, and you always slink around and watch for cameras otherwise the alarm will be set off and you're gonna get destroyed. This puts a hamper on the exploration of the open game world. So, thats not a big deal because you can shut down all hostility in an area for 15 minutes, so you gotta find a camera station, find the right camera, then open a door, and boom you can turn off hostility. See? Thats a lot of steps just to comfortably explore and thats the wall I'm talking about. Once you know how that works, my initial complaint with respawning enemies goes away but still, thats just frustrating when you don't know how to stop them from coming as the game doesn't really reinforce your knowledge on how to stop enemies in the open world. The audio is 10/10, I've listened to the soundtrack nonstopI felt the ending was a bit short, it lasted less than 30 seconds but whatever, I almost prefer that now at this point now that I'm an adult with not as much time for games. Gimme the jist of things, I don't need a metal gear solid epic saga to tell me someone dies and sorrow a character feels. So yeah, I liked that. The story in itself was a bit convoluted at first but towards the end of the game they remind you of who is who and it is easy to keep up with all the different characters you have interacted with. I would recommend this game at full price, but as always, catch it on sale if you can."

While it had references and similar themes, at the same time it was very much it's own thing, got a lot of nostalgia from the puzzles and bossfights that remind me of more old-school games. If I had one complaint it would be the apparently random spawning of blueprints in chests meant that I didn't get the Kalash until about halfway through the game in my playthrough, really hoped I'd chance on the weapon and pick it up rather than having to search every chest hoping for it to spawn.

It gets much better especially towards the later half when they talk about deeper topics of morality and evil. Of who is right and who is wrong. The gameplay is fun. I love using energy weapons cause I like to horde the ammo to the point where I will never even use it all before the end of the game. I enjoy being a loot rat and sucking up everything that I see. Needs more ways to get biomaterials since I only had about 1.5k at the end of the game but 3k of the other two common materials. Crafting ammo would cost biomaterials quite a bit of them, but has to be farmed from the plant people and their hair monsters. The main character grew on me as I saw him develop more as a character throughout the game. My personal ideology aligns with glove. I agree with glove. I want to be glove.

Game itself is rarity these days too since it is full from start to end. World is the best thing in it. It is simply enchanting and amazing. Build from scratch without cheap assests.Gameplay is fun exept for some choke points that are overwhelemed with enemies for no real reason. Music is top notch and same goes for voice acting. I relaize that some might not like it. But I find it hitting the spot. Puzzles and polygons are also one of the best thing in the game. They bring back memeories of old school games that have such stuff. Problems I encountered were buggy achievements and a few places where you could get stuck permamently. Overall it is a solid overal 8/10 game with 10/10 world building. Hope for some more expansions of the world.

The game takes a while to pick up and to ""click"" on you. On Hard the first hours were a bit challenging, but now, after defeating 4 bosses and at my 15-hour mark, it's kind of easy sometimes (upgrading the glove makes the whole game more satisfying and considerably easier). My major gripe with the game is the open world: the enemies density can be way too high at times, making some chaotic situations that aren't fun really. Combine that with ""security cameras"" all over that call for reinforcements + repairs and the fact that the stealth mechanics are half-baked (for example, no indicator of what an enemy is seeing whatsoever), makes you not want to explore the open world as much as you otherwise would want. You learn how to deal with it after a while, but still, if I should point a negative aspect this would 100% be it.I can only say good things about pretty much everything else. Final score would be 8/10."

Atomic Heart's Soviet retrofuturism, unlike Fallout and Bioshock, has little in common with real Soviet culture. The concept of the plot, which looked relevant and topical in the setting of American imperialism or ""victorious libertarianism"", transferred to the USSR, turned into banal anti-Soviet propaganda. Thus, Atomic Heart paints in front of us such a banal and worn-out picture of the ""totalitarian USSR"", which differs little from the anti-Sovietism of Western art, or from the same anti-Sovietism of the modern Russian Federation."" - Politstrum"

First, off some sections are far too long while others are really short and sweet. Second, it feels like the game is too vague, without spoiling anything, the game ends with more questions then it answered. It is possible that it is lining up a sequel, but I don't see how. The story is very strange, at some points it is really cookie cutter, while other times it is really crazy and unique. The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I was expecting, the ending left me feeling like, ""is that it?"" which I never liked from games. But other than that, it was really fun.Exploration is fine and doesn't offend. Gameplay is the highlight. Other than 1 boss who was nothing more than a bullet sponge, all bosses were fun and unique, all areas fun and had cool details and backgrounds to them. Gunplay is smooth and flashy, there can be too much going on sometimes but overall it wasn't bad. The abilities were fine, but I wish they were a bit more powerful and there were more. I liked the characters they were all likable, I wish they did more with some of the side characters, but I can understand why they didn't.Writing goes either way. You either find it fine and acceptable, or you will find the main character not very likable bordering on annoying. There were some times that I found the writing really damn funny, which was nice to see.Also thicc robots."

My only complaint would be that it was too short, I got 23 hours out of it for the story. Also the voice acting was a bit much, and the dialogue writing.

It's like 80% Bioshock and 20% Fallout and just as fun as either of those games. Very high quality on par with Bioshock gameplay and polish. The Ballerina Twins are great highlights. I would like to see more of them. The two main characters (P-3 and Charles) could have had better dialog (writing). I think it would have been better if the glove voice was female (similar to Master Chief and Cortana). My other gripe is the lack of New Game Plus. There's a ton of collecting/developing skills/weapons which I would like to keep when starting a new game."

Is it a bit clunky and a little scatter brained? yes. Is it fun? also yes.My biggest problem with the game is consonantly responding enemies when trying to find collectables and the open world. It would have been better if the game used more of a metro exodus types of maps with each area being able clear areas and find the loot. Over all the feeling i get from this game is a rougher bioshock that hopefully gets a squeal that fixes all its mistakes and improve on the formal.

4329,AKingInYellow,https://steamcommunity.com/id/akinginyellow/,No,,1,20.6,March,11,391,0,1,"I only recommend this for the Soviet-era styling and rather unique setting. A lot of people will equivocate this game to Bioshock Infinite, and that's a fair take. The game is a solid feeling of gunplay, extraordinary abilities such as freezing enemies and hurling them around with Jedi-like powers after a certain point. It never left me feeling truly helpless, only that in a tight situation I had a toolbox to figure my way out.As far as story goes. It took me 20 hours to beat the game. My personal metric for Price vs. Enjoyment tends to be 1 USD per hour, that being said, this silly equation is altered if I had an excessive amount of fun. Games like DOOM Eternal I bought for full price and beat within 16 hours of play - and I still whole-heartedly recommended them. Now! Does that stand up for this game?No. I wish there was a button for a ""Yes & No"" recommendation. Yes, this game is fun, yes this game has very nice styling and a nice story. It's woefully short and the replay factor won't really bring me back in. There's no branching choices, no ""what ifs"" and fully upgrading my guns was never really a factor on Normal difficulty. I enjoyed the experience personally, but not enough to encourage people to pay full pricing for this game.It has good quality, good gameplay, and a nice story. I'd give this game a solid ""buy it on sale, unless you really, really think this game is up your alley"".For the record: I had three bugs that required me to reload a recent save to fix them, simple stuff like elevator buttons not working or getting stuck in geometry. The game only crashed once when I was closing it and that's hardly a problem. No saves got magically deleted during my playing and no game-breaking issues came up. I started playing this game a few days after release and it's had several bug-fixes and an FOV slider update. Make of that what you will."

AH is more heftier in plot and will throw a lot at you expecting you to keep up. It has fun gameplay, and presents an interesting vision of a Soviet society built on propaganda. However, it's not as refined as an experience as Bioshock or Prey, so temper your expectations going into it. The protagonist is actively voiced and is divisive, but I enjoy him as someone who doesn't mind edgier protagonists. If you don't let him turn you off at first he may grow on you."

But there have been two updates so far and I keep on having to uninstall and re-download to update. Pretty sure this is a problem on the side of Valve. It's getting pretty annoying to have to keep re-install just to play a game after minor updates.
4340,AnormalDude,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198197334706/,No,,0,38.4,March,11,216,0,1,I really want to like this game but after having played the entirety of it I find it hard to recommend it to anyone. The game is not the longest I've played but not to short for its steep price. It does however lack a lot of polish which is constantly seen even in the main parts of the game which are more polished than optional areas. This annoys me a lot as the game is really good and fun but can be hard to enjoy when very few things don't feel rushed. Everything from the mechanics to the visuals and the story are great at first but get worse the later in to the game you get. I really would like to recommend it but after finishing the game all I'm left with is a bad taste in my mouth. Despite this I'm still going back for 100% because despite its flaws stuff like the combat feels great albeit a bit repetitive due to how easy the enemy's are to abuse ones you learn their moveset and your weapons.If you wanna buy this game I'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale for 75% or more. At first when I saw another review recommending it at that price I was shocked but after experiencing it all I don't disagree. This game had a lot of potential but seemingly rushed its release with how it is which is sad because it could have been great but ultimately wasn't and no amount of future dlcs will fix that.

You'll have a ridiculous amount of crafting materials, but there's not enough unique weapons and upgrades (and there's a lot of overlap between them all), and the game isn't hard enough to make you craft consumables, not to mention the fact that they give you so many that it just becomes annoying to clear them out of your inventory. Abilities were cool, but you're probably not going to switch from whichever ones you immediately like. I wish their individual purposes were more unique, and it'd be cool if there were more or if you could equip at least one more at a time. There used to be like 20 or 30 different weapons on Mundfish's website, the final game has like 10 or 11. The trailers show different weapons too. Hope they return for the DLC.Combat was fine. It had more going for it than most shooters, but there aren't really that many enemies. It would've been nicer if there were more unique areas with unique enemies. In the end, you can find basically every enemy in single locations. I liked the puzzles, they didn't feel annoyingly repetitive to me personally. The way that the testing grounds, upgrades, and open-world work could've been explained better though. Story was meh. I didn't mind the cheesy dialogue that much personally. Overall, it was good, probably like a 7/10 or something. The game won't change your life or anything, but it was fun, and gameplay-wise, was actually quite different from Bioshock."

I have read a lot of comments on such sites as Metacritic that this game is a poor parody of Bioshock. I think it's quite the opposite. I think it's a great parody(at least I see a lot of influence there) of a game if Halflife 2 and Portal had a love child. If I could imagine HL2 in a Soviet setting, this would be it. Also, growing up in the USSR(understanding a lot of the references and music)  and playing this game in the native language also completely changes the experience."

The AI is very tough and engaging. Loved that this game takes so many different elements to a fps as they have been pretty stale lately.

4389,TheScepticBlock,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheScepticBlock/,No,,1,48.0,March,10,33,0,1,"This game is very ambitious, and has a bit of everything in it! Do you like fast paced combat? This game has it. What about looter shooter mechanics? Yep! Puzzles, even? Y E S ! In short, I really like this game for what it offers. I'll list what I liked, didn't like and despised.What I liked:- The mix of several game types that was somewhat coherent. Looter shooter, FPS, Puzzle solving. Definitely a refresher compared to other fps games in my opinion.- The wackiness of the world is, well, wacky. The designs of architecture, weapons, enemies, and characters. They're all really weird in a way that is super cool!- There's a bunch of sound effects when looting cabinets, drawers and more that just sound SOOO FREAKIN' GOOD! All the clicky sounds just give me the good feels!- The grind is pretty good during the story, I often found myself having more than enough resources to get everything I needed. After the main story, the grind gets slightly slower and more dull.What I didn't like:- There's something about those robot twins seen early in the game and in the game's trailers that make me super uncomfortable.- The main character's voice in english feels very immature for the role he plays. Although he does sound somewhat serious when need be.- Getting used to dodging when enemies are about to do a heavy attack seems jarring. When encountering this scenario for the first time, enemies would charge a heavy attack for what felt like a fraction of a second which gave me no time to react. Once you do get used to this and start dodging consistently, it is more tolerable.- The world feels somewhat small compared to what you see in the in game map. I often found myself reaching the world boarders very quickly while moving to the next point of interest.- The lack of an FOV slider on launch was a bit annoying. It was weird seeing things as if I had binoculars the whole time.What I despised:- There are cars in the map you can drive and they have 2 major flaws in my opinion. Their lack of health and too many obstacles on the road. If you ever so slightly bump into any solid object, the car catches fire and starts to hurt you. This gets even more annoying when the roads are always cluttered with wreckage everywhere. Also, there's no 3rd person perspective while in a car. That disappoints me even more.Overall, I had a very good time playing Atomic Heart for the first time. Although if I were to run through the story again, it would have to be in Russian with English subtitles."

4402,Michael Scarn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/disconnect75/,No,,1,29.4,March,10,51,0,1,"For their first title I would say this is a huge hit, the graphics is nice, the gameplay is fun, often times I forgot to use my glove abilities and use the zvezdochka or the shotgun instead. I wished using heavy attack with the zvezdochka would have that unchain action like in the trailer but it wasn't added into the final game. For a open world game you can really explore the facilities and switch play styles each time. The enemies are well done, specifically their attack time and speed, in normal difficulty it is challenging enough yet not over the top, I would describe it as perfect, as it fits the atomic world settings and difficulty settings. For the collectibles part, it is good but can improve a bit, a lot of time I would look behind stairs, pipes and other structures and expect a collectible such as chirper, dead talking body there but there wasn't. A lot of potential for the collectibles in the environment. Exploring the world everywhere you go you can screenshot right there and then and you have a decent wallpaper, the artistic element in the environment is excellent here, playing the game is also like going on a scenic trip with atompunk elements, which is really unique and rare. I wished we can replay boss fight with new equipments and even after story campaign, but this is not possible, although you can still explore the open world after the game ends. There are some bugs during my playthrough, player can get stuck in too many places, at the end of one of the tunnels in the game I can see through the ground, if you're stuck the game will fling the player off the stuck spot after a while but it doesn't always work, sometimes I would be incline to explore for fear of getting stuck. The weapon upgrade system is the best because it allows player to experiment with different play styles. Looting is so satisfying I CAN'T STOP LOOTING FOR THE WHOLE GAME. I am very much looking forward to the DLCs that they are planning to do, please, take as much time as possible, too many games release without finishing development nowadays, this game is one of the few that doesn't do that. I do recommend this product to everyone who is even a tiny bit interested, you won't be disappointed."

4405,Luxxor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/von_lux/,1,,1,25.9,March,10,662,0,1,"Atomic Heart is blatantly Russian Bioshock, it explores the downfall of a utopia but this time it is Communistic instead of Libertarian. There is a distinct art style that is very unique and many of the environments are breathtaking. The world is vaguely open world, but the story is linear and most progression is made in secluded ""dungeon"" sections.Gameplay is mostly familiar if you have played Bioshock, it is a bit clunky and focuses on combos and combination of powers in the left hand a weapon in the other. The highlight of the combat is the enemy design especially the bosses.The ideas of the story are quite good and it takes it subject matter seriously, but the character writing is so bad that it undercuts most of it. Instead it is the world building and sci-fi elements that impressed me."

It was genuinely fun until i ran into a game breaking bug. It's been over a week and I still can't progress. I've googled it, and a bunch of other people have ran into the same issue. No idea when it's going to be fixed. Besides my unfortunate circumstance the game was really fun, with a few slight issues. The ""uncharted"" like side scrolling climbing feels like an after thought, and genuinely makes more sense to slow the player down than add anything to the game. When you get to the ""open world"" part the enemy spawns are unlimited and it makes the whole sneak/survival aspect feel pointless. You might as well just sprint through all the enemies because even if you carve your way through them there just going to come back. I would wait a while and buy this game on a sale."

Soviet Science Fiction meets Bioshock meets Doom Eternal.PROS:- An outstanding, multi-genre Soundtrack: It's very apparent that Mundfish spent a lot of time and resources making sure the game sounds good: and damn does it ever. Car radios can play techno, classical ballads, or even funky soviet songs, while fights fill your senses with hard metal riffs; Overheard speakers play propaganda to dead crowds, and dungeons have EDM music playing diegetically.  Even the atmospheric music stands out, especially the bizarre vendor background music.- Easily the most distinct fictional Universe to come out of an FPS in a long time: There's been a trend of Sci-Fi shooters and their worlds looking generic recently. Atomic Heart really blows that out of the water: The setting definitely stands out, mixing Euro Brutalism with the Deco Pop that gave the original Bioshock an identity. The visual contrast between the lush, bright surface to the dark, twisted, dirty underground complexes makes you remember just how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this world is, while never letting up on the sense of eeriness. Even the propaganda posters scattered throughout the facility is evidence of how much effort the team put in to making this world feel inhabited.- Gameplay / charter building Synergy- Polymer Jet is definitely one of highlights of gameplay for me. While it's easy to compare it to a foam gun, the Jet acts like a conduit for whatever else it touches: meaning fights can become filled with elemental traps, or increase your Damage over Time of effects. Frost, Mass Telekensis, and Shield are all fine survival options, but I had the best time experimenting with the Jet.- LORE: Computers to read up on, Collectible Audio Diary, and informational posters: there's so much here for a lore nerd like me to analyze and dissect, especially with how much writing is spent describing how specific inventions or technologies work. - High Skill Cap: Local Malfunction is a great place to start, but IMO the game is much better on the Armageddon difficulty: Resource scavenging and crafting has more emphasis placed on it, and bullet management becomes a real issue. But even if you're not looking for a challenging experience, I think there's a lot of room for players to grow on the lower difficulties. - Helplessness vs Strength: The strongest dynamic of this game is how different the gameplay becomes depending on your setting. When you're underground, the spaces are tight, meaning you can take on hordes on enemies that funnel into your location, making you feel like an action hero that takes them all down. But being surrounded above ground is terrifying: enemies fly over heard, Pchela's are on a never ending quest to revive all the enemies you killed, Camera's are watching your every move, and Rotorobots will violently knock you down if you aren't paying attention. Trying to kill everything on the surface is a futile task, and the devs have really nailed that feeling of terror and urgency when an alarm gets raised.CONS:  - Lack of Photomode / RTX: Not exactly something that gameplay hinges on, but Mundfish has created such a weird and unique world that it's shame there's no way to natively capture images. However, RTX being cut from the final version is a big let down; especially since these two features were marketed a couple of years ago. Hopefully these features are patched in eventually. - Some enemies are only encountered in scripted events: Atomic Heart has some very powerful enemies, and I was expecting these enemies to be a part of the surface world once you've beaten them; however they are instead relegated to a single boss fight. - Pacing issues: 7 minute opening cutscene, followed by about 15 mins of tutorials could be better. Once the world opens up, you can definitely take your time going from place to place (which the game encourages) but ultimately the world map is a straight line: Despite looking like a big world, it's fairly linear.- Missed Opportunities for Gameplay: Spoiler Free TLDR- A lot of set up for certain locations and events, but ultimately downplayed or pushed aside. - Minor bugs: Certain Achievements don't track, your character can get caught on boxes, enemy routing can get wonky.NEITHER PRO NOR CON, JUST NOTES:- The English Dub: Just skip it and set the audio to Russian - The tone of the writing fits way more.- The Story: A lot of exposition dumps, and a lot of dialogue between you and the glove. Switching to Russian definitely lets you tune out the glove, but it does not stop the game from halting to stop to tell a story beat. However, the story is always moving forward, and the true ending makes you reflect on the choices and interactions you've made so far.- Very overtly sexual: I knew what I was getting into by just looking at the Twins, but I was not prepared for the crafting table to sexually harass me.I think the game has a lot of obvious flaws, especially when it comes to pacing, but I think the gameplay is satisfying enough to hold the game up, while the game's identity carries it to the finish line. Hopefully future content can see things like more zones to explore, or even a boss gauntlet mode, and maybe that elusive photo mode. Overall, it's fast, slick shooter set in an world that grabs your attention - there's a lot more that can be added or changed, but the package as-is is a fun one."

It's an amazing single player game.Now that I've reached a point where I've dealt with the open world for long enough, I do agree the enemy density is a bit too much. Luckily, you can disable patrols and cameras in a certain area to give you time to loot in peace. However, you often need to deal with the pesky robots in the area in order to disable them, so there's no escaping it completely.That aside, the exploration, combat, puzzles, level design, etc.. is all top notch."

4428,"I, MAGICIAN",https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076221350/,No,,1,59.6,March,9,69,0,1,"I give this game a reluctant thumbs up. Why? The reasons are as follows: 1.) The technical ability demonstrated in the graphics is unsurpassed, but the subject matter (appearance of the environment and cinematic ambiance) is entirely focused on making everything ugly, from the architecture to the garbage and junk strewn throughout the game. These guys have proven that they can present near photographic representations of life-like animation, but I'd like to see one shot of an entirely stunning depiction that doesn't make me want to tear the wall paper off my bathroom walls. Considering how much time and energy was put into mirror imaging, shadow and detail, it's not too much to ask to see at least one image that takes the breath away. These Devs could have done that.  It didn't happen. Colors were earth tone and muted pastels and hideous architectural construction.  I understand the Devs were trying to create a mood. But why waste such talent on making the game so artistically off-putting? 2.)  The game relied too heavily on a techno-science narrative. I found the dialogue about polymer and robotic - human assimilation to be pretentious. It was unnecessary to the game and demanded that I care about a far-fetched story line in order for it to work. It did not. The game would have been better if I did not have to listen to P-3 and the NPCs droning on and on about who did what to whom...and why. It's irrelevant. I felt my time was being wasted by engaging in forced dialogue over issues that didn't affect the game play and were implausible. 3.) Some (dream) scenes were too weird. If I wanted to jump over a nuclear sub in search of apples dressed as a monkey (or similar animal) I could take 4 hits of acid, i.e. it was a bit too much, considering this is primarily a shooter game and I found these surreal elements  detracted from the main objective: Kill Evil Bots. 4.) The puzzles, unlike other games were heady and unnecessarily intellectualized: ""Ballerinas depict prior deaths."" Fine, I get that the shadows needed to be juxtaposed to solve the puzzle. But please, I play games like this to test my skill at defeating invincible enemies with limited resources. I am not exhilarated by fiddling  with abstract images just to get through a door. 5.) With all the hype before this game came out, it did not live up to the advertising. It would have been much more effective if the entire game were simplified without all the cerebral story line, without the preponderance  of the painfully ugly environment, without the reliance on my willingness to buy into a PhD dissertation on ""what if communist Russia did (fill in the blank) back in the 50s. Despite all its pretense, the game was playable. I beat it. Apparently, I'm in the top 16%, for now. How did I do that? You can beat the Twins by simply buying all the ""Character"" polymer upgrades. I did not have all the best weapons, just Electro, KS-23, Fox and Kalash. Once you get a feel of how to deal with enemy bots, defeating them is easy, even without owning the more advanced weapons. Use the adrenaline meds (the little purple ones that look like acorns with spikes). Use the Kalash to inflict damage on the Twins. If you run out of ammo, use the shotgun. (Like I said, get all the polymer upgrades under ""Character."") This game is worth playing, but wait until it does not cost $65."

Mostly due to during hectic moments my focus was not on the very calm dialog the main protagonist was having but rather the horde of enemies I was facing.Some mechanics seems a bit unclear how to use and had to google to see how to do it, even then I just ended up simply not using some mechanics. But that could just be me being stupid or simply overthinking.Music is great, however in more than one occasion I've killed off all the enemies and then triggered the music that was supposed to be accompanying the battle just after, making for a very intense and metal soundtrack-ed looting of corpses.And lastly, some minor glitches in the HUD, be it quest marker, subtitles not synced, at some point it switched from English to RussianBigger bugs I only encountered more of a collision problem; twice I got stuck and couldn't move away from a spot and had to reload a previous save.All of these are minor things and it enjoyed it, quite thoroughly."

Soundtrack is spot on for the theme of the game, unfortunately, non-russian speakers will have a hard time relating to this game since it is not something they grew up with, such as Nu Pogodi. The Soundtrack contains classic Soviet hits, techno music and classic hits but with a modern twist. The game has bugs, sometimes getting stuck between rocks, in some corners, there are a few audio bugs too which all in all have minimal impact on the gameplay.

It really took me back. solid just straight up fun game play, really well optimised, runs solid, bugs have been hard to come by so far.    also change your vocal audio to Russian, and subtitles to your home language. the English dub is pretty bad unfortunately. Makes it far more enjoyable experience!"

4488,Formerly Darth,https://steamcommunity.com/id/itsaiah/,2,,1,3.3,March,8,142,0,1,"I have only played a bit of the game so far but already know my net reaction for the game is going to stay positive save some massive ♥♥♥♥ up out of nowhere so I figured i'd review it now and re-edit my review later.The presentation for this game is absolutely breathtaking.  The graphics, art-style, sound design, music, and voice acting are all top notch.  The opening hour in particular was probably the most jawdropping visual experience i've ever had in a video-game and puts other great openings like that of Bioshock Infinite to shame by comparison.The primary problems i'm seeing right now is the UI, while pretty, feels cumbersome and the story's reliance on exposition dumps can feel somewhat overwhelming.  Often times i'll find myself listening to someone for upwards to a minute straight only to get pulled into combat and miss out on important information.I'm also not a fan of the manual save/load locations.  I felt it worked in games like bioshock where your progress was saved regardless and so save spots just changed where the game dropped you when you die.  Comparatively, it's annoying to die in Atomic Heart and have to reloot multiple rooms before progressing forward.Also, while I suspect the protagonist may go through some sort of character development, his generally dismissive and entitled attitude is a major turn off and makes me dislike him.  This isn't inherently a problem.  If it's intentional then I actually applaud the bold decision.  However, if the protagonist does end up being a stagnant character who you're supposed to just view as your stand-in avatar then i'd have to say I dislike him."
4489,Microsoft EXCELSIOR!,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatbastard5059/,2,,1,29.4,March,8,146,0,1,"Game completion: ~30 hoursStory 7/10:I found it interesting but knowing that at certain points the choice placement of dialogue made it feel like your character was solidly refusing to learn from the evidence around him I can't review it any higher. However for the third act, while I don't believe the writing improved in any meaningful way, I felt HIGHLY invested. I was pumped up for the finale and it felt gooooooood. 9/10 for that moment.Gameplay 8/10:Played on Armageddon. Frenetic, fast-paced action that absolutely requires you to be on your toes at all times. Boss fights were bloody incredible, some of the best I've seen in a shooter. Abilities were powerful enough to switch the tide of combat entirely if properly used and quite a bit of fun. Melee felt pretty useless and risky, low damage and leaves you vulnerable. It didn't make sense to have more than 1 melee weapon. If you actively explore the open world you will find more than enough ammo.Open world 6/10:Honestly this is likely somewhat just cynicism on my part due to Ubisoft titles but does everything need to be an open world? I think Atomic Heart would've been just fine without it. However, it was decent enough. It had some optional bunkers with puzzle challenges that for the time I put into them I enjoyed."

It is fairly difficult but not overly so. Solid story with fun mechanics. My only complaint is that your characters gets caught on everything, which makes mobility pretty frustrating.

I'm talking about Atomic Heart, a game that combines the best of science fiction and scariness to create an experience that is truly out of this world.Now, I know what you're thinking, ""why should I care about this game?"" Well, let me tell you, my friends, Atomic Heart is not your typical run-of-the-mill video game. It takes place in an alternate universe where the Soviet Union never collapsed, and technology has advanced in ways that will make your head spin.The game is full of stunning visuals, from the retro-futuristic architecture to the grotesque creatures that inhabit this twisted world. But what really sets Atomic Heart apart is its immersive game play. You'll have to use your wits and your weapons to survive, all while uncovering the secrets of this strange and dangerous place.So, if you're looking for a game that will challenge you, thrill you, and leave you wanting more, then Atomic Heart is the game for you. Trust me, folks, you won't be disappointed."

No, you should buy this game because it's beautiful and the story is, as best I can tell, fantastic.  That said...I'll probably never finish it.  The reason why is simple: infinite repair drones.In Atomic Heart, every area you enter has a certain number of hostile robots, and every area is beautiful.  Every zone is filled with things you'll want to read, listen to, or just plain gawk at.  It's also full of cameras, called Dandelions.  The good news is that you can one-shot these cameras and continue gawking in peace.  The bad news is that the game will spawn INFINITE - and I mean literally never ending, because I've shot down 30+ waves of them all trying to repair the same damn camera - repair drones.  These drones pose almost no threat and can be dispatched with 2 shots from your energy pistol.  They'll even give you some resources, so a useful hack for farming common resources is to shoot a camera in an area without robot patrols, then farm the repair drones for parts for as long as you can tolerate it.  The thing is, the game will continue to send repair drones, and nothing else (okay, OCCASIONALLY it'll spawn a repair drone with a very weak laser attack too, woooo) until one fixes the camera.  Once it finally does, then the camera will spot you and call in infinite waves of very angry, very lethal robots until you either die, or leave the area.What this means is that you can never just take it all in.  You can't clear an area of hostiles, then calmly enjoy the beautiful world the developers clearly poured their hearts into.  I've played maybe four games, total, where I even WANTED to just have a look around, and I love this one more than the other three.  It's too bad the game itself won't let me.I am going to look into modding this game and see if I can figure out how to limit how many waves of repair drones the game will spawn.  If I can, then I am absolutely going to finish this.  If I can't...then it's just going to eat space in my library for eternity I guess.  As-is, it's not unplayable, but it's unenjoyable."

When you're exploring facilities or other indoor/underground areas the game plays like a puzzle-infused corridor shooter. There is plenty of gameplay variety found here - and the depth of which you'll encounter depends on your willingness to explore and play with the game's many interactibles. Most of the game's structured moments happen indoors, which makes the next part of the game so interesting to me...While outside on the surface, the game is brutal and unstructured chaos. And I mean that in the best way. The game really beats it into you over and over again that this entire facility was fully built for these robots - that includes cameras and patrols on every corner - and humans are at a huge disadvantage here. I felt immersed in the world because of how terrifying on higher difficulties simply crossing the street can be if you're low on supplies. At first the relentlessness of the attacks and re-spawning enemies were frustrating, but as I changed my tactics and snuck around more often I began to really feel and appreciate the oppression of the world that Mundfish created.Strongly recommend playing with the Russian VO as to avoid hearing ""crispy critters"" out loud because even once is too much and distracts from the otherwise intriguing story and mostly solid writing - not withstanding P-3's dialogue.10/10 Would play again and again and again..."

Good.The story? Actually really good.The combat? Uninspired, nothing ground-breaking here. But it feels solid and at moments is amazing.The world? Crafted quite well, but isn't really open, you never feel like you are able to explore the world, it's pretty much linear. I hope mods change that a bit, but probably not.The art? AMAZINGThe Music? Again, AMAZINGThe English voices? A little strange, the timing is off at times, But I didn't mind it too much. You character seems rather grumpy all the time. But I found it relatable and funny. I mean how would YOU feel if you couldn't remember most of your life, everything is going wrong, people are criticizing your hero and seem kinda right, you don't know who to trust, and all of these robots, puzzles, and mutants courtesy of scientists that don't think of consequences keep getting in your way? Yeah, probably a bit testy.The overall gameplay? Eh, it feels outdated as all hell. If this game would have released 10 years ago, it would have been revolutionary. But now it is outdated from the get-go. Like a Russian game it takes aspects from other great titles of the time and improves or puts a twist on them. But the problem is that the aspects it's using as a base themselves are OLD.There is not much fresh to be found here besides the world and design, because art doesn't age like gameplay.The enemies are fantastic in animation and design, the problem is that you don't really care what enemy grunt you fight. Which would've been fine if the game came out 5-7 YEARS AGO. But since then games have evolved and left the games that Atomic Heart borrows from, in the dust.In short, this game is a victim of its own ambition. For the devs' first game it is done amazingly well and I respect them for taking the time they needed to make the game they wanted. The problem is, that in the process of making the game, the world moved on, leaving their once inspired ideas tasting stale.I'd watch out for a second game from this developer. With the majority of the groundwork laid with this game, A second shouldn't take nearly as long and should feel much more fresh.Should you buy it? Yes, for $60? No. Wait for a sale, I'd say this feels like a $45 game.Politically speaking should you buy it? Yeah, don't let the actions of some old people in some office somewhere inform YOUR decisions. They already control the world enough. It's a good game, the devs put hard work into it, if you appreciate their work, then buy it. No need for politics in the world of gamers."

It was such a description that drew me in when I first heard about Atomic Heart many years ago. And . You know: The type of game that's not really a must-play, but good fun for genre enthusiasts.First of all, . It's way closer to BioShock Infinite than System Shock 2 (in terms of its gameplay design, not the quality of said gameplay). In other words: It's a shooter with some gimmicks and more options for player expression compared to a strictly linear shooter – but . The map layouts offer some freedom, but after you're finished with a story-relevant section, you typically can't return to those areas (not that there's any reason to return in the first place). Some of the powers you get are pretty original conceptually (shooting goo from your hand comes to mind), but they're very much focused on combat – which makes most of them kinda superfluous because you have plenty of guns that can do the job just as well.: You see, not only do you collect traditional audio logs, but there are also  lying around that . Thus, many of the 'audio logs' in Atomic Heart are actually short and bizarre (in a good way) dialogue sequences, which I think is a great way of making them more engaging.. For example, many parts of the game are filled with sexual innuendo, from crash-test dummies arranged in suggestive poses and an overly pushy weapons upgrade station to more subtle things like suspiciously-shaped oval doors. These design choices give the entire game a pervasive theme of 'sexual frustration', so I was looking forward to seeing how Atomic Heart would tie this into its narrative. Maybe it would turn out that this was all just a hallucination of our main character, indicative of his own sexual frustrations. Or maybe it's meant to be symbolic of the sexual frustration lurking underneath the clean façade of this highly repressive society? Well, the game does kinda , but that information is only explicitly revealed as a side note in an optional area and it really doesn't tie into anything in the greater narrative. It's an omnipresent part of the worldbuilding that ultimately only exists to say: “Ain't that weird, huh?”All in all, Atomic Heart is a good game, especially as a first outing for this developer. Finally, let’s address the elephant in the room, which is the fact that Atomic Heart is developed by a Russian team (masquerading as a Cypriote company) and it’s been released at a time when the Russian government is committing what I and many others believe is an ongoing attempted genocide against the Ukrainian people and their culture. The fact that I've bought, played and enjoyed Atomic Heart should clue you in that I've nevertheless come to the conclusion for myself that the allegations against these devs aren't conclusive enough to tie them to the current political regime. I encourage you to read up on these allegations before buying the game, though, as you might well come to a different conclusion.What I feel the need to point out to adequately describe the finished product, however, is this: . In light of the current political and humanitarian situation, it's sometimes hard to stomach reading yet another text log about how alt-history Soviet science is the saviour of the people of the world, or hearing our main character talk about how we should just trust the Soviet leadership. But . Even our main character ultimately comes off as a 'useful idiot' anti-hero whose main fault is that he blindly follows the party line against all common sense. Now, I’m not saying it's IMPOSSIBLE to still interpret this fictional USSR as a 'utopia ruined by a few bad apples', if you really want to understand it that way. But the game does give you enough dissenting information to make that reading less valid. I do wish there were more personal stories of dissent and evidence of oppression under this regime (see Prey's sub-plot about future-Soviet forced labour victims), but it's better than nothing, I guess..."

I've followed Atomic Heart's development for quite awhile, and when the first string of trailers released I was absolutely excited. From the music in combat to the little music when upgrading your glove and weapons to the entire Facility 3826 being beautiful and alive and immersive. The boss fights and their grand animations were so jaw-droppingly beautiful and fun to fight. From weapon upgrades and glove combos, every kind of fighting style is encourage with a fun roster of unique weapons to choose from.

Since it was first announced and shown off, and I thought there was no way it could live up to the hype. At least for me, thankfully, I was wrong. This game is fantastic and sets itself perfectly inbetween bioshock and the Prey reboot. A lot of melee combat to begin with, but by the end you are guns blazing with plenty of spare ammo. The weapon variety is great, the enemies are dangerous and wonderful visually, and this game sets itself as an instant classic and leaves me wanting more atomic heart and mundfish."
4546,Perhilixous,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198128112194/,No,1,1,23.8,March,7,113,0,1,"To preface this review, I do understand there have been some *very* notable controversies regarding Atomic Heart. And while I stand on the side of ""Play what you want"", I do understand the concerns surrounding the developers, and their (reported) involvement with political factions.That is all I will comment regarding that, however; I've come here to review a game, not bicker and ♥♥♥♥♥ about politics.Atomic Heart, at it's core, is VERY similar to games like Bioshock and Prey, with the mixture of aesthetics, setting, technologies and other such gameplay implementations being a crossover between the two. And this isn't a gripe at all, I enjoy the fusion they've made here.The gameplay loop is immaculately crafted I'll just say, allowing for playstyles of all fields while still building into high-octane gameplay; forcing the player to dodge and avoid hostile attacks at will, while using their arsenal to deal with their foes. It's a breath of fresh air, and I enjoy it thoroughly.I'll also say, the game does, oddly enough, have some Portal feels in it with the Testing Ground Dungeons players can get into for extra loot, upgrades and materials. I can't say I'm a massive fan of how the Testing Grounds are constructed, and they all feel the exact same after a while, but I'm not going to lose sleep over it.I have seen people clowning on the English voice acting, and while I can agree it isn't top-notch, it *certainly* isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Of course, if you understand Russian, go ahead and use that for your language option, but don't worry about bad English performances either.Now, getting down to my favourite part of this game; the setting and aesthetics. Atomic Heart is, dare I say, *very* innovative in it's style, design and atmosphere. I genuinely cannot name any other games that use the Atomic-Era as a backdrop, and it's amazing how they set AH in the ideal Soviet future (in a purely cosmetic sense, of course). While I do believe the atmosphere can get drab at times, it's never in an insufferable way.Down to the plot, I haven't finished the game yet, but thus far it's very enjoyable. There's a good variety of missions, and it never just sticks to one single thing throughout the entire line. The characters are fairly enjoyable as well, though P-3 isn't *really* my overall favourite, since he seems to ping-pong between being a battle-forged warlord, and a noble, calm soldier who just exists to carry out orders. It's an odd way to do it for sure, but not horrid.I really don't have much else to comment on it, however. I'd say it's worth the $60, given the quality and playtime, but I can totally understand wanting to wait for a sale.EDIT: So after finishing (both endings), I must say I really liked the narrative. The game managed to trick and deceive me, using charismatic and demanding characters as it's vessel to do so. The bad ending genuinely made me feel, well, bad. And the good ending, though anticlimactic and fairly underwhelming if I'm honest, was a good wrap-upI really do wish we get to see some sequel or aftermath to the events of Atomic Heart, but should it never see the light of day, this has been one Hell of a game for sure"

Kudos to the art team. It's done really well and I would love to have explored it more......(see the bad) The labs were fun to explore and see how messed up things are/ have gotten. But something would constantly get in the way of this. (see the first section of the bad)Optimization: They did really good on the optimization in this game. I did suffer one crash during the natasha boss fight that made me restart the whole fight but other then that it was a smooth experience. Congrats to them for doing something most triple A studios neglect. I'M LOOKING AT YOU FORSPOKEN AND BF 2042(at release)Graphics: Graphically this game is solid. Some really nice scenes especially the intro. The neutral:Gunplay/melee: the Gunplay feels fine. nothing awe inspiring or innovative. Just a ok experience. Upgrading weapons did feel impactful to my playstyle. I only used melee as a last resort for most of my fights as the experience got repetitive after awhile.Powers: The powers were cool but felt like a after thought halfway through the game. Would have been fun if we could switch on the fly to mix things up instead of it being locked to only 2 at a time. THE BAD:DIALOGUE: ""CRISPY CRITTERS""....who says this?!?!?  this game protagonist and companion almost made me uninstall twice. THEY TALK SO MUCH! Like a insane amount and almost none of it is interesting information. Also the main character makes Frey from forspoken seem like Shakespeare. Cursing and yelling every 5 minutes, going on rants constantly. It's insane. And before someone goes ""b-bu-but did you try it in russian?"".....I did. it was worse to hear someone rambling in Russian every 5 mins. Easily the worst aspect of this game.  To add to this the game has a REALLY bad habit of having audio cut out  or overlap if you continue to explore while a chat is going on. Example: Running through a dungeon when P3 and Charles start talking....and then someone on the megaphone starts talking....and then a nearby body starts talking(it was one of the rare I'm going to talk without you interacting with me bodies)......miserable experience. This game has given me a DEEP appreciation for silent FPS protagsWriting/story: = ""we want to be bioshock but worse"". Could see how this story was going to go 2 hours in. Pretty disappointing.Open world:....This was such a pointless addition.It just felt like fluff to extend this game as much as possible.  Not every game needs a open world segment. Especially when the player is constantly harassed by enemies who constantly respawn. Felt like this game would have been much better by being level based.Enemies/gameplay: *YMMV on this one.* The enemies start out interesting and fun to fight but by hour 5 I just got bored of them. They just felt like gnats after awhile. I tried to mix up the powers to make it fun but that didn't last.TLDR: Can't recommend this one. The gameplay got stale and the dialogue is some of the worst stuff I've ever heard. This game has given me a deep appreciation for silent protags.  If you do want to get it wait until a DEEP sale."

I watched any video I could find on Atomic Heart, and with every video I watched I only became more and more excited for its release. I had waited a long time for others games before and have been disappointed, but I can promise that Atomic Heart was well worth the wait. It has an amazing combat system, drawing inspiration from games like Bioshock, and amazing boss fights along with puzzles that feel like something straight out of Portal. The game also has references to many things that were included in the old trailers, as well as references to material for when the idea of Atomic Heart was first being developed back in 2010. The story also does not disappoint with a good cast of characters and many interesting areas to explore. I will admit that I was a little worried about the English dub being used, but after having finished the game I can only say that it only leads to a few odd moments in combat and does little to affect the story. If you've been following the game for some time, or just recently saw the newest trailers I definitely recommend Atomic Heart as a unique first person shooter with engaging puzzle, and a fantastic world to explore."

The story is twisted, but not overdone, there is enough of everything in it. And how much hidden information about the world in the diaries and audio sources, can't be retold. What about stories about a dog, or spouses, or a space satellite... And references, references, references. As for the technical component - yes, there are problems (the hero sometimes gets stuck in objects and there is no way to get out, some objects disappear and then reappear, the acrobatics do not always work on the hook for the platforms).

All the systems are great, from the inventory to the combat to the locks. Its a blast. Also, on my 3090 I'm about 220 fps average at 1440p which blows my mind given how incredible the graphics are.

4578,Lloyd XMas,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199164319443/,No,,1,25.6,March,6,151,0,1,"Story was surprisingly engaging, even though that isn't something I usually care about (nor paid attention to, but there are forced cut scenes). The combat was fun enough. I generally don't like melee game play, but I found this tolerable. The game really opens up later once you get some of the weapon upgrades. Then you won't have to rely on melee as much. I never really used the bullet weapons very often because I didn't want to waste resources. Ended up using the electric pistol a lot and the saw melee weapon. This combo was enough to complete the game. I'm sure the rail gun is ok, I found it rather ineffective compared to some of the other weapons. Same with the rocket launcher. Just too slow. Crispy Critters (Bugs): 1. I had a good amount of crashes. Some crashes were at inopportune times. Such as after gathering supplies for half an hour just to have to do it all over again.  Seemed to happen mostly when using the gel and cryo mods together. 2. The shotgun blueprint was deactivated in my game. I've seen others with a similar problem. Kinda sucked when I wanted to try out all the attachments I got for it later. 3. Movement can be a little rough. It is very easy to get stuck in a corner because of the way the levels are designed. Things you think you would be able to walk over, you can't and it because a bit of a nuisance. 4. Climbing is the worst!5. Constant respawing of enemies got old after a while, especially when they stop dropping resources after they are gathered once (so, remember the areas you already looted).  It's not as much of a headache later in the game. Anyway, I though the campaign was good. But I also don't think the game is worth a full price because it only has about 25 hours of game (and that is with exploring everything). It needs another mode for after completing the game. If the campaign was much longer, and there were more weapon variety, then cool beans, but I just think it needs something to keep you wanting to play. The mechanics are good enough that I would like to try some more variation. Tip:Keep moving"

It is looters paradise and allows to experiment the diferent habilities and wepons as does not penalize for changing them. If you are waiting for Doom Eternal, probably this is not the game for you. This game is about exploring and experimenting. Finally altought is repetitive, the art and music of this game is amazing.

El combate mano a mano combinado con las armas y habilidades es muy divertido. La recolección de objetos es muy gratificante para cualquier ""gremlin saqueador"", y el juego no te penaliza por reconfigurar o reciclar las armas y habilidades, lo que permite experimentar. Si estas esperando un Doom Eternal probablemente no es un juego para ti, este juego más de recorrer explorar y experimentar. Hay algunos detalles de coalición con algunas superficies pero nada serio.

It reminds me of the good ol days of gaming back when there was more focus on an interesting story with fun and exciting gameplay. Its a bit buggy but not as bad as most AAA games these days, you can play through almost all of it without any severe game breaking bugs.

If you are a fan of the Bio Shock series, you will most likely enjoy this game and what it has too offer. The games strengths are in its visuals and combat systems, but fall heavely with its boring and predictable story and mechanics that have not been polished. Most of the mechanics, puzzles, and features seemed great in concept, but did not seem like they were fully completed and was slapped together near the end of development. Most of the visuals although pretty, did not have a cohesive theme the they stuck with, almost every area was broken into drasticly different art styles and makes the different levels and areas clash with one another.Over all, the game is fun, but I would not call it an amazing game. For what Atomic Heart is, it has interesting combat mechanics and environment and is rather enjoyable to play. 6.5/10"

Art direction and optimization is superb and its an incredibly unique world to explore. Combat is a nice mix of melee and ranged fights with unique abilities to experiment with. Voice acting of the protagonist could be better but if it bothers you that much switch to Russian with subtitles. The score of this game is also remarkable during fights and the ambient futuristic music is very well done. Still working on my opinion of the story.
4619,Jetmix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jetmixx/,1,,1,28.6,March,6,977,0,1,"A really nice first try for Mundfish (game developer), a solid game with some problems, but none of them are so critical that you should avoid this game. Don't expect too much, try not to compare it with other projects (especially Bioshock) and you'll not regret about spent time.I'd like to start from coolest feature of this game for me: ambience. Have you ever heard about phenomenon when people are romanticizing some time (80s, disco, medieval etc.)?  This is it; this is pure good nostalgia about USSR and as a CIS born person, I felt everything from my childhood: houses, speeches, f-words, environment, music, USSR fails mostly in all aspects (spent all the polymers if you know what I mean). But just to be clear, it’s just a background for the game, nobody will try to tell you that USSR was the best country ever (I would even say the opposite, you will see why not).And here comes one small problem, if you aren’t born in any CIS country, you might miss a lot of “local anchors” (memes, jokes, references to culture). Story is… Ok, it’s fine. As you might know, you’re a major, who was equipped with super-duper glove and sent to solve “situation”. The more you progress the story, the more complex “situation” become. Game has some twists, most of them you will guess, some of them might sounds interesting for you. There is only one thing here that actually spoils the impression: protagonist’s reaction. No-no-no. . Everybody and everything will exactly tell him (and you), what’s wrong with this place and Major Nechayev will say something like “No, it’s not possible, he is a good man \ they are good people”. That should probably show him as a straight soldier, but actually it’s just annoying.Except of this, cinematics are good, story dungeons are well designed and not boring, length of the game is pretty much balanced (by the time you’re starting to think “that starts to be boring” game actually says “ok, here is a final”)I've completed the game on Hardcore difficulty, so all my notes below should be read with one idea in mind: “What actually works to help you reach the end of the story?”. And I could say, not everything in your arsenal actually works.Least claims to weapons: melee weapons are good, shotgun is awesome, energy weapon helps you get a good start, but after that you’ll find a recipe for Zvezdochka and realize that her special attack makes everything else (especially for bosses) be just a time filler until energy is restored. Here comes one of the two major problems of the game. Mundfish were trying to make skills unique, but instead, they made most of them useless:Somewhere in the middle of a game I’ve realized that I want to choose Telekinesis and more bullets for my build.Another major problem is open world. It’s really annoying. You don’t have a Ubisoft style outposts and juggernauts (and this is good), instead you have an endless amount of cameras that triggers an alarm and forces you to fight enemies you don’t want fight to. And except of that, open-world is just a source of resources for crafting. And polygons (mini dungeons with puzzles).A lot of reviewers are saying that this is a “Bioshock inspired game” and while it looks like it, for me it’s more of “Fallout 3 \ 4 (not New Vegas) without RPG elements”. Try to guess the game by description: “You have an upgrade station, and you need a various number of resources to craft or upgrade your weapons. You are heading to open world \ dungeon, killing some enemies, looting some houses, trying to find some recipes, loot until your inventory is full, get back to station, upgrade your weapons, craft some ammo, and repeat until final boss”. At the time of review, game is pretty much in a good shape, it’s nicely optimized, but still has a lot of visual and technical issues (some objects are unreachable, some enemies are instantly stand after being knocked out, once textures for elevator weren’t loaded, bees sometimes “forgot” to repair camera, needed to progress to polygon). Fair to say, none of them are critical.It’s a first game for Mundfish and I could definitely say that this is a really good start. It’s not a best game of all years, I hope with DLC’s (or Atomic Heart 2) they will try to solve some of the problems, but for now I’d definitely recommend you to buy the game if you can afford it (but no need to rob the bank or get a loan to buy this game)"

The story is good for what it is, basically Skynet take over with a twist (a couple actually). Its a mix of Bioshock and Terminator with a pinch of alternative distopia future that is very rare with games now. Most characters are really good and actually feel like people, and the enemy variety is decent enough to keep it from going stale, I would just wish I could boss rush the bosses as some I feel like are too easy when you have so much downtime between them. MICK GORDON - that is all you need to know for music Graphics are decent nothing super special but definitely feels like even the smallest assets were given an extra touch here and there. Definitely need to update your drivers and hopefully RTX support comes out for this game. My only gripe is how everything ends of a sequel set up in both endings which personally I feel like the game stands fine as a stand alone game.

It has good pacing, good creativity with puzzles, and all the additional details like the emails you can read or the pocket watches you can listen to (like voice diaries) are worth going over if you want to get immersed with the lore.

4665,VikLives,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vikscar/,No,,1,19.7,March,5,57,0,1,"The game's got some bugs and some issues with polish but compared to the actual broken and unfinished state of most games that come out these days, this one was remarkably complete and satisfying. The gameplay is fun, the animation on all the enemies is phenomenal, and the bossfights are a spectacle, even if some of them feel mechanically shallow.The soundtrack was god-tier, easily one of the best parts of the game, and the art direction was absolutely incredible. I'd say that the story got a little incoherent but was overall competent. The voice acting and dialogue was slightly odd but I got used to it, its what happens when you have a foreign dev and things don't quite translate correctly. Also, the open world was absolutely point less, I didn't interact with it at all and just went towards where I was supposed to go. I never even noticed it really. Just drove to my destinations. Overall 8/10, not quite on par with some of the greats in this genre that it aspires to but a worthy entry into the genre."
4666,AFKaptain,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023263426/,No,,1,16.0,March,5,704,0,1,"(Grab on sale) Atomic Heart is the result of obvious passion and talent and notably absent experience and discipline. It is only a bad game if you let the absolutely amazing visuals trick you into thinking it's a AAA title, but this is an indie game, and an honestly impressive one. The open world is borderline empty of content, but looks really good. The voice acting... isn't great (not horrible, either), it mainly just suffers from having to deliver iffy lines that were obviously not written with English in mind. The combat mechanics are generally ""only"" kinda solid, but the fight music is hype and enemy designs/mechanics are actually fun as hell. The game's aesthetic makes an impact with a great blend of Bioshock, a touch of atompunk, and grandiose Russian imagery. The story is a bit messy and is more often ""just okay"" than anything else, but the moments when it ramps up are fun and weird and BARELY save the story from falling into ""forgettable"". And like I said, the graphics are top notch. Overall, it's not a great game, it's barely even good, but I have to give a thumbs-up if only for how well they did the things they got right."

People saying its a 15-30 hour play through is a lie. This game is better than any AAA game that has come out in the last 6 years, that is genuine to the work and time put into it. No online connection needed, No pay to win, No plethora of worthless cosmetics to buy with IRL money that sums well over the actual game price. Its just a work of masterful work crafting and interesting story telling. Fun weapons and view point of an Alternate reality in the Soviet Union during the mid 50s. Love the futuristic/ sci fi look of the Science the world has, but still reminds you its the 50's and its gonna be a big leap and change for humanity. A few little complaints that can be remedied via updates soon I hope, Dialog skipping seems to be a bit buggy skipping too much or to little. Certain angles or positions to looting items in the world becomes annoying or impossible (normally not big loot). Completing some mini steps to unlock the training rooms can be buggy and not register until reloading the game (which is easy plenty of save points but pls fix that). Some main character dialogue can be missed/ skipped unintentionally by walking into certain areas, or using NORA (pls fix that). Overall this game is a breath of fresh air, in a game industry of 2023 that would trough out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pay to win or broken and buggy games full of broken promises and lackluster content, Rather than release a game that has been loved on since day one developing. This Game does not do any of that. Just a plain ole fashioned shoot em up, loot em up, power yourself up, and conquer enemies in any way you wish! Characters are fun, serious, or straight up mental (some of em) and good comedy at times. Oh one last mention, This game has ""real""weapons and you don't need to worry about being a specific in game level or having Legendary weapons, or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that. Just get your weapon, get the unlocks by exploring and feel powerful mid game!"

Atomic Heart feels a lot like Bioshock Infinite and Half-Life had a baby, and its a beautiful baby. The game runs and looks fantastic, i have it all turned up to ultra and have had absolutely no frame drops. The upgrade system is awesome (has a cool 80's feel to it.) and as far as the FPP and weapons, it is all very well done. The Melee feels a lot like Dying Light 2 melee, and the FPS feels like PUBG.

But it's the first FPS in a while to bring some fresh aesthetics, themes, and design.  The combat is fast paced, the arsenal and powers (while somewhat limited) are all satisfying to use, and the enemy variety is... enough.  The puzzles are repetitive and ♥♥♥♥ though, not to mention way too easy.  While I do enjoy the moment to moment gameplay quite a bit, it is the unique and surreal setting that really keeps me coming back. I'll never get tired of hearing ""Zvyozdnoe Leto"" through staticky speakers while a giant smiling rotorbot slices my head off.Easy 20-30 hours worth here if you take your time and explore."

But most of the time I have no idea what is going on, or why I am doing what I am doing. I desperately wish someone had given this a little polish and explained what was going on better.

4678,✪ Lemming,https://steamcommunity.com/id/oomrlemmingoo/,No,,0,11.3,March,5,252,0,1,"Started the game, graphics looked great, initial missions were great, maybe a tad scripted but in a somewhat fleshed out story sequence style that was enjoyable. Then I got to the open world, this has to be the most lazy tacked on feature I've ever seen. The developers have put very little effort into fleshing it out to make it past the typical ""Hey we have open world"" bs seen in many games these days. Its as bad if not worse than many other games recently slapping on the rinse and repeat no thought put into it battle royale modes. There is very little original in concept, they attempted very poorly to slap on a GTA most wanted system, making playing the game in anyway other than a failed attempt at being ghost recon stealth simulator knock off without getting swarmed by numerous rinse and repeat enemies that all feel incredibly feature-empty. They failed to populate the open world with anything more than the typical lazy ""turn off thing A to open thing B"" style missions.Overall I cannot recommend this game, simpy for this part of it. If i could give the developers any advice it would be that if they are going to make a game open world then commit to it. If they want to make a story game then scrap the tacked on open world and give players a curated but finite experience. For the record: I purchased this game myself, I have played for 12 hours but I simply cannot play anymore through this atrocious ""open world"" to get to what I am assuming, somewhat hopefully, is another great but scripted story section."

Great story and graphically good - not too intensive of processing power either.My biggest complaint is that is a perpetual puzzle game with a bit of combat thrown in for good measure. Puzzles are great, but there just seems to be one after the other, with surprise attacks from robots thrown in for good measure.  The inability to save before going into a tricky section is another let down - i just completed 2/3s of a complex puzzle, was attacked by robot and killed, and now have to start the challenge all over again - losing around 15 mins of gameplay in the process.  Have quit the game in frustration 3 times now due to the same issue.

Some of the things he says are pretty funny but he does say “crispy critters” too many times lol. The looting is also satisfying and quick with the glove ability. The UI is clean.

Games were never meant to be political tools for stuff and war, and its very saddening to see a highly anticipated game be tainted weeks before release. maybe im biased seeing that i've waited for release since 2020, or maybe its a coping mechanism since the allegations  all that are tainting the game. whatever you please, its your own choice. Overall great game with intricate story and customiztion of weapons, its not much but better simple, beautiful designs and the nickname ""soviet bioshock"" really fits. However there are some thing i do not like:no sprinting: dashing only makes it a lot unnatural to the character, instead of running you just sidestep like a smash bro player.The dialogues: dubs are mid, better put it in the native russian with subtitles, hell, maybe you'll learn some russian words beside cyka blyat. Its enought they have dubs for other players to enjoy, but clashes with the soviet aesthetic.Gameplay: it has RPG mechanics that i hate, for example, some bosses have elemental weakneses, but that is better going off the game, since this essentially means that 1/4 into the fight, you already chug all your ammo and you are forced going melee the rest of the fight. and melee to save ammo is a nice mechanic given the situation the main area puts you into, with you scraping the scrap of the robots to craft, but some enemies are not made to be encountered into melee distance, essentially making you play sneakily, which another thing the game does not nail well. too many cameras and dandelions, every 4 step into the open I am met with a camera alerting me, and whe i get alreted, they send way to many enemies.Character: agent P-3 is another classic instance of a character that goofs around for the game, and yes while he starts to change as the game progresses towards the end, gaining a serious grasp of the situation and reality he lives in. making him as related to the main characters from forspoken or Hi-Fi Rush is a bad idea, moreso related to the main character in forspoken. however, I believe they toned it down just a few notches, too many one liners and WHO THE F*CK THOUGHT ""crispy critters"" IS A CATCH FRASE?!. maybe as dlc goes on they fix thisBut do not fret! do not let this pull you aside from the game, this is a full fledge story based game of ""what if?"" for a good price and no micro transactions for stuff, planned stuff for dlc and much. this game has a bright future, do not let its grim background affect your perception of the game.And besides, some vidoegame sales will definately not turn the tide of the event."

Half decent when out in the world but so far spent most the time inside, and found them average at best. lacking HDR. But then people criticising the game play which I've found okay, but then i loved bioshock infinite. Often feel like i'm the only one who did.i was hesitant to buy this as it came from an unproven development team, but if you can buy it cheaply its worth a shot."

4700,Kekistan Border Patrol,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198111035472/,No,,1,20.2,March,5,168,0,1,"Slavjank has come a long way. This is a one of the most uniquely bizarre and yet cookie cutter games I've ever played. Gameplay wise it doesn't really do anything new. Sort of like Bioshock meets Far Cry with a bunch of other added mechanics we've all seen before. Basically throwing crap at a wall and seeing what sticks. Surprisingly a lot of it works and it makes for a decently enjoyable action shooter. Defiantly has that slavejank feel buried under a pretty AAA presentation. Bugs, some half baked ideas, clunky controls, iffy writing, overly ambitious design, crazy story, etc. The art design and presentation is fantastic. There is an insane amount of detail put into almost every aspect of the in game world. You can defiantly see where the devs took their inspiration from but there are enough new things added that give this game a unique look and feel. The music is excellent too, if a bit all over the place. A mix of argent metal, industrial, Eastern European techno, synthwave, licensed tracks, old timey Soviet music and remixes. Boss and arena fights always have a cool track picked for them. One of the best video game soundtracks I've heard in a while. Unfortunately there is almost no in game world interaction. Everything aside from a few props is nailed down. Pretty to look at, but you can't really touch it. Also the sound effects for the weapons and powers just don't sound punchy. It drags the combat experience down a little because of this. This is in stark contrast to the really well done animations for both the player and the enemies.The voice acting is... rough. You can tell that this game was translated. The VAs do a okay job but I think some parts were lost in translation because the way some of the characters speak is a little off. This is especially present in the main character. One second P-3 is serious, then joking about, followed by raging and yelling. He also talks way to much. The writing isn't quite MCU levels of cringe but the tonal shifts, excessive and strange use of profanity with odd phrasing just hits the ear wrong. I can't comment on the Russian voice acting as I don't speak Russian.The story is alright. I won't spoil anything but you can more or less see the twists coming from a mile away. It's easy to follow and carries you through the game. The tone is strange. It goes back and forth between serious high stakes sci-fi and wacky fever dream. It does a good job at reflecting the main character's questionable mental state throughout the game. The other characters have understandable motives but they all seem pretty one dimensional. The setting is the interesting part. There was a lot of effort in creating the lore for world and it's worth your time to search for it. It compliments the main story pretty well.On the technical side the game runs well. I've got a slightly above average rig and it ran with a consistent frame rate at max settings. A few stutters hear and there but it never crashed. There are however some bugs. Nothing game breaking. Just the occasional wonky animation, pop in, physics related shenanigan, enemies hitting you through a wall and occasionally getting stuck on level geometry. It defiantly feels jankey at times.Another thing; no inappropriate political messages, virtue signaling or writer self inserts to talk down to the player. I cannot overstate how refreshing it is when a AAA game is released that does not comment on, mention, pander to or reflect on the current state of cultural affairs. There are politics discussed in the game but they are only relevant to the setting. Considering this is a 1950s retro-futuristic USSR setting you can imagine what they are. But, again, it's only brought up in relevant context to the story.Overall pretty fun. I don't feel like I wasted my money so that's good I suppose. It didn't blow me away, I wouldn't say it's mediocre, but not a masterpiece. It defiantly has a unique look and feel. I'd say it's worth a shot or at the very least get it on sale."

Even though I'm running a PC damn near a decade old, even on potato graphics, the world is beautiful. I loved the story, and the titbits of lore around the world. I'm currently on my second play-through and I still get excited when I find something new. The game play is fun and enjoyable, more en-depth than a typical FPS which is nice. I hear a lot of people call this ""Soviet Bioshock"" but that's not the case. Although I can see the inspiration and influences of said game; Atomic Heart truly is a game that stands on its' own uniqueness.  I wish they added a couple more variants of enemies to spice things up. Or maybe an extra weapon or two. I think it would've been neat to see what they could've done with an SKS, and have that as a DMR. I the game could've benefited from having a med-to-long range weapon, but balance it with smaller ammo capacity. I also would've liked it if say the characters didn't wear such similar uniforms. Since all the garrison troops you find all wear the same (no different ranks, no officers or specialists), and the main character wears a very similar jumpsuit to all the others jumpsuits wearers. Some distinction and variety would've helped to make things feel less... samey? Perhaps when DLC and mods start coming in, things will change up, but I digress.I really enjoyed the game, I honestly recommend it to anyone who wants something new and different."
4716,Grater,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CheeseIsDelicious/,No,,1,26.1,March,5,252,0,1,"Theres something endearing about the cold war/space race art style invoked in science fiction. This game is in that region with a Soviet futurism flair. It nails that landing so well. The world is never boring. The idea of how the music is handled really sets the mood, with remixes of modern songs and then classic songs from the soviet era. If there is one thing this game aced with no issues, its this.While the beginning of the game does give a feeling of system shock 2/stalker resource scavenging where every battle with the bots is a struggle, about two thirds into the game I was maxxed out. If you are packrat, this game will not hold a challenge for long. The same pitfall as prey and bioshock more or less. The developers were too skiddish to commit to an oppressive resource setting, and instead held the game back to be more accessible. Regardless, the gameplay is fast and fluid. I rarely had issues where it felt like a cheap death. The mini 'portal-like' levels (training grounds) worked well in getting you to fire some neurons in a more productive manner than just clicking on everything. Animations and gameplay mechanics are more polished than most AAA games of today. Especially when you are using powers and you are one handing your main weapon.The story has some strong beats and while the main character in english is a real jerk sometimes, it works overall. I quite enjoyed the banter. Some characters are really well done.I would not put this game into the category of more hardcore titles like stalker and system shock 2. I was hoping for this game with such a design standard, yet such hope leads to disappointment more often than not. That's the state of gaming I guess. But I will say this game does sit above bioshock and prey in that it does give you more of a challenge, and it will not hold your hand to the level those games do.Definitely recommend a purchase. Hopefully the DLC delivers as much as the main game does."

Honestly, I didn't really know what I got myself into when I pre-ordered this one, I just did because I saw a few trailers and was hyped immediately. And it certainly lived up to expectations, the game's got a good story that isn't that hard to follow. It's also got a great combat system that offers a variety of different kinds of weapons. This ranges from melee to guns and others.The game also offers a skill-tree system which allows you to upgrade your character and certain abilities, which I won't spoil for you. However these abilities do allow you to play differently if you wish, so you'll be able to switch your combat style up whenever you want.Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new modern shooter.

4723,whiskycat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/voidmalign/,No,1,1,25.3,March,5,518,0,1,"A little bit janky, but overall a very solid first project for the studio. As long as the devs learn from the mistakes made in this game, I'm sure the next games will be even better. The visuals and sound are great. The combat system is a bit lackluster, but doesn't ruin the experience. If you're planning on the hardest available difficulty, then the game will constantly punish you for exploring the world by having infinite enemies (unless you do something about this, but even then the measure is temporary). The writing is... a bit cringey. Especially when you consider the dev's obvious political agenda. But even if you put that side, some of dialogues are just weird. Expected something a lot worse and was pleasantly surprised. Definitely don't feel that the money paid was wasted."

I recommend the game but some nitpicks are evident.The game is very stable since day one but still some incomplete or un-optimized aspects of the game creep up. The most annoying parts is when the game softlocks--when an elevator wasn't programmed to come back up so you cannot revisit a training facility or standing between two wooden boxes and falling in-place forever. The game crashed once on me when I was repeatedly electrifying an enemy. Also, the game slows down when using scanner mode and you're close to anything of interest. The most mindless neglect from the developers is the inability to craft the shotgun due to the lack of a recipe for it: you either have to keep it in storage the whole game or use it as the primary ballistic gun. I've also observed a lack of subtitling near the end of the game or lack of translating the last document of the game (not sure if that was intentional).Gameplay loop is above average but not spectacular. Very Bioshock, System Shock, Fallout inspired weaponry and combat. The best part of the combat is the 5 melee weapons which offer a number of interesting mods (besides Fox) to dictate how you're supposed to play. Then you have 4 ballistic weapons to use against organic and robotic enemies--each weapon being valid in their own right and having a purpose. Then there are 3 energy weapons that range from weak, medium and strong--most likely stick to medium unless you go through the training grounds for the mods for the weak energy weapon. Luckily, all resources are in a close pool so disassembly the guns will give all the resources back. Plasmids too.The idea and setting of the world is great and reading through the documents from terminal and chirpers fleshes it out a lot. Main complaint is that the testing grounds are not really exciting to explore even if they make sense in the world. Definite bizarre moments and cringe dialogue choices and strange moral/philosophical ramblings throughout the game to keep me engaged. English dub is lacking (and cringey most times) but after knowing the story once the game should be played in the native language. Good game with way to much to type out in one review but very much recommend for anyone already interested in the game. Excited for the sequel!"

4769,Джейк,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198240250102/,1,,1,30.2,March,4,486,0,1,"Fantastic game. General thoughts: I thought the twist was obvious very early on but I really didn't see the ending being that way. Played both endings and I'm a little disappointed with no true good ending. Also, it would be nice to have the option to do Russian voice with English subs (like Metro) (still learning Russian, not quite that proficient, but I did love reading things and then being able to check for accuracy by walking up to them for the English translation; I would even correct some of them.) Jumping mechanic is wack, to just suddenly generate momentum in some direction while in mid-air. Story overall was pretty engaging and wildly relevant to some of the patterns in today's world. Even in the alternate present portrayed by this game, one can see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The minds of the world seldom follow with the technology utilized by them. I feel like the endings also left room for another game potentially; I would be fine either way if it was left as is or there was some sort of follow-up. Maybe not even a full game but an add-on DLC. I would like to be able to change the radio in the cars. I think something should be gained from each major complex's research.Cons: A little buggy still but not to the point of being unplayable. Some things would rainbow until I walked close/on them. About 3/4 of the way through the game, achievements stopped popping but I don't know if that is the game's fault or Steams's. And there were a lot of lit up corpses and loot boxes that I could not interact with no matter the angle. Also there are some chests that are inside of mountains and therefore inaccessible unless I am just missing something. Maybe it's just my time in Elden Ring but bosses felt a little easy if I just ran circles and dodged occasionally. The only enemies that really gave me trouble are the Plyush since they just won't die and often caught me in their quick time combo. The electro pistol should have the option to aim down the sights and assign the special attack to another button. I think all glove powers should be assignable at the same time because Jet is situationally useful but it relies on other elements (Shok, lasers, or freeze) to be used which unless you only use Shok, limits you to not using the shield and/or telekinesis (I didn't find out how good those were until late game). Elevator times were too long.Eroticism: Can't wait for the robophilia update/DLC so I can give NORA all the polymer she really deserves. The scenes with the Twins are somehow erotic despite the actions they perform, very graceful in what they do always. And those little grenade launcher robots that waddle the streets... I'd overheat their coils in a private room.Pros: By far the best game I have ever had for picking things up but not having to worry about inventory management. No one-by-one searching and all extras get sent to storage is definitely something I'd like to see in other games, some even retroactively. Weapon variety was good and I tried almost all of them (except every melee) but some seemed like they were only meant for early game even when fully upgraded. The different upgrade paths for each weapon were nice along with the more cosmetic functions like optics. I think the only thing missing is a DMR/sniper. The glove powers are really nice, remind me a lot of older games that emphasize ""video-gamey"" powers. I only realized in later game how well they can be tailored to your playstyle, shield is very nice for melee whereas the freeze with jet is nice to stop enemies from flooding you while you shoot the others. Variety of enemies was nice. Having robots and the run-off from failed projects (mutants) was nice, although I did not feel the need to specialize my weapons for mutants ever since I could deal with them more easily. It was also cool that they generally went about their primary purpose while not killing humans like sawing logs, tending fields, etc. Granny Zina's little Baba Yaga hut chicken was pretty cool.Political Bit: I am happy to have gotten this game at full price with the pre-order bonuses. I will make sure to only get Stalker 2 after a few years on a Steam winter sale at 80% discount. ;"

The game is a fun little fantasy adventure in a vastly alt-history universe, and while it is at times a bit heavy handed with the communist glorification, its usually framed in sarcasm. The only thing that I've found that is annoying is the dialogue is sometimes...awkward. You often see this when you translate Cyrillic languages to English, a lot is lost in translation. In terms of gameplay it reminds my of bioshock, and prey (the new one). Both this game, and Forspoken feature a gauntlet that talks, and yeah, it talks a lot in this game, but its personality is much less British and annoying. Game runs really well on my 3070."

That seems to be rare in today's gaming world. The only real issue I have is I've gotten stuck on random clutter in the world way to many times and had to restart which is a little frustrating. Obviously nothing is perfect and so far I think that if that is the worse thing about this game, y'all did pretty good. I personally prefer the subtitles with the Russian voice actors as I assume the script and dialogue was all written in Russian, and do to the fact that when its translated into English, some of the power of what is being said is lost. That's not the fault of the game developers, it's a fact of life. I'd give this game an 8/10, overall I very cool and  unique experience, good job guys."
4788,Zorcaino,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zorcaino/,No,,1,16.5,March,4,732,0,1,"Good game, basically soviet Bioshock with an open world. Gameplay is very good, but some aspects of the game are annoying. The detection and alert system in the open world sucks so it's super easy to get an army of enemies attacking you non-stop at once when you're trying to get to an objective, the map system sucks and is literally the worst out of almost any game I've seen - it's so bare bones. The side content in this game boils down to 8 optional ""dungeons"" that are more or less just the same puzzles repeated through all of them which give you some neat gun parts but they aren't the most entertaining to play through. The main campaign overall though is great and worth getting through the bad parts for, but get it on sale."

Don't listen to people saying enemies are bullet sponges. If you upgrade your weapons, use the right combinations of gloves powers n guns any enemy can do down in a reasonable amount of time. So basically... use the tools the game provides. Dodging is well designed, timing it to attacks and punishing enemies works great and creates a good flow in combat. + Great setting and environment, very cool enemy design (even though you could ask for a bit more variety in enemy types, I thought it was acceptable) + Absolute banger of a soundtrack but of course with Mr. Gordon's name attached to it it's pretty obvious + Unapologetic and does what it wants. Yeah, it makes some dumb jokes. Yeah, there's fridge sex. Yeah, the main character is a grumpy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But the game doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ and just goes for it, and I appreciated that. - I really wish it was more polished. None of the bugs are gamebreaking enough to make you stop playing. I got stuck in environment and had to reload a previous save twice in 22 hours of gameplay. Whilst arguably that's something that should never happen, it's really pretty damn rare... There are other small bugs that are a bit disappointing and the game would be a smashing 8-9/10 without them. Enemy AI is really not great, especially in terms of pathing, they get stuck running against fences very easily. There's also a strange animation bug where when they get knocked down, you will see one single frame of them standing upright (literally one frame) before getting up. Again, small polishing details that are a bit of a shame. - The story isn't a masterpiece, but it's good enough in my opinion. The ending however... I won't go into details but I thought it was pretty damn bad. Just a mess and overall quite disappointing. - Play it in Russian, seriously. The English VA isn't necessarily Tommy Wiseau level of bad acting, it's just the WRONG voice and acting for the character. He's supposed to be a grumpy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a crappy life who's generally mad at the world. Might not be the most appealing main character quality but I found it refreshing to see in a game: a main character who doesn't try to be likeable. And for the record, grumpy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who are mad at life like him exist in real life, so I found it believable. The English voice actor is the most boring, vanilla, normal sounding dude you can imagine. Like the Farcry 4 character but much more boring and vanilla. It's all wrong. He's not supposed to be a fratboy on holiday, he's a veteran spetnaz amnesiac...- Overall a bit short for the price tag"

Its very colorful and has a very clear and nice to look at art direction. Art director did a good job on this one. Game was also released decently optimized as well. A modern miracle in gaming.Now onto... the voice acting...The English voice acting specifically. I liked it. It was funny. Yes I can see the flaws in it and some may define it as cringe... and yeah a little. However I came to look at it as a Soviet counterpart to Duke Nukem. A 'Czar Bomba' if you will.

Higher difficulty just means enemies have more health and do more damage. Your shotgun takes 3 shots to kill the basic robot and ammo is scarce, especially in the first 3/4 of the game. In hard mode your melee, usually your only weapon, is almost useless. Medium is beatable, but easy provided me with the most fun : grind ratio. (I started on hard and got around 40% through on it)- Story ends stupidly, feels like they needed one more boss fight. Maybe they are setting up a sequel, but idk.- Great soundtrack, the entire time I enjoyed the music- Gunplay was really fun when I had ammo- Dismemberment was also really fun to play with- Stages had some annoying parkour, but otherwise was well thought out- The elemental aspect was basically useless, but was interesting regardless- Mini bosses were really fun- Cars are weak af, they know this and place them everywhere, they should have less cars with more health"

4825,Vanilla Glaze,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046894896/,No,,1,32.4,March,3,167,0,1,"Overall i would say this game plays like a mix of Bioshock and Doom that takes strong inspiration from Fallout in its art design. It's a pretty fun game and i had a good time. Gameplay is for sure the bread and butter. Its solid with very fast paced and tense combat. The game makes you feel like your'e the badass without any compromise. Visuals are amazingly creative that pair nicely with the bright flashing lights which add shock and awe to the environment. There's lots of puzzles throughout the game that lower the tempo in between combat areas. They are refreshing to get lost in and also can be challenging at times, but nothing that you will break your brain over.What i didn't like was the writing/dialog for the game. P-3, the person you play as, really just sounds like a teenager who thinks they need to cuss in every sentence to make themselves sound funny or gritty. He also says a lot of cringe lines that make you wish he would stop talking. Story kept me playing but its nothing ground breaking. It gets a little dry at points but the gameplay is what keeps you in. The ending however was odd and left me confused, i feel like i definitely have questions but it may be answered in the coming dlc's. Check it out when more dlc comes out and hopefully that will help tie a bow to the story. 7/10."

The story is decent enough, a little cliche but it helps drive everything along. There's also a big emphasis on rewarding exploration, going into little spaces will give you a tonne of parts to upgrade weapons and upgrades and craft consumables that can completely alter how a weapon performs or what type of target it's stronger against.Well optimised with a range of options including DLSS for people wanting higher framerates at all resolutions, probably the first game I've seen using Denuvo that doesn't run like complete dogwater and if anything actually runs really well*UPDATE* As of 10/03 this is now implemented.The only current downside I've come across so far is the lack of FOV slider but they have confirmed it's coming in a patch very soon and there is a very quick workaround using FlawlessWidescreen so it's not a deal breaker by any meansAnd yes, the music is utterly brilliant. Blessed Mick Gordon, Geoffrey and others all making a varied but across the board brilliant soundtrack. Some classic Russian songs with their own remixes too making them heavier as well as super guitar heavy tracks that could've come straight out of DOOM along with some pulsing Russian era synth beats that make you feel like it's a robot slaughter rave club or something and the testing grounds songs are just complete bopsHonestly, was expecting to be somewhat disappointed given how ambitious the game looked and I wasn't sure it would be able to deliver on what it was promising but I've ended up being more than pleasantly surprised to say the least and enjoying nearly every second9/10(As a side note, I really couldn't care less about the controversy around this game. People who seriously think this game will counteract any sanctions towards Russia in the Ukraine war are delusional and those also taking a stab at the fact it's glorifying the USSR are missing the fact that it's an alternative history game set in 1955 where the USSR took a MUCH different approach to literally everything as apposed to how it played out in real life. I came here to play a game I'd been waiting for, not get cancelled for supposedly supporting Putin's war effort)"

When I first bought it, I wanted to give it my all and 100%, but by the end, I didn't even want to try to get all the achievements. Atomic Hearts is a game that takes elements from several popular titles and blends them together in a unique way. While it isn't worth the initial $60 investment, I'd say if you can get it for $30 or $40, go for it, but the game begins to lose its luster as you progress further. The lack of innovation and originality is noticeable, and there are no real surprises or moments that leave you on the edge of your seat.The game mechanics borrow heavily from Dead Island Riptide and Bioshock, while the gameplay itself feels like a mix between Dishonored with a hint of Skyrim lockpicking and some Fallout 4 robot design thrown in. This combination makes for a somewhat disjointed experience that never quite hits its stride.The weapons are unbalanced, and the abilities feel a bit awkward with an energy meter for the weapons and a cooldown for the abilities. This can make combat feel tedious and repetitive, especially as you get further into the game.Additionally, the lack of challenge is disappointing, as everything is presented to you right away, and there are no real curve balls to keep you on your toes. By the time you reach the end, the game begins to feel drawn out and lacks any real sense of satisfaction.Overall, Atomic Hearts is an okay game that's worth playing through, but it's not one that you'll be dying to come back to. While the initial mechanics may seem promising, the lack of originality and balance make for a game that falls short of its potential.  I really loved all the other titles that Atomic Hearts borrows from. just not atomic hearts"

The main character has goofy dialogue and at first it'll be a bit jarring since his tone and personality seems to shift, but it's not too bad and reminds you this game isn't taking itself seriously so have fun. I wish he had a Russian accent instead of a bland American one to be fully immersed into the world. The gameplay is solid and easy to grasp, similar to Bioshock and yes, they reference the franchise. While there is a sneak mechanic, it's not a focus so you can go guns blazing at each fight.

There's enough that you can see the inspiration, but it's not a rip-off by any means. Voice acting and characters are great! The story is internally consistent, and any weirdness can be handwaved away with ""cool space science stuff"". The gameplay is engaging without getting old, and the enemies are varied. I'm an animal, so my solution to most problems is ""more gun"", but you are given the tools to find other ways around problems. The combat was a little odd to get used to, but once I got the hang of it, I could play and engage with threatening enemies. I LOVE COLLECTING UNLOCKS, AND THERE ARE MANY!Cons: The quick-time events were a bit of a surprise half the time they popped up. That's also, definitely, a personal preference thing. There are some tedious puzzles, but, if you stick with them, you can solve or work around them. Some of the enemies are a bit annoying (flyers), and some are just damage sponges. Minor gripes overall. My PC is also a tad underpowered for some of the more graphically intensive areas or set pieces.I absolutely recommend this game."

I am happy to see how much more optimized this game is compared to a few other AAA new releases that contain game breaking bugs and visuals. The soundtrack is spot on for the game and the atmosphere that goes with it is fantastic. However, I do feel the melee combat could use some minor adjustments to feel like you have more contact with the robots/mutants, the real-time damage done to the robots and mutants with each swing of the axe is satisfying to look at. The gunplay is very pleasing and done right, enemies also don’t feel too bullet spongy which is nice. The English voice acting especially for the main character is not the best but far from the worst I’ve heard. I do recommend playing with the Russian voices and use subtitles as it is more audibly pleasing. In closing, I think anyone looking for an alternate history game (ex. Fallout, bioshock, etc.) will also enjoy this title. It is definitely a unique experience for sure but It is an experience worth having."

4868,The Ceres,https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_ceres/,1,,1,30.0,March,3,198,0,1,"Overall i liked the game. First few hours are kind of slow, not much happening and can feel long. But if you give the game enough time, you will get tha action going. Open world isnt really definition of open world, or atleast for me. There are some dungeons you can explore (and they are worth the exploring for gear) and some nice places to see but thats pretty much it. Gameplay isnt revolutionary, just classic CoD type of gunplay. You can carry as much weapons as there is and have 3 abilities to use. I enjoyed the story especially at the end but main character has some flaws like some cringy jokes and sometimes acting like complete brainwashed soldier by the regime. PROS:- Universe and art design is really nice, liked it a lot. Its certanly not any kind of propaganda on the soviet regime. - Various weapons and abilities, you can switch and refound ability points anytime you visit the weapon ""vendor""- The story is also very good, if you want, you can read all the notes and get some more details on the characters to understand the story a bit more, but if not, you wont miss anything important.  - Graphics and optimilazations are great. With DLSS and low-med computer zou can run this game very smooth in every are in the game.- Gameplay doesnt provide anything new you never saw but its not boring. With 12 weapons too choose from and many builds for the weapons, you have a lot of variety for quite a short game. - Game is trying to send you a message at the end of the story. Or atleast it seemed like this to me. Things are not what they seem to be and its not really that predictable. CONS:- Main character is sometimes too cringy and acts stupid. Way to stupid. Dont know if devs wanted him to look like brainwashed and infinitly loayal soldier, but it gets really annoying sometimes.- Not many types of enemies. There is legit only 1 model for mutant ""dead"" human enemies in the game and everyone looks the same, looks lazy to me. - Some dungeons in open world get repetetive and there is not much more to do except them.- No FOV sliderI would rate this game 7.5/10. Finished in 28 hours and did all the side content."

It's a strong start to 2023, and I look forward to seeing what Mundfish does next. If Atomic Heart is a disappointment to anyone, they probably came in expecting way too much, because this is an enjoyable destruct-a-thon through a Soviet dystopia filled with the bodies of people deceived by promises of an easy AI-run life and a few powerful men.Combat in this game takes some getting used to, but once you understand how to mix dodging, shooting, powers, and healing it becomes a cakewalk.  Gunplay feels really good with the pistols and shotgun; less so with the machine guns, which feel weightless. Once you start getting upgrades the game really stops being scary and becomes a lot more fun. While hunting upgrades through the open world was at times frustrating, when you finally understand the rhythm of the combat and the ways you can stealth around and away from enemies it becomes pretty enjoyable. The puzzle rooms, while visually very reminiscent of Portal 2, are much simpler than the testing chambers and are rather boring. They're best used as a way to tone down the intensity of the open world and get a breather between story sections.If there is a problem with the combat it's that very few enemies ever evolve or have variants, meaning you fight the same enemies the same way in the same environments over and over again. While initially quite fun, it did become a bit wearisome by the last third of the game, and I just lowered the difficulty so I wouldn't have to waste more time on them during my last 4 hours.Atomic Heart makes it very easy to experiment with different abilities and upgrades, which I appreciated. All the powers are useful for specific playstyles, and thankfully there aren't that many puzzles that require using them; when you do need a specific power, there's usually a conveniently-located NORA nearby. Mass Telekinesis is probably the most useful though; there's no easier way to kill the hordes of enemies you fight in the lategame. The story is a bit of a mess. It felt like there were two or three writers who weren't speaking to each other. Whoever wrote the actual in-game dialogue should be sent to the gulag; it's not funny or endearing. Conversely, the main plot and the events in the cutscenes come together pretty well and culminate in a pair of endings that feel thematically appropriate, if somewhat hollow and unearned. Most of that hollowness is, again, due to the in-game dialogue of both P-3 and the various corpses you find around the facility, which doesn't add at all to the worldbuilding in the terminals or expand on any of the secrets revealed about the facility and the experiments that went on there. There's very little sense that what happens in the cutscenes is related to what you're discovering as you play through the game's levels.I strongly recommend playing the game in Russian with English subtitles. While native speakers may notice sub-par voice acting, it's infinitely better than playing the English dub. Unfortunately, the protagonist sounds far too young and unseasoned, and it makes bad dialogue worse. At least in Russian  it sounds less silly, and the emotional moments in the cutscenes hit a little stronger. The biggest flaw of Atomic Heart is that it really does not know what to do with the time it's given. The first 2/3rds of the game are fun, satisfying, and full of mystery; however, when you find yourself chasing after the same pair of NPCs again to yet another creepy underground bunker, the whole sequence feels a little too repetitive. Instead of revealing aspects of some of your characters as you reach new labs or uncover the next atrocity, Atomic Heart crams everything into a 30 minute dialogue just before the endgame. If you read all the terminals you come across, things become more fulfilling, but it's frustrating that things the player figured out 5 hours into the game aren't confirmed to the oblivious, idiot, wilfully blind protagonist for another 20 hours.Atomic Heart would be a real great game if it were only 20 hours long, or if the story revelations were better paced throughout its levels and the characters were a little more polished. Still, it's a very fun shooter with some cool worldbuilding that's definitely worth a buy.8.8/10"

The story is interesting and I liked the game mechanics from the beginning.  The open world however quickly soured, as that open world continued to repair the enemies and cameras that were destroyed.  There is a way to limit the repair capabilities of the endless swarm of repair robots, but it's only temporary (like 15 minutes temporary and only for a select area).  I took a moment to realize I couldn't play the open world game the way I would have preferred and continued onward with the story.  Things seemed better until I decided to try to optional areas to obtain blueprints and realized that jumping mechanics are utterly ******* horrible.  I've tried keyboard and mouse (and controller) and things work when they choose to work.  I've wanted to rage quit just on that alone.  Lastly, I've had a few game crashes and it really really stresses the do NOT rely on the auto-save because you can find yourself having to redo an hour."

And honestly, I think with all the ♥♥♥♥ this game tries to do it does them very well. Definitely not perfectly by any means but very well indeed.WHAT I LOVED1. Gameplay is very fun and fast-paced. It is more akin to Bioshock Infinite than anything else in my opinion. You are constantly rewarded for killing enemies and using all of your arsenal to your advantage. Picking up items quickly with your glove telekinesis is also very satisfying and should be in more games. Taking forty minutes to open every drawer in a room is not fun game design. It's crazy this has just occurred to people.2. The soundtrack is criminally underrated for this game. There were many times when I just had to stop and appreciate the music this game brings to the table. You've got a whole mix of funk, rock, and even a little hip-hop. In Soviet Russia. ♥♥♥♥ was insane. I especially loved NORA's theme/upgrading theme. It's such a simple tune, but it made me look forward to upgrading my gear even more.3. Story was surprisingly intelligent for having a rapist fridge in it. It is basically if you took two geniuses who had vastly different opinions on what humanity's evolution would be like and put them at odds with one another, with you at the center of it.4. Worldbuilding is just excellent. You can tell they were passionate about every aspect of this crazy, wacky Russia.5. Upgrading weapons and abilities was always fun and NORA just made it even better.WHAT I LIKED1. Voice acting is really good for everyone. I know how people bash the English translation and it is a bit messy at times, but the main character grows on you. I'm not gonna lie, the first time he said ""Crispy Critters"" I almost died from cringe. But after a few dozen hours he started to grow on me, and his relationship with Charles is actually quite endearing towards the end.2. The Testing Grounds was a cool idea executed... okay. There were some I really liked, and others that were just annoying. They did give me Portal vibes, which I also didn't expect from a game like this.3. Open world was pretty fun. It was just large enough to feel large but not too large to where it felt like a bunch of empty space.WHAT I HATED1. Hives. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hives. And Pchelas. These things make so many combat situations in the open world annoying as hell. You don't even have time to loot enemies you kill because in two seconds they are already fixed. I think Hives should either be destructible or should not work when you're not detected.2. Stealth. This game needed an actual stealth system. I don't understand why there are cameras, an alarm system, and stealth takedowns when this game doesn't even have a detection bar like in Farcry. It just doesn't make sense and doesn't play very well.3. The Electro. The Electro needs to be nerfed. I suppose you could just not use it, but it saves so much ammo and the EMP blast is really the only AOE attack you have in the game. It just detracted from the experimental mindset the game tries to push you toward. The same is true for Polymeric Shield. Fully upgraded, it basically makes you invincible.4. Some minor bugs that need to be patched out. I didn't really run into any until halfway through the game, then I encountered several that made me lose progress because I had to reload a save to fix my game.SCORE: 8/10I really enjoyed Atomic Heart. It has some kinks and lacks a bit of polish, but it reminded me of the glory days of FPS games, when developers actually had some amount of creativity and wanted to create interesting worlds. Looking forward to the DLC and whatever their next project ends up being."

Feels more like a $40 or $50 experience but I don't feel like I've wasted money since I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it and couldn't put the controller down.     Feels like a Russian take on a Bioshock/Prey/Half-Life but in an open world. Normally I'm not a fan of scifi but I love me some open world FPS games and also games that have a linear story-driven experience.     The main problems I have are: it's kind of short and the ending has a massive info dump, boss fight, roll credits, and the good choice is the bad ending & the bad choice is the good ending. Many twists in a short amount of time and then it's over.    If you enjoy Prey 2017, Bioshock, and Half-Life you'll probably like this."

I enjoy seeing the parts of the city. fighting all the robots in different ways, due to the gloves powers. and being able to play the game your own way. the final boss battle, funnily enough the shotgun was recommended by most, but with a few tries i was able to do it with an axe and pistol. It definitely is a 'Play your own way' story game. Of course it has the draw backs, the end of the story felt a little empty, a few things were predictable. And some sections really felt overly enemy heavy. I'd be attacked by several things, then a mini boss pops up, and it took me 15 different tries just to defeat it, ONLY to die and go back to where i was struggling before. But I will play it again with hardmode, and attempt to 100% its achievements, but to those who like combat and story games, go right for it!"
4902,Joker,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tali_ZorahVasNormandy/,No,,1,83.8,March,2,146,0,1,"I have been following this game since it had a store page on Steam back in 2019, and I can honestly say that this game was one of the best experiences I have had in a long time. The QA alone deserves the thumbs up, as I only encountered 2 minor bugs prior to the patch, which both could be remediated through saving and reloading. Aside from the QA perspective, the gameplay is a combination of elements that Mundfish has managed to blend together in a way I wouldn't have expected to see. There's a BioShock-y element to your weapon and ability usage, puzzles and test chambers that give me a soviet Portal 2 vibe, boss fights that feel engaging yet not overly tedious, and finally, a narrative that is very well written in terms of plot. Each time I thought I found everything this game had to offer, it somehow managed to surprise me in a pleasant manner with something new and the developer's attention to detail.Highly recommend this game if you want something to keep you occupied for ~40 hours and/or love classics like the BioShock franchise."

4915,NebSehemvi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nebsehemvi/,No,,1,19.6,March,2,251,0,1,"Can I recommend this game?The short answer: yes.Long answer:It's worth trying though I can tell that first quarter of the game it's kinda hard and somewhat boring at some moments. The funny thing is that this game tries to be scary sometimes too, you can expect some sort of robot jump scares if you don't scan all the space ahead. But I think it's only relevant for the beginning of the game and at the end of it.I really liked aesthetics of the game, it's really interesting to see all these robots and architecture variations that have never existed. Devs worked well on characters and I can't tell that they're plain, it's quite opposite. I had only one problem with the voice actress for Granny Zina - when I heard her voice in English I was like ""wtf it is much better than the Russian one"", in Russian she sounds like a 40yo woman trying to impersonate an old woman. Total miscast. What else didn't I like?- The huge influence of Bioshock Infinite on the plot of this game. It's really noticeable.Neptune/Rapture underwater bases, flying cities, the lighthouse, connection between the protagonist and the main villain, abilities of the hero.- Bees and their bases. I understand that they can spawn again and again. What I can't understand - why fat boy can't destroy their hive. It's awful gaming experience when your fallen enemies revive again and again. On the other hand - it's a great opportunity to farm some resources. Though I'd prefer to have an ability to destroy hives.- The first encounter of Plyush. This thing should be balanced in that scenario. I didn't have fat boy atm and I spend around 300 kalash bullets on it, 3 fire polymer thingy and some time fighting with Zvezdochka or Pashtet. It was hell. I managed to kill that thing on the third try. Also combo thing to get out of its tentacles is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Especially on the easiest mode - there is no room for a mistake and the given time is really short to react.- Steamdeck bugs: abilities don't have videos, Ну погоди! cartoons don't play anywhere, cutscenes after finishing the game show only the black screen.I won't be waiting for DLC, I'm not gonna buy them, I'm fine with spending 19 hours to finish this game. It's worth trying and finishing once, but no more than that."

On the other hand the world looks very well made, with various graphical level of details. The story so far is not something wow, it lacks in some areas, a lot, but I think it's ok. The characters are cool enough to keep the player going.The weapons and combat system are very good, and satisfying, also the looting system is awesome. I believe this game has poor sound design, at least the voice acting is bad; and some of the foot sounds don't match up with the surface the player walks on.

4927,Krenick,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Krenick/,No,,1,20.1,March,2,"1,134",0,1,"8.5/10With the expectations of this being a lot like playing Bioshock for the first time due to the fact that the developers said that they wanted to take a lot of their inspiration from said game it immediately had big shoes to fill.  With that being said I don't feel like it disappointed at all!  Would I say that there are some things I feel should be added to the game to make it a closer experience?  For sure, and with the community feedback that Mundfish games has been giving so far I could definitely see it happening later down the road with ongoing support or possibly within DLC that has already been announced down the road.I'll start with things that I feel that it could have done a little bit better for me to give it a higher score.  After you complete your first mission you are thrown into an open world where it's super hard to navigate (at least it was for me since I was on the hardest difficulty) without being detected and instantly dying, so yes that was a bit self inflicted there but as most games go that issue becomes resolved the further you get and the stronger you as the player become.  About the open world though, there are several ""Testing Grounds"" that you can go to to acquire different weapon upgrades as well as where a lot of puzzle solving starts to really shine in the game.  These Testing Grounds are super obvious on the map when you look at it but when you close the map good luck navigating to it, there's no compass, no way to set a waypoint for yourself you just have to wing it.  Very few bugs with the game where if you fall or jump into a crevice that has a V shape to it your character will get stuck indefinitely until you spam Space Bar + Shift at the same time.  This will have your character almost super jump out of anything you get yourself into however and its kind of funny when it doesn't happen too often.  The last negative thing that I will have to point out is that it felt as if the gun sounds were very muted and didn't pop enough for me.  The English voice acting wasn't exactly the greatest, if I replay the game it'll be me taking my time way more with Russian dialogue and English subtitles.  When it comes to the negatives that's all about there is.Now onto the good stuff!!  First of all I will say the art direction of this game is very much Bioshock in Russia, there's no doubt about it, and Bioshock anything is a good thing in my book!  The enemy designs range from cute to deadly.   With some enemies feeling heavily inspired by Bioshock and several other video game media, for Mundfishs' first game they made a great first impression on me.  A lot of the weapons/abilities also feel great to use and don't ever feel like one sucks more then another, obviously since there's a shock move in the game however its hard to see that going wrong when facing off against killer robots.  The music score is also paired extremely well with what's happening in the game and really gets the blood pumping, that paired with the combat it's very much like playing the newer DOOM titles as well to a certain extent.  Also a lot of the melee combat made me think a lot of Dead Islands melee combat, being able to add elements to weapons as well as just how well they depicted where the player actually hit an enemy, it makes melee combat feel very visceral and just way better then shooting a gun which seems pretty rare in games nowadays.  Another thing I enjoyed about the game is that it had its mix of audio diaries as Bioshock did as well as PC terminals that if you really want to read and get into things it's readily there for you."

The game is stunningly beautiful, combat is pretty smooth, exploration always feels rewarding and the Soviet aesthetic is pretty immersive. This game by far puts many AAA developers to shame with the games and the state they release them in this era. Critiques are few, the audio, or at least the English audio and soundeffects in cut scenes seem really off and some times totally detached from what is occurring in a cutscene Occasionally one comes across some graphic/map glitches that range from irrelevant, to pretty major in one select dream sequence. Some features of the game could be a little better explainedThat aside, highly recommend this game, very impressed"

Wow, was I wrong....this game is quite...umm, unusual...BUT Fun!Firstly, the graphics are amazing with really good frame rates, even playing at ultra (running a 2080 RTX Ti Founders Edition).  However, not unlike many PC based games, I find some of the movement a bit off and unresponsive.  I am even using Razer accessories and a wired mouse.  Jumping is a bit of a learning experience and getting caught behind objects without a way out....usual mouse and keyboard stuff.The story is a bit hard to follow as it takes odd twists in theory.  Also, some of the language and story telling seems like bad translation from the original language.  Some aspects are actually quite annoying.  I am also not a fan of puzzle and fight scenes where you have to spend 20 minutes trying, through trial and error, and then having to replay the scene if you fail.  Another game I played (could be Days Gone) had the scene jump ahead after a stupid amount of tries....smart, very! Overall.....I like the game...a lot!  ODD - Fun - Just Different!!"

Very nostalgic for me as well. People like to compare the two, and it's true they're similar in a lot of ways, but I liked this game a lot better than any of the bioshock games. Do yourself a favor and only play this game with the original Russian voice acting. A lot of people listed the English voice acting as a reason to not play the game, and I think it's unreasonable to judge a Russian game on its English VA quality. Thats not what this game was designed around. Altough yes, i'll admit, even in Russian the dialogue can be a bit rough to listen to at times. After having played the game a while longer, i'd like to add that the outside ""open world"" portions of the game need some work. While the map is very pretty and seems inviting, you can't walk two feet without being swarmed by never-ending hordes of strong enemies. Even if you manage to kill them, they're almost immediately revived. Not very fun or rewarding, especially for explorers. Hope to see this toned down just a bit :)Not perfect, but I find it extremely enjoyable and immersive. Overall, a solid 8/10 experience for me :) very fun, but maybe wait for a sale or a couple patches if you're unsure."

The only problems ive found are that the main character is kind of annoying and an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the re-spawning enemies are annoying but you can stop them from re-spawning for about 10 mins IRL if you take down a balloon thing which is very easy to do and is repeatable, and there are a prevalent amount of bugs (Ive had to reload 2 times due to getting stuck on things that you should not get stuck on. Oh and another thing the combat is too easy for it to be considered challenging even on the hardest difficulty, which is unfortunate.Edit: There are more bugs the further ive gone, ive had to reload over a dozen times now. Fun game but wait till more patches are released.Final edit: After finishing the game the final score out of 100 would be a 65. The game play is decent and the story was better than decent but left me disappointed and the ending sucked, as there is no true ""Good"" ending. Overall it is exceptionally average and has nothing noteworthy in it other than the hot ballerinas. I would wait for hot fixes to come out and then I would wait for it to go on sale.

You never get lost or don't know what to do. Over all, I'm having a blast. Once you get a few upgrades and the shotgun, the game is pretty easy. Just freeze, shoot repeat.

Prior knowledge. I was one of the many people who saw it in 2018, as it had some pretty decent hype. I know this is one of a tiny amount of games that mundfish made, so considering it took five years to make this masterpiece, I can say it was well worth the wait2. The feel. What i feel some people would hate is how it is gameplay wise, though that isn't my case. I prefer firstperson shooters and puzzle strategy, and with the added resource management and skill based gameplay, it fits my bill of a damn good game. To new players, it might not fit, but to us old schoolers, its a good reminder of when games relied on true management... if you get what i mean3. It's pretty damn funny. Despite the story being a bit odd, it adds charm to it, followed by the funny remarks and yes... Big Booba Robot Twins... it all compiles into my final bitIts a game like bioshock, with puzzle elements and shooting skills ment to give you a challenge as resources are flying out your pocket, partnered with the story and comedic value, i can say it was worth buying off sale. Though i'd suggest buying it on a 10-15% discount, if it fits your bills of the older time games, then support these guys by buying it fully."

The combat felt fun for the 18 hours I played as wellThe only negative things id have to say is The Wall Climbing while using a very similar system to other games can feel a little clunky and while the Testing Chambers I found a lot of fun the open world can feel a little baron and without character.Overall while I wouldn't say its a must play game its fun and a good experience but if you are a little on the fence about it id probably wait for a sale

Don't be surprised if you get caught between to pointy rocks and have to load a prior save- Not frequent, I've only had to reload once, but I have had to spam the jump, dodge, and move buttons for a minute several timesThe vendor/crafter menu is a little buggy sometimes- Be it the menu always scrolling back to the top after moving anything or the menus sometimes getting stuck and requiring a game restart because ESC becomes useless (only happened once so far), the menus look and sound so sleek, but the function doesn't match. For the most part it won't be anything to complain about, but when it is annoying, it's annoyingTHINGS THAT MAY PUT PEOPLE OFF:- I had to crank the difficulty up allll the way to feel like I was actually being challenged. People who are looking for a Dark Soulsesque challenge will probably be a little let down- The game does not hold your hand when it comes to explaining new mechanics as much as I would like it to. I found myself having to google something twice now. Not too annoying but still.- The writing for the main character is like an 80s action hero. ♥♥♥♥ this, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that, dumbass here, prick there. The Voice Actor is great, but the writing for him can be a bit cringe-inducing at times. All the other characters sound and speak pretty naturally, though.All said and done, I am having a blast so far. A beautiful game with an interesting story and characters to match, you will always be either shooting or slashing it up, taking in the scenery, or solving puzzles. The menus can be a bit janky at times and the enemies can feel a little childish in their difficulty if youre looking for a real real real challenge, but Mundfish truly has a gem on their hands. With a patch or two this game could be close to perfect!Check out some gameplay, read some other reviews, see if you like what you see. If so, definitely pull the trigger on Atomic Heart"
5039,lord tuberculosis,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198127346375/,No,,1,17.6,February,28,278,0,1,"Fun, but not as confusing as I would've liked, or at least not in the way I expected it to be.When I saw Atomic Heart's trailers nearly a decade ago I thought ""Wow this looks weird, I wonder what they're gonna make of this""Looking back, a lot of things that made this game look especially incredibly strange just wound up unused or changed in ways that were either remarkably similar, or completely different. The story is a clusterf**k of nonsense. Everything in the story tries to lead you in a certain way while also trying to instill doubt in ways that are bafflingly unconvincing, and then the story takes a 180 anyway and flips you in a way you never expected it to from the way it was written all along. It`s hard to say this game has a satisfying ending, especially when you consider just how weirdly organized the entire story is in the first place. That being said, it does have its charms.Combat, for the most part, is shockingly better than what I expected it to be based on the trailers. For the most part, it's a blend of shooting and melee combat much like what you could see in games like Dying Light, with enemies that are very easy to recognize and identify in importance in the heat of battle. I wouldn't say enemy variety is lacking, because for the most part I feel like if they added too many different enemies the game would be overwhelming very quickly. As it stands, the combat is good. Not exceptionally noteworthy, not terribly boring, it's just good.Some areas you discover might have puzzles. For the most part, most of these puzzles are actually pretty decently made with some clever solutions, especially those around the end game. However, a lot of optional side content that includes such puzzles have remarkably confusing solutions that I personally feel were not intentional, which made it feel less like an ""Aha!"" moment whenever I solved them, and more like ""Was that really it?"", which I suppose is a recurring theme in this game.On average, I enjoyed Atomic Heart, and I actually bothered to complete it because it was actually pretty decent and fun to play. Calling it perfect however would be a stretch of the imagination, as I can clearly see that developing this game was probably a hellscape for the developers; there's a lot of unpolished ideas and areas, bugs and glitches that can stop you from progressing or force you to restart the game, and inconsistent narrative structures that are more confusing than coherent. For what it's worth, I hope Mundfish's next project will have more clarity in its form, as I've already seen great potential for what this game is worth.6.5/10"

I also particularly like how its a game involves ""futuristic AI"", but its not about them being evil and overthrowing the human race like is normally depicted in most media to play on a fear that has existed for the same amount of time as the concept of AI. Its more about individuals having some evil tendencies that come to light when in a place of power. I wish I could explain in greater detail all the things I like about the game, the story is just captivating and the thought provoking nature of the narrative is beautiful. There's that sense of some sort of manipulation, and elitist environment similar to bioshock that's interesting to explore in a literary sense."

5068,Rockzor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rockzor/,No,,1,23.0,February,28,292,0,1,"If you enjoy games like Bioshock (more towards Infinite) and Doom, this is a game for you. Amazing graphics, fantastic music, great game play with skill lines for abilities, character perks, and weapon upgrades. Puzzles (specifically in Testing Facilities) to keep you thinking with enough variations so they don't become stale. Not sure why people hate on the VA because I think it is fine. No different than the above mentioned games really. The writing is hilarious and the story was great. The open world could use more interaction but it's really just the setting and kind of a farming ground for materials. You can basically ignore everything out there if you really want to just head to the story objective or side areas. Without too much detail, weapon and ability balancing could be looked at for the hardest difficulty. Some options are impossible NOT to take over others and make you a god."

At the end I had every skill maxed up and tons of materials and tons of ammo and stuff in inventory which I found pointless dissolving at some point. So yeah, I looted a lot. In some games looting is painfull after some time, but the style of looting in Atomic heart was pretty fun. And the soundtrack is soooo amazing, but sadly its not that common to hear it, maybe it will change, but I dont know.Game was surprisingly greatly optimised, I had no problems running it on max details with 70 to 140 fps, which is rare for new games (mainly if I consider that my pc is quite outdated for today standarts).I did not encourter any bugs, atleast not any that would not let me continue or make the game less enjoyable. Yeah there are some things at this time that dont work as intended, but its nothing major.Enemies are fun, some are anoying, but mostly I had fun with them, mainly the bosses and Right and left (twins) are simply 11/10.Puzzles, there are plenty of them and in my opinion they were fun practice to my brain.I finished the game with using only Swede, Shotgun, Kalash and dominator.The upgrade system is fun, upgrading your weapon change looks, stats and often how the weapon operates, so you can always use the same gun, without feeling repetetive.There are lot of guides for weapons, but in my opinion you need only these, Swede is realiable melee weapon and after upgrades it will onetap most enemies you encouter, also it suited me the most. Shotgun is satisfying to use and after upgrades really effective, I ended up using it for killing organic enemies and Kalach for mechanical. And dominator its really fun to use, the special attack is really efective against flying enemies or bosses.And abilities, I only really used telekinesis, which is extreamly satysfing to use and effective, and then polymeric jet, which is great against tougher enemies in combination with fire cartridge (and also is usefull som some puzzles)And if you are worried about the political side of the game, or stuff like that. Its a game that is not intended to be taken seriosly, everything is made as it was, the game is not forcing on you ideology, it used to be like that, everyting was perfect, expect it wasnt. Even in game there are some dialogs that tells you how not perfect it is."

I enjoy the puzzles and the mechanics. The melee combat is a simplified Dying Light 1, The Gunplay is Simplified Call of Duty well animated, the guns sound effects kinda lowers it though. they dont sound that powerfull.The abilities are great! i like that if you are mid playthrough and you want to try something new either guns or abilities the game lets you reset at no cost. you get all the ressources invested back so you can use them on another ability meaning no stupid grind.the Music is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. so far my favs are ''Arlekino'' , ''Kosil Jas’ Konjushinu'' and ''Hog-7''not saying the rest are not good they are if you got the time give it a listen, there's true love and passion here.All in all this game feels just so Honest in what it wants to be a FUN game, yes the dialogue in the beginning is ''S tier cringe'' but later on just sorta stops and becomes good.The plot is way more than i expected.The Aesthetic is Amazing.The performance:I Cant believe i gotta praise performance in a game as is something that should be a given from the get go but other experiences showed that aparently even that now its a luxury.. . THAT said this game runs smooth oh brother so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ smooth even with all the weird ♥♥♥♥ that goes on camera.Dont get me wrongThere are things i dont likeThe FOV is horrendous i was getting PTSD back to FO4 and BF1 and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FOV.Please Mundfish add a Slider i beg of you.The Camera Movement was also killing me, thank god there's a slider to reduce that.I also cannot denied that some trailers lie as some guns are not seen on Game. the ''Blaster'' gun from Bladerunner or ''that Gun'' as is know on FNV is not on the game even though its clearly seen on one of the trailers, the hammer with barbed Wired is also not present,Man i really wanted that Gun.Atomic Heart truly has an Atomic Heart in the form of passion its just so entertaining.if you have $60 and want something refreshing give this game a Go.Games like these and Terminator Resistance still give me hope that there's real talent and passion out there making games, not Hold down by Quotas or DealinesAlso yes the game is very Horny, I chuckled thinking this is just Soviet Old World BluesI love it.If there's typos, English aint my native so get off my grill!Crispy Ass Critter."
5089,bird with teeth,https://steamcommunity.com/id/birdlapis/,No,,1,22.2,February,28,105,0,1,"Honestly the game is pretty good. shooting abilities from your hand, underwater facilities, story of the game is everything went to shi- wait is this bioshock? anyway, the only real problem I have is one of the endings and some bugs. Lets start off with the bugs and other issues first. During some animations the game will freeze up, not such a big deal considering the gameplay is stopped so you don't worry about dying, Polygon 1's relay can't be repaired, getting stuck in spots you can pull yourself up to. NOW SPOILERS FROM NOW ON.I want to talk about the story now or the ending really.I like to think the endings aren't good and bad but just sad and ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, what"" the one that's just sad not emotionally but disappointing (to me both of them are disappointing but anyway) your character just wises up in the good ending and rips CHARLES out from the glove but also doesn't take care of the boss and you can just end the game there. But the ""bad"" endings has a theme that grinds my gears. The Good people are bad but still good thing. It makes me feel like I'm trying to split hairs here. So you are led to believe that Sechenov is the good guy at the start then ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan because you're a mind controlled zombie trying to please your boss who erases memories of your wife, puts his best friend into a glove, and plotting to control the country. IF you go with the ending to stop Sechenov then I guess you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck since when you shoot him, CHARLES who is revealed to be Chariton ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fries your brains and snaps Sechenov's neck after controlling the goo body, because evolution or something. Now that my rant about the bad ending is over. I still love this game for what it is and I give it a 7/10 (also probably not gonna happen but if the writers or devs see this can you explain to me why you chose the bad ending to be that way?)"
5090,ChaosKnight,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaosKnight_HD/,No,,1,29.8,February,28,103,0,1,"In short this is a finished game with no strings attatched, well optimised and an amazing creative direction for its own setting. The game takes place after the soviets won WW2. And you are a merc doing dirty work for a rich oligarch who kept you alive.The Bad:- Voice acting feels self insert, the english particularly has someone behind the mic making up lines for P-3 that aren't funny. You could listen in russian but you won't be able to listen to nora which will pop a blood vessel downstairs a few times. I only kept the English to listen to a fridge flirt with me. - The vehicles are terrible because the map is full of blockades so you can't drive too far. The hood of the car also blips over your screen whenever it hits something so you are inked in mario kart a lot. - Thermal weapon mod is useless- Could use more enemy variety- Inventory needs upgrades or you're stuck with 3 weapons at a time- Stealth needs more work- I can't have sex with Left and Right ballerina robot wives :(The good:- The combat doesn't allow blocking and forces you to use your glove to stay on the offence against waves of robots. Its fun and addicting a lot like bioshock. There is a lot of synergy with your abilities and you can figure them out by experimenting- looting is simple and pleasing- The puzzles are more fun than hogwarts, especially the door ones. - The upgrades are rewarding and refund if you change direction- The boss designs are fun, you can dodge attacks by jumping and ducking. Hedge trimmer is my favourite- The dandelion cameras forces you to watch your surroundings, good game design because you have limited resources (alarm triggers endless waves of bots) and exploring makes you tread carefully and not hold W all gameGive it a 7.5/10 someone mod segs plz"

I'm a little disappointed they didn't go as hard on the surreal aspects they showed off in the trailer, as before launch I thought this was going to be some sort of ""Russian SCP experiment gone wrong"" sort of plotline.

5139,Cowboy Ruckus,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069643856/,No,,1,23.1,February,27,374,0,1,Edit: Beat the gameif you like solo games with bioshock components with a dying light melee system with some crafting and puzzles. then this is the game for you! The gameplay is good but i learned later on that the loot drops are random when it comes to getting crafting for weapons and ammo (this includes upgrades to the guns as well). I didnt really care to look for the upgrades on the weapons because i had been getting good damage with the guns i was using and didnt see the need for the upgrades.The story is okay but the game as a whole was fine. I felt like i was playing outlast with a mix of Bioshock at times but when you go to the labs in the game it felt like the shining in a way.Cons: The upgrades for charles were confusing at best and i didnt realize that finding upgrades was easy. i just didnt care to find them. when you get spotted by the flower camera things it gets annoying quick since enemies will come after you in a heartbeat. I didnt like the ending of the game either since it felt like they focused more on combat and hyping up the game with Mick Gordon as the sound track guy. I didnt hear much of the Mick Gordon soundtrack songs till like near end of the game and when boss battles happened here and there. I still give this game a 8.5/10 for the gameplay alone even though the story was a bit of a miss for me.im glad the game runs well for a launch game compared to other games i have played at launch! take notes game devs!

World building and story is very interesting and imo an excellent start for whats to come if they were to release a second game or new story. The mc voice acting isn't bad but just the dialogue with the main character just feels off putting. I feel like the writers need to find a certain balance in an angry character to where he doesn't turn obnoxious. The optimization of the game it's of course phenomenal and has been said over again with fps reaching it's limits on numerous occasion. It sometimes dip below 60 fps when there are a sizable amount of enemies engages the player in the open world but that can be fixed with display setting changesOverall, it's a solid 8.5/10, must own for those who are a fan of alt history or a futurist 50's soviet aesthetic."

It's not for everyone, that's for sure, the game does have its issues, things like no FOV slider, or that P-3 is written like a highschooler with a stupid sense of humor (Which personally I love LOL) but it's just, not for everyone.Atomic heart is also Mundfish's first game, which makes me excited for the future.please pick up the game if it looks interesting, it's an experience for sure."

It stumbles in absolutely unbearable and also endless dialogue between the two main characters, who don't seem to actually fit into the world of post-Great Patriotic War USSR and instead talk like Zoomer Twitch addicts on adderall. The writing overall isn't unbearable, but there's way too much talking that's way too self-indulgent. It doesn't really hold a candle to Ken Levine or Chris Avellone re: story.

5196,Kyodai,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198814729837/,No,,0,4.4,February,27,122,0,1,Almost all enemies just take too many hits when it comes to melee. Alot of the game mechanics it doesnt tell you anything about and expects you to know how to do them and some other mechanics they tell you about with the simplicity of a toddler. It trys to make everything seem like a spectacle but all it ends up doing is making sequences last too long for no reason. There is no reason to have most if not all of the lock mini games and just feel like the game is just padding for time. Having robots just get rebuilt seconds after being killed when the robots take MINUTES to kill individually just makes it feel useless to kill them. Over all it looks pretty but that doesn't make up for the sub par voice acting and the mechanics that just feel repetitive at best and mind numbing at worse.TLDR; Just skip out on it not worth it everythings a bullet/hit sponge
5197,Ariurn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fearofvoodo/,No,,1,22.1,February,27,200,0,1,"Pluses:- Combat system. Very dynamic and complex enough.- Enemies. Variability, amount, abilities.- Weapons. Some of them are quite original.- Characters. Acting, dialogues, animations, voice.- Story. Characters, their motivation, plot twist, player manipulation.- Locations. Development, details, atmosphere.- Lore. Details, development, disclosure through the environment.- Optimization. Say hi to ""Callisto Protocol"", ""Cyberpunk"", etc.- Ending. Complicated and hard to understand on your own. But quite good.Minuses:- Open world. No motivation of exploring it. Need side quests, NPCs, etc.- Story could be more complex. A number of points could have been revealed better. But who knows, maybe it's a deliberate understatement with a plan for the sequel.Since this is the first AAA-level game for this company, I think they did a brilliant job. 9 f*cking pies out of 10."
5198,PowerThruWisdom,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065420572/,1,,1,33.1,February,27,226,0,1,"So I do recommend this game. ( please note the following is simply my opinion and not an official stance of anyone else but myself.)But not for the story, the ending is..........meh. Tried too hard IMO. there is such a thing as too many twists. Also, I feel like the ending just didn't cross the finish line the way it probably should have. Also, all the plot twists had a ton of holes imo soo... I give the story a 6 outta 10.The reason I primarily recommend this game is for the gameplay itself. The combat is refreshing and fun. the Enemies are intense and well-integrated. there is a good balance between downtime and combat time. I give combat in the game an 8 outta 10.The polygon puzzles are sometimes fun, and sometimes obnoxiously hard for no real reason, or they are just giant red herrings you can navigate around. For puzzles, I give a 7 outta 10.One downside to weapons development is that you can beat the entire game with conventional firearms and their upgrades. non of the poly upgrades are really effective or necessary but they are fun to experiment with. Also didn't need any of the fancy futuristic weapons too. All I needed was a shotgun, AK, pistol, and machete, with their perspective complete conventional upgrades and a TON of ammo. For weapons, I give an 8 outta 10.Character growth (i.e growing the abilities of the character) fell flat after I maxed out the main character's poly upgrades. all the other poly upgrades are really only needed for puzzle solving in Polygons. For character dev, I give 6 outta 10 mostly because all the cool stuff you can do is not needed at all for the primary game path. Also, the final boss fight? let's just say there is an interesting hole in its ultimate. Boss and underboss fights are OK. You need to keep a machete for literally ONE type of underboss that I could see after 30+ hours of gameplay as it's almost completely impervious to gunfire but hates melee weapons. there are I think a total of 8 of these types throughout the game, and they are very tedious fights. for boss and underboss fights I give it a 7 outta 10 mostly cause a lot of the bosses are actually pretty cool to fight and see.Over all aesthetic of the game is seriously cool. Love the crazy mutants, the nut job robots that have a ton of cool influences from people like davinci, and of course, the I-robot killer machines running around trying to snap your neck lol. The constant crazy music is awesome. the Balance between open-world play and closed-environment play is really well balanced IMO. The graphics are amazing, the game is well optimized as well.I run a basic NVIDIA 3080 with 16 gigs ram and an i7 on an MSI GP 66 leopard.  I give the aesthetics a 9 outta 10.Overall, I think the game is a very well-done game and has a lot of cool potential for a sequel, or at least Beefy DLC. I think a prequel or sequel filling in a lot of the plot holes would be pretty neat to see. If my math serves me correctly, I believe all my scores average out to 7.28 outta 10. I would agree with that. It is a solid 7.2 outta 10 after playing it for 30 hours with the biggest hits coming from the story and character-building/development. Definitely do recommend the game and I believe it is worth buying at full price. P.S. While I definitely welcome comments and discussion, please respect the community and comment only if you wish you generate a cordial dialogue on the game or wish to add to the review and suggest a different score in an area. Keep it civil and GAME ON Y'ALL!!"

5208,Hymen Humide,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RoyalTrout/,No,,0,7.3,February,27,204,0,1,"The only original thing this game has to give you is its artistic direction. That's it, and that is definitely not enough. Everything else is a tasteless soup of what AAA gamemaking has been producing with other titles for the past decade. It is bland, timid in every aspect, its writing is cringe as ♥♥♥♥, its systems are copies of other titles (progression, movements, combat, even level design feels unoriginal). Its forcing everything, from lame humour to lame horror attempts through lame action cinematics. Everything is lame as ♥♥♥♥.I won't get into the details, I've tried to make a detailed review a few days ago and ended up writing for 3 hours straight about all the pathetic ♥♥♥♥ I've had to go through in 7 poor hours of gameplay. And even after venting for that long, I was still fuming. Hell, I AM still fuming. I gave that disgusting excuse of a game more time than it deserves. And I am still angry knowing that there no way I'm getting back those hours I spent playing it.I got it for free. Someone gave me a key for that game, and I was just so happy because I was hooked at its teaser and trailers. I wasn't hyped, I was curious, hoping for something reminescent of bioshocks, or at least something that tries to be an immersive sim. Well, had I payed for it, I wouldn't even have bothered to write this. I'd have asked a refund after 1h30 of playtime, and I'd have tried to forget about it completely. But since I could play this cringe game for free, I tried harder... And now I've lost a day of productivity for that pathetic ♥♥♥♥.This is what the idiots who did that game believe we deserve. Trust me, you deserve better,  better than that ♥♥♥♥. Direct quotes from the devs' website:""[...] With the release of the first game [...], the dynamic team of 30-somethings created an original, unique gaming experience that disrupts the industry with their creativity.""and a bit further below:""The originality of ideas is the basis of our philosophy: dedicated to originality and remaining unique, we create a whole new world. This is in our DNA""This might be the fattest amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have ever read. This game disrupts absolutely NOTHING in gamemaking in the mainstream video game industry. It does exactly the opposite. So much, in fact, that they couldn't finish that game without abusive management, abusive use of internship, failed promises, crunch... English is not my native tongue, so maybe I'm misunderstanding what ""disrupting"" exactly means. When they say they want to ""disrupt the industry"", maybe they mean they want to ""do the exact same things that the industry has been doing for the past ten years or so"". It would make more sense.I believe we should separate the artist from his work. I apply that to video games also, of course. However, in this case, I find it very relevant to try to understand who made that game, how it was made and by whom. My understanding of it all is that 4 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ found a way to make a insane amount of money, and decided to lie here and there to investors up to the point of delivering a game that would be, at best, just mediocre. Why should they give a ♥♥♥♥ about the actual quality of their product ? Everything will be fine as long as the engine eternal of the hype train keeps on going.source:Honestly sorry for anybody who played more than what I played and liked it. Enjoying mediocrity that much can't be anything else but pathological."

5216,Galloglaigh,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gallo7/,No,,1,26.7,February,27,379,0,1,"Atomic Heart is a solid entry in the 'spiritual successor to System Shock' genre. If you enjoyed Prey (2017) or the Resident Evil games you will find something to like here. The presentation is perfect, with beautiful visuals and an fantastic soundtrack that stays fresh for the whole experience. Performance was also perfect, not in a decade have I played a newly released game without stuttering or fps drops.Gameplay was solid. Atomic Heart treads the line between the resource management of Resident Evil, the fun shooting and power mechanics of BioShock and Half-life, and surprisingly interesting puzzles and platforming in the vein of Portal; however, the game fails to reach quite the same highs in those categories, and a lack of enemy variety becomes apparent by the mid-game. Special mention to the boss-fights which were very enjoyable, which is usually not the case in this genre.Plot and Characters were refreshingly good. Despite a shaky first few hours the game is well paced and the story unfolds in a satisfying way that keeps you guessing till the credits. I think the less you know going into the experience, the better; let the plot speak for itself. I will say that the Soviet setting was very unique, it's a place and perspective not often explored in video games.8/10"

This game is held up by three crucial pillars which together support an overall excellent gaming experience. These pillars are: 1. dynamic, adaptive, and challenging combat system. 2. a compelling narrative with rich lore that can be investigated further via exploration. 3. spectacular world building with incredible attention to detail spent on important artistic elements such as architecture, color, the adept use of space, sound and visual motifs.

The game's world is eerie and fascinating, with a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic that sets it apart from other games.Of course, Atomic Heart is also a first-person shooter, and in this regard, the game excels. The gameplay is smooth and satisfying, with various weapons and abilities at the player's disposal. The game's enemies, ranging from robots to strange creatures found deep within the laboratories, are both terrifying and fascinating, and fighting them never gets old.The only flaw I found is that the story has a significant build-up for a fantastic world-shaking epilogue that we are barely given a glimpse of in the shape of a handful of slides and a few lines of narration.Overall, Atomic Heart was creative, colorful, and entertaining. The world has plenty of potential that would be great to see in future projects."

Big Cutting edge facility has a major catastrophe where the environment becomes ridiculously hazardous, most people die and the protagonist has to make his way through hordes of enemies while getting nuggets of story here and there.The soundtrack though... Never stopped boppin, through the entire game. Be it amazing original scores, remixes of some old timey russian music or some hard rock, the soundtrack never ceased to amaze me. The game really shines in the many facilities scattered through the complex. Puzzles, hordes of enemies, incredible weapons and upgrades, amazing world design and an intriguing story made this game really enjoyable for me. Now the open world sections... They coud be better in my opinion.The infinitely repairing of recently killed robotic enemies ends up being pretty frustrating IF you're not loking to gather resources to upgrade your weapons or just enjoy the combat. All in all, an exquisite experience for me. Of course, i had to use flawless widescreen, the standard FOV was making me kind of nauseous, but i hear that's gonna be fixed soon.

Low amount of ammo, melee combat being the go-to alternative. Stealth play. (granted this is only an issue from early to mid game, depending on how often you scavenge and explore)The story is short but fun. There are twist and turns, that also shares some tones to bioshock imo.The music is also very fun, and the enemies in the world are cool, some being creepy.Overall going back on my previous comment about it being inspired from bioshock, it feels like its a mix of the aesthetic of bioshock one, with the combat/visual of bioshock infinite. There are intense creepy dark areas, and brightly lit areas that is chuck full of combat rather than stealth play. P-3 sounds reminds me of Tank Dempsey but from Soviet Russia (the voice sounds similar, but aren't the same VA). Cons:Story is short, there are some collisions in the game that will permanently get you stuck unless u reload a previous save (i recommend download the mod on nexus that allows you to free fly and teleport to get out of such situation). The alarm system is rather annoying since there are cameras every where in the over world, so exploring can feel tedious.Certain weapons make bosses trivial due to how strong they are. Won't spoil it and let yall discover them on your own. TLDR: 8/10"

This game is just a lot of fun.  Probably the most fun I've had with a FPS since HL2.  I am a little disappointed that the devs caved to woke crybabies and removed a ONE SECOND scene in a 1950's cartoon that offended a handful of people.Some reviewers have complained that the protagonist is annoying, constantly talking.  I think that he is hilarious most of the time, as well as some of the other dialogues from other characters.  The game looks amazing, runs very smoothly, and the puzzles are doable for the most part.  I only found myself having to resort to an internet search on one so far.

Getting stuck on random things and having to redo 20 minutes worth of game play multiple time in the pseudo open world due to no auto saving?2.) Auto save mechanic only comes into play during a main story mission from what i can tell. Which makes the open world and subsequent deaths and restarts that much more annoying.3.)Not a traditional open world game but has open world sections that, so far in my play through, once you exit you can't go back to.Which in turn forces you to do all side activities before proceeding.4.) Best way to describe the open world/collectibles is in Ubisoft style. Large quantity of collectibles/scavenging crates/activities? that may or may not being interesting spread across an enormous empty area.5.) Voice acting is inconsistent and the tone or just how its said doesnt match what's going on. In the same way that the main character from ""Days Gone"" will say ♥♥♥♥ weird, same here. Maybe not as much as days gone, that games voice acting was mid.6.)I'm straight up getting bored. I want to max my abilites and craft things but all the side activites and looting in this game is extremely monotonous.7.)Mostly throw one type of enemy at you for the majority of the game. Standard worker robot and tiny flying robots."

Yes! I'm surprised that all on max I can lock at 120fps at 2K resolution and low GPU usage. For comparisson, Hogwarts Legacy dipped into 70 area out of the blue quiet often on 3080Ti and it looks much worse than this. It doesn't have FOV slider so you'll need 'Flawless Widescreen'.It has great setting and intro with fun combat and upgrades system. Dialogues are a bit corny (think Wolfenstein New Colossus) but it fits the soviet utopia gone wrong setting. What holds it back is that in 2.5h I had to reload a save already due to being stuck and that's this game's biggest flaw so far. Don't jump around wall debris etc. as it lacks some polish there. Also melee combat is so-so, very satisfying on generic mobs and boring with those that have more HP.We will see how it unfolds but so far so good and again, kudos for optimization in this day and age.

It's genuinely fun to run around and smack robots or fire a rocket in to a group of sprouts. It has some predictability with the story but I enjoyed the ending and the combat more than makes up for it.
5257,Asterrah,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Asterrah/,No,,1,24.8,February,27,"1,143",0,1,Story is good but don't expect anything serious (treat it like soviet borderlands).English voice acting is fine starts out rough but it grows on you (Just wait until you meet NORA). Combat is enjoyable.Respec is free so you can experiment with the customization options (both guns and skills).Overall great game 9/10. Definitely hope they make a sequel.
5258,CowboyWolfie,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198418704480/,No,,1,25.8,February,27,75,0,1,"Very good game with lots of minor bugs and a very UN-cohesive control layout (i tried both keyboard and controller both have issues) but would highly recommend The world it builds is extremely cool a a soviet sci-fi fantasy that make you want to dive deeper into the concept, that being said i hope you love to spend hours of game play reading every single terminal essay that can range from a single sentence to 5 paragraphs. the audio watch things are cool and give you lore you don't have to read but the quantity of them is very low (my achievement show i found less than half even after exploring everything and scanning as much as possible). when not fighting or reading you can find yourself in very long and frequent cut scenes isn't exactly the worst thing but can be annoying. the fighting feels very fun but can get a little repetitive in some aspects especially while trying to travel through the world, you are going to be constantly bombarded with attacks and even after killing them they just get reassembled. weapons are fun but had a lot of glitches with them such as when making a new weapon an older weapon would become completely unusable unless broken down and rebuilt. the abilities are very fun to play with and super cool you can recycle the points to unlock them with no penalty! the puzzles can be extremely basic and almost insulting at how boring they can be at times but some are very fun to complete and make it through. this game isn't exactly an open world it consists of story related destinations and dungeons to loot and upgrade your weapons but nothing really else. it gives a great big map to explore but half of it is fenced off or serves no purpose for loot or world building information (hopefully its open ended for the dlc to come). the ""open world"" also is very buggy and i would frequently get stuck in walls, rocks, or vehicles from miss-clicking the shift key and dashing into them. all that being said the game was very fun, had a cool story, and crispy critters is fun to say would recommend everyone to try it out."
5259,KaiTo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Koytolebo/,No,,1,26.4,February,27,392,0,1,"This game is really fun and the general idea behind it is beautiful. Hot robot mommies aside, the story, the gameplay and THE OST is amazing. There's still a lot of problems that may annoy some people, like the achivement system, the dialogues or something simple as the looting system, but let's keep in mind that it's there first game and that there is still a lot of updates to come which will fix most of the current problems. The only major complaint I could say is that sometimes I feel that the story isn't clear about the fact that you will learn some important details throughout the main quests, but also some important points will be explained when you interact with Charles. For example, the protagonist and the glove will have A LOT of talking about things they see that will sometimes look unimportant or unrelated to the plot. So when a actual important conversation occur, for my case it was hard to take it seriously or try to make connection with WHAT is the primary thing we should think about. I get the feeling they wanted to add a sens of bonding between the glove and Sergey, which is a great idea. But too much will make the player feel like not enough clear explanation. Still this is a problem that may not bother everyone and in that case that's a good thing. This problem didn't ruined the ending, but instead left me with a feel of incomplete ending. Some things feel unexplained which is maybe also the idea of the devs. I love metaphorical ending which leaves the player to decide the outcome but I feel you need to understand everything to truly interpret the conclusion.In any case, thank you Team Mundfish for this refreshing experience and fun gameplay."

Bite me)- I'm not from Russia, so the music sucks to my ears- Outdoor scenes are confusing to look at, as well as the sounds being heard - there's no logical association with anything- It's fairly linear - very little to be explored and nothing open world about itI only bought the ""basic"" version of the game because I can't see paying extra for what are basically cosmetic features.  I feel like I've played this game before.  Other, previous games all do what this games does and did it far better.

Feels like System Shock with some new ideas like vaccum cleaner for looting. Has some RPG mechanics like crafting but doesn't try to waste your time with it - everything is dissolvable into base components and gives no penalty for re-crafting. Same goes for audio-logs, you can listen to them while walking around. Basically all mechanics are well matured to get out of the gameplay, which is a very accurate melee and long range mix. This is a power fantasy core game for the 13 year old boy in us like they used to make in the 90s, complete with powerful graphics and crass jokes.  Setting is sovyet industrial. POLITICAL STATEMENT: This game has massive content and hits on ALL sides in it, even on the devs themselves, like good art is supposed to. If you are offended, you would be just one of those people who cherry pick a fictional work like a novel completely out of context and punish/censor the authors for it, only increasing the divide on the planet, making sure such self-ironic and discussion-worthy art pieces stop being produced, and propelling us back into the middle ages."

As you try to unravel the mysteries you are faced with the questions of why did these civilian robots, who were created by your scientist, have military weapons and combat mode. As you get deeper into the story even as the player you will get paranoid on who to trust and who not to trust and who to kill and who not to kill, the story will bait you into thinking you know who the bad guys are but you dont, I thought I did for the entire game but the game made me doubt myself then solidfy my claim then it turns out I was incorrect and it shocked me. , there are 2 endings and both endings are anti climactic, one ending skips entire 15-20 minutes of dialogue and 2 boss fights and the other ending goes through these boss fights and dialogue but it is a worse ending as in the more evil ending, but both endings are ""bad"" endings and there is not a good ending. The story does sadly finish extremely quickly and it being possible to finish in 10-15 hours, so dont expect a good ending but it is a surprising ending and dont expect a long game. When playing the game I realised that no matter how human a robot can look or feel, it can never be human there is always a sense of void inside of the robots which this game made me realise.Now I played the game on Russian dub and English subtitles. The subtitles were really small with no way on increasing their size. Sometimes the dialogue does get a bit long sometimes but with the Russian voice acting I dont mind since the voice actors really put their soul and effort into it and sometimes you can ""hear"" their emotions and with the dialogue there is sometimes good jokes and it sometimes appear at times were it feels rather empty. I did not play on the English dub but from a few clips I have seen the English dub sounds extremely bad the voice actors did not stick on me so I would recommend playing the Russian dub. The lip syncing however is off and it looks stupid that its laughable sometimesNow I have seen people complain how enemies are ""bullet sponges"" and what not but that is not the case, the enemies can get killed quick with the right weapons and upgrades since there are different types of enemies of which have their own elemental weakness. At first enemies felt tough and very hard to deal with but over time I quickly got used to their patterns and late game I would even just stand still and kill them. Melee enemies would have a critical attack where an orange indicator would appear telling you to dodge otherwise you will take a lot of damage and get knocked down. Something that is frustrating is when fighting in tight spaces and there are a lot of enemies you can easily become stuck in a corner constantly getting knock backed and unable to do anything. I played the game on medium difficulty and tried it on hard and there is a huge difference and if you enjoy a challenger I recommend the hardest difficulty. There are also abilities and you can equip 2 abilities at a time, each ability has its own upgrade path and even your own character has his own upgrade path to further enhance not just your abilities but survivability. Now the boss fights are super fun and can be difficult at times and some bosses having stage 2 where they add to their combat moves when they are at ~50% hp, the game depens on you dodging at the right moment and attacking when the boss is weakened or during recovery animation so you cant always attack unless you have a ton of bullets to spend, which I dont think you will have enough bullets to take down a boss.The game is loot heavy and its very satisfying to loot and when you loot you dont need to spam the loot button your character just puts his arm out and he sucks all the loot in opening any cabinet or door that is blocking the loot. You also get loot from killing enemies and different enemies give different types of crafting materials. To craft weapons you need to discover their blueprints and you need to go to ""dungeons"" to find these blueprints (more on that later), bullets and medkits also have blueprints as well as the weapons upgrades as well but you will usually find the blueprints in bulk, example is an upgrade for the shotgun and pistol and AK are together in the same dungeon. Upgrading weapons has 2 aspects, adding/changing attachments and upgrading said attachments. Each attachment is unique from the other and have a unique upgrade path from level 1 to 5 as in for example level 1 adds extra damage, 2 adds reduced recoil, 3 increases fire rate etc. I never fully upgraded a weapon since I finished the story around the 20 hours mark.The game is technically openworld but to get to looting grounds there are areas on the map where you need to go inside a ""dungeon"" where you will be faced with puzzles and boss fights. The puzzles are really nice and a nice break from the basic lockpicking rotate your mice type (it still exists in the game but rare), the game also includes a bit of platforming. When in the open world cameras will detect you and trigger warnings to nearby enemies to attack you and if you fend off these attacks the system will send a signal to a nearby factory to reinforce and bring more enemies, essentially another way of farming loot if you need but can get tedious as some enemies can be really annoying if faced in a large group where you cant get to them. The world is not that big as it mainly plays around the dungeons and looting inside there. However, you will not see a single human when youre out exploring but your character does interact with humans through comms a lot or through his robot glove buddy so thats nice. There is also the fact that you cant stop the cameras from sending reinforcement to you and it can be a hassle when you are trying to navigate through a certain place so expect enemies to constantly flood but they are also buggy.The art of the game is very nice and it reminds me of bioshock and games similar to that except its communist themed, when playing on the Russian dub I can set it so it will show a text box of what im looking at when im looking at those ww2 era propoganda posters and stuff like that so I can feel immersed as well. The soundtrack is legendary and one of the best things about the game the songs used is extremely similar to doom and some songs are remixed of old soviet era russian songs and other regular radio songs when youre driving a car. The enemies have unique sound cues that can signal when an enemy is about to do a critical attack and you can dodge them while they are out of vision. Enemies sound sick and it makes me feel like im playing doom sometimes with the metal music and robots transforming and charging up and hearing the sounds of metal clashing and clanging so this is one of the best things about the game, the best thing is upcoming.I can not emphasise this enough, this game is one of the best optimised games that recently came out, apart from a few annoying bugs you can encounter here and there, I have not encountered a single game breaking bug. I managed to run this game on 90fps (I capped it) on ultra settings on a 2080 razer laptop (bought it in 2019) that can barely run a game like for honor. Only once have i seen my fps dip below 60 and it hovered around 55, the fps averages around 80 and it got to 60. That could be because of DLSS since my friend has an older gen AMG gpu and he experienced fps drops."
5329,TheDeadlyNeck,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuzzyfire/,No,,1,18.1,February,26,100,0,1,I only have 2 problems with this game. 1. The voice acting for the main character is...bad. It makes me want to punch an infant.2. You can't invert the Y axis if your using a controller. (yeah i'm one of those insane freaks who likes airplane controls.)
5330,PoeticParadox,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071080856/,No,,1,9.5,February,26,220,0,1,"While this isn't quite the spiritual successor to Bioshock I was hoping for, this game is still quite amazing... with a few frustrating elements. So far, I have found the story well written and most of the characters interesting. There are certainly some memorable people/bots to meet. The sound design and graphics are fantastic; the environments are vibrant, enemies intense. The voice acting may not be the best ever, but it is quite good. The game seems polished from release, I've had no graphical or gameplay issues, bar one (getting stuck).Combat can get frustrating for a few reasons. Melee combat with any of the enemies I've encountered so far has devolved into rapidly circle-strafing while wildly swinging my weapon and trying to dodge critical attacks, which is a little difficult if you don't have very good reflexes. The enemies do a lot of damage too; I heal pretty much after every hit or two, which isn't as big a problem as it could be, because healing items drop like rain most of the time. Ranged weapons don't seem very well-balanced. They make a lot of the fights I've been in rather trivial. It feels like ammo/energy scarcity may have been meant to balance this, but ammo is too plentiful and while energy takes a while to regenerate, it eventually does.These issues on their own wouldn't be too bad, but the fact that large areas of the game have constantly (and rather quickly) re-spawning enemies magnifies how frustrating they are.Now, I do know there is a lot I haven't unlocked yet which may make combat more interesting and less annoying later on.The ""platforming"" is frustrating. Your Russian super soldier jumps like a 300+lb out-of-shape white dude (I say this as just such a white dude). There have been several places where I swear on my life I could make some jump but the game just refuses to allow me to grab a ledge.Worst is that getting stuck in the environment is a common occurrence right now (hopefully, they'll patch this somehow and I'll update this); making you reload to get unstuck, which usually only means losing a minute or three of progress, but it's still very annoying because of how often it can happen.All in all, I am enjoying Atomic Heart. It's got the vibes to almost feel like Bioshock Infinite, only faster-paced with a less intense atmosphere. If you enjoy FPS games with interesting weapons and approaches to combat, appreciate humor in the midst of a disaster, enjoy unique characters and storytelling, and don't mind putting up with some relatively minor frustrations, you will enjoy Atomic Heart!"

However, I must say that it was actually a good game with some flaws. Some of those flaws are subtitles are sometimes small and sometimes do not appear at all. The English Dub is bit.. awkward but the Russian dub was pretty good actually. The endings were bit underwhelming but that's probably just Bioshock thing. Another flaw of the game that makes me give it 8/10 and not 10/10 is the open world aspect. It is not mandatory and you can pretty much go past it but.. since they already put the effort in I would have loved if the open world was more open world. Like you could actually go inside the apartments, find some flashbacks like from Metro 2034 or even some NPCs (like those dead ones). What I'm saying is that you had an open world and when I went to explore it, there was nothing there just endless spawning hordes. Which is a bit of a shame. As for gameplay it was actually a blast! I enjoyed it.As for visuals it was simply put soviet porn.As for soundtrack, Michael ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Gordon made the soundtrack, the same dude who made Doom soundtrack. It was amazing!!And lastly, the game is really well optimised and has been since day 1 which is a huge achievement."

The mix between loot, weapons, abilities and puzzles makes it a bit repetative but also chalanging.The main atraction is the open world part, even if it lacks any real space. The references paired with remixes of musicaly clasics of the east block are nostalgic treats. For me this is a ruff GOTY."

The main problem for me was the respawning of enemies in the open world. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ repair robots can bring back an enemy that has just been killed after a few seconds. This killed my desire to explore the open world, I was literally rushing from polygon to polygon to the main quest marker.In terms of gameplay, the game isn't perfect, but it's decent enough.The sound design and voice acting could have been better, but it's passable.Sountracks - sometimes I sang along, so God-tier for meOverall, it's a good game that I recommend buying if you can, or just downloading if you're having trouble with the regional restrictions of steam and aren't desperate enough to get a vk-play account.

However....the voice acting was not the best, no one even dares to attempt a Russian accent which is pretty disappointing. There should have been much more dialog with more options that actually matter and the silly timer you get on some speech checks is silly since they are only present when the game feels like it. The world these guys dreamed up is one of the greatest gaming achievements of the decade. The game still needs a little polish but shes definitely a keeper. I would greatly appreciate a squeal.

Despite waiting for this game for years, and it not looking anything like it's 2018 reveal I knew things would change and a lot would probably be cut so it being how it is isn't a turnoff for me. However, as I sat there watching the credits roll I couldn't help but think ""that was it?"" It could have been more fleshed out. The dialogue isn't the best and can get annoying sometimes, it's a little jank but not enough to make it unplayable. Overall Atomic Heart feels like a game so desperately trying to be an immersive sim, even making references to Bioshock and Deus Ex among other famous ones, but it fails at being one itself. It's like Bioshock in that there is artistic inspiration, it's like Fallout in that it's open world, that is where the most made comparisons end. By itself not comparing it to other games it is a good and enjoyable experience and I am glad I played it. Normally with these games I will do 2 playthroughs one on normal and one on hard but I just do not feel like doing so, after one it stops being engaging for me. I will be uninstalling and waiting for the DLC to arrive, and will pick it back up when it does. until then I recommend getting it at full price if you really want it, and you absolutely should if it goes on sale.7/10"

Feels like a good mix between Fallout 3, Prey, Bioshock and bits of Dead Space around the edges. People harp on the voice acting but I mean... it's a Russian game, it's not the worst thing in the world. There's definitely more chirpy MC's i've played as before and given the 'situation' within the game with the Robots and all- it's really not that out of place. Hogwarts Legacy was going to be my GOTY for 2023 but this definitely took the cake, sadly I feel like the game is getting the Cyberpunk 2077 treatment very unfairly. If you have remote interest in FO3, Bioshock or Prey I highly suggest this one."

5425,Sensored,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jacinez/,No,,1,40.2,February,26,463,0,1,"Pretty good. Not on the same level as the recent hogwarts release but still worth playing. Combat gets interesting once you get some options and encounter different mob types/bosses. The attachment element and polymer abilities allow for mid-late game aoe containment. Early game fights will be a bit more of a struggle with any more then 3 enemies though mainly because there's no effective way to cc groups or outrun your opponents until later. Which basically translates into stealth being preferred earlier on until your abilities and guns are fleshed out later.As far as plot goes, its alright. We've seen this kind of plot before. I will say one thing, the English VA's are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful. It makes situations that should clearly have tension in them, comical. Switched from english to russian 1/2 way through and its definitely better but I know have to read turns people off nowadays, god forbid we have to use our brains.For achieve hunters out there, quite a few are bugged at the moment and may require cheesing, isn't that big a deal.All in all, a pretty good mix of fallout and bioshock, albeit with a mediocre story and god awful english VA's."

The weakest elements of this game are the open world and the main characters air headedness and crappy dialogue, you essentially play a mindless coolguy drone who was too cool for school and cant comprehend more then 4 syllables and his catch phrase ""crispy critters"" is pretty cringe.

Been following this game since its inception in 2017, that being said I really didn't know what to expect other than ""Bioshock in Russia"".This game is very well made, the art style, the textures and assets are a feast for the eyes. The games combat is tight and coordinated, reminiscent of Fallouts style, but Atomic heart focuses more on stealth and well time dodging tactics. The only complaint I have is I'm quite disappointed this game didn't release with its full suite of ray tracing. This game has been hyping up its RT shadows, ambient occlusion, reflections, and GI since 2018 and I was more than eager to check out all the ray tracing. Until proper RT is added into this game I will survive as this title does offer quite generous amounts of screen space reflections that are very convincing, although I wish they were horizontal instead of vertical."

Definitely could use a little bit more weapons and stuff but I think the combat is sound. It's spooky scary at times when a mustachio'd robutt greets you with a swift slap in the titty.

The sound track is excellent. I know people don't care for the dialogue, but I think it is funny and well done considering how different English and Russian are. There is a lot that could be said about a silent protagonist though and maybe there should be an option for that. Also, there needs to be a FOV slider.

Although maybe the atmosphere creates not 50s feeling but later.. maybe 70s-80s, because the vehicles and stuff was from that period(music was explained). No biggie tho. But listening to Alla Pugacheva while running around in a village was so great.Didn't also encounter any bugs, all ran smooth and without any problems. I would've wanted saving system with different save slots tho, also FOV slider would've been nice especially when being using ultrawide screen.

Seeing as how this game was made in UE4, I was very impressed at how well it ran on day one.Overall, the game is an incredibly enjoyable experience. It would not be inaccurate to say that Atomic Heart is the bastard child of Bioshock and Fallout, which has strong opinions on Leninism. Graphically the game looks great, the combat is fun and the open-world aspect that bleeds into the midgame is pretty neat. Complaints that the game is a run-n-gun are largely inaccurate and is comparable to Bioshock in its level and combat fluidity. With that being said, the only thing that does take me out of the game slightly is the dialogue. As far as I can tell, this is a pretty common complaint. I don't necessarily care about foul language at all, and frankly, I think it can add to a game's overall charm. However, it is *very* frequent in a way that kinda doesn't make sense. As I said, I don't generally care, (and I still don't really as it is a minor gripe) but after P-3 says f**k for the 6th time consecutively in one sentence, it can get a little old. We get it, you're angry, glory to the USSR, whatever just move on.  I think Atomic Heart is a great game, and I recommend it to anyone who has love in their heart for either Fallout or Bioshock, or the single-player FPS genre in general."

5540,Alkruhn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/alkruhn/,No,,1,20.3,February,26,904,0,1,"I enjoyed this game. I will start with my one gripe; being that there is no FOV slider. Not a dealbreaker by any means as base FOV is around 80. Gunplay is very good, without spoiling any of the included tools most of them feel great aside from one found quite later into the game that is mediocre at best. Things do feel weighty, which does add to the sort of effect the combat has. I love the melee fighting, it does satisfy me - especially the abilities included with each weapon.A great thing about these weapon systems is the amount of variation in terms of modifications that change the way a gun or other tool works. A decent bit of variety is included in the weapons and the way you build them, which also changes them all visually. I appreciate that point a lot. I should also add that the collection process for things like materials is relatively painless - and can be pretty satisfying, too.In terms of overall gameplay, I would consider this game more of a linear experience than not. I think fixating on something like a game being linear and deciding to play on that would be unwise, because this game also includes a modestly but fruitfully sized open world section that takes form of a vehicle for players to get their upgrades and stock up on resources - as well as kick some ass. Each section that plays a part in story progress will be more or less a linear collection of combat and actually satisfying puzzles.The story is more or less faint for a good portion of the game. It is there, it won't hound you, and it did provoke thought which I find important in a game. Things naturally ramp up as time goes on, of course - I would say it definitely helps back player action. Overall, I would say this experience was one I was glad to have. Not a needed one, perhaps, but one that I enjoyed all the way through and one that exposed me to different styles and systems that I really haven't participated in or experienced before."

The World of Atomic heart is very beautiful and the graphics are nice. It is cool to see the destructibility of robots as you use your weapons and powers on them. The Music sounds great as well. I wish the testing grounds were woven into the story instead of optional content. I missed most of them because I got too far into the story that I couldn't go back. It's open world but the story doesn't invite you to explore the world. It wants to keep you on rails going from mission to mission and before you know it you're at the end of the game. It would have been neat if the main character learned more about himself from the testing chambers instead of a big info dump towards the end. Maybe that would have allowed the P3 to grow and change from being an insufferable, idiotic, annoying and stubborn character.I do like the gameplay loop and the powers and weapons are fun. I wish they had more powers and bosses to fight. Instead of reusing the Plyusch way too much. The rocket launcher needs to be unlocked later in the game (makes it really easy to beat each boss with). The optics for each gun feel pointless to go out and get since aiming them isn't that hard and its more of an aesthetic thing.I hope the dlc or sequel can provide a better more linear experience."
5549,Chief Benny,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsMeChiefBenny/,1,,0,17.0,February,26,143,0,1,"**This is heavy opinionated, so read at your own discretion. Minor spoilers below.**TLDR: I waited years for this game to release, believing through the trailers that the artstyle, story, and gameplay were visionary, only to feel buyers remorse. To say the least: if you're expecting some breakthrough level game, on-par with Bioshock, Fallout or Prey, then this is sadly not it. I feel terrible writing this review, but after seeing an early sneak-peak trailer of Atomic Heart, 3-4 years ago, it ranked at the top of my ""most anticipated releases"" list, however after waiting the 3-4 years for the release, playing through the remarkably unmemorable and short campaign, I can note only that I'm experiencing buyers remorse. To pay this title the review it deserves, and to quote another reviewer whose name I can’t cite at the moment, in the examination of Mundfish's first release : ""they have all the right tools for a hit, but none of the correct execution"". I’ll break this down into some main thoughts. What’s good about this title? Visuals are stunning, the combat system feels uniquely crafted and powerful, reminiscent of Wolfenstein, Bioshock, and Bulletstorm (if anyone remembers that title) Etc., though marred by enemies that didn't receive a balancing system and who's placement, hierarchically, feels obtuse in the open world, in addition, weapon systems which feel, regardless of difficulty setting, without a home in the limited “open world flexibility” that the game presents the player.The “Proving Grounds”: thoughtfully designed, optional locations for additional puzzles and weapon upgrades, who’s placement feels lost amidst the overall “lack of reason to go”. This could be critiqued in many ways, but personally I forgot these were even a thing, until I completed the story, then restarted a save and went back to them because I wanted to see what I missed. Said numerous times: If this game took the Subnautica, Bioshock, Fallout, Etc. Etc. Etc. route, and had your character not talk, or STOP TALKING 99% of the time, the ambience the developers painstakingly developed wouldn’t be lost to the oversharing and major spoilers that CHARLES and P-3 chat about during suspenseful and explorative moments, e.g. “iS tHat a LuLlaBy”. Devs, please let the player work for their lunch.The campaign: I love visceral, hand-crafted single player campaigns. There’s not enough of them, and I can’t get enough of them. This game constructed a thoughtful, credible and delicious prose to introduce the player into the world, speaking exclusively for the tutorial island, and then dropped the ball. Nothing about the entire experience compared to how long I spent on tutorial island admiring the attention to detail and story driving the devs intended. This is another point that can be critiqued in many ways and from multiple viewpoints, but overall the character, story, and believability of Atomic Heart dropped off a cliff after the initial chapter. A real blue-balling experience, honestly.  I can go-and-go about this game’s details. Ultimately Mundfish proved itself as a capable studio, with a game that, whether lacking end-stage funding and functionality/detail, or had to get out of the oven due to the conflict in Ukraine complicating funding, didn’t reach its full potential, for instance: why does this game have so much detail, like a labor of love, each chapter is crafted so specifically, but also within the narrative and gameplay, there’s no detail at all. Like a kit of parts. I look forward to what Mundfish produces in the future, but am overall saddened by the lack of execution in what could have been GOTY, and a gem for future study in how Indie, or smaller developer studios are shaping the gaming industry. I could over complicate this review and leave it at a point where it’s so long, no one would like to read it, but overall this game receives a negative review for these primary reasons:I shouldn’t be able to thwart the AI/camera GTA threat level by walking in the bushes, off the paved roads, out of the intended sight-line of petel-cams.The story is unfulfilled and atrociously lacking detail/plot-holes/lack of emphasis, past the initial tutorial island.The AI is underdeveloped, oftentimes not entering buildings to attack the player if the original fight occurred outside the building.There was no emphasis on exploring the other 50% of the game. You could play Atomic Heart without ever exploring the “extra-regions”.This game is not really open-world.No FOV slider. Motion sickness, color blindness, deafness, Etc. are accessibility issues and in good design, you’re taking this into account, even if “yOur gaMe has HighEr FoV ThAN mOST ShoOters”. Oversharing and obnoxious dialogue between the protagonist(?) and their glove.Overall, buy this game on sale, see what Mundfish has to offer, look for whatever they produce next, but don’t judge this book by its cover. Thanks for reading."

TLDR: Interesting concept. Fun gameplay and action, Don't buy the game just for sexy robots. Great soundtrackThere are a lot of reviews that span between 'this concept is way to repetitive,' to, 'robot dommy mommies,' that really don't do this game justice. Sure, that is their perspective of the game and I do not want to otherwise discredit these reviews. However, I almost didn't buy this game because of these reviews and that would've been a shame because I am really enjoying the game thus far. If the only reason you are looking to buy this game is so you can experience the sexual content in this game, then I wouldn't recommend this game to you. Just look the scenes up on youtube or watch a stream of the game and avoid wasting your money. HOWEVER, if you like the idea of the game, the story and the theme, then I would recommend it to you. I've personally enjoyed drinking in the scenery of the ""open world,"" mindlessly picking apart enemies with my vast arsenal, and listening to the variety of music the game has to offer. The story leaves much to be desired in my opinion, but that hasn't stopped me from enjoying bashing robots heads in while   'Starry Summer' plays in the background. The game is unlike most rpg games in the fact that you can't really play the game start to finish in one sitting. I always worry about that when I buy a game like this but honestly, I feel like I am getting my moneys worth. One big letdown this game has in my opinion is the FOV. I don't usually get motion sick playing games, but if there were an option to adjust the camera to my liking, I would probably enjoy the game much more. The POV is zoomed in a little too much and takes away from the experience."
5559,Bobby Boucher,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shapopawitz/,No,,1,31.3,February,26,183,0,1,"I am loving this! It's like the developers took their favorite parts of the best games in the genre and mashed them together into a nice and shiny soviet package. As tongue in cheek as it gets.There is a bit of a learning curve to the combat strategy and puzzles, but it's extremely satisfying once in the groove.Dismantling weapons and refunding abilities get 100% of value back, something I tend to royally screw up in games like this, so it's been a lifesaver and a lot of fun to experiment with. (I think I could still ruin myself by crafting too many consumables.)The soundtrack is absolutely immersing. Even if the fight seems impossible, the song always gets me through."
5560,GiraffeOnATreadmill,https://steamcommunity.com/id/binoblackmamba/,No,,1,20.4,February,26,170,0,1,"This game is game. From experience small bugs that lead to confusion like story tracking gets confused if you explore a step to early but aside from that nothing game breaking the story will still continue all the same. Atomic Heart is really one of those games for me that I was only planning on playing for maybe an hour at a time and then I wound up playing for several hours at a time. For the really critical things the English Voice acting is a bit rough, but the story as a whole is really good. The music is really solid although if you play through certain points to fast or too slow the game can get confused with what you are doing at the moment. Mainly when you move to fast it will cut the characters off and make them stop the conversation entirely which the game will not repeat as far as I am aware. The same will happen to the music which will start and sometimes feel cut short. The game at its core is really fun and really encourages to try different methods and play styles in combat. I definitely plan on playing the game much more. TLDR Atomic heart is really fun."

I had my reservations, I was telling my self I'd play for at least 2 hours, and then refund it if I found no satisfaction what so ever. I decided to give it a chance, and boy did I not regret it, so I advise the same to you, Let atomic heart.. well, into your heart, pun intended.Play using the Russian Dialogue, and just give it some time to get running, in a metaphorical sense it's like making a friend with someone who's a bit off in the head, you gotta give him time to become confident, and to stop talking 24/7 and stop making one liners they've heard off the internet.Otherwise?

Technically stunning, I was impressed at how my old rig managed 80 FPS consistently even with all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that can be on screen. There can be a lot to be desired, but I also was very impressed by many parts of the game. You can tell that this team ran into issues in certain parts and that they crunched to get part of this out. This is most evident in the achievements, which at this time, are partially broken. They're not entirely broken, but I would say a good quarter of the achievements that do with collections do not save the previous state you achieved. Not a huge deal.I think the most interesting thing is what Atomic Heart is as a whole. The experience of playing the game is what you will be most impressed with. Even within the first 30 minutes I felt that the splendor paid for itself.Combat can be confusing, especially when they let you out into the ""open"" world. There is a robot ecosystem and it isn't clear at the beginning what they want you to do with it. If you're expecting a system like a Bioshock which has clear combos you won't find it here. Its clear that was intended but the reality never truly came through. Your glove has powers that let you perform 6 Polymer attacks, and they are for the most part underwhelming in all forms. Combined with the need to equip them and you can't experiment on the fly, which sucks. The guns are pretty easy to forget, and feel weak. This is fine for the most part, when you're fighting robots. They have metal plating. But even things like the rocket launcher feels like weak ♥♥♥♥. You also gain access to about 6 or 7 melee weapons. For the most part, they will fail to distinguish themselves until you spend a lot of time going through the Testing Grounds looking for their upgrade parts. Once I found the alternative charge attack for the Pashtet(please excuse my spelling here, I don't have a cyrillic keyboard on hand and also I'm tired) sends the blade out in front of you in a miniature blender, and I found it incredibly useful.The story is fine, though it feels at all times like the character you are playing as is the last person to know anything. I was fine with this actually. For the most part its fine. Some of the dialogue is annoying as you talk with Charles your glove and AI companion. Thankfully since most of the discussion revolves around how the mechanics of the world impact the story, I was generally engaged.Overall, I think this is a good first outing for the studio, and I look forward to their new work."

5586,Moo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/moo322/,No,,1,28.7,February,26,228,0,1,"So there is a lot to unpack here, but if you want the TL:DR then I would say the game is alright but not what I was expecting. Visually very good, game play is ok, and story is really sort of meh, but sometimes have some moments where I just laugh in both good and bad. So most likely just get the game on sale if you like action shooters or themes of alternate history and technology.Story (Spoiler Free)The plot jumps around a bit and for the most part just didn't make sense sometimes. Plus somethings just didn't felt like it built up to the climax of all of it. Though I would say that the lore bits, world building, and some big reveals were good, yet it was underneath all the muck. There were also characters that I didn't seem to care about, but also a Protagonist that just was an overall ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (realistically I would be too if I was stuck in this situation he is in). Though I do enjoy the company of Charles, sometimes the back and forth with the main character and him is the funniest parts of the game. But again it was a pretty underwhelming story.Game PlayThe game has mechanics and combat similar to most games that I have played. If anything it is a mix mash of say the combat, crafting, mechanics, and for the most part exploration from Bioshock or Prey, and the odd placements of the climbing system from Dying Light. The enemies were bullet sponges until I got better upgrades and abilities to handle them easily, and this helped with my experience with exploring and looting, especially when the semi open world has many security cameras, enemies, and the infinite amount of repair drone spawns. Boss fights were very bullet spongy too, but I discovered that one weapon can just do a biggest amount of damage and staggers them, making most of the fights very easy. Overall just ok, gameplay wiseI have expected the game to be more open world survival type of game due to the early reveals and teaser trailers, but it just ended up falling into an average action shooter category. Its not bad, but in all honesty it just felt like there could have been more and that there were parts of the game that felt unfinished. I will still recommend this game, but at a lower price or whenever its on sale."

This is the first game where I felt inclined to give it a review within the first hour of game play. The dialogue for this game is distressingly awful. Whoever wrote the script for the character you play is either highly unqualified or 14 years old. As much as I want to immerse myself into the world - which seems well done - the MC and his voice actor rip you out of the world just to make you cringe. Will update this review when I get further in the game to see if this remains true.

The game play is more than enough to recommend.The story however, I loved that too plenty of twists and turns and all that but I came to find the ending rather underwhelming all the build up to a grinding halt so-to-speak.

The main character is a little odd, but I have gotten used to his personality. I had had a couple cringe moments and a few moments where I laughed. Overall, in my opinion, the game is worth the full price that the devs are asking. I have no idea why some are saying to buy it on sale as this is actually a pretty enjoyable game.

If you were not born in 80-s USSR or earlier, then probably you will not get many of the references, but still the style is unique. Also the game does not try to be absolutely politically correct and cater to every twitter activist. To me it's a big plus already.You can feel weapon and character progression, it becomes easier to deal with the enemies, but the fights are not super exciting. I'd say the fights in the open world are more of a nuisance than fun and I tried to avoid them as much as possible. Location of save points is also a bit too scarce to my taste, but probably I'm just bad at the game :) Overall, it's a nice game and I'm curious to see what else it will show me."

I remember trailers back in 2012 of some guy in a white fuzzy suit walking around, now we're talking about a game that has my vote for one of the heavy hitters of 2023, even if we're two months in.Overall, it's fun. Incredible environments, interesting enemies, and a pretty interesting story. You're going to see a lot of people saying the story's not the best - and it's not on the level of something like Edith Finch, but it will most definitely keep you captivated. I thoroughly enjoyed it.If you've played Metro Exodus, you've probably experienced this - but there is a problem with the dialogue timing. Characters oftentimes speak over one another or there will be an awkward pause between voice lines - or no pause at all where the context of the situation doesn't call for it.People say they don't like MC's voice. I actually really like it, it did make me laugh...once. It can be a little overbearing at times but it's your stereotypical, ""I don't want to ♥♥♥♥♥♥' deal with this"" superhero badass. On that note, the voice acting in this game is VERY good. It's real quality, at some moments during some screams and more, it sounds genuinely real. You can tell the actors put their hearts into this game, it's quite amazing.Overall, I'd give the game a solid 7 or 8."

I'll admit though, the beginning had me falling off the hype train. But as soon as you get into the open world it gets so damn good. 9/10. Forgot I left a review already and had to come back and add one little thing. I would make my score for this game more like an 8.5-8.7/10 and that's only because of those God forsaken repair drones...they never stop and as far as I know so far there is no way to destroy or disable the Hive bot that deploys them. So for example there was a small area I was stuck in because of a difficult lock puzzle (making 5 or 6 colors line up) and in the time it took me to try and do it, all the bots I had just destroyed kept reanimating and attacking me while I was trying to do the lock puzzle, therefore kicking me out of the animation and resetting the lock. So please, make it so only a few waves of repair drones come out or make it so we can disable/destroy them. Pretty much my only complaint although it is a really annoying one for sure."

It's a great game and probably the most optimized game I've seen in years.  It's linear but not too much where it forces you to stray off course to find stuff.

I loved how they laced their story with doubts about the system, questioning the motives of the people in charge and how they disregarded the deaths of civilians. It is a great reflection on a failed system. Also, as annoying as the protagonist is in the first couple hours, I love how they weaponize his dumb action game protagonist energy into the story. Seeing the seeds of doubt form as Charles talks P-3 through the events of the game. Also the foreshadowing is lovely, from the first 5 minutes, I had doubts about the way the game was portraying everything."

5657,applekwisp,https://steamcommunity.com/id/applekwisp/,2,,1,14.4,February,25,515,0,1,"I think this game is pretty unfairly receiving a lot of criticism for reasons completely unrelated to the game itself. It's honestly a solid game, pretty short for it's price, but definitely worth it on sale (or on gamepass). As a new release it has very good performance, with a few nitpicky hitches here and there. Gameplay is solid, I enjoyed meleeing stuff the entire game, while the guns are standard fair. The lack of the sprint button is annoying, but having double dash with invuln made up for it. The powers are limited and not that interesting. The story you can guess the plot at almost the beginning of the game, but it is an adequate journey. I think the general aesthetics of the game are where it shines. The visual design is fantastic. The environments are beautiful, the robot enemies are varied and fun to fight. The boss fights have a lot of variety, though I found the game fairly easy on hard mode. You will be swimming in more health items than you know what to do with at all points of the game. The music was fantastic combined with the visuals. For a first release, it has a lot of polish. The dialog is so bad it's funny to me more so than all the whining I've read about it online. The refrigerator is not nearly as bad as some terrible reviewers have claimed. There's certainly a lot that could be improved, but I enjoyed my short time with the game. I feel like this game isn't being reviewed on merits at all, just hearsay and conspiracy theories. Don't get this thinking it's an immersive sim or RPG though, it is far from it, it's mostly just an FPS with heavy inspiration from Bioshock and Fallout, but the game is more akin to something like Doom or Far Cry than anything."

5667,MeowSmuppy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MeowSmuppyMew/,1,,1,32.0,February,25,182,0,1,"Before reading this, understand that this is from someone who has completed the game. As such, there are spoilers.This game has some good and bad things I found from it. But I'm not an expert on games, so take what I say with salt!It's fun! I just completed the game and redoing it on hardcore mode. I love how difficult the game can go depending on the number of robots around you. The fighting feels great, from swinging an ax to shooting those robo nerds in the head. The dash is fun! However, something I feel should have been a part of the dodge comes as an upgrade, which I’ll explain below. MY GOD, IT’S BLOODY GREAT! I don’t usually spend money on games to get their soundtrack unless it came in like a preorder package and I know I liked the music. But I will 100% be buying it. My only issue is how sometimes the music dies down or doesn’t activate when fighting enemies even though a few seconds ago it did. Otherwise, I would 100% say you need to get the music or listen to it when playing this game cuz gawd damn, it makes the gaming experience amazingIt was eh. They do have a fair amount of cool robots you can fight. However, it eventually gets really repetitive. A robot you were like “Cool! That robot just kicked my arse.” to “Really? 3 of them?” So the basic robots become very repetitive super quick. On the other hand, I think they could have had more difficult robots roaming the overworld rather than the basic mustache bot. Some of the “boss” robots could have been fun to encounter if like your alarm level would slowly raise to like lv 5 or something. Weapon diversity is kinda lacking. Like I was expecting so many melee weapons and a few guns. But what I got is a few guns and a few melee weapons. I loved the idea of energy weapons. I would have loved to see more.The glove abilities are kinda cool! There are a fair amount,The upgrading is enjoyable as you get to gather materials and then upgrade each component. In addition, upgrades actually visually show on your weapon. It was fun to get new upgrades then give them a spin. I also like how if you want to switch upgrades, you get all of the materials back. Same for glove upgrades. Don’t want to keep upgrading a tree or just want more neuropolymer? Just undo a tree and boom, all that neuropolymer is back! Just wished there were more special modes to each weapon. Not to mention, no blocking? Sadge.A huge issue I noticed related to gameplay is the lack of use of interesting mechanics and, to be honest, poor stealth.  Now, the stealth is awful. You move so slow that it is a bloody pain to get up behind one robot. However, in the overworld, robots are usually packed closely together, so getting close to one is a challenge on its own. And if one sees you, everyone knows you are there. Deconstruction is a pain. You have to deconstruct one item at a time. Towards the end of the game, I had to individually deconstruct like 10 stacks of shotgun shells, 8 small heals, 4 medium heals, 10 stacks of machine gun ammo, 10 stacks of pistol ammo, 8 things of vodka, and 10 things of milk. ALL OF IT INDIVIDUALLY. Kinda a pain to be frank. A HUGE issue I have is skipping dialogue and cutscenes. I am currently replaying it from the start and my god, I can’t skip cutscenes. Kinda a pain when some of them take a while to go through. To skip dialogue, you goda spam that skip button, so get ready!Got nothen bad to say about it. It’s flippen nice to look at. Sadly, my low quality screens do it an injustice. But you can tell how much love went into every wall, every blood splattered wall and floor, the bodies everywhere, the damaged walls, ETC. Golly, it really does make you feel like something went bad and now you’re the last one alive. If you play this game, make sure you can play on ATOMIC graphics and have some good screens. Your eyes will thank me later! Some areas are a bit bland, but the interiors are great!Kinda disappointed. When I first heard this was being announced, it was hyped for the concept of psychological horror. Didn’t get much of that. It was kind of like “Wow, dat crazy looken da heck” but I was never like “Oh god, my diaper.” I really wished they had made it more around horror cuz I think that would have made it so much more fun! In the end, yah. Yes, it has a few issues I have found and I’m certain that there are more I may be missing, but ♥♥♥ it, I have been waiting for this game for years. I think as, hopefully, new story DLCs and updates come out, some of these issues will go away as well as more playability. Even with all the negativity I said, I still loved it. No game is perfect and I did not expect this one to be the exception. So, if you want a fun game where you smack the ♥♥♥ out of some damn robot or get bodied by some laser shooten mofo, then this is the game for you! If anything, the universe this game is set in is like robot bioshock.Enjoy!"

(cannot dash through enemies)Speaking of stuck, you can also get stuck on small things on the ground. (honestly this is anoyying af)Achievement bug. (as for 25/2/23. I like doing achievement so this is a bummer)There's a few bug like when doing door puzzle the camera is facing downward etc. (negligible, not game breaking)That's it. Highly recommended. Cannot wait for the DLC."

The world is absolutely gorgeous and the design is fantastic. A lot of people complaining about the voice actor and the glove, I may be in the minority but I enjoy it. Sure it is over the top and sometimes goes a little long, but i still find the banter enjoyable.  All in all, good fun, I'd wait until it goes on sale, and am looking forward to the fun they can have with new locations when/If they drop DLCS.

As someone who knows soviet history well, there is an abundance of Easter eggs that make the game really enjoyable, like 80's soviet songs and cartoons, etc. The dialogue is cringe but for someone who understand's russian, this is actually normal!My only gripe is the movement. Its very....source engine like. Feels like you are in jello or on ice skates. I understand this because many russians grew up on counter strike, based on the source engine, but that movement is pretty mediocre my modern day standards. Also, I wish more objects were destructible, like glass.8 Hours in, the game is just meh. Honestly just watch the cut scenes. Even on easy mode the enemies that do matter are pretty much same old hack and slash and heal nonsense. There is really no fun past the first two bosses. Everything else is just BIG HP BAR and lots of healing. Extremely boring and borderline annoying combat."

If you got it with the idea that the open world aspect would be nice you are very mistaken. The open world is terrible to go through which is unfortunate since they put so much content into the areas you can investigate. The main story was phenomenal but kinda too obvious of a plot with way too much foreshadowing instead of figuring it out on your own to push you towards a certain ending.

While some may be turned off by the communist theme, it is important to note that the game is not meant to be a political statement. Rather, it is a beautifully crafted game that is reminiscent of Bioshock in its style and tone. The gameplay is smooth and responsive, with plenty of opportunities for exploration and discovery. The game is also very forgiving when it comes to saving progress, with plenty of points where players can save their game and pick up right where they left off. All in all, Atomic Hearth is a must-play for fans of RPGs and anyone looking for a unique and visually striking gaming experience.

Otherwise the other enemies were okay.- The ending definitely needs more explanation - There was 2 missions where it was a ""Find and bring back item"" type missions. They got boring while trying to find more than 2 items. The reason I am adding this is because those 2 missions took quite a long time to complete. - There was times that the dialogue could have been better."

This game lives up to all my expectations and then some, an absolute 10/10 experience!The environment is beautiful and exceptionally detailed, the machines are terrifying and just like the environment and story are very heavily inspired by sci-fi of the 1950's.The game at some points may be buggy, but personally I haven't experienced anything while playing in 34 hours.The levels are very well designed and fights are well laid out, combat is very swift and fluid and the Polymer enhancement system is amazing! The weapons, though few, are hefty and pack a real punch, and the modification is just as detailed as promised in preview footage!The driving mechanics are also well done and unexpected as the map is much larger than I has originally expected!All in all this game is well written, funny, and while difficult at times with its Portal-esque puzzles, the overall game is very enjoyable to play.I would highly recommend!

Optimization is very well done and this game should be an example to developers with many time the budget...Cyka.Sounds & Music: guns sounds nice tho i miss a bit of oomph, this very is noticeable when explosions are involved which sound a bit weak. Audio queues from enemies are very good tho the chopper robots can be drowning all others sounds when they try to undo your most recent massacre. The music is amazing and i fell head over heels for most of the tracks. Which vary from classical masterpieces to grungy Russian nu metal. Voice acting is good, the Russian that is.....for the love of all that is communism, disable the noises of the capitalist western pigs. The English voice acting don't fit the characters very well and sound out of place....treat this like dubbed Anime and set voice to GLORIOUS RUSSIAN LANGUAGEStory: The main story is acceptable like a Die Hard movie....We have hero, we have villain add motive for domination, and now we make them fight. There are some highlights however and for the sake of spoilers i wont mention them, but there is certainly good writing to be found.Gameplay: First thing i need to mention here....the one who added quicktime events to the game, need to be sent TO GULAG. Now with that out of the way lets start with combat, combat feels good and responsive and for once some one has spend a little bit of thought about the keybinds, they are perfect. Weapons like the shotgun and the gauss rifle feel like they should be, melee is nice a bit like skyrim but when you use your Soviet magic things get crispy...namely innocent critters, however the rocket launcher feels like you are shooting deflating balloons, in velocity and damage and is disappointing. The variety of enemies isn't huge but enough for the lenght of this game. What was weird to me that the environment doesn't react at all on your powers. Fire ignores your frost blast, and people stuck under boxes are lying helpless because your anti gravity only works on story non critical boxes. Puzzles are fun, good variety and not overstaying their welcome. Platforming is nicely done as well, good visual hints so you know where to grab, me and my colorblindness had no difficulty at all.Verdict: Not all is mentioned but i think the above gives you a pretty good idea what you are getting  by buying this game. This is a good game and a pleasurable adventure to go through, and i highly recommend it if you enjoy games like: Bioshock, Dishonored, Dead Space, Prey."

The skills, while not too varied, still offer different ways to tackle enemies and you can respec at any time you want until you find what works for youI honestly feel the devs did a good job and while there's still room to improve, this can be achieved with patched and with either free and/or paid DLC. I know not all people feel this game lived to the hype and there are some controversies, but I think it's a game worth playing, and I recommend it."

So far it has been completely linear (as opposed to the STALKER-type sandbox that the trailers indicated), but it has been a weird and fun ride.  I recommend changing it to the Russian voices as the English voice acting is REALLLLLY awkward.On that note, there are several things that are REALLY awkward and which make this more of a 7/10 for me.  The horrible dialogue and some VERY cringe-worthy moments really took me out of the experience, but I am still enjoying my time with the game despite that.  The graphics and sound design are FANTASTIC and really help to sell this bizarre and wonderful world.  Wanting to explore the world is what is keeping me from returning the game.Story 3/10Characters 2/10Gameplay 7/10World design 9/10Overall fun = 7/10"
5733,Tiderion,https://steamcommunity.com/id/snared04/,No,,1,29.3,February,25,769,0,1,"Whew.  What a roller coaster.  First off, the annoying nonsense - anyone trying to politicize this game is a pearl-clutching moron who has never played the game.  If anything, this game is a damning indictment of socialism and the USSR.  You should play it because it's good.  If you don't want to buy and play it, that's also perfectly acceptable, but don't do it because some woketivist told you not to.Alright, now that we're through that, let's talk about the actual game.This was an amazing experience from beginning to end.  It brought back heavy Bioshock feelings and that was definitely on purpose.  If you've played Bioshock, you can see the fingerprints of its influences throughout the story and narrative, less so on the gameplay.Atomic Heart is set in an alternative version of 1950's USSR where technological breakthroughs in several key areas, namely robotics, allowed the USSR to defeat Germany in WWII and then become the dominant power in the world following the end of the war.  Fast forward to the opening scene where your character, a polymer-augmented special agent who works for the lead scientist in charge of the robotics programs, is making his way through the center of the scientific sector in a supposedly Utopian Russian society.Of course, things quickly go awry, with the robots going crazy under the direction of a rogue element, and the plot spirals out of control from there.So let's talk about the three biggest things that make up this game: The combat, the story, side events/customizationRight off the bat, one area in which this game dominates Bioshock is the combat.  This game clearly had a mind for making sure that the main medium of the action - fighting - was well designed, and they pulled it off.  For a looter shooter, this game places the emphasis on the shooting, and it is a blast from start to finish.You could level a slight criticism that there isn't a huge enemy variety.  Off the top of my head I think there was at least 15 distinct enemies, not counting bosses and mini bosses, which when mixed together in frantic combat, didn't get stale to me.  That being said, some of them were super annoying and I dreaded encountering them, but overall the combat of the game drove the action forward and as you gained in weapons and powers you had new and intricate ways to meet the rising level of difficulty which was well paced.The story.  Wow.  First off, it's super weird, no doubt.  It's very heavily steeped in political commentary and while Bioshock dealt with very broad topics like anarchocapitalism in B1 and twisting religion into a society of zealous theocrats (Coupled with the sinister Vox Populi later in the game), Atomic Heart focuses solely on the morals and ethics of the socialist experiment carried to its extreme conclusions.  I won't spoil anything here, but I feel like they hit the nail on the head and gave fair treatment.  Characters are well written, though dialogue, particularly in the later stages, feels a bit forced.  That being said, everyone is very two dimensional and it will keep you guessing right up until the end.  Some twists are obvious, some will catch you completely by surprise.The ending :The side activities and character building - Well first of all, I'd like to say that I greatly appreciated how much thought was put into smaller activities like door unlocking, of which there's a whopping 5-6 different types of locks that get harder as you go.  I also thought the first person exploration and parkour in particular was super well done and also not over used.  Games like Jed: Fallen Order simply overused the parkour elements to the point where they become tedious and unfun.  Atomic Heart has the right amount, and includes tons of Dark Souls-esque shortcuts to unlock.The open world exploration... kinda meh.  This plays into the character upgrading which is 100% based on you gathering specific materials to unlock abilities, or craft guns or their upgrades.  This was all pretty good at first, and helped you create new ways to approach combat, but after a certain point, you unlocked everything there was to unlock and seeking out the cryptic and somewhat-annoying testing grounds to unlock some minor boost to your gun became redundant.  There's a lot of little stories to be told just by wandering around, and lots of interesting emails and audio to consume, but in the end it's all about chaos and death so you can pick how much you want to engage with.Overall, I'd say this is a GOTY contender or pretty close.  Between the awesome story and gameplay, I have nothing but positive things to say and would heavily recommend it to any Bioshock or FPS/RPG fan.9.5/10"

It's not perfect by any means, but compared to what we're getting these days from supposedly experienced triple a studios it's actually very polished. It works like it says on the box, it's pretty well optimized (fov issues aside), and it feels like a finished game, not like I have to buy all the missing parts over the next year (frankly gets an 11/10 from me for that fact alone).Aside from it being a solid game on technical grounds it's a beautifully crafted artistic game, with unique concepts and storytelling. Melee is solid and weighty, it feels well executed and satisfying. Gunplay is the same, feels well done and shooting a robot at point blank with a shotgun hasn't felt this impactful in while (they actually go flying, it's pretty great). The world is beautiful and calling it soviet bioshock is appropriate (I LOVE the original bioshock I don't make that comparison lightly).The English dub is awful, that is my only complaint so far, I'll play in Russian from here out most likely. It's a shame it has to be politicized, as a gamer for 30 years I'm practically begging the industry to release original, unique experiences which treat games like ART again for years and that is exactly what atomic heart delivers."

It's fun, point blank. While it wont revolutionize (hehe get it?) the video game industry, or even the genre itself, it has carved out its own identity among similar types of games. The gunplay is tight, the melee is responsive and enjoyable, the powers, while there are only a handful (hehe) are well executed (with one glaring issue currently regarding that, the Cryo power making bodies and loot disappear) the voice acting is top notch, the world is interesting, and the story thus far, is neither over the top nor is it bare-bones. Having only recently been made aware that people are boycotting and outright trashing this game for political reasons, if the suggestion can be made, to put aside the Balkanization for just a moment (I know you folks like to turn everything into team-sports) the game is worth the time, and in my honest opinion, the money."

I doubt it will win any kinds of award in the future but for the time being it does occupy as a nice filler if you have any free time. Game play is fun and there is not really much more to say about. I personally feel the weight of when i land my attacks and vice versa coming from the enemy. The design of seeing the damage you do is a very nice touch, and sometimes dodging comes out to be so satisfying fighting certain enemies and makes me feel like a complete bad ass. The designs of enemies are very pleasant to the eye but animation and behavior become wonky with some of the lesser enemies. Upgrading your weapons and character is simple however to obtain certain upgrades you need to go to certain location and it feels like the story - Being main mission placement - steers you away from that purpose. The story is OK and playing to the end I can say the build up just did not meet the mark. For a warning the main character talks a lot and it is very easy to miss dialogue because taking 5 steps into the next area just cuts out any addition instead of overlapping which would also be annoying. The game has an open world which is beautiful with its design and the atmosphere it presents, but again with this story its hard to utilize because of the inconvenience that some locations are just far away from where your objectives lead you. Its best to add your going to spend a lot of time in underground facilities and It can get pretty tiring at times depending on the types of hurdles (Puzzles, Key finding, Large  groups of enemies, Etc.) it put in front of you. I personally found myself bulldozing through the story and I cant say that I was able to fully appreciate the design of the map but It was a good 18 hours and I just cant see myself playing more. Overall it is a Okay game. I would recommend waiting for a sale or an evident price decrease in the future."

I had the frostbite and the shield the whole game and other than glitches where enemies trapped me in a corner and I was unable to move had no issues with combat.  If you want to explore the overworld wait until you get off the train and you get overload for the area otherwise it will be very annoying to look n loot when being constantly shot or hit by something.  Neat story but it has an ending cliffhanger feel so DLC or a sequel is hopefully inbound to fill said cliffhanger.  Needs more granny zina and would be neat for a dlc or sequel to allow for a robocompanion to aid on higher difficulty as a wingbot so to say.

The Glove ability are really enjoyable, giving the option of choosing a differing play style (or you could just use only 2 for the entire game and never swap them out)If I were to rate this game then i'd give it a 6.7/10, it really didn't live up the hype that I had since the very first teaser trailer. The game presenting me uninteresting characters that have little knowledge or detailed information attached to them and then they just die, the game has a very repetitive progress advancing pattern (In other words I mean moving through the story).

On one hand I found parts of the story and a few dialog moments to be not that engaging and after a while once you get your upgrades it really starts to feel like a hack and slash game with minimal Challenge (Even on Hard). However I absolutely loved the world design, the enemies, the weapons and powers, they were just so much fun to engage with and the combat was fast, clean and since you can respec everything for free you can take combat head on so many different ways (Even if it does become a hack and slasher), I mean the weapons/weapon upgrades and enemy designs are enough to keep you entertained.All in All, I enjoyed my run of Atomic Heart and i will keep playing it but after I'm done i can honestly say that this will be a hard game to come back to for the story or combat.Hope this help you and if you do buy the game I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did."

Like something you've never played before.The attention to detail is just superb. So many little things that make the game world interesting. The Loony Tunes type cartoons on the TV in the recreation (save) rooms make you eager to find the next room just to see the next clip. That and the cartoons in NORA's upgrade screen are a big example of this. In the recreation rooms you'll also find windows that at first look like they show the outside but on closer inspection they are holographic images on a screen. Very reminiscent of Sci-Fi movies and games that take place out in space where they have rooms to make you feel like your back on earth. A lot of the game hints that the purpose of this scientific installation is to come up with technology for long space voyages to other planets.The soundtrack sounds like something that Hanz Zimmer would have come up with. It is excellent and works very well with the game. The writing is decent. I know some review critics don't think so. But the witty banter between the main character and the glove is great. It never get's old. The conversations with the ""dead people"" that you speak to are well written too. There is a lot of humor and sarcasm in these conversations that make each encounter unique and it never get's worn out or old. The puzzles are good if not a little on the easy side. Unfortunately some of them you don't really need to figure out. There are places where you can ""squeeze through"" as well as jump through if you have the double character skill.The graphics are very good. About the best you can get with the Unreal 4 engine. Surprisingly the game has almost no game-breaking bugs considering it's 2023 and by now it's common for games to be practically unplayable when they first come out. Considering this is the first game this developer has come out with they did an excellent job. But there are many small bugs. Too much to get into detail here. Yes, there are that many. But like I said, there not game breaking. They are small enough that I can understand how the developers may have missed them. But they are slowly being patched up like every other week.I love the fact that it is bathed in Russian/USSR lore I'm glad they didn't try to make it more Westernized. All the posters and signs in the game are all in Russian which just adds to the character  and theme of the game.The weapon mechanics are done very well. Each weapon has a unique feel to it. The enemy AI and their attack patterns are varied and different. This makes combat more fun and interesting as you progress through the game. Although the enemy AI tends to get stuck sometimes. They will get stuck behind a simple obstacle in the road that they should easily be able to jump over or go around but yet they don't. They continue trying to ""run through it"". This get's annoying and reduces immersion as you can easily just pick them off. The combat with enemy AI isn't as smooth as it could be. I find it to be choppy at times. So there's no real rhythm to get into. So one minute your walking around observing the beauty of the environment of Facility 3826 and the next minute your getting mindlessly pummeled in every direction. This may or may not be intentional with the developers.I would highly recommend this game. It's worth the price. I'm sorry that the developers are getting so much hate on social media with the war on Ukraine and all. They don't deserve it. They are artists making art for people to enjoy. Plain and simple. It's obvious why they can't speak out against the war, Putin would have their company shut down so fast. That would be literal suicide.  Anyways, just buy it and play it. You won't be disappointed."

5808,Rabbit,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SmashinASlag/,No,,1,29.1,February,24,122,0,1,"*The Good*- The Performance   -> 60fps? on my 1080? on HIGH?! God tier performance in my eyes.- The Gameplay     -> yes, shooting/dodging/melee feels GREAT here, and impactful    -> moment to moment fights work really well, and are hectic as hell even on normal difficulty.     -> boss fights are the big stars of the show here: hedgie, the twins, natasha, and belyash are highlights.- The Soundtrack    -> GeoffPlaysGuitar and Mick Gordon knock it out of the park for EACH and EVERY track. Yes, including the ambients and normal fighting tracks. It all meshes well, and syncs to the action beautifully.     -> The boss fight tracks for Natasha, Hedgie, the Twins fight, and the combat track for the first portion of the Pavlov Complex (the metal one) are highlights for me.- The Level Design + Testing Rooms (for the most part)    -> The level design shines in the dungeon-like portions of the game (e.g. the prologue, pavlov complex, testing dungeons), it feels like the combat loop and speed of the movement was optimized for those portions instead of an open world.- The Story (Somewhat, read below)    -> While overstuffed and front-loaded to an EXCESSIVE and PAINFUL degree, the banter between P-3 and CHARLES does help make the game feel more alive than it would've with a silent protagonist.    -> There is actual story growth between P-3 and CHARLES depending on how many test chambers you do. You can even get P-3 acting warmly to CHARLES and saying ""Thanks"" depending how many you do with him, rewarding players with an actual growth for P-3 and CHARLES relationship due to game completion. (The fact that this doesn't impact the ending legitimately upsets me, but i digress)    -> The banter and exposition after the prologue (but before the lighthouse/""finale"") feels much better paced out because its more tied to player progression, and actions (like entering a saferoom, or a lull in the action/start of a puzzle room in a testing dungeon.    -> The actual mystery of what Kollektiv 2.0 really is and the Atomic Heart protocol, while predictable, is a fairly engaging hook.    -> The initial promise and setup for the story given everything above had me enjoying the somewhat predictable, cheesy and over-the-top world and characters Atomic Heart provided, with a grounding in 50s Soviet corruption and dystopia... until the ending. Which ♥♥♥♥♥ all over it.*The Bad*- Constantly getting caught on level geometry, leads to unfair and messy combat encounters- Normal Difficulty is balanced for closed-room encounters, not for open world engagements, leading to Alerts being a non-factor (i.e. you can literally run from one end of the map to another, and you'll hardly find any trouble... unless it's a mini-boss like a Plyush.)- Encounter Balancing (see: Plyush being faaaaar too tanky for a mini-boss when normal bosses aren't as tanky, but are far more balanced to fight)- The Pacing of the Narrative- The Pacing of Banter between P-3 and CHARLES- SOFTLOCKS, SO MANY SOFTLOCKS   -For example:    -> Freefall forever on level geometry after jumping or being pushed onto it by enemies    -> Prompts for the camera-hack system wouldn't show, requiring a reload of a save.... on a regular basis    -> Clipped into walls after being knocked down by heavy attacks, forever stuck    -> Clipped into doors, repeatedly, just by standing at the wrong spot    -> Important items to proceed the puzzle room or story room (see Candles in pipes, or Candles needing to be thrown) getting snagged on level geometry, makign them inacessible with glove.- The Endings are unsatisfying and feel unnecessarily contrived to give a big ""twist"".    -> Surprise, CHARLES is evil. The film Upgrade handled the twist with far better grace than this, with much less time.    -> Surprise, the ""Good"" ending is you letting the mad scientist mind control everyone and essentially take over America with attack robots...     ->  Surprise, the ""Bad"" ending is you actually getting answers and stopping the mind control plot like a SANE PERSON, but now CHARLES traps you in a hallucination with your not-wife (wife is never found), and CHARLES goes to plot the end of humanity...    ->   It's basically the Forespoken plot twist where you magical glove/bracelet is evil, but its even worse here... because the story could've functioned better if they just played it straight, and kept Sechenov the main villain, not CHARLES.    ->   As a result of the endings, it nullifies and actively ♥♥♥♥♥ on any investment you could have gotten from P-3 and CHARLES relationship, as well as any narrative truths or satisfaction from being invested in P-3's story.  It goes to show, sometimes subversion and ""twists"" don't automatically make a story better or more interesting.*The Ugly*- ""Crispy Critters!""    ->   P-3 is a cheesy ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and much of the story is over-the-top, whacky and downright cartoony. **IRONICALLY ENOUGH** the dub may be the best at showing this, as the russian dub seems to be trying a bit too hard to sound cool (exception being Petrov, whose hamming it up and embracing the whackiness of the role), whereas the english is embracing the crazy and the stupid of it all. It sounds weird, but the story and writing is weird, so... YMMV.   ->  THEY NEVER SHUT THE ♥♥♥♥ UP... until you get past the prologue (and before the lighthouse) where it calms down significantly. The banter itself isn't a problem for me, but the game struggles letting you breath and letting the environment or lore in-universe do the talking. CHARLES is relied on too much to be a literal exposition machine, and it shows in the prologue. The fact there's no CHARLES button to at least have it be a player-controlled option definitely is a ""bad"" in my book.- A Plyush tanks and deals more damage than Natasha, The Twins, and even Hedgie. (On Normal, god forbid what they are on Hard difficulty)  ->  The balancing in the game needs some work. For being a mini-boss that the game throws MULTIPLE at you before the Pavlov complex, Plyushs are far too annoying and tanky to fight. For the first encounter, it can work given their rarity but otherwise, the game makes them far too powerful to be fun fighting as a normal enemy.  ->  Enemy damage overall is wonky. Even with my maxed out health, increased regeneration and such, I can still find myself low on HP fairly fast given enough enemies or a powerful enough heavy attack (see Plyush, or certain laser/missile attacks). This makes combat often feel weirdly lopside on some encounters, where they pass too fast, or take forever. The robots feel the most balanced to fight given you properly upgrade your guns and health/character stats, but minibosses like the black Labtechs or the Plyush can be chores to fight sometimes due to their tankiness even when maxxed out on melee damage or firearms damage.- The Open World and why it's borderline useless.  ->  In my experience, you can literally just run (normal run, not sprint/dash... there is no sprint) from one end to the map fairly quickly and lose most chasing enemies and even alert levels if you're fast enough. It renders any and all threat they have pointless and moot after a while.  ->  Sometimes the way to access the testing grounds is so inane, obscure, and reliant on every system working perfectly (which they often don't) that it's easier to actually just google what to do and where to look over risking unnecessary damage and resource wasting.  -> No basic ability to custom waypoint to a testing ground, or specific area on the map. Constantly have to pop in and out of the map to reorient myself. Normally I wouldn't mind this, but it's definitely one of the most cumbersome parts of the game... oh, and there's no map for facility areas, so you better memorize the layout or get used to backtracking... OFTEN for save-scumming and resource management.Recommend? Sure, at a discount. Ignore the story (mainly because of the endings)."

5845,Would You Kindly?,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kindly_Engineer/,1,,1,16.8,February,24,349,0,1,"Absolutely loved the game, the only gripe I have is for once I honestly wish that there was less 'open world' content.  I would have preferred a longer, more fleshed out story with fewer side areas.  The writing is good, I was invested enough to finish it within just a few days of release, but it does feel a little hollow after the fact.  A lot of people have pointed out that the pacing drops off a bit after the opening acts and I cant deny that, but it was still well worth playing through in my opinion.  Overall, I believe it is a very, very, strong offering for a studio's first major release.  I am hoping that the DLC will contain further story content and expand on the world the devs have created."

Thank god though, that the reviews were somewhat positive enough for me to take a chance on installing Atomic Heart instead of returning it.I am a sucker for great graphics and this game doesn't disappoint.  In fact, in that area, it excelled.  The opening scene of the game made me really appreciate my RTX 390TI.  From the real water effects, to the highly detailed scenery during the first 5 or 10 minutes of the game, made it a totally immersive experience and made me eager to dive further into Atomic Heart's world. Excellent graphics, fun and intuitive game play, along with a decent story line and very few bugs thus far, makes me feel that I not only made the right call with keeping and installing it, but buying the deluxe version as well.  Highly, recommended =)."

If they don't, Yay Devs!  Everything I've heard at this point is hearsay so will leave it at that.As for the game, I only encountered 2 bugs with 1 of them being game breaking but it did auto save right before I encountered it so was not a huge issue.  Considering the amazing graphics and content, I was delighted about how smoothly the game ran.The game was not as open world as I was hoping for but never the less, I really enjoyed it.  It had Fallout meets Bioshock vibes.  Loved the loot and crafting system.  In easy mode, the game took me about 16 hours to complete with a lot of that time spent looting everything I could find.  In the early game, the inventory management was a bit annoying but later on, you can upgrade your inventory and it becomes less of an issue.For only 16 hours of game play, I don't know if I would recommend buying this game at $60 unless you are going to play through all the various endings but if you have the money, I do highly recommend playing this game.  It had a great story, everything had voice overs and some great humor tied into it."

Open-world filled with dungeons, a great balance between combat and puzzles, this is definitely one of my new favorites.

Story wise i felt like i was in some sort of Bio shock remake now and then. But in a good way. Some game play aspects were already familiar from other games but what are you supposed to do. You cant reinvent the wheel. I do believe this is a genuinely polished game with an original Story.The game flow may be a little ripped apppart now and then. There are areas that are only seen if you want to. I was always unsure if i should explore or go back to the story. Both was fine in the end.I found it quite engaging collecting some things and then going back to the missions eager to get a new Story related cutszene. All in All it was fun. 60€ are too much for my Taste for any game but it is a really god game. Just don't expect an outrageous playtime if you don't wanna walk around collecting everything. This is a mixture of FPS, Puzzle and Platformer.ThanksEdit: The Achievments are filled with problems. The collect all things start counting from 0 every time you load the game, no matter how many you have already gotten. An Achievment you get for defeating a specific enemy was not given to me.

The amount of variety in this game's mechanics and gameplay has left me fairly amazed, still seeing new things 11 hours into the game. The parkour was an unexpected but fun take on terrain traversal that I find very enjoyable.     Many members of the cast (in the russian dub at least) are a complete joy to listen to. P-3 has become one of my favorite main characters I've seen in a new IP. The perfectly cheesy euro dialogue mixes excellently with his delivery, making it a joy to listen to.     And speaking of auditory joys; the soundtrack is absolutely breathtaking. The sheer amount of genres and styles of music in this game is phenomenal, and all of the original music is done amazingly by Mick Gordon and Geofry Day.     And at the end of it all, I'm so so glad that the last few months of ""controversy"" in this development studio hasn't faltered them in making a fun game that will surely stick out in my mind for a long while."

No evidence of devs actually pro/against Ukraine. It's also not a bad game. Writing might be cringe for your char p3 Game hits a Wolfenstien/Bioshock/Fallout itch with a unique polymer robo, soviet skin.It was fun to play. Looking forward to more content from this universe. Hoping the season pass isn't just skins. The skins themselves I thought were overpriced until you realized they are very detailed and adapt to your upgrades with unique parts that are distinct from vanilla.

Music is great, both for the licensed tracks and the remixed ones, plenty of STALKER radio tracks from anomaly and lost alpha to be found in here.The gameplay is fine, but the game lacks proper difficulty. The early game can be very punishing, but you snowball very fast and it becomes a cakewalk just a few hours after you're let out in the open world. Resources are too common, I had a massive stock of EVERYTHING by the end of the game, even starting to use the shotgun way less restrictively by the halfway point onward.Minor bugs are present, mostly with some animations or being unable to loot some items. Getting stuck in place is also something that likes to happen when doing the training facilities, requiring a reload. Still, I've seen A LOT worse from a day 1 release.The main character needs to SHUT THE ♥♥♥♥ UP, he talks way too much and says plenty of either retarded or cringe lines that I fail to understand the target audience of. ""Who knew robots liked cookies, do you like cookies charles?"" ""this place used to be beautiful, then everyone died"" both have the spotlight in my almost 22 hours.From 3/4th onwards, he also likes to bring up the same exact topic over and over, with the course of the conversation always resulting in ""no the guy can't be evil, everyone loves him, he's a great man"" and the glove responding ""are you sure about that"", it got boring SO FAST.

It doesn't outdo bioshock in the formula but it's a welcome addition. the writing outside of the main story points found in audio logs or text files are pretty interesting but the story itself isn't very inspired or something unexplored conceptually.unless they intend to patch it in i'd recommend using Flawless Widescreen so you may adjust the fov because they don't have a setting and it's extremely tight for this type of shooteroverall it didnt over stay it's welcome and was genuinely a good time, maybe wait for a sale though because I dont really see a reason to do a second playthrough"

Yes, comrade Sergey has the IQ of a fridge (pun intended) but other than that the game is a must for every Bioshock fan and/or shooter fan in general. Sure it ""stole"" more than one mechanic from its spiritual paragon, even the whole floating city theme is well known. Neitherless it stole it very well and as a Bioshock nerd I enjoyed these little treats a lot!Difficulty: I played 4 hours straight on the hardest difficulty and I died once because I got cornered. The game is EASY so I recommend playing it on at least normal or hard (like again, isn't hard at all), because otherwise the fighting's gonna be pretty boring. Its super smooth to evade enemy attacks, especially with the dodge upgrade. As long as you have some space to do it. Don't get cornered because thats instant death there..Verdict:The fact alone that it works perfect without any bugs on day 1 is outstanding. Graphics are beautiful minus the fact that raytracing isn't implemented yet for whatever reason. That's weird because in the past they made a big fuzz about it how great their raytracing looks.. I will update this review when I'm trough but so far I had a blast. Highly recommend!"

Typically not a huge puzzle game person, but the mix of puzzles and combat made it a perfect mix. The story seemed really short, and seemed pushy about continuing the story. Testing ground 8 wasn't available until after a story mission. But I guess the point of any game is to finish the story then go back and enjoy. Problem is, after continuing the story to unlock TG 8, there was never really another point to stop and go back for the loot. Only ended up with some basic attachments when fighting the twins, prolly could have been easier had I had access to all testing grounds first, but that's fine. Enjoyable experience either way."

Visually the game is beautiful The puzzles are always getting harder, vary enough the aren’t too annoying, and aren’t too frequent.Gameplay is difficult. I played on medium difficulty, but wasn’t good enough after about 8 hours in to keep up. I switched to easy and it’s much better. The enemies change a lot and it takes a lot to not get overwhelmed, but you start to figure out how to deal with each in due time. One of the hardest parts of in the open world the robots fix each other, now this makes sense because of the background of the game, but this is so incredibly overwhelming sometimes that you won’t want to be outside for every long. You need to go into the game with the understanding it’s based in communist Russia and if you’re not okay with hearing pro-communist ideology you most likely won’t like the game because the “good people” in the game are heavy believers in that. Overall the game in my mind is great, based on what I thought was promised from the studio."

5918,Combine_Overwλtch,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Combine_Overwatch/,No,,1,45.8,February,24,146,0,1,"Note: As someone who has been waiting for this game for the better part of 4 years, I have substantial bias towards this product and the Mundfish team. I also played the game in Russian with English subtitles and on the hardest difficulty.—Performance—		An optimized PC game?? In the year 2023?? It’s almost like we're living in sci-fi times. But truly, performance was great with only a single crash in my 15 hour run through of the main quest and only a couple bugs related to enemy AI and player UI. In addition to minimal yet fast loading screens and the seamless world, it's truly impressive. (Played on 3080, 16 gigs of ram, I7 CPU with an SSD)—World and Art— 		Atomic Heart is artistically cutting edge from start to finish with a combination of horror, retrofuturist and surrealist art permitting every room of facility 3826. From the robots, the mutants, technology you use or even the cartoons that play for each weapon or skill upgrade, each one exerts detail and passion from the team who has the pleasure of designing this amazing location. Although the art design of 3826 is amazing, there’s so much of it and its so noisy that it becomes overwhelming at points and it becomes difficult to identify locations at points because everything is so wildly varied. The curated complexes and labs allow the art to shine but the open world is far less consistently eye-catching with inconsistencies in theming.  Worldbuilding is standard with the same aspect of quality as the art, classic audio logs, readable terminals and codex entries, the world is significantly fleshed out with phragrapgraps of lore to read up on.—level and Encounter Design—		level design is mostly linear with multiple objectives you may handle in different orders, at its best its linear levels with some player agency in the order you complete your missions, think Fort Frolic from bioshock. Puzzles are great as well, the small mini puzzles like lockpicking and hacking are fun and do draw themselves out and the larger, more unique puzzles always feel challenging and rewarding to complete. At its worst, it's traveling long distances with a terrible car over an overcrowded bridge with 2 boss enemies on it. In the isolated complexes, the level design can flourish but on the surface, the open world doesn’t work very well. In addition the open world encounters feel almost randomized, with the cameras always calling in more robots that gets very annoying and overwhelming at times in stark opposition to the more curated and balanced encounters of the 5 main complexes. —Combat—		Combat is separated into 3 main parts of melee, ranged and power combat. Melee combat plays almost like dark souls with dodging heavy attacks, using moments of opportunity to land your hits and using the time in between to heal. Each weapon has a varied alternate attack and modding tree that can be used to further specialize your weapons. Melee combat is my preferred way of dealing with the dangers of facility 3826 and its hostile ecosystem. Glove powers factor into combat with many abilities such as polymer jet, polymer shield, shok, frostbite and mass telekinesis. The powers don't flow with the environment, with weapons or with other enemies as well as in Bioshock but they function just as well as Bioshocks plasmids in a vacuum. Another gripe with the powers is the lack of an energy system, rather the powers are on a cooldown, this eliminates an element of management and death to this element of combat.Firearms consist of energy weapons and ballistic weapons. Energy weapons use energy that is accumulated by using melee weapons and ballistic weapons use traditional munitions. Guns feel good to use and have extensive upgrade trees and modifications to use. Sound design could be better in some guns like the Electro or the PM.But why have weapons if there’s nothing to fight? There’s a varied selection of enemies to fight that work together and fight against each other to create a cohesive ecosystem to facility 3826. And of course, each one is more masterfully designed then the last both artistically and gameplay wise with varied attacks and great designs. Enemies are aggressive and feel like formidable opponents with multiple attacks for each situation in addition to enemies feeling heavy Although spongy at points. Enemies will fall apart when it is enough, they will burn, fragment, spark and light fire depending on their health and where they're hit and it serves as a great indicator of how much health each foe has without any health bars. Boss fights are a highlight of the game with each one being a spectacle to behold with each one having different mechanics and attacks. Some Boss fights are reused throughout the game in combination with other enemies but they’re consistently fun to fight in these different situations.—Open World—		Now this is where the package sadly begins to fall apart, the game features an open world that includes enemies to fight, some main quest objectives and optional dungeons to conquer to get new weapon mods but that’s about it. I felt no need to go out and get these weapon upgrades even when playing on the hardest difficulty and even getting to and from these optional areas in a slog with one of the worst drivable cars in any video game I’ve ever played. As well as the staggering number of robots on the surface that are constantly coming at you, and the cameras that you can barely see calling more and the repair hives constantly dispatching drones to repair the robots you just killed. The visual design is very stagnant in the open world as well, it feels like halo infinite where it features a single kind of visual style and for atomic hearts open world, it's forest with villages and some admittedly eye-catching architecture. I would honestly recommend not interacting with the open world just to savor the sharper, more curated complex missions.—Plot and story—		The plot opens with a walk through a utopian Soviet city, showing off what the Soviet Union wants you to perceive, but the utopian dream is not what it seems and you are thrusted into your first linear complex after the robots begin to attack humans. You move through the game, interacting with characters and trying to uncover the secret of what happened to the robots and the true nature of facility 3826. The story moves at an inconsistent pace and progresses very slowly for the first 7 or so hours until large developments begin to occur at the conclusion of the 2nd major complex and beyond. The people you interact with are standard to uninteresting with little personality to each besides the erotic refrigerator that is the crafting machine. Some plot developments hit harder than others in the well rendered cutscenes with fine to good Russian performances (while the english ones are subpar). My main issue with the story is the dialog between Major P-3 and Char-Les, your glove sidekick. These 2 speak WAY too much about nothing relevant for it to be endearing. P-3s personality tries to be the no nonsense, stone cold soldier but he comes off as just mean, like he's constantly upset about everything and listening to him talk about nothing but how terrible everything is becomes very obnoxious at times, Although playing the game in Russian makes it slightly more bearable.."

The graphics and lighting are amazing and crisp. I found the game-play mechanics to be a little weird in the begging but It got easier to handle the more I played.

As others are saying, at first the dialogue sounds a little cringe - especially one super dumb, repeated phrase that will grind on your ears every time you hear it - but I promise it will quickly grow on you, and the protagonist says some genuinely hilarious stuff when he gets angry. It's not a long game, and it is not an open world (although it looks like one, you are fenced in to a thin one-way path across the map) The graphics and performance are god tier, it looks INCREDIBLE and runs excellent on my 5 year old PC.

5948,Hiyabois,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198238526950/,No,,1,26.4,February,24,68,0,1,"This game is awesome. I found the dialogue hilarious (the MC turning the key counter clockwise in the beginning was so good) and the combat really fun up till the end. The robots, especially in the beginning are so terrifying to fight against on the hardest mode it really immerses you into the survival aspect. Also the ability to respec/dissemble anytime for free is so good in this game, because, it forces you to focus on different skills depending on your progress in the game, and does not punish you for investing in different weapons and abilities. The puzzles were pretty simple and fun too, they were pretty diverse too.Downsides:Bugs-The downsides though are some crashes (23 crashes in 26 hours so not terrible), glitches such as enemies falling onto the floor then standing then laying flat then standing,  your map not being avaialble and having to reload the game, some weird menu interactions. Gameplay-I didnt have a blueprint for the shotgun in my whole run so when i destroyed the weapon I lost it the whole game.  The inventory system is silly, you're constantly grabbing all sorts of loot, but its often ammo for weapons you dont have or consumables you never use. A method to filter would have been useful, the abiltiy to send stuff to Nora is a good remedy, but is repetitive. The ability to give your weapons fire, shock, or ice bonuses sounds cool, but they run out way too fast, take up inventory space, and are honestly more of a hassle to use. Sucking stuff with your gloves is un-ironically a long process, often times you miss stuff and then have to hold alt (or bind it to a mouse button like I did) to scan the area and then resuck up stuff. you'll encounter glitches where a shelf or something will still show as blue despite not being able to get any more loot unless you're at a specific angle. Lastly many guns and abilities are pretty useless. The best abilities are mass telekinesis and the shield, the former lets you one shot most basic enemies (on hard mode too) once you can slam them, including every flying enemy, and the ladder makes you invulnerable and can heal you. Freeze takes a while, makes you lose loot when you kill enemies, and has a relatively short range. The polymer requires other abilities and weapons to be useful.. As far as weapons go they are all pretty much the same, really strong against super early basic robots, and useless against tankier robots and the red looking organic mini bosses. except for the melee weapon that shoots out saws, you can melt enemies with this weapon and then be invulnerable by switching between the shield and telekinesis to CC enemies. It is fun for sure still, but by the end there were no good threats and not enough interesting and useful abilities and weapons.Story:Its good! Ending leaves a bit to be desired, but the cut-scenes give a nice break from the combat and I never found my self skipping through it."
5949,JuulJesus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JuulJesus/,1,,1,22.4,February,24,181,0,1,"By far one of the best single player games released in the past few years, that said the game does suffer from a verity of issues. The major issue with the game is the puzzles, these puzzles start out as being very fun and engaging but as you progress deep into the game these puzzles start to feel rushed and no longer pose a serious challenge. Several of the weapons(and their upgrades) that you can unlock trivialize all combat even on the hardest difficulty. From a narrative perspective, this is a truly fantastic game. The story is engaging and the verity of ending are thought provoking. While the combat can be trivialized with certain pieces of equipment, it is still fun and engaging."

5959,K!netic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/,No,,1,14.1,February,24,554,0,1,"It's not as good as you were hoping, but it's still quite a good game. If you're interested in the art, absolutely get it. If you're looking for story, pass. If you're hoping it's gameplay gives a lot of ways to interact with the world, you'll be disappointed but not totally let down. If you're intrigued by it, get it - but don't expect it to be GOTY.I'm one of those weirdos here for the gameplay more than anything else; i wanted something like Prey or Shock2. This absolutely is not it. They clearly love those kinds of games too - with an 0451 homage and loading tips about Gordon Freeman, but it lives up to none of them. Instead, it's strongest as a melee game, with easily the best knock-down dodge-and-strike gameplay you'll find anywhere. The absence of a block button is honestly very refreshing; I think we can all use a bit of a break from perfect parries after hifi and hogwarts this year.The game itself is a sequence of linear levels punctuated by some frustrating open-world segments. But it doesn't have the same tight pacing and careful ""let the user figure out where they have to go"" design of something like half-life - instead leaning heavily on quest markers and some clunky encounter placements that don't obviously telegraph what they expect you to do (am i supposed to clear all four floors of the morgue before going to the door?). Every time i thought i found a neat side-area, it turned out to actually be required, just later in the sequence that i arrived at it.On the other hand, it clearly has shock-like inspirations. Slow, methodical combat, a blend of magic and weaponry to defeat difficult opponents, carefully stepping around cameras. But the magic system is lackluster, taking only faint inspiration from a shock2 OSA build, and leaving all the interesting tools (that even bioshock had) behind. The enemies are spongy, and become more annoying than challenging. The security system is littered everywhere, with only temporary reprieves available. Nor are there really any interesting areas to explore outside the main quest. You go from one room to the next, killing bad guys and putting macguffins into pedestals until the door opens to the next room. There is no creative solution to either your route or your combat, you are a blunt instrument beating your way through the facility.I'd still recommend it to anyone who's interested, it's still fun and good (once fixes are applied and spoken language changed). And I suspect that the art of the game will be unchallenged for years to come, and that some of its gameplay hints will be taken by others (remote looting is super nice). But i doubt many will be coming back to this in ten years the way people do with bioshock."

Firstly although there's regions you can rome around its not a true open world but with that said, developers stated that. Secondly, its stated that there's 25 hours of game play...I've gotten through the entire game in 12 hours and romed all the areas... in total there's like 6 missions that last a while but that's it. Lastly, if you run on high graphic settings, you'll notice the finer details that they skimmed over...a lot of things are pixilated, houses that you cant enter and when you look inside, they're completely empty. With the story (which is amazing) youd think thered be more content but there isnt...its been 2 days and theres nothing left to do in the game. Theres no second play through... once you finish the game...you load is at a point mid-game and it essentially l picks up with the original dialogue. The game has so much potential but it misses the mark but still would play, its fun in general"

6007,ADHDmania,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adhdmania/,1,,1,30.9,February,23,136,0,1,"My rating: 7/10. I barely recommend it.The good are really good, the bad are awfully bad.The good include:1.beautiful graphics and optimization, everything looks sharp and runs smoothly.2.amazing and unique world.  This is an alt universe when the Soviet Union had super advanced technology. It was inspired by Bioshock Infinite in a good way, and it doesn’t conceal it. City floating in the air, high tech equipment, AI and robots.It looks great, it feels great.    3. Great puzzle design. Seriously, this game possibly has the best video game puzzle I ever played,  (although I don’t play many puzzle game) it has various puzzles, some of just a lock puzzle that need you press a button with right timing, some of the puzzles are entire room, you need to change room configuration to solve it. It’s really amazing. It reminds me of The Clockwork Mansion of Dishonored 2.4. Stupid sexy joke made by a refrigerator. Some people hate it, but I find it really funny. The bad include:1.Lackluster Openworld. The openworld has nothing but 8 research sites, basically 8 big puzzle rooms, nothing special to see, to do, to explore,  no fast travel, you have to travel by running or driving a car which has skippy and floaty control. And I can’t even open the map most of the time. There are only 2 occasions I can open the map, one is nearly 80% the game, and one is after I beat the game. Other than that, everytime you press M or whichever button that opens the map, it says “no geolocation data” and it’s blank. WTF.2. Story telling. It starts very strong, but it gets weaker, even weird in the second half, it seems rushed in the latter 30% of the game. The acting in cutscenes is just bad in the latter part of the story. Every twist in the story was all in the last 10% of the game, it was weird,It just feels something is not right.3. As an FPS game, the gunplay isn’t satisfying. Probably because every enemy is a bullet sponge, bullets seem doing nothing to them, they don’t react when getting hit until they die. I know they are robots, but even robots will react to the bullet's impact. It isn’t right. Especially in the Armageddon difficulty,  every gun is piss shooter, And in the earlier game, you are forced to use melee combat only to deal with enemies, and you need to axe the sh1t out of them to kill one while you need to constantly dodge their deadly attack. Not fun, man.In the end, I think Atomic Heart isn’t a FPS shooter game, but more like a FPS puzzle game. It’s not an open world game, it's a linear game with sudo open world.  But Atomic Heart has built an amazing world,  great puzzle design, beautiful graphics and it has decent gameplay time. It took me 20 hours to beat it. So, I think it’s an OK game overall.FYI: If you are completionist, beware, many of its achievements are bugged. You just can’t unlock them."
6008,ActionJaxon,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994007187/,No,,1,1.4,February,23,318,0,1,"This game is amazing. it's Fall Out and System shock's adopted cooler brother. Atomic Heart has been nurtured on a perfect blend of System Shock's dreadfully chilling atmosphere draped in a Soviet era cybernetic Russian aesthetic.  While its Fall Out derivation is seen in the game's unconventional levity and ghoulish humor. Atomic Heart's influences are worn on it's sleeve, you play as a government enforcer sent to apprehend the saboteur of this Soviet  A.I. utopia. Instead, of Shodan you're after Viktor. I choose System shock rather than Bio, because Bioshock games overall premise is of a man trying to escape paradise. The elite try to create a heaven on earth for themselves that falls apart and must be abandoned after being overrun with abominations and depravity. Atomic Heart, and System shock both share the motif that Heaven or Utopia is the threat to mankind, so you aren't trying to escape it, you are trying to destroy it. The presentation of this game is perfect, the signs of destruction and death are graffited throughout every corridor.  Murder haunts the walls of the complex as you make you way through, but it is hued with a 1950-60s Soviet office coating that invokes and amplifies an ominous nostalgia. The dated decor as well as the deceased victims of robotic onslaught keeps the game delicately macabre. The game's nightmarish setting isn't so horrific that it becomes gore, nor to whimsical or immature that it becomes anesthetized. The fear that that grips the air in Atomic Heart is the perfect balance of morbid curiosity and anxious danger.  This is the best fps RPG I have played in a long time. The soundtrack and game's performance also show that art of game direction and sound design are not dead, yet. The game runs beautifully smooth on my PC and the music does an excellent job of immersing you into this world. The use of traditional and synthetic sounds and chords flowing through the music, make for memorable  engagements. I can't really say more about this game, it works on all cylinders and I look forward to playing it more. It is and EZ recommendation."

6010,LuckyS,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197962803052/,No,,1,50.9,February,23,592,0,1,"This game is really good. The dialogue seems bad at first but it really grew on me. Same exact plot as Bioshock to the letter, including your left hand shooting elemental effects, and the dialogue is part of that aesthetic actually and it starts to work as soon as you finish the tutorial. (The entire first indoor section is a tutorial)The game is difficult on normal difficulty, it involves a souls-style dodge mechanic with a hit prompt. If you can't dodge you might not like the game but you can presumably enjoy the ambiance on easy mode.This game is inspired by Tomb Raider (Remake), Bioshock, and Dishonored but it's it's own thing and the best iteration of the gameplay itself in my opinion. The sound track is amazing, and the IDEAS are amazing. Any failure of the specific plot execution can be forgiven entirely by the radio from the future, the sprouts, the neurolink, and the swirling conspiracies.I also really like how the game subverts communism the way bioshock subverted libertarianism. At first I thought this game might be a 7/10 but after finishing the tutorial this game stands alongside bioshock."

This place has gone to hell in a hand basket and it's one of the best kinds. It feels like a modern, narrative driven game (Metro, early Far Cry, Dying Light, etc) with the right story flow, pacing, and writing to make this facility feel more layered than it's underground labs. It's got some of my favorite things:Monster? Yes!Machines? Oh yeah!Military-grade hardware that could threaten the world? You have no idea.Don't fall for the negativity and the haters, this game is honestly great. It's got lots to explore, plenty of mixin' and matchin', and it's got a freaky-ass story that is trippy as hell and very well written (and I'm a snob for good writing). The soundtrack is super cool, but I can't say it's as good as DOOM (because it's also Mick Gordon's work) but hearing some of the Russian classics remixed into the Argent Metal that Mick Gordon and Geoffrey Day are known for is one hell of a whiplash-force, soak-your-chair sweating, zero-point focus soundtrack with that right twist of zesty, bouncy, and sweet Russian Rock/Pop.The enemies are fantastic, from mutant ivy-altered freaks (beware the Plyusch! Seriously...) to the various civilian-designated automatons, nothing ceases to keep me on my toes.Speaking mainly on the company, which mind you are based in Cyprus, a Mediterranean Island (primarily Greek) some distance off of Lebanon. This company has basically no history that I'm aware of and they dropped a bigger bombshell with this A-list quality game than America did in WWII. This company in the middle of basically nowhere (in regards to games and commercial tech, that is) pulled off a better job making this fantastic game than Cracktivision, EA (Eat my A$$), and Goofysoft have in the last half-decade.Despite my praise, I will say that $60 is a tad steep for my taste. I usually judge the worth of a game by the dollar-to-hour, and as of writing this I've completed the game in around 25 hours. Personally, this is a $40-$50 game and like most in it's class is not prone to having plentiful replayability. It's certainly good for a couple playthroughs, as there's lots of lore and whatnot."

The stealth game play is not very good balanced, but one can always use brute force. ;) Pity that one can not play it in the original russian language and with english subtitles. It would fit the tone of the game much better."

Now, a little over 20 hours of play later, I can safely say this is one of the best games to come out in recent memory. What it lacks in length, and I did not 100% the game at the time of writing this, though I plan to soon, Atomic Heart makes up for in an incredibly well optimized performance, interesting story, fun combat, and all of the fun vibes of a nuclear era USSR. Overall I cannot sing enough praises of this game, and I personally recommend playing through with the Russian dialogue, because in my experience the voice acting is a bit better in the native tongue. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece!"

Also either im blind or it isn't present, there is no indication on what an item is when hovered or selected in inventory, so unless you remember each item how they look and what they do, good luck."

I stumbled across a random atomic heart trailer on youtube over 2 years ago and have since anticipated this game. To think that this game actually came out without any false promises is worth praising by itself. If we were to judge by the trailers from a couple of years ago when the game was still in its early development I was honestly expecting more horror aspects instead but that doesn't mean it's terrible.Okay now, let's get straight into the game. there are a lot of things to say about this game.The first thing that you might notice is the unique artstyle of this game. While it might not be everyone's cup of tea I personally find it really amusing, in fact, it was the first thing that caught my interest back when I laid my eyes upon the first trailer I came across on youtube. The artstyle has this funny polished vibe to it. The second thing that I can commend is the combat system of it, it feels flawless and you flow through it very naturally. Certain types of enemies will require a different way of approach and it really makes the strategy fun and not repetitive. Although the weapons progression feels a little out of place, you get some weapons and near the end game and that point you barely get any use of them since you either have focused your upgrades on other weapons or you are already used to the previous weapons.The only major complaint that I think is worth pointing out is the story near the end of the game. They build up this good hype from the beginning until the middle part of the game but the ending is just not satisfying and doesn't make any sense in my opinion. I see a lot of people complaining about the protagonist being too annoying but I don't find it annoying and honestly, at least it's still better than most games. I heard that the DLCs that will be released in the future might serve as a more satisfying story to the base game.At the end of the day, this is definitely one of those games that you need to at least try once in your life so you can look back at your history and go ""Oh hey yeah I remember playing that unique artifact"". As for now, I'll give a rating of 9/10"

Game play is also very good, weapons feel good. Nothing much to nit pick. It also looks amazing! However, This game was being advertised as an NVIDIA RTX Title, but there is no Raytracing to be found in the settings.... No RT Reflections or Even Shadows..... A bit disappointing there. for that it looses some marks.Overall I'd say this game is a solid 9/10"

Get this game on sale, not at full price if you are expecting great narrative. What it lacks in narrative, it keeps you invested through its world building, combat, and intrigue on what lies at the next check point. Gun play and your powers feel great, it was really satisfying lifting enemies up in the air with telekinesis, shooting them, then slamming them back down on the ground. All in all a fun and unique experience."

The ""open world"" parts are pointless. It's the writing that really lets it down, the main character is insufferable action hero ""that has no time for any BS"" and never thinks things through or clearly and just shoves his way past big reveals with the writing equivalent of a middle finger thrown at it. This would be fine if the dialogue wasn't so cringy. It is far more tolerable with russian voice over as the english voice actor just takes you out of the experience entirely sounding so out of place in a 1950s russian science lab.

It's a combination of elements from many of the best shooters of the past 10 years in a Bioshock shell.  The gunplay is good, but could be better.  I do like that it has a big melee element like Condemned and Dying Light.  It seriously reminds me of every FPS ever.  They took a lot of lessons into this game.  The standout feature though is the graphics and world building.  The graphics are outstanding."

When i look back and ask myself did i have fun its a definitive yes"

If you like the game Blacktail, you'll like this too. You have to think through you're combat styles or you'll die a lot. The game is really good looking apart from a few weird textures and the soundtrack is awesome. The plot is nothing special but it provides a great excuse to kill some robots. The weapons are fun and are well balanced. Again, those that complain about them really just suck at life and are short a few marbles in the spatial perception area of their brains.

So far game has been pretty fun. I have encountered a number of minor bugs and one major bug so far. The minor bugs being invisible models (not enemies just items) and minor glitches. The major bug is the overworld map frequently not working for some reason with it thinking I'm still underground even when in a wide open field. A reload is needed to fix it usually.As for gameplay, it's a fun fps shooter in the vein of bioshock but with simpler gameplay systems. The difficulty is a bit all-over-the-place. With the combat starting incredibly difficult at the beginning where a single robot can kill you, then after some upgrades you feel like a demi-god wading through them, then the game throws an elite/boss type at you and you just get annihilated. Once you beat it the game goes back to easymode. In otherwords, there is no challenge in 90% of the levels now, but the bosses it suddenly throws at you without warning will ramp the game up to darksouls-mode for a moment.Oh and weapons are really weird balance-wise. Like the little energy pistol being better than the giant decimator energy machinegun."

I like the combat mechanics, although they take some getting used to. I like the graphics and the style a LOT. Something about the way the robots are animated (some moreso than others) are very pleasing to watch. My only real gripe is the fetch quest-reliance. (spoilers ahead) One set of fetch quests i can tolerate, but when i go from the birch tree fetch quests, to a little bit of open world with 1 boss fight, to ANOTHER set of fetch quests with 1 mini-boss, to where i'm at now. It's a little irritating to say the least, but fortunately the fetch quests are tolerable because the puzzles aren't that hard, if tedious at times, the game play is unique, the lore is pretty interesting, and the game is overall pretty fun. Most notably, there are little to no bugs, and the game is actually really well optimized all things considered. Pleasantly surprised to see game developers release a completed product. 9/10"

The outdoor environment is spectacular and very grandiose. I havent gotten TOO much of the story yet, but I am liking it so far. It starts out fairly fast and there are multiple sub-plots and some subtle, some not so subtle foreshadowing that you have to pay attention not to miss. The other great thing in my opinion is the combat which is what really ties the game together for me. I am finding it pretty fast paced, with lots of options for customisation and some VERY powerful synergies later down the line. The crafting system is kind of meh, nothing too special, but it gets the job done, which is to supply you with ammo which is pretty rare to find in the world in good quantities, and weapon upgrades. One thing that I found disappointing, is the lack of variety in some of the models in game. The most egregious example of this is ""dead solider"" model. Its literally the same model everywhere. Like they are clones. Any dead solider you see is the same guy. Its kind of annoying and at times a bit immersion breaking. That specific model is also bugged, and some times the cadavers wig out, scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me a couple of times. Some of the banter between P-3 and Glove is annoying at times, and I kind of hated the crafting machine introduction...if you know you know. Some people will probably love that, but I can see it being annoying.Overall so far what matters is done well, and the things that are annoying are not really game breaking."

The setting & atmosphere of Atomic Heart is fantastic in my opinion.Some concepts about the game are neat but there is nothing exceptional or groundbreaking about it. The story is okayish but nothing why you would want to play the game for.Gameplay feels a bit clunky at first but is still fun to me and i have a good time playing it.About a technical standpoint there are not all too many bugs for a game at release + performance & optimization is surprisingly really good and it also looks great.So i can recommend it as long you don't have super high expectations.

Just like the real USSR it was complicatedbtw if you don't like the Voice acting just change it to the native russian its turns this game from a 7/10 to a 9/10 for me some fun lore nuggets for you 1. Germany lost ww2 in a single year after invading the ussr thanks to the new soviet technology, they either partly or fully get annex into the ussr along with all of eastern europe. 2.there was no de-stalinization as Molotov one of stalins allies remain in the government and seem to be highly accomplished,more so than our own reality, and there was no sino soviet split as soviet and chinese relations remain high."

It goes hard on its overall themeing and is graphically absurd. However,SPOILERS AHEADThe game played excellently towards its theming and kept itself interesting, and presented many good thoughts that people don't think about like how creating a sentient subservient class does nothing but make the issue larger, as you've now created a new lower class that suffers.It explored the usual issue of the soviet union which is essentially that while communism is a fairly altruistic ideology, the soviet union was majorly dictatorial which essentially lead to despotism and tyranny, and will always suffer from issues like with stalin where people just force themselves into power by any means possible.The game set up all of its things, the polymer containing human consciousnesses, the machines being smarter than people believe, stuff like that. There's so much flavor and lore and hidden things to make the player inference things about the plot and it was nice that the game basically encouraged you to think about things early.Then in the last 10 minutes of the game it establishes that Charles is evil and ♥♥♥♥♥ the bed and gives the player no winning choice, you can't use the device that blocks the kollective in any way it's a plot string that just dies, and the entire plot collapses because your options are ♥♥♥♥ off to the country side and let sheknov take over or charles take over and its just sucks"

Horrible (but tolerable) voice acting? Yes. Full of bugs? Not that I found any personally, but I don't doubt it, so yes. This game has its pros and cons, and I could not put it down. Believe it or not, this game actually made the Soviet Government look bad, no glorifying chants, no belittling America (maybe a little), so that might be an eye opener. It's a blend of Bioshock and some other generic rougue shooter game, you fight enemies, you upgrade your gears and yourself, etc, and just like Bioshock, you get these super powers that are suspiciously like plasmids, and you can carry them two at a time, plus the default electric one. Weapon upgrades are fun, you're almost never run out of materials, as long as you are diligent about collecting them. Melee is a disappointment, the swinging animation resets are too long, it's hard to get consecutive hits in even on a single opponent, so don't even think about mobbing with just melee in this game, despite how cool the protagonist look on the main menu carrying that hammer looking thing over his shoulder. The voice acting is also something you either get used to, or tuned out, after a couple of hours. What I can say is that it's good enough for a game that's made by Russian developers, Overall, I don't regret paying for the full price for this game, and I'll definitely replay it later."

Пожалуй только у 2х главных антагонистов с мотивацией все норм, да и то, только из-за того, что один кукухой поехал. Главный герой истеричка, а в некоторых катсценах поведение ""спец-агента"" напоминает поведение охранника из ашана. Боевка - в самом начале классно, но к середине игры, однообразие надоедает, вообще нет челенджа.Открытый мир - он очень условный, он типа открытый, но на самом деле коридорный. Машины - лучше бы их не вводили, бесполезный кусок хлама, с поломанной физикой, столкновение с гуманоидным роботом или гуманоидом-растением может запустить вас в стратосферу.UPD: А еще, маленький лицензионный плейлист, так что уже к середине игры вы будете ненавидеть Пугачеву и ансамбль Песняры, потому что они будут играть из каждого утюга."

6213,U.S. Waste Facts,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WakeyWakeyEggsAndBakey/,No,,1,47.0,February,23,143,0,1,"Been waiting for this game since it was announced like 3-4 years ago. Maybe even more, I don't remember. It's been so long. When I saw that trailer I knew this was going to be a good game. It isn't right now, but it's going to be. I truly believe this game can be great.But as it currently stands there are kinks that need to be worked out, many bugs. Oh, so many bugs. If I had a dollar for everytime I got softlocked I could afford the Atomic Pass. Fr. The detection of the scanner as well as other things like fall damage or triggers for events are so bugged it's insane. The stealth in this game is very poor. There is very little stealth opportunity. It is either run past everything or kill everything. Also killing everything is a terrible experience because they get resurrected in seconds. There seriously has to be a better game mechanic than repair bots showing up every 10 seconds. They aren't even worth farming because it has diminishing returns. If you got to loot resurrected robots that would be a more acceptable trade but you can't. Also it's just so annoying walking around and being forced to ignore enemies. Because it's like if you engage they'll call reinforcements and that isn't very fun.There's a lot of different melee weapons, so it's very strange the combat isn't very hand to hand oriented and rather fire arm oriented because you have to fight projectile enemies at the same time as melee ones and you can't ignore the melee ones to b-line for the long ranged guys because the melee enemies are tanky and by the time you finish one off they'll have resurrected the long ranged enemy.The movement needs some work. The clipping is the main issue why movement needs more work. You can grab onto ledges that aren't there, as well as scale walls you really shouldn't be able to scale. Enemies cornering you means you get stunlocked and can't escape because your jump is pitiful and your dash won;t allow you to traverse a background prop also blocking you in. The amount of times I get stuck in a wall or the floor is so annoying. Add loot respawns, fix enemy spam, add more stealth options. You move at the same speed as robots when crouched sometimes. It's almost impossible to sneak up on enemies. And some enemies have no silent take down approaches even though they're supposed to so there's that.A lot of bugs.But they'll fix those at some point.No, as it currently stands it isn't worth 60-110 dollars. Wait a year or two for it to go on sale and the DLCs get released. Then we'll have some 60 dollar quality here. Plays like a 45 dollar game tbh."

However, the game is still pretty damn fun and it seems to run pretty well. I think the voice acting is pretty trash and the ""comedic"" aspects of the game are pretty dry, but I have been enjoying just about everything else in the game. The combat is fun (reminds me a bit of Bioshock) and I really love the area designs. Overall, Atomic Heart is a pretty solid game. However, for people who go all out on things like achievement hunting, I'd consider staying away until a patch is released."
6217,Slothability,https://steamcommunity.com/id/slothability/,No,,1,41.8,February,23,157,0,1,"Runs like a champ at 2560x1440, maxed out. 70-80fps+ even without DLSS using a 2080ti.Gameplay is like Prey (bethesda game) mixed with a russian Bioshock's style of art/story/setting.Much like Prey, combat starts off a little slow and basic. You quickly gather up materials to craft/upgrade your weapons, abilities and even your character's movement speed/options. This allows you to take on more enemies at once, adapt to different enemy types on the go (change element damage on weapons) and adds replay value. I'm having a blast trying out different combinations and optimizing my build as I go.Minor complains would be lack of fov slider, hope for ray tracing added later, achievements seem a little buggy, and main character's dialogue is a little too frequent/corny at times. Should have taken more notes on dialogue from Bioshock. There's a time and a place for the character to chime in (or hey, not at all is fine too)!- edit: already mods online for fov, skipping intros, more player storage/inventory space etc. Looking forward to more in that area as well.All in all, pretty impressive debut game from a studio. Looking forward to updates and added content."

It's primarily a puzzle solver (at least as far as the first few hours are concerned - haven't played the whole game yet), with some shooting involved (or stealth, if that's what you prefer).Overall - it's pretty good game. Haven't found any game-breaking bugs yet, which is a rarity these days (what with most AAA games being released in half-arsed state).My major - and only - complaint so far is absolutely terrible voice acting. I'm guessing the main character didn't have any visual help, or even knowledge about the game, so it sounds like he's just reading text off the sheet: no character, no emotions, sounds like a news anchor reciting lines. This seems to always be the case with the games coming out of ex-USSR countries: great technical implementation, but very poor voice acting :("

PERFECTLY, Carl! On PC, Carl!Turn on and get fun, no struggle with bugs, stutters and glitches.Pros: - Gorgeous visual with a lot of stunning details, interesting soviet-technology robot design.- Strong atmosphere- Good optimization, really good optimization. - Robot Ballerinas twins.- Not a bad story with a nice background.Cons:- Clunky melee battle system.- Not all cutscenes look good, some animated really cheap (or looks like it).- Frustrating “never ending” enemies on the openworld. - And personally for me a small number of bosses.Hard to believe, but “Atomic heart”, in my opinion, shows how the AAA-game must look like in 2023.Mundfish, this is an unbelievable job!

The best of both worlds in my opinion. I am really enjoying this game. It's tough going on medium difficulty but there's satisfaction in finding better ways to destroy enemies other than head-on attacks.Doesn't seem to be a way to remap the keyboard/mouse on PC which is holding me back from doing better. I also wish enemies and cameras could be perma-killed. You can't destroy cameras in the underground areas and you can't perma-kill enemies in the outdoor spaces. Edit, still indoors but discovered a way to destroy the cameras. Use the Electro gun. Then, you might have to wait around to destroy any drones that come to repair the camera. The Electro gun is good for that too.Take your time playing this game. There's so much to discover and see. Don't rush through, you'll be missing a lot of the experience if you do."

All i can say is that faults and all i enjoyed pretty much every moment from the stunning environment to bosses getting stuck in walls and cheesing entire encounters with a certain glove upgrade.

6276,|2nd-AD| Liquid,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLiquidMetal/,No,,1,15.9,February,22,321,0,1,"Honestly, I am so glad I picked this game up, I hadn't done any research, or watched any videos about it before hand, but holy cow, this is a ""must play"" title in my opinion! The game gave me a lot of Bioshock Infinite/ Far Cry vibes. I haven't done all of the side content yet, but I did complete the story ( which took about 12 hours ). The setting for this game is insane, the world is beautiful and so detailed, the story was pretty decent until the ending, then the story really picked up and started to shine. The combat system is OK, for me this was one of the weakest points in the game, the guns are very cool looking, but didn't real super great to use, and while melee combat is clearly the highlight, to me it felt very clunky, I found the combat really made me rely on using the abilities which are super cool, but it kind of lead to every fight feeling the same. Stealth is an option I guess, but is very light and wasn't really super useful while playing through the the ""medium"" difficulty. The weakest part of the game is the UI/Menus at the crafting station/store, very basic, and very cumbersome in my opinion, but all of the problems with that are minor and I would imagine not hard to fix.Overall I would not be surprised to see this game in the running for some awards later in the year, and I will simply summarize how I feel about it in 1 word: Breathtaking"

That being said, it seems that a majority of the game's content can be achieved in about 25 hours for most people, and replayability may be low for some. Unless a semi-open world, but still linear, FPS game is something you enjoy specifically, I would recommend getting the game at a lower price if you correlate gametime with cost. If not, have at it, it is an awesome game.Also, one of the Steam tags is ""Sexual Content"" and that is false. Memes are going hard with the twins.The game itself is extremely stylish, with amazing art styles and good sounding dialogue in Russian, but the English is goofy. The gameplay and combat are extremely fun and smooth, with the game awarding high reflex movement. The game on the hardest difficulty is a good challenge as well. Exploration is functionally present, but it isn't the best exploration you can get in a game. There are 8 puzzle dungeons across the map you can access for weapon blueprints, and that is really it.Aside from the puzzle dungeons, the game story is a sequence of going through a large interior, leaving the interior, traveling via the open world to the next interior, and repeat. The story itself is very strange in a good way, with a common theme of power dynamics, backstabbing, manipulation, and corruption, with the dialogue being critical of both communism and capitalism. All in all, I enjoy this game and think it is worth the money to experience the world. 8.5/10"

6289,ahobodude,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ahobodude/,1,,1,23.5,February,22,638,0,1,"by the looks of the game its just another open world game like fallout or deathloop. and the core of the game is. but they do so many things different that it makes it feel entirely unique just from a gameplay perspective. the gathering in the game is actually fun. you dont have long menus of individual items you pick through to get what you want you just hold one button and watch doors fly open and junk come flying at you and you get everything out of them. and stuff automatically goes to storage that you cant hold on you person. The lock picking is so interesting because everytime you get a lock its different. there are a few different types of lock you can pick and it keeps it from feeling monotonous. and theyre all fun puzzles or reaction type minigames to get the locks open.The character and weapon upgrading is a lot of fun and has a no  penalty buy back on skills and weapon components if you decide to break them down for other gear to try out. i still need to try out some of the weapons but i have found a few that are a permanent part of my arsenal. Then there is the open world, which isnt as open as i was expecting, yet anyway, but it is insane. having a system set in to revive all the enemies you kill while youre outside makes it very interesting trying to scavenge and progress. its easy enough to stave them off and get what you want out of buildings but then theyre back and fighting you again moments later. and you can farm kills if there is any reason to in this game but supplies are scarce and not worth wasting so it makes stealth a more helpful option in the game.Be ready for plenty of puzzles. theyre all unique in thier own ways and so far i have enjoyed them all and havent really been stumped on any for too long yet. The mobility in the game and options to jump and dash i have done a lot of exploring and only managed to get my self stuck once. i havent seen many glitches and havent had any crashes. so far im super impressed with the overall quality of the game. there is such a fun pace to the game and so many things to get involved with that it is always exciting and has you on the edge of your seat. the story is also very interesting and tosses a lot of twists and turns at you and keeps you guessing. i cant wait to beat the game and see what all it has in store for me.Edit: I have now beat the game. This was one of the first open world games I've ever played where I ignored everything to beat the story. I was so engulfed in it and curious how it was actually going to play out. I loved it. The ending was very unexpected especially after what builds up in the last few missions. Even with completing the game I only ever ran into one big that stopped me from progressing. Trying to complete a testing facility I had to jump on a platform from out of the water. And when I got onto the platform I fell into it and couldn't move. So I had to reload. Thankfully I didn't lose a lot of progress. But now that I have completed the game I started a new game plus and am attempting to complete all the testing grounds and explore the open world some more. Over all such an amazing game. The only thing that really bothered me about it was how often I heard the phrase crispy critters. Must be a Russian thing I don't understand? But very seriously I can't think of many downsides to the game. The variety of levels and puzzles and mission styles are super interesting. All the boss fights were different and fun and I rarely found myself feeling bored or as if something was super repetitive. The worst part for me was the intro it is pretty long and slightly boring but I even made sure to talk to everyone I could and see everything so I probably could have completed it in half the time if I just rushed it."

There might not be ray tracing right now. Currently I don't want to battle with making a game perform well and wanting ray tracing. Gameplay is pretty fun and the game keeps you moving to big and interesting stuff. Decent melee combat that you compare to dying light or warhammer darktide. So far it's a really decent game and as the price comes down it will probably be 90 plus positive rating. We have 4 more dlcs being added to the game and I am hoping these are all straight gameplay focused dlcs not cosmetic crap or maybe they do rouge lite mode which would be cool. I look at so many other games that try to do what this game is doing and they aren't as fun or interesting. Back 4 blood, farcry and etc. I think is more in line with classic games like half life with it's puzzle design. It's fps fun and I am seeing how you upgrade your character which is awesome because it's simple to understand how you will become a power house the more you get into this game. I preorder this in 2019 and got my picture in the game. I am happy I help fund such an interesting project. I hope that any of the issues people have with main game can be changed for future dlc. They stated that they have ideas for at least 2 more games. Main thing I am looking forward to is new ideas and immersive experiences which this games a really good job with. Can't wait to play more and I hope they give us a field of view option in the first patch."

It is high in price but I recommend buying it on sale unless the future content/dlc validates the price. Minor Cons I hadIn terms of jank there are some odd cutscenes that mess with immersion but besides that everything ran well. Another negative some people will have is some of the humor as well as dialogue; for example the mc uses the phrase ""crispy critters"" an annoyingly frequent amount of times."

To me, it feels like an original game with an original story. I enjoy playing it and it is a lot of fun. The design and aesthetic of the game are something special. The only things I have to complain about are some minor bugs such as when collecting items, when the dialogue gets cut off, the main character has some really lame and annoying dialogue written for him, and the translations of the Russian dialogue are not always accurate with the subtitles or the script does not always show up. So far I have had a lot of fun playing it and the unique world of the game keeps me entertained.Edit: Another issue with the game is that after a certain point where you really get out in the open world, there is no way to clear the maps. Even if you eliminate all the robots they just keep getting revived, so you can't freely explore, given the game's beautiful environment this kind of sucks. Just something to keep in mind in case that is something you're looking for. Something I have noticed that I like is that the game is very well optimized for PC, which is a rare sight but I appreciate it."

The game is ridiculously beautiful too, there's a ton of detail to everything.Indoor linear sections give Bioshock, Prey, and System shock vibes while the outside areas are more akin to exploring in Fallout or driving around in Far-Cry. It's a nice mix of both.Mick Gordon and the other composers killed the OST, so far I've heard chainsaw-like DOOM tracks, bassy and adrenaline pumping electronic tracks, and songs that sound ripped straight out of an 8-bit game with a modern twist to it. Not to mention tons of licensed classical music and jazz tracks that you can't help but nod your head to. My only issue - please add an FOV slider.

If you were expecting a moody and atmospheric game, its in here somewhere, but the dialogue, pacing, and story feel like they are constantly at odds with each other.Now, there's a fork in the road here, you can either let the protagonist wear you down to the point where you have to change the dialogue language to Russian just to emulate a more grounded and serious game.  You will find the gameplay is a little bland and the lore (in the form of interviews and 'audio logs' is lacking a certain sparkor...Roll with the punches. Tonally, this isn't Prey or Bioshock, but we still have those games. This is more of a campy silly game that just so happens to have a golden, million dollar of an idea attached to it.It's so strange, I originally fell into category 1, and was kinda turned off from the game for a while. I then took it at face value, let Charles and my main character grumble the whole way while smashing robots with an ax and treating it more along the lines of Resident Evil 2 with Resident Evil 7's inventory and sensibilities, if that makes sense...There certainly is fun to be had here, but you kind of have to make sure you are looking in the right places. The story is pretty lackluster, but that is balanced out by an incredible world with some truly impressive graphics. It certainly isn't the next big thing, but its fun, plays good, runs absolutely fantastic, and has a lot of good going for it. I won't blame you if you just cannot get over the characters' banter or the bargin bin storyI will say though, having finished the game, the ending is unintentionally horrible and hilarious at the same time.

6348,Kitkat,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067086966/,No,,1,26.2,February,22,84,0,1,"Have not completed the game as of this review, but figured I would post my first impressions about the game.Hardware:CPU 5800X3dGPU 4080 RTXRAM: 32GB @ 3600mhzDrive: SSD 125GBMonitor: 4k 144HzMax settings with little to no issues other than the occasional jump into spot on map shouldn't be on due to tight windows to jump through here and there.Gameplay: I don't necessarily hate the gameplay, but default setup of the abilities/scanning is funky and will not be comfortable to everyone for a FPS layout. The FOV does feel a little limiting, even without a widescreen monitor. The enemies will not wait for you to know where they are before attacking, they will just come at you with nothing but your death on their mind. The fact that cameras are everywhere and constantly repaired as fast as you destroy them (along with everything else) makes exploration difficult to pull off without getting attacked. Plenty of puzzles during the game with a good deal of mixture to keep it from being too dull, but at times little to no direction in solving some of them - more trial and error. The pace is a bit mixed when it comes down to it going back and forth between feeling slow and pressured fast at times. This brings me back to the default layout of keys for the game that can make combat frustrating at times, or even lead to accidentally swapping items when wanting to use them, or even use them when just trying to hit scan. Would highly suggest adjusting this to fit a comfort level for the player over using default settings.Graphics:It is a very beautiful world, and surprisingly well optimized day one which is rare. I am a little disappointed that RTX was dropped before release as that has been one of the biggest teasing points by both the developer and Nvidia for several years, but the use of SSAO is very well done along with rasterization making it hard to really tell. Due to how much is going on in the environment that might also be a good thing when it comes to performance as well. I would still like to see a Ray tracing option in the future, but it isn't game breaking not having it. Story:The story has some issues, which mainly has to do with the main character being more of a brawn and no brains joker with a glove companion that is constantly trying to educate while sowing thought provoking seeds of consideration about the over all premise of the story. As I haven't completed the game yet I can't really say more on this, but there are times I am annoyed by the main character, and times I'm intrigued by the underlying deception within the unfolding story being revealed as I go on.Overall:As of right now I'm over all impressed with the game, but also constantly battling my own frustrations with the pacing and annoyance of the main character. It is apparent that the developers wanted to have a somewhat serious tone in the story, but have the main character be the comedic relief. Sadly the comedy might be getting lost in translation, or is purposely made lower IQ to show that he is just an easy to manipulate pawn in a bigger scheme. Other than that, i would strongly suggest the game, but make sure anyone I do suggest it to know that it is a game that heavily relies on skill and awareness of surroundings else you'll be dying a lot."

(Do it if you want to.)The Bad:The English voices vary in tone and contents, broadly, one moment you sound like a sarcastic teen, then a Duke Nuk'em wannabe.Super transparent plot twists.The Ugly:The puzzles are super simple in almost every case I've encountered, sometimes so much so that it leaves me scratching my head as to why they even bothered with some of them.Overall, I've enjoyed this game immensely and would encourage anyone who is a fan of open world dystopian sci fi to give it a try!"
6354,Epicotters,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198104034880/,1,,1,31.9,February,22,248,0,1,"Atomic Heart has really drawn me in with its fantastic world, the feeling of Soviet Bioshock is quite unique, and the environmental and enemy designs are just fantastic.To begin, the optimization of this game is phenomenal, I play on a gaming laptop and am still able to get a steady 60 FPS with medium-low settings and v-sync on.The gameplay is incredible, with a great balance of combat, puzzles, and exploration/looting. The combat feels particularly satisfying once you start expanding your arsenal and abilities.I only have some minor gripes with the game, the fact that a game can launch in 2023 without an FOV slider is rather shocking to say the least. Additionally, there is some odd audio mixing in certain areas and some minor sound bugs with the soundtrack not playing the correct music in certain areas. However, these are fixable.What's not so fixable is the English voiceovers; they don't really match the tone of the game, great performance, just not my cup of tea. I'd recommend swapping to the Russian voices if you plan on playing this game, it's just far more immersive despite having to read subtitles.I give Atomic Heart a solid 7/10 and probably an 8 when the audio bugs get fixed."

This is a solid game, the progression is exactly the right pace, the ammo and enemies are doled out just right.  The vibe is extremely good, the world is super cool, the art style awesome.  The team came up with some new approaches to staple game concepts like door lock pick minigames, boss fights, alert levels, etc.  The creativity on display is great.Gunplay is super satisfying, the melee is very good, if a small weak point (not a big deal).  Guns are unique and interesting enough, and don't have the complexity of a Destiny/TD2, or even FO4, but its enough for this type of game.   The music, some or all by Mick Gordon, is great, sometimes seems out of place, but I'm expecting a twist to make it make sense.  Definitely a good buy at full price if you're aching for a good adventure that takes you back to Bioshock/System Shock style exploration RPG FPS types.  Definite buy for almost anyone at 50% off."

Happy to say I'm very pleased with this game. Visually it is stunning. Running at max settings with a 3080 at consistent 60 fps. No ray tracing, but with how beautiful the game is you couldn't tell the difference. The game is essentially Soviet Union Bioshock. Unlike BioShock 1 & 2 it goes for a communist utopia instead of a capitalist one. Like Rapture the Soviet Utopia goes tits up. So the game play is essentially like BioShock. Power in left hand, weapon in the right. Semi-open world sandbox levels, but a linear path overall. I 100% recommend this game. For most authentic Soviet experience set voice language to Russian and subtitles to your language. Plus 7 foot tall mommy dommy robots with jiggle physics."

With the feel of something like Bioshock, meets a cross contamination between Metro and Stalker esque style, this game truly is a must have, if not for the fun intuitive way the combat system works, then for the story line alone. P.S. I know alot of people have complained about the corny/horrible voice acting that occurs during this game, personally I believed it added an original take with an original story line that gave me a breath of fresh air.

I have only played a couple of hours but so far, I really like it. It's funny, beautiful and sometimes terrifying. I love the world building so far, the graphics are beautiful but also frightening, even before the robots go off the rails they are pretty creepy. The story is so early that I can't really say what I think about it, except, so far, it's been interesting. I read every sign in the opening area before the game really starts. I read ALL the employee files, some were a lot of fun and there is some meat to the story there. I love how you gain resources, basically point your hand in the direction and hit the interact button. It's like your glove is magnetic and everything is metal. The drawers fly open and the object gets put in your bag. I really dislike games were picking up items and putting them in my bag is a chore. This game makes it fun. I was glad I could rebind ALL the keybinds. Being left handed, often games have something like the home button, delete button, enter button etc that aren't able to be changed.. It makes it difficult to play. I was able to keybind everything.I installed the game and was able to immediately play. So many AAA games I have bought off Steam in the last 2 year require all sorts of tinkering to work.Some people say they really disliked the dialogue. I find it funny. The protagonist reminds me of Duke Nukem. I thought the irreverent dialogue was fun although it would have been better if the English voice actor had a Russian accent. The game pokes fun at both communism and capitalism as well as the Soviet Union. The mechanics are good, melee feels heavy and lumbering with an axe. The ""magic"" abilities are quick and responsive. I didn't have any issues with the mouse acceleration some other reviews said they had while playing. As far as it being a ""Russian"" game, firstly don't blame a group of people who aren't even in Russia but have family there for not blasting Putin. As an American, I don't want to be held responsible for the action's of my government which I often disagree with.. Secondly with the BILLION's being spent on this war, this game is not going to keep the ""war"" machine going. If you think it's an ideological point you are trying to make by bashing it, you better look at a lot of the games you are playing that China has a hand in or other nations you may disagree with... Remember or read if you don't, Ukrainians and Russian's are from the same people's. They only split a relatively short time ago."

It's wayyyyy too small for me. Other than that, I can't think of a single flaw aside from a bug here and there. One of the few development teams to put out a truly finished product.Combat is satisfying and challenging. Everything else gameplay-wise has a fresh/new innovative spin on it to keep things interesting/fresh.. this truly feels like it's own style of game in the way everything is painstakingly designed to be unique and fun. Even the lock minigames are unique in this game.Writing is great, the main character is childish but that's a design choice. Read stuff in emails and listen to audio recordings and you'll find that the quality of the writing is not lacking. Awesome world building with so many details to take in! The characters are super fun (with a certain notable one that is just overall truly ridiculous in the best way possible).The artistic design and aesthetics in this game reach a level I've yet to experience in the medium. The craftmanship and creativity involved at Mundfish is ridiculously impressive.. I am often awe-struck at how things look, behave, and how they interact. This game is literally art (Ken Levine would really dig this game's artistic design). However, unlike other recent attempts at making games that are super artistically impressive, this one does not do so at the expense of including excellent gameplay. as it's just incredibly fun to play. I haven't felt that I could say something like that totally honestly since Half-Life 2.This is probably going to end up being one of my favorite games I've played, right up there with Fallout: New Vegas and Hollow Knight. It's just that kind of quality and truly an experience, at least in my opinion.So far, everything is a 10/10. It's just that good.I still have a lot of game left (I really take my time in the games that I play, and am still in the first area after the intro sequence, with probably around 7 hours of actual gameplay; yes, I tend to leave games running in the background overnight lol so the hours are over-exaggerated as a result) so I'm gonna get back to it. Again, please add in the subtitle/caption font size adjustment option! I hope someone at Mundfish sees this.Also, quick remark: this game's soundtrack is ridiculously good. Super varied, many styles and genres of music, all really well done."

However the team that did the English dubbing did an absolutely horrible job on their end. The protag is the most annoying character i've ever witnessed in my life. He cusses in every sentance and talks way too much, its completely obnoxious and takes away from the game. He talks about everything he is seeing when i can see it myself. Its so unnesessary . The dialouge might be even more cringe than Forspoken. Idk when throwing the F-bomb every other word became cool and funny because its not."

The gameplay and immersive backdrop are amazing and when you throw in all the music theres nothing quite like it. If you think combat is a little slow give it some time.

6427,TonyT,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198408506517/,No,,0,18.2,February,22,86,1,1,"To start off I have to say the graphics were amazing, when you start the game you're shown this beautiful picturesque version of the USSR, greenery everywhere, bright blue skies. The textures look very high quality. I don't think there was a time where I looked at something and thought ""Wow, those textures seem off/ blurry."". The particle effects are also great. Sadly the graphics is where this game starts to drop off.Game play was great for the most part, the boss fights lacked variety, the story was okay, what really held back most of the game was either the bad writing/ bad translation. Conversations felt stale, off, and at times it was humorous with the pauses/ cut offs. I enjoyed the gun play, I felt like there were too many melee weapons. Not enough projectiles and the looting system is kinda weird. I went the whole play through without weapons sights and some upgrades because they're hidden within levels. Further in traversing the ""open world"" gets a bit stale. I would run past all the POI's and head straight to the objective.Now the real kicker and the reason I edited my review was the selection of endings. Without spoiling too much you get 2 endings. This absolutely infuriated me, the endings felt rushed and much more to be wanted. Not only did I also get sent back to the menu after beating the game but the closest save before picking which ending was an hour before which I wasn't doing all over again.This game is decent for a first time play through but has almost no replay value. The story is decent up until the ending where they absolutely fumbled the endings. I hope they add a few more endings that would actually satisfy most players. They tried pulling a Cyberpunk but at least with Cyberpunk the endings could be seen as a bitter sweet where as these felt lazy.Overall, I give it a 6.5 out of 10. If you're starving for a new AAA title with amazing graphics and decent gun play than have at it. If not than wait until this game drops to $30-$40 and play it then."

It has an engaging story, excellent visuals, and entertaining gameplay that is not overly complicated or difficult to use on a PC with mouse and keyboard.  The soundtrack is superb.  This is one of the few games where I left the music on as it's that good.

It does have somewhat decent story but the pacing is terrible. Second up, for those reviews saying the combat is generic and one size fits all, I must say.. You are absolutely wrong. You can even use a bucket in this game to destroy enemies. Want to mow down a group of enemies with your car while it has cryo freeze bumper? You can do that. The price is a bit steep.. not worth full price to be quite frank. But if you're buying it for a hell of a time, good music and good combat? I recommend atomic heart.  It's basically mini bioshock. Ps: The voice acting can be a bit bleh."
6441,Noodle_Man,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Noodle_Bro2007/,No,,1,13.0,February,22,67,0,1,Atomic Heart ReviewAtomic Heart takes place in an alternate version of the USSR. The USSR has had a technological boom and robots have been made en masse to serve the populace. Eventually the robots go rogue and plunges the USSR into chaos. You play as P-3 a soldiers who's job is to find out what happened and stop it. The game has unique locations each with a ton of detail and care put into them. The weapons all feel good to use and combat is fun and engaging. Ammo at the beginning is scarce so prioritizing what enemies should be shot or smacked are up to you. Once you get a gun do not abandon your melee weapon as melee combat is very important to the core of Atomic Hearts gameplay. You also have a glove named Charles to help you in combat. Using an item called Polymer the player can fire a wide variety of attacks from the glove such as bolts of electricity or streams of ice. These attacks are meant to compliment your gunplay rather then outright replace your weaponry. They can also be used to interact with certain objects in the environment. The voice acting isn't outstanding but there are pretty entertaining moments. The soundtrack is also really nice. A mix of metal and Russian music. This game takes a lot of inspiration from the BioShock franchise but still is able to make an identity for itself.

6505,West Taiwan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/emrickgj/,4,,0,7.8,February,22,522,2,1,"I'm going to have to give it a no, because fundamentally the game isn't really that great. The performance is good, way better than most recent releases, and the story/setting is very interesting... it even has the Soviet Soda machines. Little things here and there are really interesting to see, especially since ""AAA"" quality games in the soviet era are rare, so it's neat at least in that regard. I have had a few bugs that have caused the game to crash or restart a save already within 4 hours as well, which will probably be easy patches in the near future. NO FOV SLIDERS.The English voice acting though is really bad. And they talk constantly, as much if not more than a game like High on Life. They just won't shut up and it's so bad you can't listen to audio logs in the game unless you just want to sit and wait in one spot, because they will most certainly interrupt you to say something meaningless in the next 30 seconds if you try to play the game at all.The combat is very unbalanced. Not that single player games need to be balanced, but you can very easily have an OP build within an hour that stun locks every enemy you come across making fights very boring. If you try to fight them normally, enemies are very spongey and take lots of damage, and doesn't feel great fighting them as you don't really get interesting ""feedback"" when hitting them.The melee combat isn't great either. It really needed something like a block/parry system, instead all you do here is spam dodge whenever you see an orange indicator and hit them 4-5 times per enemy to kill them. Feels pointless when the glove abilities can overpower literally anything and the guns like the shot gun can one tap most of the easier enemies (who take several hits).It's not the worst game in the world. But if you aren't interested in the Soviet setting/story and just want a game for the actual gameplay, this is very subpar."

You have to get into it but i am sure everyone could manage that in the first 2-3 hours.I can't say much about the story because of obvious reasons but i personally have alot of questions about this world that i want to answer.

The story is thoroughly entertaining and engrossing, and the visuals are some of the best I've seen in gaming (save for a few minor visual bugs like texture pop in and seeing robots on the ground for a split second before they drop down). I'm surprised that my PC can even run the game, quite honestly. Also, for a game that takes place in Russia, it is slightly disappointing to hear very few people with Russian accents. Most people have American or British accents and it is a tiny bit odd coming from citizens of Soviet-era Russia XD. Aside from that, I can't think of any major thing that I dislike about this game. I will say that I'm not a fan of the multiple edition pricing scheme. (but that's not solely an issue with Mundfish, rather the gaming industry as a whole.)  For Mundfish's first release, they blew it out of the park and I eagerly await their future content."
6560,Brooklyn,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020223476/,2,,1,1.9,February,22,141,0,1,"This game has a unique story, unique mechanics in terms of gathering supplies from your surrounding environment, lock picking, and combat styles. However, the gathering mechanic somewhat diminishes the joy of finding something and looting it, because you're essentially 'hoovering' your surrounding of whatever you might find. The story is a bit abrupt in the beginning, and I personally didn't find it compelling enough to really get into it. All enemies have similar appearances, and that can be a bit boring. This game has similar features you might expect from other games in the same genre, so the only thing that would have kept me interested would've been the story / writing and the acting, and maybe a robust crafting/looting component. Looting and crafting is a little lacking in this game, but I would still have kept the game if it weren't for the dialogue - the voice acting is fine, but the writing is really awful, and there's too much of it to ignore. Still, the game is pretty and it is enjoyable if not for the dialogue - I would maybe buy it on sale."

More importan DOES NOT HAVE FOV SELECTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!update 1: in the open world area you will lost a lot of FPS update 2: 4 game Crash and 2 blue screenUPDATE 3: dont pay 60$ for it, in the end after hours playing the game is not good in anything and have too much problems Sadly :(update 4: after 1 week and ONLY 2 tiny update the game dont crash game.. so far and the 165 FPS inside building or dungeon still no enough"
6562,PRC-150,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198304452289/,No,,1,27.1,February,22,124,0,1,"So far this game is far better than expected! (Just based off all recent releases that have been a dumpster fire) The game itself has a old feeling that I enjoy but brings a new spice too. The combat is pretty straight forward with dodging and the whole game seems like a mix of Bio shock and Dying Light. I also mention dying light because this game has a similar ability and character upgrade system much like dying lights tech tree. Bio Shock is pretty obvious as it has the same future driven world that you see here but with a big leap regarding graphics and cinematic improvement. I recommend this game to anyone who likes gore, mutants/zombies, robots and, a little horror!Only slight downside is the story seems pretty easy to figure out already and just a cliche plot line but I don't really mind as all the other points I made makes this new experience very distracting and fun.EDIT:I finished the game and I have to say this was a nice refreshing game there is a bunch of combat and there isn't really a lot of that Destiny (the game) feeling to it where you just scan and listen, there is a ton of interactive content and stuff to do like explore the world. I would like to say the ending left me with a bunch of questions but it was very well pieced together and I hope they make a DLC or something because I want to know what happens after these alternate endings and you are left without much detail on what happens my rating would have to be a 7 or 8/10"

It does have some aspect that comes close to that, just not much, so i am a bit disappointed.There are also some cut content it seems, looking back at some of the teaser, there are things i am looking forward to that isn't in the game, again, i am dissapointed.However, the gameplay is fun as hell, i enjoyed all the mechanic they are offering in this game (The looting system is convenient, probably one of the best i've seen in video game). The material to craft is also not too scarce, and not too frequent, it's just balanced.Also don't play the game on the hardest difficulty like me, as the enemy can be REALLY BULLET SPONGE as hell. I think the best difficulty to enjoy this game would be Normal.Also, the music's are absolute banger, they really didn't have to go that hard over the music in  but they did.So overall, the game is worth enough to buy, maybe on sale, but me personally on full price. Aside all the cons in this game, the pros surely can cover them up.Also, spoiler :"

Highly unbalanced.- No Tooltips to tell you whats what in your Storage Inventory Items and such. I have something in my inventory that looks like a grenade yet I have no idea what the hell it is until I waste and try to use it or attempt to create it or just try to dismantle it.- Sprinting is kinda permanent and overly fast, it just feels weird, tolerable and different but weird.- The Crafting System is a bit of a mess and trying to get enough loot to craft items just doesn't feel like it is enough, I find myself barely getting enough loot for bullets unless I spent a lot of time just grinding enemies. - Weapon Upgrades are confusing AF, I have no idea what exactly I need to upgrade stuff, its just not obvious nor very clear enough when looking at upgrades for weapons etc to install.- A lot of the time during combat I find myself occasionally getting thrown into a group of objects in the environment that caused me to get stuck or not enough room to focus on the fight because of it which is rather frustrating because there's so many damn meshes in the way. The enemy seems to easily maneuver around and through these objects unfairly but doing this with the player character is not simple nor cohesive whatsoever and either forces you to become a sitting duck that is stuck with a hard time fighting back which almost got me killed on several several times if I didn't keep mashing down the jump button 500 times to get around and through meshes to an open enough area to fight back decently.- Trying to understand the Hawk System etc is rather confusing even though explained, same with the Secret Vaults, like I am really going to even remember all of that.- The Game Map isn't really marked that well unless you hover over things and can be confusing.- Issues with Crafting Window, sometimes the upgrade/install button and ui area will be slightly off the screen to the right making it difficult to know what you're doing with it.- Sneaking System is utterly useless and fails 9 times out of 10 when attempting to sneak quietly past large amounts of enemies in certain areas so you may as well just not even bother with any of it and just go in guns blazing with a plan to destroy everything in your path.- Safe Rooms being Safe my foot! Very broken! In the beginning when you reach the very first Save/Save Room it tells you that you are safe in the room but later on this is entirely untrue and the game is very broken because somehow I have had enemies chase me and enter these rooms therefore they are not safe for saving at all.= VERDICT = ============= Atomic Heart is an atomically astounding game in nearly and it is exactly what we needed in almost every way. It's riveting, interesting, and fun to play and definitely delivers. It is certainly worth the wait and now that it is here I am happy to be playing it. Additionally, be advised there are some false claims saying this is Bioshock 4, this IS NOT Bioshock and it is a completely different game. This game may share some similarities is more of a mix of Bioshock + Far Cry gone wrong, taken over by robot which then threw throws you into a different timeline within a Futuristically Historical Soviet Union Era."

6619,TheFantasticFox,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198845115339/,No,1,1,34.1,February,21,92,0,1,Love the game. Overall 9/10. There seems to be an issue with there being no FOV slider for some people but it doesn't bother me as my issue was fixed by turning off motion blur and reducing camera shake to .2 but the Devs plan to fix this with the next update so no big deal. Dialogue can seem a bit robotic at some points but I'm guessing its chalked up to originally being in Russian (I think) and I quickly grew used to it and even enjoyed hearing the main character make his quips. Only with issue I have with enemies are the repair robots. Abominations they are. Especially once you get outside. As for difficulty its not too hard with the hardest difficulty being somewhat challenging. Still leaves much to be desired for people who want to experience pain. So far I've encountered little to no bugs but I'd expect nothing less for a game that's been developing for 7 years. Another nice thing is for certain areas where you have to defend (notably with the sprouts) you can prepare ahead of time to make the defending easier. (getting rid of the bodies in the area so they can't assimilate them) It also seems there are multiple ways to go about completing objectives as (minor spoiler) when you collect the canisters for the tree to leave the facility you can (at least for the pesticide one) chose 2 ways of going about it. Also side note on that. I did both of them (on accident) but it seems that the game didn't realize that and it completely skipped the Cold lab one and allowed my to place the second one as the cold sample. Its also interesting to talk to the dead people too. My favorite one is the guy in hall who tells you how to robots positioned themselves behind people at their desks. He says goodbye :) most other don't. Now for the important part. The story. The game is single player only so it better have a good story. So far the story is engaging. The chirpers (audio logs) and pears(I think that's there name) tell stories about the life in the facility and how there were strange occurrences that built up to where you are when you arrive as well as providing some hints on the bigger picture. I cant say too much on the main line as I just got out of the underground part but it definitely has me hooked.

Far too much western, typical BS has plagued our screens for too long. Its refreshing to see a game out of Russia with cultural features of that country, in both design and detail. I have an extremely smooth experience so far.  No shader stutters and only encountered one bug (game crashed).Three hours in so far and the game is great. Feels good to play. Its not easy, it has a sense of humour and some very quirky dialogue (The upgrade machine) to which i found funny... remember, games are aloud to be fun/rude and silly....makes a person smile and that makes a person feel good. Humour is fading due to all  this WOKE crap and yet humour is an incredible thing. I felt pleased to write a review after three hours as i was taken back to games like Bioshock, Metro and Wolfenstein..... Atomic Heart has so much going for it....and like any game there will be weaker parts but its captured me from the  off due to the atmosphere and artistic design of the world and enemies within the world.   I paid £36 for my copy.....no complaints at all..... can not wait to play more when time allows.   This game deserves credit for many things....and its great to see games like this that tread away from the western rinse and repeat designs of AAA games."

I was disciplined and didn't watch any gameplay footage or read anything online about the game prior to its release, so by doing that its only enhanced the element of surprise when playing the game for the first time.  To put it shortly, the lore is interesting and the world is intriguing.  Combat doesn't feel clunky, weapons have a sense of heft and aesthetic damage is satisfying.  Skill tree per usual with these types of games, choose a path that best suits your play style and enjoy!  Unlike some of these other ""review enthusiasts"" out there, I prefer to keep things as plain Jane as could be...the game was worth pre-order, I believe at the time of my review I maybe have 4-6hrs logged in and I am thoroughly pleased.  A solid 8/10 rating MINIMUM.  I'm positive performance patches will be released in the near future (not that the game needs them in its current state - at least for me), just go ahead and buy the game if you're on the fence!Updated Review:I believe I have about 24hrs total into the game at this point in my updated review, I have a couple reasons why I have to decrease my total rating so here goes:1) The main protagonist is honestly annoying.  When first starting the game I was interested and enjoyed the conversations with your ""ability glove"" and whomever you encountered as you progressed...but over time everything started to become heavy on the ears, and almost exhausting to fully pay attention to.  ""Crispy critters?""  Let's just say I never want to hear that line again...2) The game makes jokes about how tedious modern gaming has become with objective completion, ONLY TO THEN MAKE YOU PERFORM TEDIOUS OBJECTIVES...Some examples include find 4 birch tree batteries, locate a train ticket, the Darwin test, and find all of Claire's missing parts...all of these missions could have been thoughtfully recreated or made less a burden for the player by adding RPG elements such as chat dialogue options only accessible depending on your ""skill"" - AS IN - Intimidate, bribery, hell add in a glove ability that's basically the same as ""force persuasion"" SOMETHING FOR GOD'S SAKE - Don't have the protagonist make in-game jokes about how monotonous objectives are, only to then have players actually go and perform them in order to progress?  Wtf...3) Abilities? - exactly that...what about them?  Guys all I'm going to say is there's nothing special about the in-game abilities which we haven't already seen before in previous video games....And guess what's funny about this particular complaint?   If you take away the ""abilities"", the game is basically just another FPS...What makes ""bioshock-like"" games intriguing IS THE ABILITIES...This game doesn't create anything unique or new that we haven't seen before.  Shock?  Telekinesis? FREEZE??? c'mon, at this point games like this need to come up with entirely new and ""never before seen"" abilities - I mean this is a game based on robots, and you don't even have a ""hack"" ability - THAT SHOULD SAY SOMETHING......My honest and final review <insert drumroll>........6.5/ 7 out of 10"

Great visuals, running well on my RTX 4090 max settings, 4K and 120fps. Audio (aside from the VO) is really good as well in a quirky sense. I really love the refrigerator upgrade station.

6646,Puma,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PUwUma/,1,,1,12.2,February,21,548,0,1,Just over the 6 hour mark and I’ve been enjoying the game. Am I experiencing the same “problems” as everyone else? Yes and no. The whole thing with mouse acceleration I can’t really notice all that much and I’ve gotten used to within the first hour of playing. The headache from the FOV being too low is also a problem but nothing a patch can’t fix. So far no major bugs besides the collection mechanic being a bit finicky at times. No crashes. And the game runs about 70-85 FPS on high settings (motion blur off and DLSS on balanced) on a Ryzen 7 5800X and RTX 3060. Very well optimized for launch and I’m guessing they’ll make it better with time! Been having a blast with the game besides the enemies having WAY too much health in the open world. I think they should be toned back a bit on the “normal” difficulty as they do seem a bit tanky and tedious at times. Again something a patch can fix. Looking forward to the rest of the game!

I enjoy the combat and the special abilities, that's a lot of fun. and the puzzles are enjoyable, It's not the best game in the world but frankly I enjoy myself in the moments where I actually get to use all the gun mods and abilities. But I do have my complaints about the game There have been several moments where I get stuck with collision glitches, other times there's issues with getting stuck in a corner and getting the sh#t smacked out of you, and then there's the platforming. These things in my opinion kind of make the game play more unenjoyable. Also there's So. Much. Dialogue. that doesn't give you time to think. Going for speed, in a span of an hour, you'll probably have no more than a minute without the characters waxing on about story beats and sarcasm. Not the best, but one of the better big releases in the first quarter of 2023"

From the performance with DLSS to the Top Notch Art Direction it is clear that Mundfish had a strong idea for Atomic Heart. Also I am pleased to let you all know the combat is overall satisfying and gritty. Some weapons don't hit quite as hard as I would like in the audio department and the spin attack from the axe is utterly useless aand is only made worse from the fact that the fov is locked. With a proper mod, the Fov can be fixed... but that does NOT excuse why it should be locked and not available to change. Everything listed here in terms of gameplay I (mostly love).... however....The Story is generic at best unfortunately, being able to predict what is gonna happen. Not Horrible ... not Great either...The writing... is an absolute travesty, besides Granny and p3's glove there is nothing but mundane verging on grating writing. P3 as a main character you play has to be the worst. It's not even the voice actors as you can only give them as much as they can work with. It almost feels like punishment at times having to be a absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.To note... If Mundfish want to come out swinging on all cylinders with their next title, get some competent writers... cause my god sometimes I want to peel my ears off from my head.I have much to explore and play and the review could change but as of now, it's a solid 7.5.I would rank higher but with a story I don't care for  and being a ♥♥♥♥ head while going through that story does not help. If you are interested in the fantastic Wolfenstein/ Bioshock/ Fall Out art direction which permeates throughout this world aswell as some pretty satisfying game play, I'd give this a shot. There is something special here... but it unfortunately has been covered by verbal diarrhea, it just depends on if you can get passed that."

The only thing that i don't like is the lack of a FOV slider. This is a must play and even with some of the small minor bugs, its still a very enjoyable experience and nothing is ruined.Also the big booty robo-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are a good incentive to buy it."
6698,MORTOS,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963281303/,No,,1,9.2,February,21,700,0,1,Great so far. It's definitely in the tradition of Bioshock or Prey with the style of gameplay. Gives Half Life and ESPECIALLY Singulary vibes what with the power glove and alternate old timey Russia. Zero performance issues for me thus far.
6699,Script Kiddie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/3232195/,No,,1,19.4,February,21,252,0,1,"Really enjoy the game so far. However, there are some things I am taking issue with:- The game can be punishing by throwing you into a small area that is swarmed with enemies.- The looting mechanic is tedious at best and hard to get used to. - Using polymers is basically useless early on in the game and often just serve to piss off enemies. - Dropped frames left and right even when running with a RTX 4090. - Game really just throws you into the story with little into. Really threw me for a loop.For the things I like:- The story thus far has been great. - The visuals are incredible.- I know a lot of people say this copies Bioshock and other titles. Maybe some aspects were influential but it's refreshing to have a game that's original. - The character dialogue in English is very amusing even when it might not be aiming for it. Overall 8/10."

Combat serves a good challenge and character physics feel great, love the quick-time dodging personally. Everything has been accurate to the trailers. There's even something charming about the dialogue not taking itself completely seriously that I thought I would hate but, have ended up loving and straight-up laughed out loud meeting the horny vending machine XD.Running on an RTX 4090 + 5900X and it's really smooth; 240+ FPS with frame gen, dlss quality and max settings at 4K in a lot of areas. So great to see when other games recently haven't held up to the standard of using that kind of GPU power properly and feels a lot like Doom Eternal to me at times, while being something as unique as, dare I say, Half Life while still drawing inspiration from games like Bioshock but, in a different way that I haven't seen anything like. I absolutely love this game so far!!!Only negatives are the lack of FoV slider and RT/HDR (Auto HDR seems to help though) but, time will tell if these are patch-limited complaints and really don't detract from it for me at all as it's gorgeous to look at anyways."
6709,FIIZiK_,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FIIZiK_/,No,,1,1.0,February,21,225,0,1,"Let me say that the game runs BEAUTIFULLY, no stutters at all, maxed out in 6K resolution with DLSS Frame Generation with 100-220 FPS (Depending on the area).First game in a long time that runs well on day 1, The Callisto Protocol, Dead Space Remake, Returnal, Howgards Legacy all had crazy stutters and issues.The game must be commended for this. Although, there is mouse smoothing enabled by default (not a big deal imo, this is not a competitive MP FPS) and the FOV is quite bad (flawless widescreen adds +30%, so use it). Outside of that, the port is great, amazing visuals and it has FSR, DLSS, DLAA, Frame Generation and Nvidia Reflex. RTX as they mentioned 2 days ago, will not be available until they release a patch later.The fact people complain about stuff like ""bad textures for trees"" or ""bad dialog"" is crazy to me and it's simply nitpicking. The game is funny, it has that eastern european humour + a lot of swearing, so it's not for everyone, but I find it funny, the good funny. People complaining about this then go to play GTA V and think the humour there ""is good"".As for the gameplay, it is similar to Prey and Cyberpunk 2077 in feel (more like Prey actually, better feeling that CP2077 imo). I think it's great. You are supposed to use a huge arsenal to kill different robots by using some form of strategy as they take quite a lot of hits. It's not a power fantasy like other games. Imo the enemy HP feels similar to System Shock. The melee also feels like Dying Light. The same people complaining about the combat here then go and enjoy Dying Light combat.The people complaining about ""no running button"" are also insane. The character moves almost as fast as Doomguy in Eternal, and has the same dodge mechanic as Doom Eternal or Cyberpunk 2077. It's good speed imo.Very unique game and setting, crazy soundtrack created by Mick Gordon. Can't comment fully on the story as I have played little, but it's a great start."

I pre-ordered the platinum version of Atomic Heart a few days before release, shortly there after I heard that the game was sub par and that the frame rate was unreliable. I can say that this is far from the truth. I have been playing this game all night and it has been one of the most visually beautiful games I have ever played. I quite enjoy the combat system, and really appreciate the crafting and upgrading systems. All of the enemies were very eye catching. The environments were outstanding. Unfortunately I cannot say much on the story line as I have only played for three and a half hours, although, from what I have played so far I can say I really like it. The art in this game is incredible. The attention to detail is outstanding. To sum up my opinion of the game, I think Atomic Heart is going to be one of the best games of  this decade, comparable to titles like Fallout 4 and NV. If you do not have this game I highly recommend that you get it."

6729,Crow,https://steamcommunity.com/id/chaotikcrow/,No,,0,24.0,February,21,236,0,1,"Atomic Heart is broken. I've tried for like two hours trying to open the doors of the testing ground 8 and there's nothing I can do. I even followed guides on the net to see how they do it and it doesn't work for me. So since I can't get the blueprints I don't feel like playing anymore, it's so freaking frustrating having to fight bots after bots again without being able to shoot down these cameras for good so that you can have a break! The moment you destroy a robot, seconds later it gets repaired by those blue drones, and there's ABSOLUTELY NOTHING you can do to destroy them permanently, even if you destroy the blue drones there's going to be like four more that will come shortly after. I have no idea what the devs were thinking when they decided to keep this in the game. Don't get me started with the stealth mechanic, it's terrible, don't bother.Some people complained that they were running out of ammo and I didn't have that issue, I've only used my guns only when I needed to on hard difficulty and it was fine. I was playing it like it was a survival horror game, so no complaints there. It's not because I find the game difficult, it's just unfair and badly designed. I'm very good at video games and I love challenges, but this is too much. No joke, all you do in this game is running away from enemies since that's the only way you can make them stop following you. Where's the fun in that?The trailer that you've seen four years ago is a totally different game, some of the enemies ain't in the game, the style has changed a bit, it doesn't feel like Bioshock or System Shock, it's like they mixed it with something else. The combat is quite fun when it works, the leveling system is meh, I don't feel any stronger unless I increase the damage of my weapons. When it comes to the character and glove and the super powers, it's pretty disappointing. English Dub is pretty bad, so play it in Russian.There's been a few little bugs, but the game is well optimized though.The puzzles are pretty lame and easy, even the main character kept making jokes about how he's so tired of solving puzzles. I don't blame him, it gets boring quickly. There's like four types of puzzles. There's one that you have to lockpick a lock, one that you have to snap your fingers at the right time, another one is with lasers, and lastly moving a ball through transparent tubes. So the puzzles are pretty bad and it only makes the game worse, in my opinion.Being able to upgrade your guns and melee weapons is fun, especially finding the blueprints (when you're able to.) But again, why upgrade if it's all for nothing in the end? As I've said you cannot destroy those robots when you're outside, so it feels pointless.The music is very good, there's one part in the game that when you're fighting the robots outside you can listen to some Russian music with some metal, composed by the great Mick Gordon, the guy who did the soundtrack of the newest doom games. Here's what I am talking about: The music is good.The protagonist and the glove they constantly talk and they never shut up, if you're like me who doesn't like it when you play as someone who talks all the time, you can skip this one. I never once thought that their conversation was interesting. What I also didn't liked about it is you can't just listen while exploring, because if you continue walking around and there's a part where the glove have to say something in that section that you are in, what you were listening to will just stop, and you won't be able to hear it back again.The graphics and the art style is just perfect, sure this ain't the most beautiful game I've ever played but it ain't ugly either. It is running with the Unreal Engine 4 and it looks like a game that came out around 2020. There were many places that I had to stop and look around for how beautiful it was.If they can somehow patch it and fix it, they I would say it's worth to check out."

Considering how often the release of AAA games can be disastrous (i.e. glitches, clipping, texture pop-in, frame drops, etc.), I'd say Atomic Heart outclasses most, and that's no small feat considering how long we've had to wait for this game to drop.

The window is cropped to fit an ultrawide monitor, not extended. This was the case with Back4Blood for a long time to. And since there's no FOV adjustment, the game window will feel very cramped. It's playable (to me, anyways), but if that kind of stuff bugs you, stay away until a community fix or ACTUAL ULTRAWIDE SUPPORT is implemented.

Gives me NOLF2 vibes with map design and a heaping helping of an original take on gameplay/atmosphere elements from Bioshock and Half Life 2. Atmosphere is off the charts from mentioned titles, whole other league. Extensive weapon upgrade system, varied skill tree, satisfying looting and crafting system. Enemies are not tanky or bullet spongy they are just difficult and not fodder. You wanna take full advantage of timing fully charged swings (which allows you to hold it and release). You wanna avoid setting off alarms and engaging different types together early game. The anamotrons in the early game are creepy because of how they jog at you and you have to judge when they are gonna lunge at you while you fully charge a heavy attack while back peddling. Really fun and tense and thats just the starter enemies. Five years worth the wait"

6812,Michiru Gaming,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tanookigaming/,No,,1,19.1,February,21,427,0,1,"Before I begin this review I'm gonna start off by saying I'm going to be doing a lot of comparisons to the Bioshock series, the reason being is that I was always interested in the game for it's Bioshock like approach. So sorry for the constant comparisons lmfao. I've been waiting for a Bioshock like game for many many years, while Bioshock Infinite had it's moments I felt that the game didn't live up both story and gameplay wise to the first two games (especially the first one) when first showed off 6 years ago, Atomic Heart looked as if it would fulfill the promise of giving us a unique and new experience while maintaining the feeling of the first two Bioshock games both gameplay and setting wise. Having just started playing, I can say so far that gameplay and setting wise it has succeeded in the department of my want for a Bioshock like for many years. Atomic Heart looks absolutely stunning, when you are first introduced into the game, you are immediately left with the awe and wonder you had when first arriving in Rapture in Bioshock 1. Atomic Heart goes even a step further with it's incredible art direction that gives it it's own unique identity, the setting, world, characters, enemies are all very very strange and weird and honestly, I can't get enough of it. The open world isn't Rockstar games or even Bethesda massive but it's still quiet the map to explore and discover new awesome locations and get new items and powerups. Atomic Heart also takes inspiration from other titles released in order to give it it's own unique identity. Inspirations include Half-Life, DOOM, Fallout, Cyberpunk 2077 and much more. It really adds much more gameplay and setting wise and I'm glad for these inspirations, it doesn't make Atomic Heart a carbon copy of Bioshock at all. The music in the game is very much worth the hype, Mick Gordon's rocking music playing while fighting giant Robot bosses add's the same experience and adrenaline you get when playing Doom 2016 and Eternal. This game is not perfect however. While I am having an absolute blast, I don't think I'm going to hold it in the same vein as I hold Bioshock 1 or heck even Bioshock 2's incredible story DLC Minerva's Den. From how long I've played, first off a major issue I have is that your protagonist Major P-3 will not. shut. the. ♥♥♥♥. up. I do not know what it is with recently released games lately having protagonists who do not just keep their mouths shut for 5 minutes. Bioshock 1 and 2 had the mercy of silent protagonists, which made the experience much better both setting and story wise. You really took Rapture in for yourself because besides grunts and screams of injury and pain, your protagonist is basically silent throughout the game. Major P-3 could take notes from Jack and Subject Delta because I'd love this game's story more if he would just stop with the constant quips and action movie lines. Bioshock Infinite was a disappointment for me back then for many reasons, and one of them was that Booker and Elizabeth really took away the experience of exploring Columbia. Atomic Heart's gameplay and experimentation don't make the same mistake Infinite made however, which really saved it's ass. Also I think playing in Russian with English subtitles is the way to go since I'm not very impressed with the English voice cast. It's not terrible but characters (especially P-3) don't sound....the best and honestly with all of P-3's annoying quips, for me it's better if the game was only spoken in Russian. Gunplay and the powerups you get feel good, however melee combat is very very slow and sluggish I feel. I don't get the same satisfying impact as hitting an enemy with the wrench in Bioshock 1 or especially the drill in Bioshock 2, even when you do upgrade, I still feel like P-3 swings line a slug. So far I'm hardly ever using melee combat, only as a last result. While the game sure does have detail you'll notice that it also skips important detail you'd expect from modern day games, it's strange that the environment hardly reacts to my combat, you'll have balloons in the game that will not pop when you swing your sharp ax or shoot them and it's kind of awkward. It doesn't ruin the game overall. Overall, Atomic Heart is an incredibly ambitious game that gets many things right but also stumbles on a few things. It does not however, ruin my experience and fun I've been having with the game but it might for others. It's honestly pretty impressive that this brand-new studio's first game is something this ambitious and it turned out pretty well. Not groundbreaking but having a game this scale and this impressive for a first ever game? That's a good sign I feel. If Mundfish listens to feedback and improves, their next projects could really be something special and even memorable I think. If you're a die hard Bioshock fan and have been waiting for a Bioshock game for years, this is definitely enough to give you a fix. If you're looking for a fun action RPG shooter, I say go ahead and get it (especially if it's on sale) but if it's negatives are too much for you, I'd say if you have Gamepass giving it at least a try. I'm excited to see where this game and studio goes. After years of waiting, we finally have a game that gives us the feelings we've had with the first two Bioshock games and that's enough for me. Welcome to SovietShock."

I haven't been able to play much of the game yet but from what I have seen the game and gameplay looks amazing. They really put some work into how this game looks and runs. It's nice to see a game release that is stable and not a laggy buggy mess. I can't wait to get further into this and see more of the world they have crafted and get my teeth into some more combat. This does have a HUGE Bioshock feel to it and I loved those games when I was younger. Also the glove's A.I. is like having a Mr Handy with you at all times. It's kinda funny imo. I will edit my review in the future after having more time to play and see what's in store.Edited:After playing for more time I can definitely say this game is fantastic IMO. There are some very minor issues here and there but nothing that can't get fixed in a few Patches or even just one Patch. The only issues I've really seen so far are small QoL issues. It would be nice to have a little bit more Inventory space. Even after upgrading my inventory twice I still fill it up rather quickly. Maybe allow meds to stack atleast to 5 or something to help out with space. The game could also use a Flashlight. There is a mod that adds a simple Flashlight to the game that is kind of STALKER style but it would definitely be better if the Devs just implemented a Flashlight in the game themselves. I noticed a few times where Frames dropped but only for a moment then it would smooth back out and run great. I do think that there needs to be an ADS sensitivity setting added to the game. The current sensitivity setting affects aiming and looking around.Fighting the enemies can be rather intense sometimes and they really keep you on your toes if you don't pay attention to your alert level and surroundings. They will team up on you if you get into fights with multiple targets. I love that they can see you from a decent distance. I've always been bugged by games that have sight ranges for enemies that end after about 20 yards or so. I mean cmon I can see way past 20 yards so why not let the enemies. So that is a big plus for me. Fighting them also seems like you are actually in a struggle with a mechanical menace and not some push over dummy. The variety of enemies is nice also. I am still basically in the beginning areas so I have yet to see every enemy in the game. It took me about 7 hours just to leave the first facility, but I went very slow and tried to make sure I grabbed every piece of loot and read all the terminals I could find.  I will say some of the enemies seem to get stuck on things sometimes. Mainly just the flying repair drones. I have noticed on a few occasions where they will just get out right stuck on a tree or wall and can't figure out how to get around the obstacle so they just continue flying into it till you kill them. This is something they can probably fix pretty easily though and it doesn't happen enough to ruin the game.They could do with some more guns though. I do like the guns that are currently in the game but It would be nice to see some other ones added. A sniper would be nice and a LMG as well. I know some people don't care too much about that stuff, but I do like muh pew pews though. The upgrades for weapons are decent and actually seem to make the weapons better rather than just making them look different. The story is pretty good even if the acting is a little corny at times. Honestly though the corniness of some of the comments is pretty funny to me so that stuff doesn't bother me at all.  The Robo Hooker NORA is kind of funny and over the top at times especially when you first meet her. Word of warning. If you have small children and like to watch what they are exposed to be very careful about going to NORA to upgrade things because she definitely says some very very sultry things at times.Over all I really really like this game. It is one of the first games to be released in the last few years that didn't disappoint me with lack of content, massive lag, bugs, crappy design or all of the above. Ignore the negative comments. A vast majority of the negative comments are due to Political Ignorance and have nothing what so ever to do with the actual game itself. They are irrelevant and should be removed since their reviews have nothing to do with Gameplay, Stability, or Content and are strictly directed at Hating the devs due to their Nationality.I can not wait to see what gets added in future updates and I definitely am looking forward to the DLCs they add. Hopefully they are geared towards new areas, gear, and enemies. I will be disappointed if they add an Arena DLC. I am sick of seeing games add boring Arenas. Give us more places to explore, loot, and destroy robos in. Thank you very much to the Atomic Heart Devs for creating this gem!"

6828,TheUpsetWookiee,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheUpsetWookie/,No,,1,0.8,February,21,656,0,1,"I didn't have time to fully play this tonight, but wanted to check it out and see how it ran and get a vibe of the game. I've been suffering through the absolute garbage performance of Hogwarts and I am so relieved, it's Flawless. DLSS Quality, DLSS 3, Maxed out settings, 120 fps. 4090, 13700K, 7200mhz DDR5.  And it's really good so far. The only thing Russian about this game is it's setting."
6829,Edweird,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035665985/,No,,1,3.0,February,21,94,0,1,"This game runs and looks great, but the field of view (probably ~70)  is too narrow and you can't adjust it. You can't turn off chromatic aberration or bloom effects. The combination of the three make it a little sickening after some time playing.It is a good game, I just don't know how they overlooked these things."
6830,Admiral Pantsu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RemIsMyQueen/,No,,1,12.7,February,21,392,0,1,"So far, this game is awesome! I don't really understand nor do I care about any of the controversy surrounding it, as I don't think that should affect anybodies view on the games quality. But it feels super fun to play, Even works amazingly on controller as that's my personal preferred way to play games. Looks great graphically to! And I haven't had a single performance issue once it loaded/compiled the shaders. Although, I don't recommend turning on fidelity fx super resolution at the moment as for some reason it will make the game blurry and pixelated, probably just a bug with it's implementation or something. Overall, feels kind of like a mixture of Prey from 2017, and Bioshock, with maybe a bit of other things sprinkled in here and there. Highly recommend trying it, don't pay attention to any nay sayers."

Best looting system ever, hold F and suck everything up.Major indoor areas are unique and fun to explore.Open world is not littered with useless objectives, only 8 ""labs"" where you get upgrades.Cool puzzles.Cons:Some minor visual glitches but nothing game breaking.Too much dialogue, main characters can be annoying at times.Open world has infinite spawn.Climbing animation is a bit slow."
