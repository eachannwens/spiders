0,Tamaster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tho545454/,"3,786",46,1,81.6,February,25,917,70,1,"Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the iconic Wizarding World setting created by J.K. Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. The main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.The world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. Most dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.Magical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. Combat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.Quests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. Challenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort."

5,▮ NO FILE,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yonaga/,"6,625",120,1,89.3,February,10,"2,758",144,1,"Sometimes games are getting released with way too much hype. Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don't even get me started with license games in general....Hogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.I don't usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of ""Harry Potter"" made me buy it in an instant.The following review won't contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.So far so good. It starts off with a generic ""You are the chosen one!"" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don't want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn't be able to stop reading it until the very end.Overwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.First off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.Then you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.Also: You don't get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.If you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the ""Floo powder"" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  Decorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! What would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. Fighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. For your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.The further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.As a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.There is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.I just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! Just wow!  Hogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don't even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.I play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won't be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!Simply magical!I also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!"

9,Kujar3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kujar3Player/,"1,067",19,1,58.8,February,13,"1,551",18,1,"I could gush about this forever. The world is so well crafted and there was so much love put into it, it's kind of absurd. You start off in the castle, it's bloody massive, very faithful to the template you know, it's clear they tried their best to do a 1:1 replica. Walking through the halls and rooms in ecstatic, never did I feel that exploration is in any way forced, I was encouraged to explore and I have yet to properly utilize fast travel, it just doesn't get old and I still keep bumping into corridors that eluded me, still finding new things. And that's JUST the castle, the moment you look past the castle and take in the sheer scope of the world, it is possitively jaw dropping. The world is ginormous and the developers found clever things to sprinkle everywhere you go. Every now and then you bump into a small village out there, each one is different and again, very detailed and even tho they keep the same aesthetic, it never felt like exploring more of the same. It is honestly kind of overwhelming how much there is to find and play around with, this is a real work of art that even if you do not fancy the world of Harry Potter, should give you plenty of enjoyement to travel through.I jumped in on Hard difficulty as I was seeking some challenge out of this, however not much challenge is really provided. I keep being capped on my healing potions, rarely having to reach out for them. There are moments that test you certainly, large group of enemies are fun to tackle and the higher difficulty does not allow you to make many mistakes. Combat is satisfying, you generally play with a selection of 4 main spells you chose, from what you have learned, but you're not limited to them. You get up to 4 spell tabs for a total of 16 spells at the ready that you can switch between during combat at will. You'll learn combos of spells that work well together and swinging your wand around will feel really good. Enemies attack back with attacks you can protect against and ones you can only dodge, always visually apparent by a different colored circle around your head, it's a simple nuance but you'll trip up here and there, game doesn't make you feel invincible. Enemy variety could be larger, but it's not absolutely terrible, what's a bit of a shame is that you rarely battle more than 1 enemy type at the same time, maybe that's something that will be happening more later on, I can imagine that could spice up combat a bit. Every enemy type has some kind of weakness for you to discover and you'll be keeping mental notes.Beyond your spell selection, there is not really much else you can do to build your character differently, all gear slots are basically stat sticks that you can eventually augment a bit for specific situations but I feel like it's nothing too significant. Still they made the best out of what they had, maybe gearing being more casual was the goal here.The story is intriguing but nothing ground breaking, so far it stands on its own pretty well, without spoiling as this is in the opening scenes, you learn that your character can see traces of ancient magic which leads you on a path to pursue this calling, but there's a faction of goblins and their leader who are after the same thing, the knowledge of great magic that's only rumored to exist, very few people in the past knew of its existence and could wield it. The game presents sense of urgency while also intentionally slowing you down, but you can argue it is doing so for you to slowly master this magic and uncover the whole truth so I give it a pass. As for sidequesting, you have the usual fetch quests most of the time, that are made interesting by the possibilities a world like this can present. I never felt annoyed doing a side quest that was simply ""deliver"" or ""find and bring"" as it pointed me to places to discover, this is very much carried by the setting and the amazing world. Some side quests are more convoluted and eventually lead you to what could be described as collectible chains. The game slowly introduces collectibles and series of puzzles for you to complete through side quests and it kind of feels natural. The only time I wasn't happy with this was when the unlocking spell ""alohomora"" was locked behind one of those, multiple tiers of it even, as someone who wants to unlock every door, I felt forced to go on collectible hunting but in the end, again, I was happy doing so as it led me places... Did I mention exploration is fun yet?Flying! My god, getting your first broom and taking to the skies feels surreal. You could fast travel, sure, but why would you when you can fly? Game places very few restrictions on where you can and can't fly, practically the whole world is traversable on a mount, it's amazing.Room of Requirement. If you like creating your own space or ever found yourself lost in building a house in The Sims, this will be right up your alley, everything is customizable and by exploring you will find more items to place down,, but this feature got overshadowed for me by taking care of your own beasts. I damn nearly cried grooming and feeding the creatures, it's so adorable, I could spend hours just watching them in the space you get for them, this is my single most favorite feature.Beast catching. You have to catch your beasts so better go out there hunting, many types of beasts to catch and bring home out there in the world. Some are easy to catch, some harder, always having to find the best approach, it's honestly fun.Reputation system, honestly, the game allows you to cast unforgivable curses and nobody seems to care you do so. You can fling avada kedavra next to dozens of witnesses and most you may get is a couple of comments. I wish there were some drawbacks, if not in ""reputation"" then at least visually, think Mass Effect 2 where Shepard would look more scarred the more evil you'd be. I'd take anything.Points system, it's Hogwards, part of it is winning points for your house and while during some quests you get the ""points to *your house here*"" comment, it isn't reflected anywhere. There's virtually no rivalry between the houses as a result.Quidditch, please... The game comes up with an excuse to not have it but man, what a shame.And lastly, I would like to see some deeper relationship feature, building friendship with some important characters, outside of main quests. Doing things for them and maybe being able to take them with you on your exploratory adventures. When I think Harry Potter, I also think of the friendship the main group had going for them, it sometimes feels a bit lonely in this giant world.Performance is rocky, the game drops frames unexplainably, in cutscenes and in a few areas, this is something that can be fixed with patches so hopefully it'll improve.Voice pitch? Don't even bother, leave it on the default spot when creating your character. It makes your voice robotic, echoey and just plain weird. Been resolved, you now get 10 character slots.This game makes me feel like a kid again, I don't remember the last time I was this happy and eager to explore a world, this is coming from someone who grew up on HP, this is all practically a wet dream made real. I am overjoyed the be part of all this and despite knowing this could be a much better game, both improved in what it offers and in some of the glaring issue it has, I can overlook it because so much of this game has been crafted with a lot of love. Bravo, loving every second of it."

13,[HH]Volstraiger,https://steamcommunity.com/id/volstraiger/,"1,213",21,1,74.0,February,12,132,0,1,"So I have finished my first playthrough of the game, have put 57.9 hours into it at this point and completed the content to 100% outside of a few steam trophies.Personally, I have really enjoyed this game and think it's a great release and everything I ever wanted out of a Harry Potter game. The story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.I have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.Outside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries. I believe a lot of people may enjoy playing as an Auror or a Unspeakable."

You play as one of the Hogwarts students learning the world and exploring its secrets. Dangers are at every step and it's up to you to become the most powerful witch or wizard Hogwarts has seen in a long time. Rate: ★★★★☆ Surprisingly the game has a lot more to offer than what trailers show. Combat feels good, with a large array of spells that controls the battlefield and gives you the freedom to do whatever you like.Learning new spells is done via side quests and main missions which oftentimes are pretty nicely crafted. In the game you are faced with a lot of collecting, puzzle-solving, exploring, and sightseeing.Although some areas of exploration can get a bit too much even for the ones that wish to complete the game 100%, the game can be fully enjoyed, and go through the main campaign and pick the side quests with a lot of enjoyment. Rate: ★★★★★  I've had a lot of fun exploring this game. Hogwarts is rich with fun areas to explore. The world continues to impress you and learning new skills and putting them to test is fun and rewarding.  Rate: ★★★★★ This game looks absolutely stunning and it would be without a doubt one of the best-looking games I've played this year. Ray-tracing adds up with a great umph to the overall look, but due to poor performance, it can be heavily costly on your GPU.The world and the key areas look distinguished, remarkable, and jaw-dropping. This game is a really pretty game and each screenshot I took I am not ashamed to share. Rate: ★★★★★Sound effects and voice acting are strong in this game and oftentimes feel very polished. I did find some skipped dialogues by the end of some conversations which may be a bug, but other than that, I think pretty much all dialogues and characters are well-voiced.I have to remark that there's a large array of English dialects, from African, possible Uganda, to Indian accents are well done and feels nice to be able to hear such differences.  Rate: ★★★★☆ Although the end of the game felt a bit weak and the villain wasn't necessarily defined very well, the whole build-up of the story is interesting until that point. Characters are fascinating and despite not being a fan of Harry Potter, I can say that the world and the people are extremely interesting and I was easily captivated by the visuals and the theme the game presents.  🔲  Short (1-8h)🔲 Medium (8-15h)🔲 Long  (15-25h)☑️ Very Long  (25h+)🔲 Unlimited  It's a fairly long game if you intend to finish this game completely and do all 4 houses. The main story alone takes a while and some side quests are too interesting to skip.   ☑️ Easy ☑️ Normal ☑️ Hard 🔲 Brutally Hard 🔲 Impossible  The game isn't too difficult and unless you wish a slightly bigger challenge there is something for you. By the end of the game, as you understand the mechanics of the game and how combat works you'll become a powerful wizard/witch. Hogwarts Legacy is by far one of the best Harry Potter games ever created and this opens up to new possibilities for this IP. As a non-fan of the franchise, I think the game offers a strong open-world experience without overwhelming you with lots of tasks to do, unless you wish to do them. Puzzles are rather simple, but fun and the whole world made me appreciate the game even more."

I wanted to add a few more thoughts.My daughter who is closing in on 18, and my half century year old self have both been fans of Harry Potter and the Wizarding World. I read the books to her when she was younger and then on my own. We’ve watched the movies and it has always been great bonding for us.I preordered the Deluxe edition on Steam when it first came available. I knew my Desktop would handle it but had some concerns about the Steam Deck which has become my device of choice to game on when I feel up to it health wise. Luckily it got Steam Deck Verified before early launch.During early launch we spent about about 10 hours into the game. I put a couple hours in on my Steam Deck with no issues and it ran a solid 30 FPS except the very sparse drop to mid to high 20s on some cutscenes. Note that I made no changes to the stock installation settings. Also note that I play in performance mode as I am plugged in while in bed or on the sofa 99% of my playtime. My daughter had about 8 on our primary desktop which is an aging i5-7400 @ 3Ghz, 16GB RAM, SSD with a GeForce 1060 GTX and reported no issues either.At this point we have over 35 hours in with the majority of them being my daughter on the PC and me making up about a third of the remaining hours on the Deck. During those hours we each experienced one crash. For her it was a CTD for myself it was a crash that locked up Proton causing a force restart of the switch. Note both of these crashes were prior to the Day 1 patch and we haven’t ran into any further issues since.Gameplay is fun and a lot more interesting and in-depth than I expected. Learning the various arts like potion making, herbalism, and so long always gives you something to do. I am known for almost always turning off in game music but the soundtrack is perfect for reminding you what world you are in. There are more than enough side quests to keep you busy, to the point of falling behind and losing track of the main quest.There are puzzles at every turn that are both hard but not impossible. I have yet to have to refer to a walkthrough as much as at times I wanted to. This game really keeps you wanting to avoid spoilers and accomplish things on your own. You will meet a lot of classmates and others on and off campus, however there is really a fairly limited pool that you regularly interact with. That said you will quickly make close friends and even your own Draco Malfoy types who you will hate but might end up have a truce with.All in all my daughter and my biggest complaint is the lack of better character customization. There are a fair number of presets but there is no ability to adjust outside those presets such as adjust lips or cheeks, noses to your own design outside the presets slider. There is no hight or weight adjustment. I like the amount of control over skin tones and as mentioned there are a fair amount of sliders.However by modern standards it’s barebones. It’s sad when I have played phone f2p games that have better character creation when you can only really only see your character at the selection screen than a $70-90 USD that everyone is going to want to go all out on character design. It is for this primary reason along with my dislike of how hard on the Deck and I assume PC selection of Foo Flame travel points is harder than it should be. I watched my daughter do fast travel via KVM and it was smooth as could be. I do so on the deck and I eventually give up and fly or walk there.That said we still rate this game a very strong 9/10 and already call it GOTY for us."

37,Elysian,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Elysian1_/,649,13,1,93.4,February,17,610,58,1,"While not as good as our dreams, Hogwarts Legacy is nevertheless a decent game that exudes the visual charm and beauty of J.K. Rowling’s fantasy world well. It is burdened by performance issues, a somewhat hollow world, and some small, though cumulatively bothersome design oversights, but with a passable story and mostly enjoyable gameplay it lands itself a generally positive recommendation.•	GeForce GTX 1660Ti•	8GB DDR4@1330MHz•	i5 9300H @2.4GHz•	HDD 7200RPM*Game requires min. 16GB RAM.Initially unplayable on low, changing system and game settings resulted in a fairly playable game at medium - low settings. A recent patch improved it a bit, and while there are FPS drops, there’s less freezing. Hogwarts’ architecture is breath-taking, and outdoor environments are varied and beautiful – some dark and creepy, others warm and vibrant. It’s a visual masterpiece, and the atmosphere of the Wizarding world is brilliantly captured. It’s absurd there’s no photo mode.Some house and dungeon interiors are repeated, which feels lazy, but you're only there briefly to loot chests. Important places you visit often are unique.Spells are colourful and vibrant, and particle effects are pretty, with light wisps, auras and ‘sparks’ lending a magical quality to the game. Performance aside, these are smooth and satisfying to watch, too.While not photorealistic, the artistic style is pleasant, and characters do have well-detailed faces and mostly good expressions.The cast doesn’t feel from 1800, but I’m not so bothered by this. It wasn’t sold as a historical game, and I didn’t expect realism. I didn’t buy this game , but .Our characters are disappointing, with creation based around presets with very limited customisation – worse than Cyberpunk. Female characters in particular look pretty bad. In the world, lighting affects your face sometimes horribly, though cutscenes show how it in better detail. Hogwarts interiors sometimes capture the grandeur of the place in their soundscape in those big open stairways with high ceilings, but I don’t remember losing myself in outdoors nature sounds. Environmental sounds were more remarkable indoors than out, I think.Characters are generally well-spoken which I like, and some personality does come through. Emotion is conveyed fairly well, but rarely to the point it moved me in any way. Our character (female for me) does a good enough job, but I wouldn’t say it was outstanding.Music is pleasant, although sometimes perhaps a little energetic. When exploring, it never made you feel like you were floating on a breeze in this beautiful world, like Skyrim did. It was often quite intense in a way that’s a bit much, though in intense moments it served well. Regardless, it did have a fantasy feel about it, and in that way it fit the game well.The stage is beautiful, but the play is empty. There isn’t much sense of being a Hogwarts student. Classes teach you spells, but feel like tutorials. Once done, you aren’t really a student anymore, and this becomes a typical RPG, lacking RPG features. Extra-curricular assignments don’t change this feeling, and come over more as challenges than student roleplay.You can’t interact with NPCs outside of missions. There’s no companions. Common rooms are lifeless. Mounts don’t stay, despawning when dismounting. At night, the atmosphere is lovely, yet there’s not much to do. We also can’t play Quidditch! They only strength with immersion is the graphics. Beyond that, the game doesn’t capitalise on its unique setting, and feels like any other below average open world RPG as a result.As an RPG it lacks a sense of choice or consequence. While there are different endings, most of the game is linear, and so the room for roleplaying is limited, as is replay value.Combat is challenging without being too hard. Because you have to match spells with defences, you can’t just spam your way through fights, and that makes them feel quite rewarding. So far, I like this, though the abundance of fighting in tougher missions can also be very tiring.I hate the spell toolbar system though. It takes 4 spells, and you can unlock 3 more toolbars, scrolling between them in combat. There are more spells than this though, and I kept needing to change, requiring a visit to the menus. Even with spells I have in my toolbars, scrolling through  is annoying.While overdone and abundant in the world to the point they can feel like mindless busywork, I do actually enjoy ticking these off to 100% the game. There is some variety across different types, so there’s  complexity, without being frustratingly difficult.Crafting isn’t instant, and without minigames, you simply have to wait for a timer up to ~10 mins. This is such an awful, boring design. Once the timer is up, the game won’t produce more either, so you can’t explore and come back to 50 potions, for example.One thing I love about the apparel system is the ability to change the appearance of anything you’re wearing to something you like more while keeping the stats.However, nearly every chest has a clothing item, yet you can carry so few. Upgrades don’t mitigate the problem. Yet I can keep several Hippogriffs in a bag, and brooms in my pocket. This is irritating. Returning to vendors so often is tedious, and destroying the clothes wastes money they could be sold for. It also requires going into the menus and then to return to the world, you have to escape through about three layers of menu. This is like a Ubisoft game - grindy. There’s many repetitive tasks, all of which you have to do to 100%. I expect 100+ hours.The narrative hasn’t moved me as much as I would have liked, but it would be unfair to say it’s bad. It is yet another ‘you are the unique hero who can save the world’ story, which is fine – it’s nice to feel important. But then you are sent on a plentiful amount of fetch and carry missions, and given you’re a young student, adults are quite willing to send you into danger, too.By almost 50 hours in-game at 57% total completion, the story introduces some unlikable enemies and some mildly likeable friends, but none are very memorable. The overarching story is compelling enough to drive the gameplay – there is a  to play on, but rarely do you  the stakes or care about the consequences, as it’s hard to care about most characters. The thing that’s moved me most so far is a mission where you rescue animals. Take that as you will.While I recommend this game, it is also symptomatic of the downward spiral in quality we see these days. It’s quite repetitive and shallow, but some of the sting is taken away by a beautiful world and the Harry Potter setting. Many criticisms I have are small, but together sap the game of charm. When the child-like excitement fades and the product is viewed neutrally, it’s not a masterpiece.The environments are lovely, the audio and puzzles are good, and combat is the right balance of simplicity and challenge for me. Roleplay and immersion are lacking, and the story is mediocre. For these reasons, while I recommend the game, it’s not an overwhelming recommendation. Ultimately, though, do I regret pre-ordering? No, I don’t. I like Hogwarts Legacy. I just don’t love it."

But it is lacking in some small areas. Below I have listed the pros and cons of the game. I also listed what I want to see in the future, as well as what I don't want to see in the future! Keep in mind I am not a massive Harry Potter fan and only have seen the movies a long time ago. This list was made over the course of my playthrough during the 72 hour early access for Deluxe Editon owners, hopefully there is a day 1 patch out by now! Enjoy!• Good Performance (Could be better, but it is very good at least for me)• Great Immersion• Graphics and Art Style• Changing Seasons• Fancy Animation (With spells, puzzles, doors, and all that)• Great Music & Sound Design (Broom class kinda popped off with that music)• Engaging Story/Narrative• Fun Late Game Combat (Ancient magic is sick! Just use your spells and mix it up! It's pretty fun)• Exploration (Rewards you heavily for it)• Detailed & Big World (You can go into any building, find many secrets, solve fun puzzles, pet cats, and much more)• Interesting Characters (There are lots! The voice acting is sometimes bad)• Great Transmog (Once you get the item you keep its appearance for use whenever you want)• Great Quests (There are a ton)• Fun Skins/Outfits (Great outfit pieces, mount skins, wand skins, and all that)• Almost No Bugs (Visual bugs only, most are funny)• No Crashes• Accessibility & UI Options (There are LOTS!)• Graphic Options (Also LOTS!) • NPC Quest Speed (WOW, NPCs that actually move your speed on quests?! More games should do this!)• Room of Requirement (Fun to customize, can be daunting at times)• No Quidditch• Cramped Camera (Sometimes it can be at weird angles, maybe add customizable positions)• Character Customization (I'm referring to the customization at the start of the game, it's a bit iffy)• Voice Pitch (In the character customization menu at the start, every voice pitch besides the default one sounds robotic)• Voice Acting (Sometimes)• Repetitive Early Game Combat (Not a lot of spells to use but it's understandable)• Limited Gear Slots (Can be increased by doing )• Confusing Menu (At first, it was hard for me to get used to it all at once, I couldn't find transmog or my Twitch drops)• Useless Houses (From what I have played your house doesn't mean much)• Useless Wands (When choosing your wand, the attributes don't do anything from what I have seen, from a game standpoint it makes sense)• Small Enemy/Boss Variety ()• Graphical Stuttering (In cutscenes mostly, sometimes happens when entering newly rendered areas)• Lighting Transitions & Flickering (Sometimes the lighting can be blinding, or just straight up weird looking)• Door Loading (When traversing the castle, sometimes the game will show a loading icon on doors)• Robot Background NPCs (They pretty much don't do anything but walk and talk, with no reactions to spells or anything)• NPC AI & Animations (Sometimes it's a bit janky)• Multiplayer (At least Quidditch multiplayer)• Mod Support (Would be awesome, especially Steam Workshop)• Quidditch (They have the Golden Snitch and the arena in-game already)• Camera Control (Positioning, maybe increased FOV slider?)• Photo Mode (Please!)• Better Character Customization (More skin colors, hair, face shapes, and more)• Improved Voice Pitch (Better pitch shifter)• Improved Voice Acting (Most likely will not happen)• Bug Fixes (Lighting transition fixes)• Better Performance (Door loading improvements)• More Accessibility Options (Arachnophobia switch?)• Community Engagement (Free in-game events to win cosmetics, community updates and more! Ex. Dying Light 2 is a game that does this VERY well!)• Micro-transactions • Overpriced DLC• Radio Silence (No more updates, no communication, and all that. Would be a bummer)To conclude, most of the cons can be fixed easily, don't let the cons bring you down. I believe most of the cons will be fixed/addressed.

In most of the dialogue, you can choose what to say. We have many ways to complete the mission. Each mission is interesting and different from the last. We also have riddle games and good sidequests.Beautiful open world, giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore Hogwarts, caves, forests, mountains, and do much more. The map is very large. Herbalism and alchemy are important and help a lot; we can also upgrade equipment. We can have a real Wizard of Oz adventure. The fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocked by a small obstacle, but in comparison to other games, it is not very annoying.Each character has its own charm. The characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We can also choose the main character's path, whether he is a good wizard or a bad one (using unforgivable spells), but the game will not punish us for it.The graphics in this game are amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined; for example, when we move the grass, it moves with us. Graphics capabilities are used at 100%. The movement of water and clouds is very well refined. We can see falling leaves and changing weather. It makes a huge impression.The music and ambient sounds in this game fit great. We can listen to climatic music that is selected for each moment of the game. Character voices are not my favorites, but they fit the characters. There is a lot of music from movies.If you are thinking about purchasing this game because you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend it for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun will come from it. This is a well-made game not only for Harry Potter fans but for everyone."

And that's fine, it doesn't have to be. Finally, for people who only care about what J.K.Rowling says on twitter... this game is not for you. Not due to anything in the game itself - it is actually very kind and inclusive and you *would enjoy it* - but because J.K.Rowling created the harry potter world ~30 years ago, you won't enjoy playing any game set in that world.

48,ExuberantFool,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039483816/,454,13,0,31.8,March,14,51,25,1,"Hogwarts Legacy has a lot going for it. It is clear that a lot of love and labor went into the creation of the world. Considering previous titles Avalanche has developed, it is probably fair to say they punched above their weight class with this game.So why a negative review?Because the game is a very large, very shallow puddle. Hogwarts Legacy's world may be very pretty, but it's also a world that solely exists for you. Once the initial bedazzlement wears off, it becomes impossible not to notice how deeply infected this game is with the Ubisoft model of open-world design. Perhaps such a design would be tolerable if your choices actually mattered, but they don't. There are no consequences for your actions and it gets worse: your character is incredibly heavily scripted by Avalanche, occasionally blurting out things you were trying to keep secret in every ""choice"" you were given before. Aside from making one or two snide comments, you cannot make your character act like a jerk. Your character is going to be a pet-loving, tree-hugging, empathic goody-two-shoes no matter what you do.- Choices don't matter- There are no consequences to your actions.- There are no stakes! There is a supposed ""big bad"" who is interested in you and wants to capture you, yet you can roam the world however and whenever you like without any risk of getting caught. The story only happens when you trigger it.- At some point in the story, the interests of MC and a side-show villain become aligned. The side-show villain even says so and offers a chance to work together. I wanted to accept, but noooooo, Avalanche made my character decline and spew some moralistic BS at the villain, I was not even given a choice. UGH.- Totally missed opportunity on using the four houses as competition factions. There is no competition between houses in this game, there are no factions, there are no house points.- When it becomes night, everybody just outright vanishes. When it first happens it gives a kind of creepy vibe that seems almost suitable. But once you notice that this happens every night, and no NPC goes to bed, no prefect patrols the halls, and you become aware that you are essentially running around an empty level... well, it just takes your right out of the experience.- No social gameplay at all. No building of relationships between other characters. You're just going to be friends with everyone, no matter how you play, because Avalance says so.- Starting as a fifth-year IMO was a cop-out. A cheap narrative reason to be able to give the player some of the more mature spells. The problem with this choice is that it eliminates the potential to build a bond with any of the side-characters. Seriously, even just spending a couple of hours as a first year could have done so much to help set up meaningful relationships. Huge missed opportunity.- No classes or curfew systems. Some people think that having these would be boring. By themselves they could become boring or annoying, sure, but when there is a social cost associated with them, I think they could be excellent gameplay loops. Missed a class? Lose house points. Lose house points? Social relation with side-character X is affected, which in turn affects your story and the choices you are able to make. Or how about having to feed your secret Hippogriff pet, which you can only do at night, so you have a reason to break curfew. And if you fail and get caught? Who knows, maybe the Hippogriff abandons you. Risk and reward people, it's not that hard!I hope Avalanche will do better in the future. There is some reason to think that they will as modders have uncovered things like an unused morality system (which this game desperately needs), thieving system, and even things like GoToBed(). So Avalanche *did* think about some of these things, but for whatever reason they never ended up in the game.I respect the developers for what they've done. A game of this scale for one of the largest fandoms in the world is no easy task. It was always going to be hard for them to meet expectations. I can only hope they will learn from this game and will take the needed steps to improve upon it in some future iteration."

I should say though, after an explosive starting scene, it's a bit of a slow progression in the  beginning. You'll need to master some spells, meet around people, etc to really be prepared to start the actual journey. Even your brooms comes in at around 10 hours into the game. But it's definitely worth the wait. The gameplay itself is pretty good. Using different spells for different enemies. They have a pretty good variety and I'm not disappointed. The map is good, there's fast travel options, talent points to unlock new abilities, etc. The best thing about the game is the world itself and they've executed it perfectly. Even if I'm just walking around the castle, I find things which make me smile. Honestly, I feel like I'm s student of Hogwarts and I'm exploring this amazing place. The castle is the best place, but there are outside places too. Lots of sidequests, puzzles, dungeons, etc. Basically, it's everything you'd expect from the world of magic. But ofcourse, it's not perfect. There are certainly some flaws. There are a few glitches which affected the gameplay. And one was so huge and I can't progress a quest at all (Edit: its fixed now and I've completed the quest). The number of gear slots are way too less and I'm forced to sell most of my unused gears to make space for new ones. Some of the puzzles are just repetitive that I gave up on them being bored of it. But those are just minor things. I'm sure they'll fix the glitches too. But seriously, I love this game and I definitely have my money's worth. I'm around 23 hours in and I know that there's lots more waiting for me in terms of story and I'm going to have a blast. So final verdict, just get it. You won't regret it. PS: Just ignore all the hate for this game regarding the JK stuff. Just because one old woman is perceived as being inhuman, you're going to ignore the love and effort of hundreds of game creators? I mean, there are even lesbian couples and trans characters in the game (sure, it must be the marketing strategy, but it's still representation nonetheless). This game is not about the one person, it's about a group of developers who love this project. Just think about that too before you make a decision."
58,Old Man Gamer (OMG),https://steamcommunity.com/id/OldManGamerOMG/,242,2,1,193.4,February,21,277,18,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a must play experience. The world design, music, story and characters are an overall fantastic experience. You do not have to be a Harry Potter fan to be able to enjoy the game, but it does add much to the game if you are. The graphics are fantastic. The user interface is informative while remaining simple and user friendly. The menus are fun to navigate and check the map, collections and progress. For the most part, Game play is mostly perfect. I am not a fan of the broom stick flight. The controls on the broom feel clunky and not user friendly on controller nor on keyboard/mouse. However, the combat is highly enjoyable. Spell casting, item utilization and potions are well balanced in player use. Difficulty on hard was not difficult in the slightest, but there has been an update and I am finding the challenge has been upped quite a bit. Fast reflexes and smart choices definitely are needed for a favorable outcome. I would not consider the game remotely as difficult as a ""souls-like"" experience. While the story is fantastic, it is the world immersion that makes Hogwarts Legacy shine brightest. The side quests, choices, progress in the main story and discoveries all add and change the conversations and interactions that the protagonist has with the other classmates, professors and even enemies. If you use certain methods in combat more heavily, your enemies will make comments on that, for instance. We are still not at a truly dynamic open world, but this is one of the best open world builds I have enjoyed in gaming.My biggest complaint is that the puzzles are all rudimentary. There is nothing mentally taxing in the entire game. With so many puzzles, the most difficult is solvable without any pause for thought. I could expound on all of this and more, but it is easier said that Hogwarts Legacy is a great foundation for a new gaming franchise. While I could nitpick Hogwarts Legacy in how the game can be better in many ways, it achieves what many games fail to even deliver. And that is an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience from start to finish."
59,Majordomo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/You_Found_The_Easter_Egg/,47,1,1,68.1,March,19,171,11,1,"""Magic is no different from any other power. What really matters is the one who wields it.""- Eleazar Fig Hogwarts Legacy is the first instalment of the beloved Wizarding Universe since 2013, so it's no surprise that the open-world RPG blew up the market, with many series fans eager to embark on this new magical adventure. However, despite the stunning visual designs and a diverse range of creatures, plants, and potion recipes, the rich package quickly becomes stale, with some shallow formats employing the Disillusionment Spell to hide flaws.  The journey begins a century before the events depicted in J. K. Rowling's novels, with a custom-rendered protagonist who has just begun their fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The talented wizard has shown a strong affinity for magic over the past few months, and with the aid of friends and strange acquaintances, they will set out on an epic journey that could help them reach their full potential. Who knows what secrets they may uncover? Hop on the Jacobite steam train and find out for yourself… The main plot follows the traditional Harry Potter formula, with the protagonist discovering their calling that connects them to a greater purpose. The colourful cast that takes up the mantle of supporting characters further reinforces this factor as they are intertwined with your wizard’s personal growth and progress. But yet, with such diverse personalities and some solid chain quest activities, the overall narrative keeps falling flat the more you play the game, and the main reason behind this can be found in the dialogues. Since the Harry Potter universe has attracted players of all ages, Avalanche Software took the safest approach by offering a child-friendly experience. As a result, many times you either encounter NPCs that talk like children or, even worse, they are treating you like a child despite the fact that you murdered three wizards prior to the interaction.In contrast to its weak narrative elements, Hogwarts Legacy provides solid gameplay in both combat and exploration. The plethora of customization options and unexpected interactions between spells and consumables provide all of the tools needed for unique role-playing sessions, but this does not imply that they check every single box with equal efficiency. Avalanche Software faithfully depicts Hogwarts and the many regions that surround it, capturing both the beauty and the mystery that the Wizarding World is known for. The Hogwarts castle is the game's pinnacle, with many hidden rooms and interactable objects cleverly placed in crowded corridors or isolated locations, while the surrounding fields add an extra layer of diversity with various underground caverns, cosy villages, and mysterious forests. Although an overwhelming amount of beauty is bursting at your screen, the developers made sure to take things slowly by opening up to the numerous mechanics without imposing limitations. Consequently, you can adjust the pace of the progression according to your needs. The only deterrent to the aforementioned formula is the map. By having such a diverse world, I was expecting a much better navigation system similar to other big titles of the same genre. The 3D interface, for instance, offers zero functionality aside from being visually stunning because it cannot be customised to highlight particular points of interest, and the distances are frequently inaccurate, showing long path roots that could be avoided.While fairly simple in nature, combat is very engaging, as it opens the door to many combos and unexpected interactions. The six elements of magic used in spell casting, the most potent of which are the forbidden spells, are stationary. Your toolkit holds a total of sixteen charms that you can equip, but you can always quickly combine different abilities depending on the circumstance. The beauty behind spell casting can be found in two main parameters: the rotations and the cooldowns. In order to prevent players from constantly using Avada Kedavra, each spell has a time limit before it can be used again. As a result, your heavy damage dealers become somewhat limited, forcing you to plan ahead of time before engaging in combat. Furthermore, in order to maximise their potential, Hogwarts Legacy introduces weaknesses to your adversaries that encourage experimentation and quick thinking. Spiders, for example, are weak to fire damage, while Dugbogs become vulnerable when you expose their bellies. Finally, the clearly overpowered potions and plants you'll brew or grow in your workshop will broaden your lethal abilities, adding another layer of complexity. Besides the main story, Hogwarts Legacy is rich with puzzles, collectibles, and minigames that are slowly unravelled as you learn new abilities. The Merlin trials, for instance, were the most memorable of the bunch because you got to use the knowledge you have been honing so far in order to move objects or simply destroy orbs and pillars in a timed manner. Such activities were a welcome diversion from the main pump-action story sequences, but despite their novelty, they were clearly outmatched by the game's most prominent feature: transportation. Flying on a broom proved to be exceptional, mesmerising, and, most importantly, fun to such an extent that it could be transformed into a game itself with the necessary adjustments. Last but not least, I would like to touch upon the lack of sandbox elements that the overall experience could clearly benefit from. Regardless of how charming the world is, it unquestionably requires a moral compass to keep our protagonist from overrelying on forbidden spells. The absence of such an addition is a missed opportunity, especially given that both students and professors comment on your previous actions.Staggering visuals, neat animations, and colourful spells combine into a canvas full of passion and grandeur. The world is a love letter to the Harry Potter fanbase, creating a very faithful template to the original series. Even the smallest details have been meticulously crafted, with the falling leaves during autumn being one of the most impressive and breathtaking effects that left me speechless. Everything is tinged with mystery and magic, almost begging you to abandon fast travel to fully appreciate the beauty, which is why I consider the lack of a photo mode feature to be a crime. Even though I appreciate the fact that music and spell effects are reused from the original Harry Potter movies, there is nothing new in the overall mix. Sure, the environmental sounds are remarkable, adding lots of personality during conversations and cutscenes, but I still find them very lacking in comparison to the visual approach. The voice acting is superb, with new voice actors getting a chance to shine, but as previously stated, the dialogues can become quite irritating. After nearly 70 hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Hogwarts Legacy is by far the most promising fantasy world adaptation I've ever seen in a video game, paving the way for a new era of Harry Potter titles. The game is excellent yet not perfect, with both unexpected and twisted turns that, in spite of their shortcomings, prove to be mostly masked by the shroud of nostalgia."

I cannot express how enchanting it is to play, and when I am playing I don’t want to stop. The atmosphere, attention to detail, and overall gameplay mechanics when casting magic in combat or when choosing the right spell to solve a puzzle is fluid and fun. The Avalanche Software team put a lot of heart and soul into this game and definitely captured the overall feel of the universe."
64,Rampaging Cookie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ali_HT/,50,1,1,38.8,February,11,"1,005",22,1,"is one of the biggest fantasy franchises of the new age, which, despite more than 25 years having passed since the release of the first book by J. K. Rowling, is still popular. Since 2002, From that time until now, we have always been waiting for a good quality game from the world of Harry Potter. The Hogwarts Legacy is a role-playing action game developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Now we are going to review the whole game.This open-world game, which can be experienced in single-player mode, has created a closer and higher-quality image of the magical world of Harry Potter. However, this game does not tell the story of Harry Potter, and its story goes back at least a hundred years before the events of Harry Potter. You start the game as a new student in the fifth year of Hogwarts; However, the game does not give information about the reason for your late studies in the fifth year.The game's main story draws you in with beautiful twists and pulls you by creating a curiosity to discover the truth about your unknown ability. Although the story is not the boldest element in this game, the creators have managed to mix the game's not-so-complicated main narrative in the form of the magical and vast world of the game.In addition to the main narrative, hundreds of side quests have been designed for users to participate in according to their choice. The variety of side quests in the game is so great that engaging with them will sometimes be more interesting than the game's main story. Exploring the enormous game world allows you to play other magical games and challenges. Solve Merlin's trials, hunt magical animals, find hidden tunnels, and search for relics of ancient magic. The game is so big and rich that you'll find yourself exploring for hours and hours without even touching the main quests.To move around in this big world, you can use fast travel; by discovering them, you can move between different places in the game world without delay. This makes it possible to follow any desired primary or secondary quests quickly. In addition, you can also travel using a broomstick or other magical creatures such as a hippogriff. In each area of this magical world, there are tons of activities to complete your collection. All these areas and activities are accessible on the game map, and the game map is one of the essential tools for that, guiding the user through all quests.The Hogwarts Legacy RPG progression system is designed in such a way that you can collect XP by following the main or sub-quests. When these XPs reach a certain amount, your character's level will increase; for each level increase, more puzzles or stages will be available. By advancing the main story, you gain new abilities, and by doing the game's side quests, your skill in these abilities will improve; you can upgrade your character's talents in various fields, such as elemental spells, black magic, stealth, etc.The game allows you to create and personalize the appearance of your desired character by choosing the face, hair, skin color, and even facial scars. You will also be able to select your desired grouping in Hogwarts. The range of customization of the game extends to the selection of clothes, accessories, magic wands, flying brooms, and even your private room in Hogwarts Room of Requirement. Although these customizations are extremely fun, even the choice of school grouping does not affect the gameplay and is limited only to cosmetics. This also applies to in-game decisions. In the process of advancing the story and in relation to the characters of the game, you will have several dialogue options to choose from; But these choices will have practically no effect on the story. And in both cases, you will receive the same reward and output.One of the exciting places to customize is the Hogwarts Room of Requirement. If you have followed the Harry Potter series, you know that at Hogwarts, this secret room appears when students need it. In the game, Professor Wisley brings you to this room to study more on magic lessons and to create your work environment. In this room, minor details can be personalized, such as the frames on the wall to the desks. You can also keep your magical animals in the magical garden of the room. This room is perfect for crafting potions, practicing spells, and upgrading your character's cosmetics.The combat system of the Hogwarts Legacy is perhaps the most exciting part of the game. The game initially starts with limited spells and abilities, But gradually, by learning new spells and improving skills with the help of game points, the fighting experience turns into significant action. The game allows you to customize and combine different spells to create your own fighting style. This has made the game's combat experience extremely fun and addictive, despite the very low variety of enemies. These fights, which take place against black witches, giant spiders, goblins, zombies, and of course, trolls, sometimes become so challenging that you have to try many times to get past them. Another thing that needs to be addressed is the artistic graphics of the game. The Hogwarts Legacy game has one of the most beautiful magical worlds. Hogwarts school in the game is designed in the most beautiful way possible, and almost all the memorable places in the book can be found in the game.Despite all the positives, this open-world game has many technical problems. These problems, primarily seen in the game's PC version, have somewhat damaged the game experience. For example, many users of Nvidia's 30th and even 40th generation graphics cards face problems such as limited graphics RAM or multiple crashes when playing games. Also, long loading times and some graphic textures not loading correctly are other problems on the computer and console platforms. This issue probably makes it impossible to experience the game on old hard drives and HDDs.Overall, I can say that the Hogwarts Legacy is a brilliant magical open world of Harry Potter. This game has fulfilled more or less everything we expected. It portrays Rowling's magical world in the best possible way. Hogwarts Legacy is the best game from the Harry Potter franchise ever made, and if it weren't for the many technical issues with the PC version, I could have easily given it a full score in this review.Hogwarts Legacy is everything that Harry Potter fans have been waiting for. The game does not tell the story of Harry Potter, but by creating a magical world, it has been able to tell another brilliant story.If you are interested in the fantasy world of Harry Potter and enjoy the experience of exploring a large fantasy world, the Hogwarts Legacy game is what you need. Hogwarts Legacy has no obvious negative points other than technical issues. Therefore, it cannot be included in the list of games that I don't recommend buying."
65,skořicový trdelník,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nntnce/,68,2,1,95.4,February,23,738,4,1,"If you expect Hogwarts Legacy to have a complete freedom of action, different endings which depend on your relationship with the characters and stage of completing certain quests, these are exactly the things you won't get there as well as a high range of replayability. Although the game is still rather good, as a friend of mine accurately pointed out, it’s all about the lack of competition among other major titles, focusing on one specific fandom, and an absolute lack of alternatives in this fandom. I've played through the game and finished it completely with 100% achievements, so I'd like to tell my personal opinion about it after all. ● There is . The ending will always be the same and there are no consequences of your actions. ● . Restricted areas are restricted just because they are meant to be restricted, not because you are not able to wandering there freely if it’s not about a quest, so feel free to come back any time.● There is . Yes, you can choose a bad “not-true” ending. Yes, you can freely study the Dark Arts. No, you can’t kill anyone, but bad guys, because it’s a good story and you cannot be a villain. ● Unforgivable spells are obviously unforgivable, which means that they cannot be used if you’re a good wizard, though nobody would stop you if you cast them. Any witnesses would only note something like “oh you’re not afraid of the Dark Arts”. But there are  at all. And no, if you’re interested, you cannot kill the bosses with Avada Kedavra. ● Sometimes, going between the sectors of a location becomes slightly frustrating. Before the door opens, there is . It would be better if there was an animation of some kind which could replace the time you wait staring at the door stubbornly while random NPCs go through the same door freely. Not to mention  what means now you are to force close the game via the Steam overlay or Task Manager and restart it.Vice versa, some cutscenes such as going to Undercroft seem to work worse towards the end of the game. Sometimes it becomes highly difficult to go, because after holding F, nothing happens at all. You have to walk back and forth and try again until the character finally enters the door.● The fact the player gets the last level after getting almost all the collectibles which, by my calculations, usually happens after going though the main plot makes . After completing all collectibles, there are no activities left in the game at all. So what’s the point of maximum 40 levels if 30 levels are more than enough to go through the main plot and even more?● It's not about your PC; it's just all about the game. 8GB (which is possible to play with), 16GB (which is recommended), or 32GB RAM – .● Poorly, there is  while on broomstick as well as there is  so there is no reaction from other characters if you barely knocked them down. It's not a catastrophe, but feels weird still. ● Obviously, there is no The Haunted Hogsmeade Shop PS5 exclusive quest in Steam version of the game. This is the quest (and it's a pretty good one) which allows you to open your own store and sell your belongings for a better price. However, , so now we can see the store's locked door in Hogsmeade. Thanks, I guess? ● You’re . Back in Resident Evil 2004, the player could shoot through the gaps in the textures, and this is a project with AAA price in 2023.● When a game has flight mechanics, you never know if it will be good or not. But here,  (except for the lack of collision animation). Besides, you're also able to  and find the one you like visually. Plus, there are three types of mounts revealing with the story progress. ● You can help random characters with extra tasks but you’re also allowed to never give back the things they asked to help with. Some of them need to get back their books and you are happy to help them, but some of them are Zenobia Noke, and I’ll never regret I did not give her back whatever she wanted me to find.● There is nothing special about the character customization menu at the beginning of the game, but  into any other outfit from those already found or received as a reward, is priceless. And it’s a real visual treat!● You can . If you don't want to see the mini-map or quest markers, or you don't need a spell bar, you can remove everything freely. Eventually, you can just turn off HUD completely and enjoy the game. It is quite a needed feature.●  is the witcher’s flair in the Harry Potter universe. It’s a night vision device in the magical world and also an invaluable tool for finding anything and everything. Revelio is a spell justified by lore of the game, the usefulness and convenience of which cannot be overestimated. Besides, Revelio has its own assign button, so this spell doesn't take any of much-needed space on the spell bar.● Although I didn’t like that only first lessons were interactive, since so many people told that the class system in Hogwarts Legacy would be similar to that of Bully: Scholarship Edition, the spells learning as a system worked out well. One way or another, . They won’t overload you and are quickly remembered.● From the ability to stealth to various spell combinations,  in Hogwarts Legacy are solidly implemented. Fighting is interesting even at the end of the game because it's not tedious. You always use different spells and try different combos. Yeah, it may not be the best combat system in the world, but it's well implemented which is just great.● There is , so you can not only finish the collectibles and achievements, but also complete unfinished side and extra quests.● If you forgot where we are, this is a real magical world, so grow flowers, collect herbs and make potions, and don't forget to pet and feed magical beasts. Everything is in real time, online farm lovers, even if the time periods are short and can get even shorter since you can use fertilizers. This is , baby!● There are , and you can pet them all. . There are lots of unnatural-looking things, given the fact this is England in the 19th century. After finishing the game, I still have barely anything special to tell about the plot. . Despite the fact I have mixed feelings about many things, or the fact Hogwarts Legacy has poor optimization and many limitations, and there is also no quidditch, I liked it. Hogwarts Legacy is definitely worth the money, and I got pleasure exploring the world, casting magic and finishing the collectibles. ."

Harry Potter fan, etc etc.Let me tell you the THINGS I DON'T like about the game:Sometimes the world feels very empty even though you find students and people everywhere. BUT THEY NEVER REACT TO ANYTHING YOU DO. There are beds and you have a bedroom BUT YOU CAN'T SLEEP IN IT. You DON'T even get a CHEST to put cool gear that you find and DON'T want to SELL even if you can make other gear LOOK LIKE the one you like. Sometimes we just like knowing that we can hang on to legendary stuff and keep it. You CAN'T SIT in chairs with other students and just watch them do their weird things. YOU ONLY FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PART OF THE WORLD DURING MISSIONS. That's the only time that NPC's react and interact with you. GREAT GAME for Harry Potter universe FANS. NOT SO MUCH for OPEN WORLD players who WANT AN IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE sadly."
67,Cebi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cebi/,131,4,1,57.4,February,26,462,0,1,"- To play this game for me personally was a childhood dream come true. It's fulfils that itch of being a wizard.- Riled up people on social media should not stop you playing this game if you really want to.- All the complaints I have about this game are minuscule, like the removal of Quidditch.- Never the less, I think they will probably add Quidditch in DLC, then we will have the complete package!- So let's go over some of the things I like and the minor inconveniences the game, first the negatives:- We have all probably noticed, the game lags at higher graphics, even on good systems, why is this?- Over all my searching, it seems like there is severe memory leak issues with this game.- More over, there are some backend bugs due to how the source code was implemented into the game.- Everything you can do to limit this won't fix that, you need Ascendio mod to have a chance to fix it.- Not sure if this will be fixed in future, but if you are fine with mods, there is at least a good fix for it.- As for gameplay itself, I wish you could reset talents, also I hope we get an increase in spell variety.- Really, the gameplay is fine, very fluid, could do with some touch ups in dodge indicators, seen it bug a bit.- Evil characters wont have THAT much consequences either, like Avada Kedavra is just like saying a swear.- Not seen much bugs, I did fall through the floor once which was weird, it didn't let me open my map either.- On top of that, sometimes rolling and climbing are a bit... inconsistent, you can end up in unintended places.- Take the Witches Tomb, there is a platform you can climb up, only a specific angle.... for some reason...???- Bugs and weird gameplay aside. They seem fairly minimal, let's talk about the forced ""representation"":- Every dialogue option refers to you as ""They"", I get it's due to 'modern times' but it feels very out of place.- In some dialogue it just doesn't flow well, it's like they intended the dialogue to have he/him and she/her.- Now I don't mind if they was an option, but the other two options should also be a thing.- Guess they wanted to avoid drama from the mob, at that point, was just a futile effort, same with Sirona.- Kindness and empathy may be the intention of the developers, but it just comes off as pandery after a while.- I do admit though, these interactions are not that bad and are far between. Doesn't impede the game really.- Let's talk about the unforgivables: OP, not as OP as you think. You will run Avada Kedevra all the time.- Learning new spells sometimes is a waste since you wont use them but more variety is always good tbh.- Every spell has a use but some overlap. I wish the Room of Requirements spells didn't need to be hot barred.- Difficulty is pretty decent, but you could go through this entire game without being hit once I think.- Oh also forgot, the stealth system is a bit  bare boned but it's also not the worst, needs expanding to be sure.- Very nearly every situation can be overcame with brute force, there are small required stealth parts tho.- Even then, these are scripted parts, not something you would naturally use in the open world as much.- Really... overall, these are BARELY nitpicks at all.- The combat is excellent and so many combos, load outs and rotations I've seen on youtube.- Hitting people with certain spells feels so punchy. The fantasy is there for being a truly powerful wizard.- I personally like to use expelliarmus to disarm opponents then use Magic to throw their weapons at them.- Sound is also great, every spell has a unique feel and puts you into that fantasy of being a wizard so well.- Game of the year contender to be sure. Though I suppose it isn't all that revolutionary, it's just plain fun.- Another open world game, but at least this time, you have a true feeling of fantasy and role play.- Minus some of the forced dialogue, the script for the game ain't bad, funny moments too with students.- Every npc seems to have some trigger that makes them say something at certain times or do something.- To me as well, the characters are great, already seeing people thirst over the Herbology teacher, jeez lmao.- Overall the charecterization of each house is spot on, I love the clothing, the areas and the students designs.- Until they allow Quidditch or house points, this can be expanded on, it's mostly cosmetic at the moment.- Common rooms too look nice, not any customization there, but that is what the room of requirement is for.- Hufflepuff has the best Jackdaw mission btw, they go to a very well known place in the wizarding world.- Great game.- Reccomend to anyone who loves the wizarding world.- All the things you expect are here, not rocking the boat but what we need right now.- Salazar.- Slytherin."

In most of the dialogue you can choose what to say. We have many ways to pass the mission. Each mission is interesting and different than earlier. We also have riddle games and good sidequests.Gameplay - 9/10Beautiful open world giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore Hogwart, caves, forests, mountains and doing much more things. The map is very large. Herbalism and Alchemy are important and helps a lot, we also can upgrade equipments. We can have a real wizzard adventure. Fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying.Characters - 10/10Each character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We also can choose the path of the main character be good wizzard or bad (unforgivable spells) but the game won't punish us for it.Graphics - 10/10Graphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. The movement of water, clouds are very well refined. We can see falling leaves, changing weather. It makes a huge impression.Sounds - 9/10Music and ambient sounds in this game fits great. We can listen climatic music which is selected for each moment of the game. Character voices are not my favourite but it fits into character. There is a lot of music known from the movies.Overall - 9.5/10If you are thinking about purchase this game, if you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend these game for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun comes from that game.

Developers clearly focused on quantity over quality, it felt like I was playing a Ubisoft game before I gave up on them;- You can't get the final cutscene unless you reach level 34 by the time you finish the main story, and that means you have to drag yourself through repetitive content to finish the game."

73,jeffv0id,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffvoid/,47,2,1,109.5,February,11,532,15,1,"This game is a dream come true. I waited 20 years for this. I'm every second of this, the atention to detail is amazing. And sometimes you get the Skyrim vibes. The OST is amazing and pays tribute to John William's with lots of variations from the OG.I gotta adress the elephant in the room tho: performance is not great. It boggles my mind that they chose to go with Unreal Engine 4 for a game of this magnitude, specially when one of WB's own devs have an amazing engine ""Firebird"" from Monolith (used in Shadow of War), which these devs could have borrowed if WB wasn't to give monolith the project for what reason may be (maybe because they are doing wonder-woman). My point is, UE4 is dated. It used single threaded performance so the 1% lows are disgusting and all over the place (12900K + 4090). The hardcoded TAA to mask the engine's limits and rough edges is vomit inducing at times.2nd- Complaint: They should have gone further with this project. NPC colision and interaction specially inside the school. Day and night cicle is there but there is no mandatory curfew and no eating schedule and classes are not times. So it all feels off somehow. They should have gone with an aproach á lá Kingdom Come Deliverance on this imo.Alas, no game is perfect, maybe the potterhead in me makes turn a blind eye to all the shortcomings in this game, because when at its peak this game really does shine and any fan will have goosebumps. The wasted potential may be mitigated with mods as i already seen some mods on Nexus and there already a mod loader (btw, theres a mod to unlock all PS5 exclusive content but requires a new save to get the mission, but potion works regardless)And there you go. im sure im missing a lot of stuff, but i recomend this game for all fans, and to non fans who like a RPG lite, story driven game. 9/10"
74,Arcandres,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Arcandres/,105,4,1,11.0,February,18,519,3,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a game that shows a lot of promise. The immersive atmosphere and top-notch cinematics make you feel like you're really part of the wizarding world. The flying mechanics are also a standout feature, providing a thrilling and fun experience. However, the game does have some issues that hold it back. The lack of freedom is a noticeable downside, as it would have been great to have more control over your actions as a student. Additionally, the lack of optimization can be frustrating at times, as it impacts the overall performance and can be a distraction from the otherwise engaging gameplay. Overall, Hogwarts Legacy has a lot to offer for fans of the Harry Potter universe. While there are some areas that could be improved, the immersive atmosphere, thrilling flying mechanics, and detailed world-building make it a fun and enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of the series or just looking for a new adventure, Hogwarts Legacy is definitely worth checking out.PD: Don't be fooled by my playtime, I was mostly offline playing."

I only enjoyed the initial part of the game, once you play longer, you'll notice there are some stuffs the developers could have done better. Things to improve:- Better NPC dialogue/ mini-conversations (NPC are just spewing lines after lines with no relevancy when talking to one another in the living world, no proper conversation)  - Increase enemy variety- Dynamic HUD (It's too cluttered)- Dynamic camera controls (Explore - Far, Combat - Near)- Quidditch  To name a few... shall wait patiently for Day 1 update and mods,"
79,Zuluf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zulufski/,71,4,1,35.5,March,1,682,2,1,"Hogwarts Legacy functions as a pez dispenser for memberberries for anyone who grew up reading Harry Potter’s wizard school adventures. Even though the setting is 19th century Hogwarts and most characters and plotlines are completely divorced from the main series, there are plenty of easter eggs, references and “he said the THING” moments to feed your millennial childhood nostalgia. Furthermore, we get to visit various locations and use a bunch of MacGuffins that directly reference events from the books (which kind of makes you wonder why a 5th year like the game’s protagonist is taking the same mandrake 101 class as Harry did in his first year, but I digress).You start out by customizing your hero by choosing your appearance, gender, voice (one male, and one female). Your avatar receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts as a late fifth year student. Enter Eleazar Fig, your own personal mentor, who will help you harness a newly awakened form of ancient magic. After an introductory misadventure in Gringotts and a Sorting Ceremony in which you get to choose your own House, you are free to tackle the magic academy and surrounding grounds (including the Forbidden Forest, Hogsmeade and other iconic locations). Later in the game you get flying mounts in the form of either a broom or a hippogryph, as well as a massive ground mount that can ram enemies and obstacles.Sadly, there’s no Quidditch, ostensibly because it got banned by the headmaster (Phineas Nigellus Black, a rather unpleasant fellow and Sirius’ ancestor), which limits the usage of your broom for map navigation, a couple of sidequests and popping collectible balloons. Just feels like a missed opportunity. You will gradually learn tens of spells during your schoolyear, varying from combat to utility spells and you’ll have more and more access to the map as you gain the power to destroy obstacles. There’s also a skill tree and as you complete your Field Guide (basically an album with all your collectibles) and complete Challenges you also unlock more inventory space, cosmetics and runes you can upgrade your gear with. For the most part, the mechanics used by the game are par for the course in the whole open-world action/adventure genre: you have stealth and the obligatory takedowns, there’s the whole twin-stick orientation lockpicking when you Alohomora a locked door and you have a form of basic color coding to complicate the combat a little bit (you have to cast either red, yellow or blue spells to pop enemy shield of their respective color). Enemies you fight can be spiders, goblins, dark wizards, trolls and a few other types, but for the most part are just fodder for your ever-expanding arsenal of combos and damage spells. Most of the time you’ll only use four quickslots, but you can unlock extra sets to accommodate a more versatile playstyle. The combat resembles Arkham-type dancing where you alternate your offensive strings with timed parries and dodges and try to sustain a high combo count by not getting hit. For the most part, these things feel like threaded ground and might even become tedious after a while. It doesn’t help that the game’s main story sports a couple of one-dimensional villains and the plot feels like a salad in which they wanted to include as many fanservice elements as possible (you go from visiting a vault in Gringotts during a goblin assault to revisiting memories in pensieves to trying to unravel the mystery of the Deathly Hallows). Despite the generous playtime (around thirty hours to finish the main story and about 70% of challenges in my experience), Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t take much time to develop its central characters. There’s a lot of diversity in almost every aspect but not a lot of depth - the stakes are higher and the drama is more impactful in Sebastian Sallow’s quest chain than the main story. On the plus side, the game looks absolutely gorgeous. There’s an almost painterly look and the gloomy weather really enhances the elaborate architecture and detailed models. If you wanted to explore Hogwarts in an elaborate, big-budget way this is your best chance - meeting ghosts, opening secret tunnels and running errands through huge, ever-shifting staircases feels like a wizard-themed playthrough of Bully. Little subplots and grievances you solve intertwine with classes where you unlock new abilities and tools, and there’s even a day/night cycle that affects available content (although in Hogwarts Legacy there’s no time limit to doing anything and you can’t skip classes). Speaking of upgrading, there’s a pretty elaborate crafting system that has you collect ingredients for potions from plants that you grow yourself or buy from vendors, and gear upgrades require stuff you can collect from beasts you grow and breed. To that end, The Room of Requirement returns from the book series and serves as your personal sandbox. The game does a good job of not feeling overwhelming or pressy about its open-world content. Even though there are dozens of activities, over fifty sidequests, puzzles of a wide variety and hundreds of collectibles, you can easily go through the story without touching them and won’t feel underpowered or like you’re missing out. Some of the content is locked behind spells, which you will learn by attending classes and doing assignments for your professors.Is Hogwarts Legacy worth it? If you’re a Harry Potter fan and aren’t tired of the framework these types of triple AAA sandbox actioners employ, by all means. You get around 60 hours of gametime if you want to collect everything (according to my estimates) and will enjoy a more than competent and varied (if not particularly well-written or deep) experience."

84,Snorkel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SandvichToaster/,74,6,1,137.5,March,3,633,0,1,"It's a good game!I have completed the game. This game constantly introduces new spells and mechanics as you progress through the story. I'm a gamer who is accustomed to ignoring the story missions until 40 hours later - don't do that. You'll want access to spells and pickups before you really get exploring. I recommend PRIORITISE THE STORY MISSIONS THROUGHOUT"". It is very hard to not get distracted along the way.Gameplay - It's all about exploring, finding collectables, opening doors, solving puzzles and finding secrets. Most puzzles give rewards. The Hogwarts castle is huge. The surrounding area is also huge. There is a LOT to explore.This game is NOT about making decisions and seeing changes from those decisions. Most dialogue choices early game are just for Roleplay, are you boastful or humble, nice or snarky?  I don't believe these have any impact. Near the end of the game there are a couple of quest choices that do have impact. Those choices are obvious, you get asked a question in a quest and you can choose one of two answers. No need to worry about saying the wrong thing through most of the game.Combat - there are four spell types, damage (slice, set alight etc), control (slow, cause to float etc), movement (push, pull etc) and utility (light, repair etc). The first three are used in combat, and the spell types are colour coded. Sometimes an enemy can only be effected with a control spell, and after that you'll be able to do damage normally. There is dodging and shielding. I played on 'normal', and found combat to have a good flow. It is fun, challenging enough to not be too easy, but not frustratingly difficult either.Stealing - nobody cares about stealing. Just pick locks right in front of people, it's totally fine.Stealth - There are only a couple of short mission sections that require stealth. Both are sections you can return to later, so no need to explore everywhere while trying to stay hidden. You may use stealth in open world for sneak attacks, but it's not required or necessary.Game resources - You can craft potions, and use grow plants that can act like turrets or grenades. Honestly, the only potion I used in the entire game was the health potion, and I rarely remembered or needed to use the plants (on normal). You'll end up with more money than you know what to do with. I had close to 50,000 at the end of my game. The only one that I found really important was using the loom to upgrade items (unlocks a long way through the story).Performance - I'm running a 1080GTX and expected to be playing on Low, but I could actually turn it up to Medium, and I'm quite happy with the performance. Only occasional hitching is seen.Clothes - Clothes are important. You can tell this, because you'll complete a dungeon that's worthy of Indiana Jones, and in the big glowy chest at the end you'll find . . . dun dun dun . . . An Old School Uniform! You have a bunch of gear slots. Found items have defense stats and can have special abilities as well. This game DOES HAVE transmog, and you should use it. Put on your outlandish glasses, go back to the top 'Gear' screen and use the prompt to change the appearance of the gear to match any gear you have found/sold/destroyed so far in the game.Character creation - DO NOT change the voice pitch of your characters, they'll sound weird. If you DO change it, you can actually go to the audio options menu and change it back. You don't get to fully customize your character appearances. There are 30 head shapes to choose from (15 each feminine/masculine), 50 hairstyles, 20 skin tones (there's a mod if they don't go light or dark enough for you), hair colours, freckles and moles, scars, eye colour, eyebrow shape, masculine or feminine voice, and whether you sleep in the Witch or Wizards dorm.Dorms - directly from the books, wizards cannot enter the witch's dorms. In Ravenclaw, enchanted suits of armour with polearms will block the stairs, in the other three dorms, the stairs turn into slides as you try to go up them. Whether you want to explore the whole dorm, or experience the slides may influence your decisions. The Ravenclaw and Slytherine dormitories are basically mirror images of each other and roughly identical, you're not missing anything by going as a wizard. The Gryffindor witch's dorms are very different to the wizards and worth seeing. In Hufflepuff, the balcony area outside the witch's dorms is also worth visiting.LGBTQ+ inclusion - this game has gay NPCs, a transgender NPC (with a transgender voice actor), and allows full voice/face/dorm picking options for characters.Violence - there is a surprising amount of murder in this game. You'll constantly be fighting Dark Wizards, Goblins, Wolves, Giant Spiders (there's a mod for that) etc, and you're getting rewarded for defeating them. If you want a game for yourself or a child with lower violence, this is not the game for you.Racism - so far I have seen zero evidence that the goblins may be a racist stereotype. NPC characters represent a solid range of racial backgrounds.Mods - this game supports mods. I have not installed any yet, but it's good to know they're there.Complaints:- The map does not show you the corridor detail, except in the little minimap in the corner. It's a bit annoying.- Only 4 character slots. My instinct was to create 5 or 6 characters, play them all for half an hour and then decide which to continue with. Nope. 4 characters only.- Getting inundated with too much clothing that I've picked up, and the puzzles to get more slots being a third of the way through the story missions.- Some of the mechanics are unintuitive, like using the map to its full potential, figuring out how to change gear appearance.- Can't skip the tutorial prologue for new characters.- Bug reporting is a bit harder than necessary, you need to sign up on the WB website. They'll only consider bugs that get enough votes. I had a bug that caused a mission to be incompletable, I had to abandon the mission and start it again from the beginning. The bug report didn't get enough votes in their system for them to even look at it. *sigh*So, all just minor things really. It's a good game."
85,OMN1CRON (🔨 WORKCATION 🌴),https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/,449,19,1,98.6,February,12,"1,856",53,1,"I was playing the game on another account and I have no reason to write a fake review or get paid for it, so calm down about game timeIn Hogwarts Legacy we play a new student who comes to magic school. As previously known, we start with the character in fifth grade and not as usual, as an eleven-year-old in the first year. And yes, as the story progresses it becomes clear why that is.The main mission series, i.e. the core of the game, has been implemented flawlessly, is absolutely creative and not only takes place in the open world.I was really impressed with some of the things the developers came up with, especially towards the end of the main story.In addition, the cutscenes are graphically on film level and the story is told in an exciting and interesting way. Also, there is no shying away from death and violence and you experience a lot of fan service with attention to detail and only rarely does it get overly sentimental.The character editor is solid but doesn't allow for an excessive number of options. You can only select pre-made faces and characters. Unfortunately, there are no other personalization options. Therefore, the number of assets is also noticeable in the game because in the castle you always meet the same people or very similar ones. Basically, the castle is not overly busy and it is noticeable that grades one to four, six and seven are not available at all.I can imagine that this is partly due to the fact that not so many character models should be designed and even more NPCs would probably have caused a stuttering orgy.I also have the feeling that the character animations have been cut back a bit and there are some clipping errors. Basically, however, all character models are really pretty and the coats, scarves and capes are designed great, even if they quickly develop a life of their own when moving and flap around wildly. If you overlook the few little things, you get an absolutely beautiful game that can convince with both the graphics and the spectacular scenery. The faces look alive and you can read the emotions that go with what is happening, and the overall animation of the characters is very believable.In general, the world is very harmonious and you quickly feel at home. The areas in the castle are strongly inspired by the films and outside they have detached themselves more from them, but still made sure to create a world in which one likes to move.You can tell on every corner that the developers put their hearts into it and you constantly come across lovely details such as decorative objects, scattered lore and one or the other side quest.And finally, the musical cherry on top of the sundae with cream.There's no direct soundtrack from the films, but the music is pretty damn close and really, really good. I also liked the fact that there is no excessive continuous sound and the developers have found a good mix of when scenes are “bombastic” accompanied and when things should be a little quieter.The overall result is a production that really convinced me and made me forget the real world for hours.The main missions are quite varied and the game world changes as they progress. There are several seasons that change when you reach certain story moments. The side missions, on the other hand, are not tied to the seasons and therefore cannot be missed.However, it can quickly become confusing in the quest menu if you only accept the challenges and never complete them.As far as the demands of the side missions are concerned, this varies greatly. There are classic ""boring"" collection tasks but also missions that lead you to hidden places that you probably wouldn't have seen otherwise. And for the fact that these are purely optional areas, some of them are really impressive. In the lessons, you can expect a wide variety of challenges depending on the subject. All the different types of teaching are all well implemented and the professors appear as believable personalities who take great care of us. After all, we have a lot of catching up to do and that happens with… exactly, homework. Sounds really bad, but it really isn't because it loosens up the events for a while and there are additional magic rewards.I think that with the spells, a lot of attention was paid to player friendliness, because there are almost no annoying elements and spells have a long range and there is no cooldown for them outside of combat. Flying with the broom, which you unlock after a few hours of play and use constantly from then on, was also implemented very well. The controls work great and I'm really not a good flyer in such games. You're fast in the open world and it feels great. The view you have is absolutely awesome and I like to fly a little longer instead of using fast travel. A little less spectacular but somehow even cooler are the flying mounts that you unlock a little later. Basically, these do exactly the same thing as the broom, although they may seem a bit slower and don't feel quite as agile, but there's something absolutely epic about it compared to a magic broom. Of course you will have to fight too. And these are great fun.We have a standard spell, a block-counter mechanic, and the different spell classes. Enemies create colored shields that can be countered with the right type of spell. The great thing is that each spell also has a unique ability and it's not just the color coding that matters. This allows you to try different tactics and quickly develop your own magical fighting style. The game still has a replay value because the main quest is played differently in the different houses and the students react differently to it. And since you often have the choice of how to decide, a second run is probably just as much fun because you can try out the unused dialogue options. Ultimately, however, it is up to each individual to what extent the passages then differ from one another.Even after the main story, it's still worth playing because the final exam of the fifth grade is waiting for you. So there's a good reason to keep zipping through Hogwarts after the credits roll, doing side quests and engaging in battles.The game doesn't reinvent the wheel and comparable fights, quests and open world tasks can be found in other games, but the creative and clever implementation of the story events in a video game design, coupled with the new game mechanics that are presented every few hours I was pleasantly and positively surprised. The game has many allusions to the Harry Potter world, but still has its own and new ideas that the developers turn into unforgettable game moments.Review date: February 11, 2023✔ long story campaign✔ magical and enormously detailed game world✔ atmospheric music✔ great fights through magic combos✔ lots to discover ✔ game mechanics clearly explained✔ letters give backgrounds to the game world✔ Harry Potter charm with lots of fan service✔ interesting side missions and collection tasks✔ world invites you to explore✔ countless puzzles and mysteries✘ quite stiff facial animations✘ no Morality System, Quidditch✘ sometimes very artificial-looking dialogues"

A story we value along side the beloved cannon. Hogwarts Legacy is proving to be sitting in the very epicenter of the spirit of what is the Harry Potter universe.the game sucks you in and doesnt let go, especially if you already adore the lore of this world.an original story that is rapturous in the fantasy we so longed for from this franchise.x1000 recommended"

I will lay the issues out. ISSUES:- Graphical Poppins- frame drops (even on rtx 4090)- NPC dialogue makes no sense (NPC conversations consists of asking each other random questions with no responses) - Unable to interact with NPCs (you literally walk through NPCs. I want to be able to cast random spells like levioso on students and have them react accordingly. Currently you are a ghost to everyone, besides supporting cast.) - OMG the Cats have no hair or textures. Like I said overall it's a fun game. I'd give a 7 or 8 / 10"
