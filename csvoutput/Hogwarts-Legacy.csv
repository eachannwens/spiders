0,Tamaster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tho545454/,"3,787",46,1,81.6,February,25,918,70,1,"Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the iconic Wizarding World setting created by J.K. Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. The main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.The world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. Most dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.Magical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. Combat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.Quests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. Challenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort."

5,▮ NO FILE,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yonaga/,"6,625",120,1,89.3,February,10,"2,760",144,1,"Sometimes games are getting released with way too much hype. Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don't even get me started with license games in general....Hogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.I don't usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of ""Harry Potter"" made me buy it in an instant.The following review won't contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.So far so good. It starts off with a generic ""You are the chosen one!"" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don't want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn't be able to stop reading it until the very end.Overwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.First off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.Then you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.Also: You don't get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.If you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the ""Floo powder"" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  Decorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! What would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. Fighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. For your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.The further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.As a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.There is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.I just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! Just wow!  Hogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don't even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.I play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won't be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!Simply magical!I also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!"

9,Kujar3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kujar3Player/,"1,067",19,1,58.8,February,13,"1,552",18,1,"I could gush about this forever. The world is so well crafted and there was so much love put into it, it's kind of absurd. You start off in the castle, it's bloody massive, very faithful to the template you know, it's clear they tried their best to do a 1:1 replica. Walking through the halls and rooms in ecstatic, never did I feel that exploration is in any way forced, I was encouraged to explore and I have yet to properly utilize fast travel, it just doesn't get old and I still keep bumping into corridors that eluded me, still finding new things. And that's JUST the castle, the moment you look past the castle and take in the sheer scope of the world, it is possitively jaw dropping. The world is ginormous and the developers found clever things to sprinkle everywhere you go. Every now and then you bump into a small village out there, each one is different and again, very detailed and even tho they keep the same aesthetic, it never felt like exploring more of the same. It is honestly kind of overwhelming how much there is to find and play around with, this is a real work of art that even if you do not fancy the world of Harry Potter, should give you plenty of enjoyement to travel through.I jumped in on Hard difficulty as I was seeking some challenge out of this, however not much challenge is really provided. I keep being capped on my healing potions, rarely having to reach out for them. There are moments that test you certainly, large group of enemies are fun to tackle and the higher difficulty does not allow you to make many mistakes. Combat is satisfying, you generally play with a selection of 4 main spells you chose, from what you have learned, but you're not limited to them. You get up to 4 spell tabs for a total of 16 spells at the ready that you can switch between during combat at will. You'll learn combos of spells that work well together and swinging your wand around will feel really good. Enemies attack back with attacks you can protect against and ones you can only dodge, always visually apparent by a different colored circle around your head, it's a simple nuance but you'll trip up here and there, game doesn't make you feel invincible. Enemy variety could be larger, but it's not absolutely terrible, what's a bit of a shame is that you rarely battle more than 1 enemy type at the same time, maybe that's something that will be happening more later on, I can imagine that could spice up combat a bit. Every enemy type has some kind of weakness for you to discover and you'll be keeping mental notes.Beyond your spell selection, there is not really much else you can do to build your character differently, all gear slots are basically stat sticks that you can eventually augment a bit for specific situations but I feel like it's nothing too significant. Still they made the best out of what they had, maybe gearing being more casual was the goal here.The story is intriguing but nothing ground breaking, so far it stands on its own pretty well, without spoiling as this is in the opening scenes, you learn that your character can see traces of ancient magic which leads you on a path to pursue this calling, but there's a faction of goblins and their leader who are after the same thing, the knowledge of great magic that's only rumored to exist, very few people in the past knew of its existence and could wield it. The game presents sense of urgency while also intentionally slowing you down, but you can argue it is doing so for you to slowly master this magic and uncover the whole truth so I give it a pass. As for sidequesting, you have the usual fetch quests most of the time, that are made interesting by the possibilities a world like this can present. I never felt annoyed doing a side quest that was simply ""deliver"" or ""find and bring"" as it pointed me to places to discover, this is very much carried by the setting and the amazing world. Some side quests are more convoluted and eventually lead you to what could be described as collectible chains. The game slowly introduces collectibles and series of puzzles for you to complete through side quests and it kind of feels natural. The only time I wasn't happy with this was when the unlocking spell ""alohomora"" was locked behind one of those, multiple tiers of it even, as someone who wants to unlock every door, I felt forced to go on collectible hunting but in the end, again, I was happy doing so as it led me places... Did I mention exploration is fun yet?Flying! My god, getting your first broom and taking to the skies feels surreal. You could fast travel, sure, but why would you when you can fly? Game places very few restrictions on where you can and can't fly, practically the whole world is traversable on a mount, it's amazing.Room of Requirement. If you like creating your own space or ever found yourself lost in building a house in The Sims, this will be right up your alley, everything is customizable and by exploring you will find more items to place down,, but this feature got overshadowed for me by taking care of your own beasts. I damn nearly cried grooming and feeding the creatures, it's so adorable, I could spend hours just watching them in the space you get for them, this is my single most favorite feature.Beast catching. You have to catch your beasts so better go out there hunting, many types of beasts to catch and bring home out there in the world. Some are easy to catch, some harder, always having to find the best approach, it's honestly fun.Reputation system, honestly, the game allows you to cast unforgivable curses and nobody seems to care you do so. You can fling avada kedavra next to dozens of witnesses and most you may get is a couple of comments. I wish there were some drawbacks, if not in ""reputation"" then at least visually, think Mass Effect 2 where Shepard would look more scarred the more evil you'd be. I'd take anything.Points system, it's Hogwards, part of it is winning points for your house and while during some quests you get the ""points to *your house here*"" comment, it isn't reflected anywhere. There's virtually no rivalry between the houses as a result.Quidditch, please... The game comes up with an excuse to not have it but man, what a shame.And lastly, I would like to see some deeper relationship feature, building friendship with some important characters, outside of main quests. Doing things for them and maybe being able to take them with you on your exploratory adventures. When I think Harry Potter, I also think of the friendship the main group had going for them, it sometimes feels a bit lonely in this giant world.Performance is rocky, the game drops frames unexplainably, in cutscenes and in a few areas, this is something that can be fixed with patches so hopefully it'll improve.Voice pitch? Don't even bother, leave it on the default spot when creating your character. It makes your voice robotic, echoey and just plain weird. Been resolved, you now get 10 character slots.This game makes me feel like a kid again, I don't remember the last time I was this happy and eager to explore a world, this is coming from someone who grew up on HP, this is all practically a wet dream made real. I am overjoyed the be part of all this and despite knowing this could be a much better game, both improved in what it offers and in some of the glaring issue it has, I can overlook it because so much of this game has been crafted with a lot of love. Bravo, loving every second of it."

13,[HH]Volstraiger,https://steamcommunity.com/id/volstraiger/,"1,213",21,1,74.0,February,12,132,0,1,"So I have finished my first playthrough of the game, have put 57.9 hours into it at this point and completed the content to 100% outside of a few steam trophies.Personally, I have really enjoyed this game and think it's a great release and everything I ever wanted out of a Harry Potter game. The story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.I have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.Outside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries. I believe a lot of people may enjoy playing as an Auror or a Unspeakable."

You play as one of the Hogwarts students learning the world and exploring its secrets. Dangers are at every step and it's up to you to become the most powerful witch or wizard Hogwarts has seen in a long time. Rate: ★★★★☆ Surprisingly the game has a lot more to offer than what trailers show. Combat feels good, with a large array of spells that controls the battlefield and gives you the freedom to do whatever you like.Learning new spells is done via side quests and main missions which oftentimes are pretty nicely crafted. In the game you are faced with a lot of collecting, puzzle-solving, exploring, and sightseeing.Although some areas of exploration can get a bit too much even for the ones that wish to complete the game 100%, the game can be fully enjoyed, and go through the main campaign and pick the side quests with a lot of enjoyment. Rate: ★★★★★  I've had a lot of fun exploring this game. Hogwarts is rich with fun areas to explore. The world continues to impress you and learning new skills and putting them to test is fun and rewarding.  Rate: ★★★★★ This game looks absolutely stunning and it would be without a doubt one of the best-looking games I've played this year. Ray-tracing adds up with a great umph to the overall look, but due to poor performance, it can be heavily costly on your GPU.The world and the key areas look distinguished, remarkable, and jaw-dropping. This game is a really pretty game and each screenshot I took I am not ashamed to share. Rate: ★★★★★Sound effects and voice acting are strong in this game and oftentimes feel very polished. I did find some skipped dialogues by the end of some conversations which may be a bug, but other than that, I think pretty much all dialogues and characters are well-voiced.I have to remark that there's a large array of English dialects, from African, possible Uganda, to Indian accents are well done and feels nice to be able to hear such differences.  Rate: ★★★★☆ Although the end of the game felt a bit weak and the villain wasn't necessarily defined very well, the whole build-up of the story is interesting until that point. Characters are fascinating and despite not being a fan of Harry Potter, I can say that the world and the people are extremely interesting and I was easily captivated by the visuals and the theme the game presents.  🔲  Short (1-8h)🔲 Medium (8-15h)🔲 Long  (15-25h)☑️ Very Long  (25h+)🔲 Unlimited  It's a fairly long game if you intend to finish this game completely and do all 4 houses. The main story alone takes a while and some side quests are too interesting to skip.   ☑️ Easy ☑️ Normal ☑️ Hard 🔲 Brutally Hard 🔲 Impossible  The game isn't too difficult and unless you wish a slightly bigger challenge there is something for you. By the end of the game, as you understand the mechanics of the game and how combat works you'll become a powerful wizard/witch. Hogwarts Legacy is by far one of the best Harry Potter games ever created and this opens up to new possibilities for this IP. As a non-fan of the franchise, I think the game offers a strong open-world experience without overwhelming you with lots of tasks to do, unless you wish to do them. Puzzles are rather simple, but fun and the whole world made me appreciate the game even more."

I wanted to add a few more thoughts.My daughter who is closing in on 18, and my half century year old self have both been fans of Harry Potter and the Wizarding World. I read the books to her when she was younger and then on my own. We’ve watched the movies and it has always been great bonding for us.I preordered the Deluxe edition on Steam when it first came available. I knew my Desktop would handle it but had some concerns about the Steam Deck which has become my device of choice to game on when I feel up to it health wise. Luckily it got Steam Deck Verified before early launch.During early launch we spent about about 10 hours into the game. I put a couple hours in on my Steam Deck with no issues and it ran a solid 30 FPS except the very sparse drop to mid to high 20s on some cutscenes. Note that I made no changes to the stock installation settings. Also note that I play in performance mode as I am plugged in while in bed or on the sofa 99% of my playtime. My daughter had about 8 on our primary desktop which is an aging i5-7400 @ 3Ghz, 16GB RAM, SSD with a GeForce 1060 GTX and reported no issues either.At this point we have over 35 hours in with the majority of them being my daughter on the PC and me making up about a third of the remaining hours on the Deck. During those hours we each experienced one crash. For her it was a CTD for myself it was a crash that locked up Proton causing a force restart of the switch. Note both of these crashes were prior to the Day 1 patch and we haven’t ran into any further issues since.Gameplay is fun and a lot more interesting and in-depth than I expected. Learning the various arts like potion making, herbalism, and so long always gives you something to do. I am known for almost always turning off in game music but the soundtrack is perfect for reminding you what world you are in. There are more than enough side quests to keep you busy, to the point of falling behind and losing track of the main quest.There are puzzles at every turn that are both hard but not impossible. I have yet to have to refer to a walkthrough as much as at times I wanted to. This game really keeps you wanting to avoid spoilers and accomplish things on your own. You will meet a lot of classmates and others on and off campus, however there is really a fairly limited pool that you regularly interact with. That said you will quickly make close friends and even your own Draco Malfoy types who you will hate but might end up have a truce with.All in all my daughter and my biggest complaint is the lack of better character customization. There are a fair number of presets but there is no ability to adjust outside those presets such as adjust lips or cheeks, noses to your own design outside the presets slider. There is no hight or weight adjustment. I like the amount of control over skin tones and as mentioned there are a fair amount of sliders.However by modern standards it’s barebones. It’s sad when I have played phone f2p games that have better character creation when you can only really only see your character at the selection screen than a $70-90 USD that everyone is going to want to go all out on character design. It is for this primary reason along with my dislike of how hard on the Deck and I assume PC selection of Foo Flame travel points is harder than it should be. I watched my daughter do fast travel via KVM and it was smooth as could be. I do so on the deck and I eventually give up and fly or walk there.That said we still rate this game a very strong 9/10 and already call it GOTY for us."

37,Elysian,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Elysian1_/,649,13,1,93.4,February,17,610,58,1,"While not as good as our dreams, Hogwarts Legacy is nevertheless a decent game that exudes the visual charm and beauty of J.K. Rowling’s fantasy world well. It is burdened by performance issues, a somewhat hollow world, and some small, though cumulatively bothersome design oversights, but with a passable story and mostly enjoyable gameplay it lands itself a generally positive recommendation.•	GeForce GTX 1660Ti•	8GB DDR4@1330MHz•	i5 9300H @2.4GHz•	HDD 7200RPM*Game requires min. 16GB RAM.Initially unplayable on low, changing system and game settings resulted in a fairly playable game at medium - low settings. A recent patch improved it a bit, and while there are FPS drops, there’s less freezing. Hogwarts’ architecture is breath-taking, and outdoor environments are varied and beautiful – some dark and creepy, others warm and vibrant. It’s a visual masterpiece, and the atmosphere of the Wizarding world is brilliantly captured. It’s absurd there’s no photo mode.Some house and dungeon interiors are repeated, which feels lazy, but you're only there briefly to loot chests. Important places you visit often are unique.Spells are colourful and vibrant, and particle effects are pretty, with light wisps, auras and ‘sparks’ lending a magical quality to the game. Performance aside, these are smooth and satisfying to watch, too.While not photorealistic, the artistic style is pleasant, and characters do have well-detailed faces and mostly good expressions.The cast doesn’t feel from 1800, but I’m not so bothered by this. It wasn’t sold as a historical game, and I didn’t expect realism. I didn’t buy this game , but .Our characters are disappointing, with creation based around presets with very limited customisation – worse than Cyberpunk. Female characters in particular look pretty bad. In the world, lighting affects your face sometimes horribly, though cutscenes show how it in better detail. Hogwarts interiors sometimes capture the grandeur of the place in their soundscape in those big open stairways with high ceilings, but I don’t remember losing myself in outdoors nature sounds. Environmental sounds were more remarkable indoors than out, I think.Characters are generally well-spoken which I like, and some personality does come through. Emotion is conveyed fairly well, but rarely to the point it moved me in any way. Our character (female for me) does a good enough job, but I wouldn’t say it was outstanding.Music is pleasant, although sometimes perhaps a little energetic. When exploring, it never made you feel like you were floating on a breeze in this beautiful world, like Skyrim did. It was often quite intense in a way that’s a bit much, though in intense moments it served well. Regardless, it did have a fantasy feel about it, and in that way it fit the game well.The stage is beautiful, but the play is empty. There isn’t much sense of being a Hogwarts student. Classes teach you spells, but feel like tutorials. Once done, you aren’t really a student anymore, and this becomes a typical RPG, lacking RPG features. Extra-curricular assignments don’t change this feeling, and come over more as challenges than student roleplay.You can’t interact with NPCs outside of missions. There’s no companions. Common rooms are lifeless. Mounts don’t stay, despawning when dismounting. At night, the atmosphere is lovely, yet there’s not much to do. We also can’t play Quidditch! They only strength with immersion is the graphics. Beyond that, the game doesn’t capitalise on its unique setting, and feels like any other below average open world RPG as a result.As an RPG it lacks a sense of choice or consequence. While there are different endings, most of the game is linear, and so the room for roleplaying is limited, as is replay value.Combat is challenging without being too hard. Because you have to match spells with defences, you can’t just spam your way through fights, and that makes them feel quite rewarding. So far, I like this, though the abundance of fighting in tougher missions can also be very tiring.I hate the spell toolbar system though. It takes 4 spells, and you can unlock 3 more toolbars, scrolling between them in combat. There are more spells than this though, and I kept needing to change, requiring a visit to the menus. Even with spells I have in my toolbars, scrolling through  is annoying.While overdone and abundant in the world to the point they can feel like mindless busywork, I do actually enjoy ticking these off to 100% the game. There is some variety across different types, so there’s  complexity, without being frustratingly difficult.Crafting isn’t instant, and without minigames, you simply have to wait for a timer up to ~10 mins. This is such an awful, boring design. Once the timer is up, the game won’t produce more either, so you can’t explore and come back to 50 potions, for example.One thing I love about the apparel system is the ability to change the appearance of anything you’re wearing to something you like more while keeping the stats.However, nearly every chest has a clothing item, yet you can carry so few. Upgrades don’t mitigate the problem. Yet I can keep several Hippogriffs in a bag, and brooms in my pocket. This is irritating. Returning to vendors so often is tedious, and destroying the clothes wastes money they could be sold for. It also requires going into the menus and then to return to the world, you have to escape through about three layers of menu. This is like a Ubisoft game - grindy. There’s many repetitive tasks, all of which you have to do to 100%. I expect 100+ hours.The narrative hasn’t moved me as much as I would have liked, but it would be unfair to say it’s bad. It is yet another ‘you are the unique hero who can save the world’ story, which is fine – it’s nice to feel important. But then you are sent on a plentiful amount of fetch and carry missions, and given you’re a young student, adults are quite willing to send you into danger, too.By almost 50 hours in-game at 57% total completion, the story introduces some unlikable enemies and some mildly likeable friends, but none are very memorable. The overarching story is compelling enough to drive the gameplay – there is a  to play on, but rarely do you  the stakes or care about the consequences, as it’s hard to care about most characters. The thing that’s moved me most so far is a mission where you rescue animals. Take that as you will.While I recommend this game, it is also symptomatic of the downward spiral in quality we see these days. It’s quite repetitive and shallow, but some of the sting is taken away by a beautiful world and the Harry Potter setting. Many criticisms I have are small, but together sap the game of charm. When the child-like excitement fades and the product is viewed neutrally, it’s not a masterpiece.The environments are lovely, the audio and puzzles are good, and combat is the right balance of simplicity and challenge for me. Roleplay and immersion are lacking, and the story is mediocre. For these reasons, while I recommend the game, it’s not an overwhelming recommendation. Ultimately, though, do I regret pre-ordering? No, I don’t. I like Hogwarts Legacy. I just don’t love it."

But it is lacking in some small areas. Below I have listed the pros and cons of the game. I also listed what I want to see in the future, as well as what I don't want to see in the future! Keep in mind I am not a massive Harry Potter fan and only have seen the movies a long time ago. This list was made over the course of my playthrough during the 72 hour early access for Deluxe Editon owners, hopefully there is a day 1 patch out by now! Enjoy!• Good Performance (Could be better, but it is very good at least for me)• Great Immersion• Graphics and Art Style• Changing Seasons• Fancy Animation (With spells, puzzles, doors, and all that)• Great Music & Sound Design (Broom class kinda popped off with that music)• Engaging Story/Narrative• Fun Late Game Combat (Ancient magic is sick! Just use your spells and mix it up! It's pretty fun)• Exploration (Rewards you heavily for it)• Detailed & Big World (You can go into any building, find many secrets, solve fun puzzles, pet cats, and much more)• Interesting Characters (There are lots! The voice acting is sometimes bad)• Great Transmog (Once you get the item you keep its appearance for use whenever you want)• Great Quests (There are a ton)• Fun Skins/Outfits (Great outfit pieces, mount skins, wand skins, and all that)• Almost No Bugs (Visual bugs only, most are funny)• No Crashes• Accessibility & UI Options (There are LOTS!)• Graphic Options (Also LOTS!) • NPC Quest Speed (WOW, NPCs that actually move your speed on quests?! More games should do this!)• Room of Requirement (Fun to customize, can be daunting at times)• No Quidditch• Cramped Camera (Sometimes it can be at weird angles, maybe add customizable positions)• Character Customization (I'm referring to the customization at the start of the game, it's a bit iffy)• Voice Pitch (In the character customization menu at the start, every voice pitch besides the default one sounds robotic)• Voice Acting (Sometimes)• Repetitive Early Game Combat (Not a lot of spells to use but it's understandable)• Limited Gear Slots (Can be increased by doing )• Confusing Menu (At first, it was hard for me to get used to it all at once, I couldn't find transmog or my Twitch drops)• Useless Houses (From what I have played your house doesn't mean much)• Useless Wands (When choosing your wand, the attributes don't do anything from what I have seen, from a game standpoint it makes sense)• Small Enemy/Boss Variety ()• Graphical Stuttering (In cutscenes mostly, sometimes happens when entering newly rendered areas)• Lighting Transitions & Flickering (Sometimes the lighting can be blinding, or just straight up weird looking)• Door Loading (When traversing the castle, sometimes the game will show a loading icon on doors)• Robot Background NPCs (They pretty much don't do anything but walk and talk, with no reactions to spells or anything)• NPC AI & Animations (Sometimes it's a bit janky)• Multiplayer (At least Quidditch multiplayer)• Mod Support (Would be awesome, especially Steam Workshop)• Quidditch (They have the Golden Snitch and the arena in-game already)• Camera Control (Positioning, maybe increased FOV slider?)• Photo Mode (Please!)• Better Character Customization (More skin colors, hair, face shapes, and more)• Improved Voice Pitch (Better pitch shifter)• Improved Voice Acting (Most likely will not happen)• Bug Fixes (Lighting transition fixes)• Better Performance (Door loading improvements)• More Accessibility Options (Arachnophobia switch?)• Community Engagement (Free in-game events to win cosmetics, community updates and more! Ex. Dying Light 2 is a game that does this VERY well!)• Micro-transactions • Overpriced DLC• Radio Silence (No more updates, no communication, and all that. Would be a bummer)To conclude, most of the cons can be fixed easily, don't let the cons bring you down. I believe most of the cons will be fixed/addressed.

In most of the dialogue, you can choose what to say. We have many ways to complete the mission. Each mission is interesting and different from the last. We also have riddle games and good sidequests.Beautiful open world, giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore Hogwarts, caves, forests, mountains, and do much more. The map is very large. Herbalism and alchemy are important and help a lot; we can also upgrade equipment. We can have a real Wizard of Oz adventure. The fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocked by a small obstacle, but in comparison to other games, it is not very annoying.Each character has its own charm. The characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We can also choose the main character's path, whether he is a good wizard or a bad one (using unforgivable spells), but the game will not punish us for it.The graphics in this game are amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined; for example, when we move the grass, it moves with us. Graphics capabilities are used at 100%. The movement of water and clouds is very well refined. We can see falling leaves and changing weather. It makes a huge impression.The music and ambient sounds in this game fit great. We can listen to climatic music that is selected for each moment of the game. Character voices are not my favorites, but they fit the characters. There is a lot of music from movies.If you are thinking about purchasing this game because you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend it for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun will come from it. This is a well-made game not only for Harry Potter fans but for everyone."

And that's fine, it doesn't have to be. Finally, for people who only care about what J.K.Rowling says on twitter... this game is not for you. Not due to anything in the game itself - it is actually very kind and inclusive and you *would enjoy it* - but because J.K.Rowling created the harry potter world ~30 years ago, you won't enjoy playing any game set in that world.

It is clear that a lot of love and labor went into the creation of the world. Considering previous titles Avalanche has developed, it is probably fair to say they punched above their weight class with this game.So why a negative review?Because the game is a very large, very shallow puddle. Hogwarts Legacy's world may be very pretty, but it's also a world that solely exists for you. Once the initial bedazzlement wears off, it becomes impossible not to notice how deeply infected this game is with the Ubisoft model of open-world design. Perhaps such a design would be tolerable if your choices actually mattered, but they don't. There are no consequences for your actions and it gets worse: your character is incredibly heavily scripted by Avalanche, occasionally blurting out things you were trying to keep secret in every ""choice"" you were given before. Aside from making one or two snide comments, you cannot make your character act like a jerk. Your character is going to be a pet-loving, tree-hugging, empathic goody-two-shoes no matter what you do.- Choices don't matter- There are no consequences to your actions.- There are no stakes! There is a supposed ""big bad"" who is interested in you and wants to capture you, yet you can roam the world however and whenever you like without any risk of getting caught. The story only happens when you trigger it.- At some point in the story, the interests of MC and a side-show villain become aligned. The side-show villain even says so and offers a chance to work together. I wanted to accept, but noooooo, Avalanche made my character decline and spew some moralistic BS at the villain, I was not even given a choice. UGH.- Totally missed opportunity on using the four houses as competition factions. There is no competition between houses in this game, there are no factions, there are no house points.- When it becomes night, everybody just outright vanishes. When it first happens it gives a kind of creepy vibe that seems almost suitable. But once you notice that this happens every night, and no NPC goes to bed, no prefect patrols the halls, and you become aware that you are essentially running around an empty level... well, it just takes your right out of the experience.- No social gameplay at all. No building of relationships between other characters. You're just going to be friends with everyone, no matter how you play, because Avalance says so.- Starting as a fifth-year IMO was a cop-out. A cheap narrative reason to be able to give the player some of the more mature spells. The problem with this choice is that it eliminates the potential to build a bond with any of the side-characters. Seriously, even just spending a couple of hours as a first year could have done so much to help set up meaningful relationships. Huge missed opportunity.- No classes or curfew systems. Some people think that having these would be boring. By themselves they could become boring or annoying, sure, but when there is a social cost associated with them, I think they could be excellent gameplay loops. Missed a class? Lose house points. Lose house points? Social relation with side-character X is affected, which in turn affects your story and the choices you are able to make. Or how about having to feed your secret Hippogriff pet, which you can only do at night, so you have a reason to break curfew. And if you fail and get caught? Who knows, maybe the Hippogriff abandons you. Risk and reward people, it's not that hard!I hope Avalanche will do better in the future. There is some reason to think that they will as modders have uncovered things like an unused morality system (which this game desperately needs), thieving system, and even things like GoToBed(). So Avalanche *did* think about some of these things, but for whatever reason they never ended up in the game.I respect the developers for what they've done. A game of this scale for one of the largest fandoms in the world is no easy task. It was always going to be hard for them to meet expectations. I can only hope they will learn from this game and will take the needed steps to improve upon it in some future iteration."

I should say though, after an explosive starting scene, it's a bit of a slow progression in the  beginning. You'll need to master some spells, meet around people, etc to really be prepared to start the actual journey. Even your brooms comes in at around 10 hours into the game. But it's definitely worth the wait. The gameplay itself is pretty good. Using different spells for different enemies. They have a pretty good variety and I'm not disappointed. The map is good, there's fast travel options, talent points to unlock new abilities, etc. The best thing about the game is the world itself and they've executed it perfectly. Even if I'm just walking around the castle, I find things which make me smile. Honestly, I feel like I'm s student of Hogwarts and I'm exploring this amazing place. The castle is the best place, but there are outside places too. Lots of sidequests, puzzles, dungeons, etc. Basically, it's everything you'd expect from the world of magic. But ofcourse, it's not perfect. There are certainly some flaws. There are a few glitches which affected the gameplay. And one was so huge and I can't progress a quest at all (Edit: its fixed now and I've completed the quest). The number of gear slots are way too less and I'm forced to sell most of my unused gears to make space for new ones. Some of the puzzles are just repetitive that I gave up on them being bored of it. But those are just minor things. I'm sure they'll fix the glitches too. But seriously, I love this game and I definitely have my money's worth. I'm around 23 hours in and I know that there's lots more waiting for me in terms of story and I'm going to have a blast. So final verdict, just get it. You won't regret it. PS: Just ignore all the hate for this game regarding the JK stuff. Just because one old woman is perceived as being inhuman, you're going to ignore the love and effort of hundreds of game creators? I mean, there are even lesbian couples and trans characters in the game (sure, it must be the marketing strategy, but it's still representation nonetheless). This game is not about the one person, it's about a group of developers who love this project. Just think about that too before you make a decision."
58,Old Man Gamer (OMG),https://steamcommunity.com/id/OldManGamerOMG/,242,2,1,193.4,February,21,277,18,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a must play experience. The world design, music, story and characters are an overall fantastic experience. You do not have to be a Harry Potter fan to be able to enjoy the game, but it does add much to the game if you are. The graphics are fantastic. The user interface is informative while remaining simple and user friendly. The menus are fun to navigate and check the map, collections and progress. For the most part, Game play is mostly perfect. I am not a fan of the broom stick flight. The controls on the broom feel clunky and not user friendly on controller nor on keyboard/mouse. However, the combat is highly enjoyable. Spell casting, item utilization and potions are well balanced in player use. Difficulty on hard was not difficult in the slightest, but there has been an update and I am finding the challenge has been upped quite a bit. Fast reflexes and smart choices definitely are needed for a favorable outcome. I would not consider the game remotely as difficult as a ""souls-like"" experience. While the story is fantastic, it is the world immersion that makes Hogwarts Legacy shine brightest. The side quests, choices, progress in the main story and discoveries all add and change the conversations and interactions that the protagonist has with the other classmates, professors and even enemies. If you use certain methods in combat more heavily, your enemies will make comments on that, for instance. We are still not at a truly dynamic open world, but this is one of the best open world builds I have enjoyed in gaming.My biggest complaint is that the puzzles are all rudimentary. There is nothing mentally taxing in the entire game. With so many puzzles, the most difficult is solvable without any pause for thought. I could expound on all of this and more, but it is easier said that Hogwarts Legacy is a great foundation for a new gaming franchise. While I could nitpick Hogwarts Legacy in how the game can be better in many ways, it achieves what many games fail to even deliver. And that is an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience from start to finish."
59,sorrow,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adeacon48/,212,,1,41.2,February,12,61,0,1,"In my opinion, this game is an absolute masterpiece! I cannot express how enchanting it is to play, and when I am playing I don’t want to stop. The atmosphere, attention to detail, and overall gameplay mechanics when casting magic in combat or when choosing the right spell to solve a puzzle is fluid and fun. The Avalanche Software team put a lot of heart and soul into this game and definitely captured the overall feel of the universe."
60,Rampaging Cookie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ali_HT/,50,1,1,38.8,February,11,"1,009",23,1,"is one of the biggest fantasy franchises of the new age, which, despite more than 25 years having passed since the release of the first book by J. K. Rowling, is still popular. Since 2002, From that time until now, we have always been waiting for a good quality game from the world of Harry Potter. The Hogwarts Legacy is a role-playing action game developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Now we are going to review the whole game.This open-world game, which can be experienced in single-player mode, has created a closer and higher-quality image of the magical world of Harry Potter. However, this game does not tell the story of Harry Potter, and its story goes back at least a hundred years before the events of Harry Potter. You start the game as a new student in the fifth year of Hogwarts; However, the game does not give information about the reason for your late studies in the fifth year.The game's main story draws you in with beautiful twists and pulls you by creating a curiosity to discover the truth about your unknown ability. Although the story is not the boldest element in this game, the creators have managed to mix the game's not-so-complicated main narrative in the form of the magical and vast world of the game.In addition to the main narrative, hundreds of side quests have been designed for users to participate in according to their choice. The variety of side quests in the game is so great that engaging with them will sometimes be more interesting than the game's main story. Exploring the enormous game world allows you to play other magical games and challenges. Solve Merlin's trials, hunt magical animals, find hidden tunnels, and search for relics of ancient magic. The game is so big and rich that you'll find yourself exploring for hours and hours without even touching the main quests.To move around in this big world, you can use fast travel; by discovering them, you can move between different places in the game world without delay. This makes it possible to follow any desired primary or secondary quests quickly. In addition, you can also travel using a broomstick or other magical creatures such as a hippogriff. In each area of this magical world, there are tons of activities to complete your collection. All these areas and activities are accessible on the game map, and the game map is one of the essential tools for that, guiding the user through all quests.The Hogwarts Legacy RPG progression system is designed in such a way that you can collect XP by following the main or sub-quests. When these XPs reach a certain amount, your character's level will increase; for each level increase, more puzzles or stages will be available. By advancing the main story, you gain new abilities, and by doing the game's side quests, your skill in these abilities will improve; you can upgrade your character's talents in various fields, such as elemental spells, black magic, stealth, etc.The game allows you to create and personalize the appearance of your desired character by choosing the face, hair, skin color, and even facial scars. You will also be able to select your desired grouping in Hogwarts. The range of customization of the game extends to the selection of clothes, accessories, magic wands, flying brooms, and even your private room in Hogwarts Room of Requirement. Although these customizations are extremely fun, even the choice of school grouping does not affect the gameplay and is limited only to cosmetics. This also applies to in-game decisions. In the process of advancing the story and in relation to the characters of the game, you will have several dialogue options to choose from; But these choices will have practically no effect on the story. And in both cases, you will receive the same reward and output.One of the exciting places to customize is the Hogwarts Room of Requirement. If you have followed the Harry Potter series, you know that at Hogwarts, this secret room appears when students need it. In the game, Professor Wisley brings you to this room to study more on magic lessons and to create your work environment. In this room, minor details can be personalized, such as the frames on the wall to the desks. You can also keep your magical animals in the magical garden of the room. This room is perfect for crafting potions, practicing spells, and upgrading your character's cosmetics.The combat system of the Hogwarts Legacy is perhaps the most exciting part of the game. The game initially starts with limited spells and abilities, But gradually, by learning new spells and improving skills with the help of game points, the fighting experience turns into significant action. The game allows you to customize and combine different spells to create your own fighting style. This has made the game's combat experience extremely fun and addictive, despite the very low variety of enemies. These fights, which take place against black witches, giant spiders, goblins, zombies, and of course, trolls, sometimes become so challenging that you have to try many times to get past them. Another thing that needs to be addressed is the artistic graphics of the game. The Hogwarts Legacy game has one of the most beautiful magical worlds. Hogwarts school in the game is designed in the most beautiful way possible, and almost all the memorable places in the book can be found in the game.Despite all the positives, this open-world game has many technical problems. These problems, primarily seen in the game's PC version, have somewhat damaged the game experience. For example, many users of Nvidia's 30th and even 40th generation graphics cards face problems such as limited graphics RAM or multiple crashes when playing games. Also, long loading times and some graphic textures not loading correctly are other problems on the computer and console platforms. This issue probably makes it impossible to experience the game on old hard drives and HDDs.Overall, I can say that the Hogwarts Legacy is a brilliant magical open world of Harry Potter. This game has fulfilled more or less everything we expected. It portrays Rowling's magical world in the best possible way. Hogwarts Legacy is the best game from the Harry Potter franchise ever made, and if it weren't for the many technical issues with the PC version, I could have easily given it a full score in this review.Hogwarts Legacy is everything that Harry Potter fans have been waiting for. The game does not tell the story of Harry Potter, but by creating a magical world, it has been able to tell another brilliant story.If you are interested in the fantasy world of Harry Potter and enjoy the experience of exploring a large fantasy world, the Hogwarts Legacy game is what you need. Hogwarts Legacy has no obvious negative points other than technical issues. Therefore, it cannot be included in the list of games that I don't recommend buying."

63,skořicový trdelník,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nntnce/,68,2,1,95.4,February,23,739,4,1,"If you expect Hogwarts Legacy to have a complete freedom of action, different endings which depend on your relationship with the characters and stage of completing certain quests, these are exactly the things you won't get there as well as a high range of replayability. Although the game is still rather good, as a friend of mine accurately pointed out, it’s all about the lack of competition among other major titles, focusing on one specific fandom, and an absolute lack of alternatives in this fandom. I've played through the game and finished it completely with 100% achievements, so I'd like to tell my personal opinion about it after all. ● There is . The ending will always be the same and there are no consequences of your actions. ● . Restricted areas are restricted just because they are meant to be restricted, not because you are not able to wandering there freely if it’s not about a quest, so feel free to come back any time.● There is . Yes, you can choose a bad “not-true” ending. Yes, you can freely study the Dark Arts. No, you can’t kill anyone, but bad guys, because it’s a good story and you cannot be a villain. ● Unforgivable spells are obviously unforgivable, which means that they cannot be used if you’re a good wizard, though nobody would stop you if you cast them. Any witnesses would only note something like “oh you’re not afraid of the Dark Arts”. But there are  at all. And no, if you’re interested, you cannot kill the bosses with Avada Kedavra. ● Sometimes, going between the sectors of a location becomes slightly frustrating. Before the door opens, there is . It would be better if there was an animation of some kind which could replace the time you wait staring at the door stubbornly while random NPCs go through the same door freely. Not to mention  what means now you are to force close the game via the Steam overlay or Task Manager and restart it.Vice versa, some cutscenes such as going to Undercroft seem to work worse towards the end of the game. Sometimes it becomes highly difficult to go, because after holding F, nothing happens at all. You have to walk back and forth and try again until the character finally enters the door.● The fact the player gets the last level after getting almost all the collectibles which, by my calculations, usually happens after going though the main plot makes . After completing all collectibles, there are no activities left in the game at all. So what’s the point of maximum 40 levels if 30 levels are more than enough to go through the main plot and even more?● It's not about your PC; it's just all about the game. 8GB (which is possible to play with), 16GB (which is recommended), or 32GB RAM – .● Poorly, there is  while on broomstick as well as there is  so there is no reaction from other characters if you barely knocked them down. It's not a catastrophe, but feels weird still. ● Obviously, there is no The Haunted Hogsmeade Shop PS5 exclusive quest in Steam version of the game. This is the quest (and it's a pretty good one) which allows you to open your own store and sell your belongings for a better price. However, , so now we can see the store's locked door in Hogsmeade. Thanks, I guess? ● You’re . Back in Resident Evil 2004, the player could shoot through the gaps in the textures, and this is a project with AAA price in 2023.● When a game has flight mechanics, you never know if it will be good or not. But here,  (except for the lack of collision animation). Besides, you're also able to  and find the one you like visually. Plus, there are three types of mounts revealing with the story progress. ● You can help random characters with extra tasks but you’re also allowed to never give back the things they asked to help with. Some of them need to get back their books and you are happy to help them, but some of them are Zenobia Noke, and I’ll never regret I did not give her back whatever she wanted me to find.● There is nothing special about the character customization menu at the beginning of the game, but  into any other outfit from those already found or received as a reward, is priceless. And it’s a real visual treat!● You can . If you don't want to see the mini-map or quest markers, or you don't need a spell bar, you can remove everything freely. Eventually, you can just turn off HUD completely and enjoy the game. It is quite a needed feature.●  is the witcher’s flair in the Harry Potter universe. It’s a night vision device in the magical world and also an invaluable tool for finding anything and everything. Revelio is a spell justified by lore of the game, the usefulness and convenience of which cannot be overestimated. Besides, Revelio has its own assign button, so this spell doesn't take any of much-needed space on the spell bar.● Although I didn’t like that only first lessons were interactive, since so many people told that the class system in Hogwarts Legacy would be similar to that of Bully: Scholarship Edition, the spells learning as a system worked out well. One way or another, . They won’t overload you and are quickly remembered.● From the ability to stealth to various spell combinations,  in Hogwarts Legacy are solidly implemented. Fighting is interesting even at the end of the game because it's not tedious. You always use different spells and try different combos. Yeah, it may not be the best combat system in the world, but it's well implemented which is just great.● There is , so you can not only finish the collectibles and achievements, but also complete unfinished side and extra quests.● If you forgot where we are, this is a real magical world, so grow flowers, collect herbs and make potions, and don't forget to pet and feed magical beasts. Everything is in real time, online farm lovers, even if the time periods are short and can get even shorter since you can use fertilizers. This is , baby!● There are , and you can pet them all. . There are lots of unnatural-looking things, given the fact this is England in the 19th century. After finishing the game, I still have barely anything special to tell about the plot. . Despite the fact I have mixed feelings about many things, or the fact Hogwarts Legacy has poor optimization and many limitations, and there is also no quidditch, I liked it. Hogwarts Legacy is definitely worth the money, and I got pleasure exploring the world, casting magic and finishing the collectibles. ."

Harry Potter fan, etc etc.Let me tell you the THINGS I DON'T like about the game:Sometimes the world feels very empty even though you find students and people everywhere. BUT THEY NEVER REACT TO ANYTHING YOU DO. There are beds and you have a bedroom BUT YOU CAN'T SLEEP IN IT. You DON'T even get a CHEST to put cool gear that you find and DON'T want to SELL even if you can make other gear LOOK LIKE the one you like. Sometimes we just like knowing that we can hang on to legendary stuff and keep it. You CAN'T SIT in chairs with other students and just watch them do their weird things. YOU ONLY FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PART OF THE WORLD DURING MISSIONS. That's the only time that NPC's react and interact with you. GREAT GAME for Harry Potter universe FANS. NOT SO MUCH for OPEN WORLD players who WANT AN IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE sadly."

In most of the dialogue you can choose what to say. We have many ways to pass the mission. Each mission is interesting and different than earlier. We also have riddle games and good sidequests.Gameplay - 9/10Beautiful open world giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore Hogwart, caves, forests, mountains and doing much more things. The map is very large. Herbalism and Alchemy are important and helps a lot, we also can upgrade equipments. We can have a real wizzard adventure. Fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying.Characters - 10/10Each character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We also can choose the path of the main character be good wizzard or bad (unforgivable spells) but the game won't punish us for it.Graphics - 10/10Graphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. The movement of water, clouds are very well refined. We can see falling leaves, changing weather. It makes a huge impression.Sounds - 9/10Music and ambient sounds in this game fits great. We can listen climatic music which is selected for each moment of the game. Character voices are not my favourite but it fits into character. There is a lot of music known from the movies.Overall - 9.5/10If you are thinking about purchase this game, if you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend these game for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun comes from that game. This is well made game not only for Harry Potters fans, but for everyone."

It's fulfils that itch of being a wizard.- Riled up people on social media should not stop you playing this game if you really want to.- All the complaints I have about this game are minuscule, like the removal of Quidditch.- Never the less, I think they will probably add Quidditch in DLC, then we will have the complete package!- So let's go over some of the things I like and the minor inconveniences the game, first the negatives:- We have all probably noticed, the game lags at higher graphics, even on good systems, why is this?- Over all my searching, it seems like there is severe memory leak issues with this game.- More over, there are some backend bugs due to how the source code was implemented into the game.- Everything you can do to limit this won't fix that, you need Ascendio mod to have a chance to fix it.- Not sure if this will be fixed in future, but if you are fine with mods, there is at least a good fix for it.- As for gameplay itself, I wish you could reset talents, also I hope we get an increase in spell variety.- Really, the gameplay is fine, very fluid, could do with some touch ups in dodge indicators, seen it bug a bit.- Evil characters wont have THAT much consequences either, like Avada Kedavra is just like saying a swear.- Not seen much bugs, I did fall through the floor once which was weird, it didn't let me open my map either.- On top of that, sometimes rolling and climbing are a bit... inconsistent, you can end up in unintended places.- Take the Witches Tomb, there is a platform you can climb up, only a specific angle.... for some reason...???- Bugs and weird gameplay aside. They seem fairly minimal, let's talk about the forced ""representation"":- Every dialogue option refers to you as ""They"", I get it's due to 'modern times' but it feels very out of place.- In some dialogue it just doesn't flow well, it's like they intended the dialogue to have he/him and she/her.- Now I don't mind if they was an option, but the other two options should also be a thing.- Guess they wanted to avoid drama from the mob, at that point, was just a futile effort, same with Sirona.- Kindness and empathy may be the intention of the developers, but it just comes off as pandery after a while.- I do admit though, these interactions are not that bad and are far between. Doesn't impede the game really.- Let's talk about the unforgivables: OP, not as OP as you think. You will run Avada Kedevra all the time.- Learning new spells sometimes is a waste since you wont use them but more variety is always good tbh.- Every spell has a use but some overlap. I wish the Room of Requirements spells didn't need to be hot barred.- Difficulty is pretty decent, but you could go through this entire game without being hit once I think.- Oh also forgot, the stealth system is a bit  bare boned but it's also not the worst, needs expanding to be sure.- Very nearly every situation can be overcame with brute force, there are small required stealth parts tho.- Even then, these are scripted parts, not something you would naturally use in the open world as much.- Really... overall, these are BARELY nitpicks at all.- The combat is excellent and so many combos, load outs and rotations I've seen on youtube.- Hitting people with certain spells feels so punchy. The fantasy is there for being a truly powerful wizard.- I personally like to use expelliarmus to disarm opponents then use Magic to throw their weapons at them.- Sound is also great, every spell has a unique feel and puts you into that fantasy of being a wizard so well.- Game of the year contender to be sure. Though I suppose it isn't all that revolutionary, it's just plain fun.- Another open world game, but at least this time, you have a true feeling of fantasy and role play.- Minus some of the forced dialogue, the script for the game ain't bad, funny moments too with students.- Every npc seems to have some trigger that makes them say something at certain times or do something.- To me as well, the characters are great, already seeing people thirst over the Herbology teacher, jeez lmao.- Overall the charecterization of each house is spot on, I love the clothing, the areas and the students designs.- Until they allow Quidditch or house points, this can be expanded on, it's mostly cosmetic at the moment.- Common rooms too look nice, not any customization there, but that is what the room of requirement is for.- Hufflepuff has the best Jackdaw mission btw, they go to a very well known place in the wizarding world.- Great game.- Reccomend to anyone who loves the wizarding world.- All the things you expect are here, not rocking the boat but what we need right now.- Salazar.- Slytherin."

None of them are completely game-breaking, I still enjoyed playing the game and would recommend you to buy it if you're interested in the HP universe.List:- PC Performance leaves a lot to be desired even with the latest (17 Feb 2023) patch and engine.ini tweaks;- Lifeless NPCs that you can't interact with throughout the world;- There's nothing to do in your sleeping dorms and house room;- Cutscenes are locked to 16:9;- Main Character is an annoying backseat gamer during main story quests and won't stop spoiling the answer to the riddles;- House choice doesn't have an impact on story;- Stealth mechanics are absolutely obnoxious to play, but at least there's only a few missions where you have to hide;- There's no endgame and new game+;- SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE ALL ROADS LEAD TO HOGSMEADE (annoying repetitive voice lines as you travel around the world, especially after you teleport);- There's so much character diversity that sometimes you forget you're supposed to be in 19th century UK;- Most open world side quests are just boring go and fetch stuff/kill bad guys;- There's way too many Merlin's Trials, Bandit Camps, Field Guide pages. Developers clearly focused on quantity over quality, it felt like I was playing a Ubisoft game before I gave up on them;- You can't get the final cutscene unless you reach level 34 by the time you finish the main story, and that means you have to drag yourself through repetitive content to finish the game."

I'm every second of this, the atention to detail is amazing. And sometimes you get the Skyrim vibes. The OST is amazing and pays tribute to John William's with lots of variations from the OG.I gotta adress the elephant in the room tho: performance is not great. It boggles my mind that they chose to go with Unreal Engine 4 for a game of this magnitude, specially when one of WB's own devs have an amazing engine ""Firebird"" from Monolith (used in Shadow of War), which these devs could have borrowed if WB wasn't to give monolith the project for what reason may be (maybe because they are doing wonder-woman). My point is, UE4 is dated. It used single threaded performance so the 1% lows are disgusting and all over the place (12900K + 4090). The hardcoded TAA to mask the engine's limits and rough edges is vomit inducing at times.2nd- Complaint: They should have gone further with this project. NPC colision and interaction specially inside the school. Day and night cicle is there but there is no mandatory curfew and no eating schedule and classes are not times. So it all feels off somehow. They should have gone with an aproach á lá Kingdom Come Deliverance on this imo.Alas, no game is perfect, maybe the potterhead in me makes turn a blind eye to all the shortcomings in this game, because when at its peak this game really does shine and any fan will have goosebumps. The wasted potential may be mitigated with mods as i already seen some mods on Nexus and there already a mod loader (btw, theres a mod to unlock all PS5 exclusive content but requires a new save to get the mission, but potion works regardless)And there you go. im sure im missing a lot of stuff, but i recomend this game for all fans, and to non fans who like a RPG lite, story driven game. 9/10"

Rowling's novels, with a custom-rendered protagonist who has just begun their fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The talented wizard has shown a strong affinity for magic over the past few months, and with the aid of friends and strange acquaintances, they will set out on an epic journey that could help them reach their full potential. Who knows what secrets they may uncover? Hop on the Jacobite steam train and find out for yourself… The main plot follows the traditional Harry Potter formula, with the protagonist discovering their calling that connects them to a greater purpose. The colourful cast that takes up the mantle of supporting characters further reinforces this factor as they are intertwined with your wizard’s personal growth and progress. But yet, with such diverse personalities and some solid chain quest activities, the overall narrative keeps falling flat the more you play the game, and the main reason behind this can be found in the dialogues. Since the Harry Potter universe has attracted players of all ages, Avalanche Software took the safest approach by offering a child-friendly experience. As a result, many times you either encounter NPCs that talk like children or, even worse, they are treating you like a child despite the fact that you murdered three wizards prior to the interaction.In contrast to its weak narrative elements, Hogwarts Legacy provides solid gameplay in both combat and exploration. The plethora of customization options and unexpected interactions between spells and consumables provide all of the tools needed for unique role-playing sessions, but this does not imply that they check every single box with equal efficiency. Avalanche Software faithfully depicts Hogwarts and the many regions that surround it, capturing both the beauty and the mystery that the Wizarding World is known for. The Hogwarts castle is the game's pinnacle, with many hidden rooms and interactable objects cleverly placed in crowded corridors or isolated locations, while the surrounding fields add an extra layer of diversity with various underground caverns, cosy villages, and mysterious forests. Although an overwhelming amount of beauty is bursting at your screen, the developers made sure to take things slowly by opening up to the numerous mechanics without imposing limitations. Consequently, you can adjust the pace of the progression according to your needs. The only deterrent to the aforementioned formula is the map. By having such a diverse world, I was expecting a much better navigation system similar to other big titles of the same genre. The 3D interface, for instance, offers zero functionality aside from being visually stunning because it cannot be customised to highlight particular points of interest, and the distances are frequently inaccurate, showing long path roots that could be avoided.While fairly simple in nature, combat is very engaging, as it opens the door to many combos and unexpected interactions. The six elements of magic used in spell casting, the most potent of which are the forbidden spells, are stationary. Your toolkit holds a total of sixteen charms that you can equip, but you can always quickly combine different abilities depending on the circumstance. The beauty behind spell casting can be found in two main parameters: the rotations and the cooldowns. In order to prevent players from constantly using Avada Kedavra, each spell has a time limit before it can be used again. As a result, your heavy damage dealers become somewhat limited, forcing you to plan ahead of time before engaging in combat. Furthermore, in order to maximise their potential, Hogwarts Legacy introduces weaknesses to your adversaries that encourage experimentation and quick thinking. Spiders, for example, are weak to fire damage, while Dugbogs become vulnerable when you expose their bellies. Finally, the clearly overpowered potions and plants you'll brew or grow in your workshop will broaden your lethal abilities, adding another layer of complexity. Besides the main story, Hogwarts Legacy is rich with puzzles, collectibles, and minigames that are slowly unravelled as you learn new abilities. The Merlin trials, for instance, were the most memorable of the bunch because you got to use the knowledge you have been honing so far in order to move objects or simply destroy orbs and pillars in a timed manner. Such activities were a welcome diversion from the main pump-action story sequences, but despite their novelty, they were clearly outmatched by the game's most prominent feature: transportation. Flying on a broom proved to be exceptional, mesmerising, and, most importantly, fun to such an extent that it could be transformed into a game itself with the necessary adjustments. Last but not least, I would like to touch upon the lack of sandbox elements that the overall experience could clearly benefit from. Regardless of how charming the world is, it unquestionably requires a moral compass to keep our protagonist from overrelying on forbidden spells. The absence of such an addition is a missed opportunity, especially given that both students and professors comment on your previous actions.Staggering visuals, neat animations, and colourful spells combine into a canvas full of passion and grandeur. The world is a love letter to the Harry Potter fanbase, creating a very faithful template to the original series. Even the smallest details have been meticulously crafted, with the falling leaves during autumn being one of the most impressive and breathtaking effects that left me speechless. Everything is tinged with mystery and magic, almost begging you to abandon fast travel to fully appreciate the beauty, which is why I consider the lack of a photo mode feature to be a crime. Even though I appreciate the fact that music and spell effects are reused from the original Harry Potter movies, there is nothing new in the overall mix. Sure, the environmental sounds are remarkable, adding lots of personality during conversations and cutscenes, but I still find them very lacking in comparison to the visual approach. The voice acting is superb, with new voice actors getting a chance to shine, but as previously stated, the dialogues can become quite irritating. After nearly 70 hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that Hogwarts Legacy is by far the most promising fantasy world adaptation I've ever seen in a video game, paving the way for a new era of Harry Potter titles. The game is excellent yet not perfect, with both unexpected and twisted turns that, in spite of their shortcomings, prove to be mostly masked by the shroud of nostalgia."
74,Arcandres,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Arcandres/,105,4,1,11.0,February,18,519,3,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a game that shows a lot of promise. The immersive atmosphere and top-notch cinematics make you feel like you're really part of the wizarding world. The flying mechanics are also a standout feature, providing a thrilling and fun experience. However, the game does have some issues that hold it back. The lack of freedom is a noticeable downside, as it would have been great to have more control over your actions as a student. Additionally, the lack of optimization can be frustrating at times, as it impacts the overall performance and can be a distraction from the otherwise engaging gameplay. Overall, Hogwarts Legacy has a lot to offer for fans of the Harry Potter universe. While there are some areas that could be improved, the immersive atmosphere, thrilling flying mechanics, and detailed world-building make it a fun and enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of the series or just looking for a new adventure, Hogwarts Legacy is definitely worth checking out.PD: Don't be fooled by my playtime, I was mostly offline playing."

I would only give it 7/10 after the initial joy and wow factor has subsided. I only enjoyed the initial part of the game, once you play longer, you'll notice there are some stuffs the developers could have done better. Things to improve:- Better NPC dialogue/ mini-conversations (NPC are just spewing lines after lines with no relevancy when talking to one another in the living world, no proper conversation)  - Increase enemy variety- Dynamic HUD (It's too cluttered)- Dynamic camera controls (Explore - Far, Combat - Near)- Quidditch  To name a few... shall wait patiently for Day 1 update and mods,"
79,Zuluf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zulufski/,71,5,1,35.5,March,1,682,2,1,"Hogwarts Legacy functions as a pez dispenser for memberberries for anyone who grew up reading Harry Potter’s wizard school adventures. Even though the setting is 19th century Hogwarts and most characters and plotlines are completely divorced from the main series, there are plenty of easter eggs, references and “he said the THING” moments to feed your millennial childhood nostalgia. Furthermore, we get to visit various locations and use a bunch of MacGuffins that directly reference events from the books (which kind of makes you wonder why a 5th year like the game’s protagonist is taking the same mandrake 101 class as Harry did in his first year, but I digress).You start out by customizing your hero by choosing your appearance, gender, voice (one male, and one female). Your avatar receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts as a late fifth year student. Enter Eleazar Fig, your own personal mentor, who will help you harness a newly awakened form of ancient magic. After an introductory misadventure in Gringotts and a Sorting Ceremony in which you get to choose your own House, you are free to tackle the magic academy and surrounding grounds (including the Forbidden Forest, Hogsmeade and other iconic locations). Later in the game you get flying mounts in the form of either a broom or a hippogryph, as well as a massive ground mount that can ram enemies and obstacles.Sadly, there’s no Quidditch, ostensibly because it got banned by the headmaster (Phineas Nigellus Black, a rather unpleasant fellow and Sirius’ ancestor), which limits the usage of your broom for map navigation, a couple of sidequests and popping collectible balloons. Just feels like a missed opportunity. You will gradually learn tens of spells during your schoolyear, varying from combat to utility spells and you’ll have more and more access to the map as you gain the power to destroy obstacles. There’s also a skill tree and as you complete your Field Guide (basically an album with all your collectibles) and complete Challenges you also unlock more inventory space, cosmetics and runes you can upgrade your gear with. For the most part, the mechanics used by the game are par for the course in the whole open-world action/adventure genre: you have stealth and the obligatory takedowns, there’s the whole twin-stick orientation lockpicking when you Alohomora a locked door and you have a form of basic color coding to complicate the combat a little bit (you have to cast either red, yellow or blue spells to pop enemy shield of their respective color). Enemies you fight can be spiders, goblins, dark wizards, trolls and a few other types, but for the most part are just fodder for your ever-expanding arsenal of combos and damage spells. Most of the time you’ll only use four quickslots, but you can unlock extra sets to accommodate a more versatile playstyle. The combat resembles Arkham-type dancing where you alternate your offensive strings with timed parries and dodges and try to sustain a high combo count by not getting hit. For the most part, these things feel like threaded ground and might even become tedious after a while. It doesn’t help that the game’s main story sports a couple of one-dimensional villains and the plot feels like a salad in which they wanted to include as many fanservice elements as possible (you go from visiting a vault in Gringotts during a goblin assault to revisiting memories in pensieves to trying to unravel the mystery of the Deathly Hallows). Despite the generous playtime (around thirty hours to finish the main story and about 70% of challenges in my experience), Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t take much time to develop its central characters. There’s a lot of diversity in almost every aspect but not a lot of depth - the stakes are higher and the drama is more impactful in Sebastian Sallow’s quest chain than the main story. On the plus side, the game looks absolutely gorgeous. There’s an almost painterly look and the gloomy weather really enhances the elaborate architecture and detailed models. If you wanted to explore Hogwarts in an elaborate, big-budget way this is your best chance - meeting ghosts, opening secret tunnels and running errands through huge, ever-shifting staircases feels like a wizard-themed playthrough of Bully. Little subplots and grievances you solve intertwine with classes where you unlock new abilities and tools, and there’s even a day/night cycle that affects available content (although in Hogwarts Legacy there’s no time limit to doing anything and you can’t skip classes). Speaking of upgrading, there’s a pretty elaborate crafting system that has you collect ingredients for potions from plants that you grow yourself or buy from vendors, and gear upgrades require stuff you can collect from beasts you grow and breed. To that end, The Room of Requirement returns from the book series and serves as your personal sandbox. The game does a good job of not feeling overwhelming or pressy about its open-world content. Even though there are dozens of activities, over fifty sidequests, puzzles of a wide variety and hundreds of collectibles, you can easily go through the story without touching them and won’t feel underpowered or like you’re missing out. Some of the content is locked behind spells, which you will learn by attending classes and doing assignments for your professors.Is Hogwarts Legacy worth it? If you’re a Harry Potter fan and aren’t tired of the framework these types of triple AAA sandbox actioners employ, by all means. You get around 60 hours of gametime if you want to collect everything (according to my estimates) and will enjoy a more than competent and varied (if not particularly well-written or deep) experience."

84,Snorkel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SandvichToaster/,74,6,1,138.7,March,3,633,0,1,"It's a good game!I have completed the game. This game constantly introduces new spells and mechanics as you progress through the story. I'm a gamer who is accustomed to ignoring the story missions until 40 hours later - don't do that. You'll want access to spells and pickups before you really get exploring. I recommend PRIORITISE THE STORY MISSIONS THROUGHOUT"". It is very hard to not get distracted along the way.Gameplay - It's all about exploring, finding collectables, opening doors, solving puzzles and finding secrets. Most puzzles give rewards. The Hogwarts castle is huge. The surrounding area is also huge. There is a LOT to explore.This game is NOT about making decisions and seeing changes from those decisions. Most dialogue choices early game are just for Roleplay, are you boastful or humble, nice or snarky?  I don't believe these have any impact. Near the end of the game there are a couple of quest choices that do have impact. Those choices are obvious, you get asked a question in a quest and you can choose one of two answers. No need to worry about saying the wrong thing through most of the game.Combat - there are four spell types, damage (slice, set alight etc), control (slow, cause to float etc), movement (push, pull etc) and utility (light, repair etc). The first three are used in combat, and the spell types are colour coded. Sometimes an enemy can only be effected with a control spell, and after that you'll be able to do damage normally. There is dodging and shielding. I played on 'normal', and found combat to have a good flow. It is fun, challenging enough to not be too easy, but not frustratingly difficult either.Stealing - nobody cares about stealing. Just pick locks right in front of people, it's totally fine.Stealth - There are only a couple of short mission sections that require stealth. Both are sections you can return to later, so no need to explore everywhere while trying to stay hidden. You may use stealth in open world for sneak attacks, but it's not required or necessary.Game resources - You can craft potions, and use grow plants that can act like turrets or grenades. Honestly, the only potion I used in the entire game was the health potion, and I rarely remembered or needed to use the plants (on normal). You'll end up with more money than you know what to do with. I had close to 50,000 at the end of my game. The only one that I found really important was using the loom to upgrade items (unlocks a long way through the story).Performance - I'm running a 1080GTX and expected to be playing on Low, but I could actually turn it up to Medium, and I'm quite happy with the performance. Only occasional hitching is seen.Clothes - Clothes are important. You can tell this, because you'll complete a dungeon that's worthy of Indiana Jones, and in the big glowy chest at the end you'll find . . . dun dun dun . . . An Old School Uniform! You have a bunch of gear slots. Found items have defense stats and can have special abilities as well. This game DOES HAVE transmog, and you should use it. Put on your outlandish glasses, go back to the top 'Gear' screen and use the prompt to change the appearance of the gear to match any gear you have found/sold/destroyed so far in the game.Character creation - DO NOT change the voice pitch of your characters, they'll sound weird. If you DO change it, you can actually go to the audio options menu and change it back. You don't get to fully customize your character appearances. There are 30 head shapes to choose from (15 each feminine/masculine), 50 hairstyles, 20 skin tones (there's a mod if they don't go light or dark enough for you), hair colours, freckles and moles, scars, eye colour, eyebrow shape, masculine or feminine voice, and whether you sleep in the Witch or Wizards dorm.Dorms - directly from the books, wizards cannot enter the witch's dorms. In Ravenclaw, enchanted suits of armour with polearms will block the stairs, in the other three dorms, the stairs turn into slides as you try to go up them. Whether you want to explore the whole dorm, or experience the slides may influence your decisions. The Ravenclaw and Slytherine dormitories are basically mirror images of each other and roughly identical, you're not missing anything by going as a wizard. The Gryffindor witch's dorms are very different to the wizards and worth seeing. In Hufflepuff, the balcony area outside the witch's dorms is also worth visiting.LGBTQ+ inclusion - this game has gay NPCs, a transgender NPC (with a transgender voice actor), and allows full voice/face/dorm picking options for characters.Violence - there is a surprising amount of murder in this game. You'll constantly be fighting Dark Wizards, Goblins, Wolves, Giant Spiders (there's a mod for that) etc, and you're getting rewarded for defeating them. If you want a game for yourself or a child with lower violence, this is not the game for you.Racism - so far I have seen zero evidence that the goblins may be a racist stereotype. NPC characters represent a solid range of racial backgrounds.Mods - this game supports mods. I have not installed any yet, but it's good to know they're there.Complaints:- The map does not show you the corridor detail, except in the little minimap in the corner. It's a bit annoying.- Only 4 character slots. My instinct was to create 5 or 6 characters, play them all for half an hour and then decide which to continue with. Nope. 4 characters only.- Getting inundated with too much clothing that I've picked up, and the puzzles to get more slots being a third of the way through the story missions.- Some of the mechanics are unintuitive, like using the map to its full potential, figuring out how to change gear appearance.- Can't skip the tutorial prologue for new characters.- Bug reporting is a bit harder than necessary, you need to sign up on the WB website. They'll only consider bugs that get enough votes. I had a bug that caused a mission to be incompletable, I had to abandon the mission and start it again from the beginning. The bug report didn't get enough votes in their system for them to even look at it. *sigh*So, all just minor things really. It's a good game."
85,OMN1CRON (🔨 WORKCATION 🌴),https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/,449,19,1,98.6,February,12,"1,861",53,1,"I was playing the game on another account and I have no reason to write a fake review or get paid for it, so calm down about game timeIn Hogwarts Legacy we play a new student who comes to magic school. As previously known, we start with the character in fifth grade and not as usual, as an eleven-year-old in the first year. And yes, as the story progresses it becomes clear why that is.The main mission series, i.e. the core of the game, has been implemented flawlessly, is absolutely creative and not only takes place in the open world.I was really impressed with some of the things the developers came up with, especially towards the end of the main story.In addition, the cutscenes are graphically on film level and the story is told in an exciting and interesting way. Also, there is no shying away from death and violence and you experience a lot of fan service with attention to detail and only rarely does it get overly sentimental.The character editor is solid but doesn't allow for an excessive number of options. You can only select pre-made faces and characters. Unfortunately, there are no other personalization options. Therefore, the number of assets is also noticeable in the game because in the castle you always meet the same people or very similar ones. Basically, the castle is not overly busy and it is noticeable that grades one to four, six and seven are not available at all.I can imagine that this is partly due to the fact that not so many character models should be designed and even more NPCs would probably have caused a stuttering orgy.I also have the feeling that the character animations have been cut back a bit and there are some clipping errors. Basically, however, all character models are really pretty and the coats, scarves and capes are designed great, even if they quickly develop a life of their own when moving and flap around wildly. If you overlook the few little things, you get an absolutely beautiful game that can convince with both the graphics and the spectacular scenery. The faces look alive and you can read the emotions that go with what is happening, and the overall animation of the characters is very believable.In general, the world is very harmonious and you quickly feel at home. The areas in the castle are strongly inspired by the films and outside they have detached themselves more from them, but still made sure to create a world in which one likes to move.You can tell on every corner that the developers put their hearts into it and you constantly come across lovely details such as decorative objects, scattered lore and one or the other side quest.And finally, the musical cherry on top of the sundae with cream.There's no direct soundtrack from the films, but the music is pretty damn close and really, really good. I also liked the fact that there is no excessive continuous sound and the developers have found a good mix of when scenes are “bombastic” accompanied and when things should be a little quieter.The overall result is a production that really convinced me and made me forget the real world for hours.The main missions are quite varied and the game world changes as they progress. There are several seasons that change when you reach certain story moments. The side missions, on the other hand, are not tied to the seasons and therefore cannot be missed.However, it can quickly become confusing in the quest menu if you only accept the challenges and never complete them.As far as the demands of the side missions are concerned, this varies greatly. There are classic ""boring"" collection tasks but also missions that lead you to hidden places that you probably wouldn't have seen otherwise. And for the fact that these are purely optional areas, some of them are really impressive. In the lessons, you can expect a wide variety of challenges depending on the subject. All the different types of teaching are all well implemented and the professors appear as believable personalities who take great care of us. After all, we have a lot of catching up to do and that happens with… exactly, homework. Sounds really bad, but it really isn't because it loosens up the events for a while and there are additional magic rewards.I think that with the spells, a lot of attention was paid to player friendliness, because there are almost no annoying elements and spells have a long range and there is no cooldown for them outside of combat. Flying with the broom, which you unlock after a few hours of play and use constantly from then on, was also implemented very well. The controls work great and I'm really not a good flyer in such games. You're fast in the open world and it feels great. The view you have is absolutely awesome and I like to fly a little longer instead of using fast travel. A little less spectacular but somehow even cooler are the flying mounts that you unlock a little later. Basically, these do exactly the same thing as the broom, although they may seem a bit slower and don't feel quite as agile, but there's something absolutely epic about it compared to a magic broom. Of course you will have to fight too. And these are great fun.We have a standard spell, a block-counter mechanic, and the different spell classes. Enemies create colored shields that can be countered with the right type of spell. The great thing is that each spell also has a unique ability and it's not just the color coding that matters. This allows you to try different tactics and quickly develop your own magical fighting style. The game still has a replay value because the main quest is played differently in the different houses and the students react differently to it. And since you often have the choice of how to decide, a second run is probably just as much fun because you can try out the unused dialogue options. Ultimately, however, it is up to each individual to what extent the passages then differ from one another.Even after the main story, it's still worth playing because the final exam of the fifth grade is waiting for you. So there's a good reason to keep zipping through Hogwarts after the credits roll, doing side quests and engaging in battles.The game doesn't reinvent the wheel and comparable fights, quests and open world tasks can be found in other games, but the creative and clever implementation of the story events in a video game design, coupled with the new game mechanics that are presented every few hours I was pleasantly and positively surprised. The game has many allusions to the Harry Potter world, but still has its own and new ideas that the developers turn into unforgettable game moments.Review date: February 11, 2023✔ long story campaign✔ magical and enormously detailed game world✔ atmospheric music✔ great fights through magic combos✔ lots to discover ✔ game mechanics clearly explained✔ letters give backgrounds to the game world✔ Harry Potter charm with lots of fan service✔ interesting side missions and collection tasks✔ world invites you to explore✔ countless puzzles and mysteries✘ quite stiff facial animations✘ no Morality System, Quidditch✘ sometimes very artificial-looking dialogues"

A story we value along side the beloved cannon. Hogwarts Legacy is proving to be sitting in the very epicenter of the spirit of what is the Harry Potter universe.the game sucks you in and doesnt let go, especially if you already adore the lore of this world.an original story that is rapturous in the fantasy we so longed for from this franchise.x1000 recommended"

I will lay the issues out. ISSUES:- Graphical Poppins- frame drops (even on rtx 4090)- NPC dialogue makes no sense (NPC conversations consists of asking each other random questions with no responses) - Unable to interact with NPCs (you literally walk through NPCs. I want to be able to cast random spells like levioso on students and have them react accordingly. Currently you are a ghost to everyone, besides supporting cast.) - OMG the Cats have no hair or textures. Like I said overall it's a fun game. I'd give a 7 or 8 / 10"

Finished the Campaign and most other stuff ( 97% completion of my challenges ). The soundtrack and feeling you get is very nice, the artwork is amazing. I have stuttering issues but it was playable. (might be my pc tbh... i7-6700k isnt what it used to be :P ) The thing that actually made me sad is the feeling that none of my decisions mattered.Whatever I said, whenever I pushed for the ""Dark Side"".... In the end... I´m the hero. Neither the ending nor anything else apart from maybe learning the 3 unforgiveables feels like its up to your choice. Beeing rude to NPCs / extorting them / betraying quest givers. Nothing happens... apart from maybe a different voiceline, but then everything is back to normal. I literally chose to take the powers. I used all unforgivable curses. Nobody cared. I was the hero... YAAAAAAY.... Replay value probably 0 unless you want to see a different common room / play in different house colours and maybe have 5 different side quests... Apart from that. Character feels overpowered very very easily if you put the talent points in the right talents combined with the right gear enchantments. Which is very hard to avoid considering how many points you get vs how many points are even possible to spend in total..."
91,Hiiitechpower,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197979740638/,39,1,1,33.2,February,15,406,0,1,"It's pretty good so far. You can tell where the dev team chose to spend their resources, and those areas of the game shine. Combat is very fun, exploration and flying around the world is fun, leveling up feels good (level 22 so far), and you always feel busy and never out of things you want to go do.The areas where it doesn't shine are economy design, early game pacing, and RPG systems where choices don't matter and the world does not change to player feedback. You should think of Hogwarts Legacy being more of an Assassin's Creed type game, than Skyrim.There's a lot of content, and I still have a long way to go. It took me 12 hours to unlock my broom and room of requirement. That was going at a normal pace through the main story and completing a few side quests along the way. It takes a long time for the game to ""Open Up"" but once it does it's a thoroughly fun experience.Overall 9/10 so far. What works and is fun is exceptional. What it lacks definitely makes you think ""What If"", but for me that doesn't overshadow the fact that this is still a Very Good Game!"
92,Bearsonal,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bearsonal/,421,17,0,66.5,February,11,"1,291",106,1,"I know this will piss many people off, seeing almost everyone loved this game and most of my friends as well, but I don't care. Hogwarts Legacy is nothing more qualified than a Ubisoft title. Okay, maybe a little bit more than that. It's ridiculous how people call Ubisoft's copy-paste open-world content trash and praise Hogwarts' bland content just because it is Harry Potter. In Hogwarts Legacy, the developers tried adding some Breath of the Wild shrine-like puzzles (Merline Trials) which consist of 6-7 types and are no-brainers. You memorize them, and the rest is a matter of finding butterflies, or other objects needed to pass the trial. Simply, they are fetch quests rather than actual puzzles. Moreover, they implemented some of Elden Ring's caves (mini-dungeons) because they had to do that too after Elden Ring's success, which is fighting the same enemies and mini boss again and again for some not-so-rewarding randomly generated loot at the end. This definitely is not an RPG where you can make your own path despite the developers saying so. It's an open-world action-adventure game. Yes, you can upgrade and find new gear (if that makes this game an RPG), but none of your choices matter. Devs saying you might even be a bad guy is also untrue here. Regardless of whatever you do, you're the hero in the end. Here is an example from my experience; during the side quests, I first offered people help for free, but after realizing that it would not change anything at all, I began charging them. This is the first time that I asked for money in return from people, in any videogame I played. That's how serious this is. You don't give your character's personality a form. Your characters Bearsonal'ity is already settled and you are simply a boring NPC. What else? You don't get rewarded or praised for not casting unforgivable spells, or punished for casting them. There is not even a single dialogue that condemns you for using these forbidden spells. Even if you couldn't add anything for that matter, you could have just added an achievement that said ""Complete the game without using the unforgivable spells"". You should have done at least that, developers. You may wander in the forbidden forest for days and perform unforgivable spells all the time. However, none of your professors will warn you or say anything to you about that matter. The main story is terrible. The storytelling and characters are dull and lifeless, and the side quest stories are not interesting either. Terrible villain, like almost all games, who is not given enough attention. Another lazy design is how professors teach you spells in exchange for fetch quests. Bleh. There is a day and night cycle, but that does not affect vendors. They will always be waiting for you to shop. There are not many people at the castle at night, that's all. This game should have just been around Hogwarts Castle and not focused on the open world. Combat is fun at first but gets fairly boring after 20+ hours. It's because of the lack of spell and enemy variety, dumb AI, and a combat system that's not very exciting. Traversing through the map is also a breeze after you have acquired the broom. There is no danger that you cannot handle. All you have to do is fly up if you want to get out of combat, not like there is any threat for you in the map. There are no dragons, goblins that use brooms, or any other enemy type that can counter your easy way out of battle. So flying is boring too. The game's marketing led me to believe that this would be Persona but Harry Potter. Even if it wouldn't be exactly what I hoped, I would expect so much more to do as a student inside Hogwarts than what you actually can. I hoped for a game that you had to go to classes in specific times, where there was authority, a similar experience to Bully. That would have made the game way better. You cannot interact with any person other than a few predetermined ones. In addition, you can not spend time with your friends as much as you want, sleep, do homework (legitimate homework, not fetch quests), eat food in the hall, or explore the ""magical"" (or should I say unalive) castle of Hogwarts. Hogwarts Castle is visually appealing, however, it feels dead inside. You don't feel like you are a student, instead, you feel like ""I am the chosen one and the hero of this world"". Common rooms are useless. There is nothing to do inside them or any reason to spend time in them at all. Hogwarts Castle is filled with invisible walls. Overall a bland atmosphere throughout the map. There are no puzzles. I wouldn't call those no-brainer Merlin Trials or ""Alohomora"" locks puzzles. There are many collectibles in the world as well, which are obviously artificial game lengtheners. There is no immersion at all, wasted potential.Optimization sucks. How tf can this game use 23Gb of RAM at times? It's inexplicable. Constant frame drops and stutters all over the place. Graphics are okay, feels like early PS4 era at most, lighting is terrible.To conclude, the major issue with Hogwarts Legacy is its game design and the lack of detail almost everywhere. It doesn't do the player any favors to direct them in every mission with the minimap and various hints. That is not how you lead the player into exploration. I can't have fun in any long lasting 50+ hours long open world game after experiencing BOTW, RDR2 and Elden Ring. Not only is the open world very poor content-wise, it is also not visually appealing. I disagree with those who say there is great art direction in Hogwarts Legacy. It looks just like the Far Cry 5 map, full of copy paste trees and zero points of interest. In Hogwarts Legacy, where can the player look and say: ""What's that interesting looking thing over there?"" Just like how we all said in Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild. Regarding Hogwarts, because everything is already marked on your map for you, you just open the map, mark your next quest and follow the path by tracking the minimap with your eye. As a result, the urge to explore disappears. What's there to explore when you % 100 know what you are going to find? Developers, it's 2023, learn from the innovative and successful examples around you. Follow My Curator Page:"

The universe is very well retranscribed and very immersive, the number of references, small details or lore are huge and you will be directly immersed in it if you are a fan of the universe.The story is very intriguing, you want to go on to know the continuation but also want to take your time and do the many other possible activities in the game.  The exploration is excellent, there are a lot of collectibles scattered in the open world that will allow you to unlock in addition to the lore, various cosmetic elements.  There are as in any open world, a good number of side quests, as well as a housing system very chill. If you like loot, you will enjoy it.I was afraid of the combat system but it is actually very satisfying, many combo are possible thanks to the different spells you will unlock during the adventure. There is also a possibility to play in infiltration even if it remains quite minimal.  The ""dungeon"" system is really cool too, there are a lot of side areas where you can find more loot and there are also many interesting puzzles but often spoiled in my opinion by the clues given a little too quickly.Despite its optimization which could have been better, I recommend this excellent game which if you are a fan of the universe but also if you are looking for an open world with a lot of content and a quite innovative universe will satisfy you."

99,Victors!,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheVictors500/,27,2,1,76.3,February,20,226,2,1,"Gra bardzo ciekawa, myślę że solidne 8.5/10 jest dobrą oceną ze względu na niedogodności, które opiszę niżej.PLUSY:✔️ ✔️Oprawa audio-wizualna na wysokim poziomie. Tereny jak i Hogwart bardzo dobrze odtworzony. Raytracing robi robotę (co prawda często się buguje, ale zostanie to naprawione w patchu)✔️Gameplay ciekawy, nie nużący po 70H, jednak w niektórych momentach wydaję się za prosty. Zagadki co prawda powtarzające się to jednak wymagające od początkującego gracza.✔️ Gra z godziny na godzine się rozkręca co uważam za plus, nie jest to typowe monotonne bieganie po mapie jak w niektórych innych tytułach z otwartym światem.✔️ Sama główna kampania na jakieś 30-35h, jednak rekomendowane jest wykonywanie pobocznych zadań relacji przed każdym głównym, aby przedłużyć i rozwinąć trochę główną fabułę. Zakończenie nie spoilerując jest raczej standardowe/klasyczne jak na grę tego typu (nie było jakoś zaskakujące).✔️ System levelowania jak i ekwipunek standardowy dla tego typu gier. ✔️ Ciekawy system rzucania zaklęć i odblokowywania ich, jednak ze względu na to, że do głównej kampanii nie ma za dużych wymagań co do odblokowań (gre da się praktycznie przejść mają tylko podstawowe zaklęcia) to psuje to trochę możliwości jakie twórcy maja przy tworzeniu róznych poziomów rozgrywki (stopień skomplikowania zagadek jest niższy niż w pobocznych, często wymaga użycia tego samego schematu zaklęć).✔️ Możliwość skradania się w grze, przejścia poziomów ""po cichu"" (nie jest to jednak zawsze możliwe, czasami gra ""odsłania"" gracza automatycznie przed przeciwnikiem/przeciwnicy nadal nas widzą nawet kiedy jesteśmy niewidzialni lub wymaga tego gra)MINUSY:❌ Moim zdaniem animacje postaci i mimika twarzy jest momentami za drętwa (w tych bardziej ""dramatycznych"" momentach).❌ Powtarzające się teksty i zdania wypowiadane przez główną postać lub też osoby trzecie (np. dwie te same kwestie przy każdorazowym wchodzeniu do Hogsmede, Pokoju Życzeń etc.). Uciążliwe po 70H.❌ Optymalizacja to jest sam w sobie oddzielny problem (najnowszy patch ma to natomiast mocno poprawić). 3090 w 4K (RT/Ultra) osiągała średnio 60fps z DLSS w Hogwart, 30fps w niektórych lasach, 40-45 w Hogsmede, natomiast z spadkami/stutterami co jakiś czas przy ładowaniu terenu itd. (32GB rekomendowane do gry).❌ Kilka niedociągnięć, błędów graficznych z raytracingiem (przebijające światlo przez ściany), cutscenki czasami nie doładowywały na czas tekstur w tle/cieni na postaciach co trochę psuło immersję w niektórych momentach. Błędy pokroju blokowania się postaci na jakiś ścianach/schodach powtarzały się dosyć notorycznie. Wiekszość z tych rzeczy zostanie na pewno naprawione w patchu.❌ Ten sam przycisk usuwania/ustawień w menu, przez co przypadkowo można było skasować save gry.❌ Z kilka razy podczas 75H gameplay spotkałem się z błędami, które wymagały wczytania zapisu od nowa (np. zbugowane zejście z miotły, nie dało sie z niej nigdzie zejść)❌ System ekwipunku mógłby posiadać kilka dodatkowych opcji np. blokowanie wyglądu postaci, aby nie trzeba było przy każdej zmianie ubrania zmieniać wygląd na ten co był wcześniej.❌ Niektóre elementy menu wyzwań niezbyt intuicyjne na poczatku (np. pamiętanie o odbiorze nagród za dane wyzwanie, za każdym razem kiedy je się wykona, co prawda gra przypomina o tym co jakiś czas na dole ekranu)❌ Model latania początkowo wymagający (pad), jedna gałka służy za skręcia lewo/prawo, druga za góra/dół oraz kamere co przeszkadza początkowo w locie (z tego co wiem, nie da się tego zmienić w ustawieniach). EN VERSION:The game is very interesting, I think a solid 8.5/10 is a good rating due to the inconveniences that I will describe below.PROS:✔️ ✔️ Audio-visual setting at a high level. The grounds and Hogwarts are very well recreated. Raytracing does the job (although it often bugs, but it will be fixed in the patch)✔️Gameplay interesting, not boring after 70H, but at some moments it seems too simple. Although the puzzles are repetitive, they are demanding from a novice player.✔️ The game is getting started every hour, which I consider a plus, it's not a typical monotonous running around the map like in some other open-world titles.✔️ The main campaign alone for about 30-35h, however, it is recommended to complete side relationship quests before each main one to extend and develop the main storyline a bit. The ending without spoilers is rather standard/classic for a game of this type (it wasn't surprising at all).✔️ Leveling system as well as standard equipment for this type of games.✔️ An interesting system of casting spells and unlocking them, but due to the fact that the main campaign does not have too high requirements for unlocking (the game is practically possible to pass only basic spells) it spoils the possibilities that the creators have when creating different levels gameplay (the level of complexity of the puzzles is lower than in the side ones, they often require the use of the same spell scheme).✔️ The ability to sneak in the game, pass levels ""silently"" (however, this is not always possible, sometimes the game ""reveals"" the player automatically from the opponent / opponents still see us even when we are invisible or the game requires it)CONS:❌ In my opinion, character animations and facial expressions are sometimes too numb (in these more ""dramatic"" moments).❌ Repetitive texts and sentences spoken by the main character or third parties (e.g. two of the same lines every time you enter Hogsmede, Room of Requirement, etc.). Nuisance after 70H.❌ Optimization is a separate problem in itself (the latest patch is supposed to improve it a lot). 3090 in 4K (RT/Ultra) averaged 60fps with DLSS in Hogwarts, 30fps in some forests, 40-45 in Hogsmede, while with occasional drops/stutters when loading terrain etc. (32GB recommended for the game).❌ A few shortcomings, graphical errors with raytracing (light shining through the walls), cutscenes sometimes did not recharge the background textures / shadows on the characters on time, which spoiled the immersion at some moments. Bugs like characters getting stuck on some walls/stairs were repeated quite notoriously. Most of these things will be fixed in the patch for sure.❌ The same delete/settings button in the menu, which could accidentally delete the game save.❌ Several times during 75H gameplay I encountered errors that required reloading the save (e.g. bugged descent from the broom, it was impossible to get off it anywhere)❌ The equipment system could have a few additional options, e.g. blocking the character's appearance, so that you don't have to change the appearance to what it was before every time you change clothes.❌ Some elements of the challenge menu are not very intuitive at the beginning (e.g. remembering to collect rewards for a given challenge every time you complete it, although the game reminds you about it from time to time at the bottom of the screen)❌ The flying model is initially demanding (pad), one knob is used for turning left / right, the other for up / down and the camera, which initially interferes with the flight (as far as I know, it cannot be changed in the settings)."
100,general.kronos,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060509134/,"1,193",55,0,37.4,February,12,17,102,0,"I strongly believe that this game would not be as popular if it wasn't about the world of Harry Potter. There is an obvious love for visual details in the game, but there is not much substance behind it. The common rooms look beautiful, but there is absolutely nothing to do in them, you cannot talk to the npc's there, you cannot sit in a chair or sleep in your bed... These are but  a few minor details, but indicative of a bigger problem with the game; there is no immersion, your character does not seem to be part of the world. You cannot interact with most NPCs. they do not react to your spells, the dialogue options mostly do not matter for the progression of the story, there is no real day/night cycle (There is day and night, but shops are also open in the night, vendors do not seem to sleep or go out of their shop).After a few hours the combat gets repetitive, there is not a lot of enemy variety, the number of brewable potions and of plants is low. There is no real excitement of which spells you will be able to learn because the UI shows you all the spells and their names from the beginning, they are simply not selectable. The ""unforgivable"" curses are totally forgivable, there is 0 consequences to using them, during missions you can use them right next to your professor and he won't care in the slightest...Most hidden areas just contain a single chest with randomly generated loot. Your gear slots are very limited so you will have to fast travel a lot to vendors simply to get rid of the loot. Your gear is upgradeable, but I never bothered to upgrade it and under normal difficulty there really seems to be no reason to upgrade it.Finally there is a ton of collectibles (field pages, chests etc...) But these mostly to have been put in there to artificially add playing hours which provide little entertainement.I had a few hours of fun in the beginning, exploring the castle etc, but after that the veil fell and I noticed how basic the gameplay is and how unoriginal the main story line is. I would definitely wait for a price drop before buying it."

103,Preator,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000207900/,42,1,1,84.3,February,25,"1,973",5,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a third-person action-adventure game with some minor RPG and exploration folded into the mix. Set in the Wizarding World universe, this game finally lets you explore the castle of Hogwarts and the surrounding area with near-limitless freedom. But did this game capture the magic of the Harry Potter books and movies? Let's find out below.Hogwarts Legacy takes place in the 1800s, a long while before the events of Harry Potter. You play as a self-named and created character arriving at Hogwarts for his first year starting in the 5th year of school. Almost immediately upon setting off for your year of school, the flying carriage you are riding is involved in an incident where the villain, Ranrok, is after something in your possession.This unravels into a scramble for answers and unlocks your powers as quickly as possible to help your new friends and Hogwarts survive this growing threat. With the help of your mentor Professor Fig and some of the other professors at the school providing you with special assignments to hone your considerable talents, your powers grow significantly and impressively quickly, as well as your understanding of your place in this story.For the most part, the story is actually well-written and provides a lot of nostalgia for fans of the WW series. But this is ultimately undone by the lack of fluidity, flow and at times, rushed plot points that litter the entire game. You finally feel invested in a storyline, blazed through in a single mission and forgotten. Pretty sad as this story could have been expanded and would have been sensational.Hogwarts Legacy has quite a considerable repertoire of spells you can unlock and use throughout the story and exploration. Some spells are best utilised for puzzles and activities, and others are more combat proficient.Spells also fall into colour categories which help differentiate them for their use, as well as their purpose in combat. Purple shields can only be damaged by purple or ""force"" spells, yellow shields can only be broken by yellow or ""control"" spells and so on. Falling into one of the categories, Control, Force, Damage, Essential, Utility and Unforgivable. Unforgivable curses are broken as they can break any shield colour and dominate combat quite easily.Exploration plays a large part in the game, even though you won't need to or get much time to explore until you're finished with the rather lengthy tutorial. The best items can only be located by exploring dark caves and dungeons.I have to admit, however, while exploring was fun and fascinating in the first part of the game, it became more tedious in the latter, and I tended to avoid it entirely.Flying!!! I absolutely adore flying around on the broom or on the back of a creature and experiencing the world from way above it. There is just something absolutely captivating about it!But Hogwarts Legacy also doesn't have Quidditch in it, removing the main reason people would want to fly around. With fast travel available that is lore-friendly, there is already a quick means of travelling the world. They just removed a reason to get good at flying.This is the part where I'm going to cover a lot of little annoyances and missing content that bothered me during the game.Morality.There is none. You have the ability to cast both light and dark magic, but nobody really cares about it. There is no downside to killing people outright with Avada Kedavra, just as there's no reason to avoid it.Day/Night Cycle.Time does continue to tick as you play the game, and day and night do come to pass, but these events don't mean anything either. When you wake up in your dorm there is nobody still in their beds, and you are all alone. The school empties out for a few hours, but nobody is roaming the halls looking for students.Houses and house points.Joining one of the four houses, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw should mean something, but really they are just a mild aesthetic kick and have no real purpose. You don't gain points for your house by being a good student or doing complex challenges, and you will win the house cup regardless of your effort.This title is beautiful. Landscapes will capture your breath, and the amount of detail put into the world's design and development is astounding. Probably one of the most impressive graphical experiences available today. Particle effects from spells and the overall ambience are above the standard.The audio falls into a very similar basket. The ambience of waves crashing against rocks, trees rustling in the wind and birds chirping as they fly by is brilliantly captivating. While the soundtrack captures nostalgia and wonderment that the movies did so perfectlyRunning the game on high and set to 2560 x 1440 resolution, I never saw the game drop below 60 FPS. Ultra RTX did cause the game to chug quite viciously, however, but was fine as soon as I turned it down to high. I also didn't experience any significant bugs or issues whilst playing the game, which is impressive.RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 58%)CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 13.4%)GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 70%)While I had a lot of nitpicks to say about this game, the overall experience wasn't bad at all. Was it worth the current price? No, not really, Was it fun? Yeah, it was, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was. If you're a fan of the franchise, give this game a shot, but I would suggest waiting for a decent sale as I don't think there's enough here to warrant the price."

(pretty on the surface but cast revelio and you'll notice how very shallow it is)the world is big yes but feels really dead outside of Hogwarts, its just filled with very stupid repeatable ""puzzles"" that seem to never end. you did one of them successfully? well that's great now go fly elsewhere and repeat it 1000 times. some of different puzzles will be introduced to you during quests where you do one and then they tell you to do more in your spare time. if you do decide on collecting stuff then for exploration there is also a lot of backtracking, example you run around collecting stuff and end up in 1 room where there are 3 things to collect but 2 of them are locked behind closed doors (and you get the extremely-annoying-to-use spell for it later) or require some spell that you don't have right now. please come back again later lol.The game has an utterly pointless MMO-style (green-blue-purple-orange) loot system. you can finish it with the starter level 1 gear and its just mostly filling your inventory and blocks you from opening chests later because your inventory is full so either destroy it/sell to vendor or just ignore all chests, still you might want to collect some for the looks which you can apply to active gear.rather mediocre story (with a unisex main character without any backstory whatsoever) and even worse boring side quests. starting at 5th year - why? who taught MC about magic before? not important i guess. also the ridiculous scale of things, you're a 5th grader but will take on mythical monsters and deadly mages from organized criminal gangs in combat along the way as a pastime between classes - rather ridiculous.also Hogwarts in 1800s is more diverse than any place in real world lol... in addition to British/European professors there are also ones from Japan, Uganda, India, Persia? they even insert a Korean teacher during an idiotic fetch stuff quest for learning lock-picking... why not include native Americans?! i guess they are not on your representation checklist lmao) no morality system, you can just run around and cast ""forbidden"" spells while on a quest with your classmates and they will only give some empty comment like, oh looks you're not afraid of dark magic bla bla bla. why is it even so controversial to use ""dark magic"" anyway, you're telling me its bad to kill someone with it but is ok to blow them up to pieces with a fireball instead??? also the choices you make (and that's limited to being either nice or mean to someone - example, they ask you to recover something for them and you'll return and say im going to keep it etc) along the way really don't matter at all and everything will play out the same way regardless of everything you did.on the positive the combat system is quite fun and using different spell combos feels rewarding. Hogwarts does have this atmosphere like in books/movies. its the only >decent< game in potter universe. also the first for this developer i believe? hopefully the next one will be better. being a big brand with big backers behind it it should've been much more than this.as a slap on the face at the end i found there is one more ""main quest"" after the ending to do but my level was too low for that - well i'm not going to grind those stupid puzzles for that. bye.overall i don't recommend it for full price but is ok to get it for a discount later on."
105,Crowzer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/crowzer/,38,1,1,70.8,March,7,522,0,1,"Just finished Hogwarts Legacy and it's an excellent game !Even if there are flaws, Hogwarts Legacy conquered me. I'm not a big fan of Harry Potter (I watched all the movies and read a couple of books) but I like the universe and I had a ton of fun in Hogwarts Legacy.The main story is quite engaging and the companion ones are also intriguing (I love the Sebastian story).Hogwarts Legacy combats mechanics are simple but really fun. Only 26 spells but it was enough and there is a plethora of spells combos.Visual ? I put everything to max (even ray-tracing) and Hogwarts Legacy is fabulous, but indeed, it requires a monster PC.Two interesting features in Hogwarts Legacy are :- Pokemon-like, there are a lot of creatures to catch-up and after, feed/clean them.- Housing. There is big room (which increase with story) where you can decorate as you wish. Furniture is available in the open-world chests.- Character creation is awesome ! Let's talk about the open-world. Well, it's quite generic like Ubisoft games but not that bad. You have a lot of places to explore, destroy poacher camps, visiting other villages, doing quests, etc... Lot of activities to do between main quests.I did almost all the side quests but the 'collectibles' thing inherent in the majority of open-worlds quickly bored me. For example, I only did a few trials of Merlin.Like Wo Long Fallen Dynasty and like the other recent releases on PC, Hogwarts Legacy is badly optimized. There are few guides around to improve framerate and stability but there are no miracles. The Reddit thread named ""PC Performance Tips - This got rid of low FPS dips for me and friends"" can work for you. It does for me, so you give a try.On Steam Deck : I locked to 45 FPS the game is quite playable but still suffer from framerate drops.Hope Avalanche devs will work on patches for PC version of Hogwarts Legacy.Yes, Hogwarts Legacy is a good RPG than will make busy for hours. Also, if you play on PC, there are a lot of mods for the game. It doesn't seem to be planned at the moment, but I hope there will be DLC in the future."
106,iamSean,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199477113075/,30,2,0,90.0,March,17,10,2,1,"I really want to love this game. But unfortunately the level of delight at the beginning is equal to the level of disappointment at the end. Lots of cool stuff. But everything feels unfinished. Animals, plants, potions. Useless.There are few plants. I bought all of them at the start of the game. Grew them once and did not come to them again. Save animals? Cool! But really you just put them in your bag. And then there is a bug when they just get stuck in a cage. Cubs do not grow and are no different from adults. There are many colors like in Pokemon. But they didn't do anything about it. They simply exist. I was expecting at least something from the potions. Maybe I'll add the ingredients myself? Or make your own potions like in Skyrim? No. It's about 6 potions. And only green potion is useful.Puzzles exist only for you to spend time on them. Without them the game would have been quite short. Tbh at start I liked them. But then i quickly realized that they are all the same. But on the map there are an insane amount of them. And at the end I got a bug that didn't let me complete the collections. 139/140 chests. Now they seem to have fixed it. But the taste of disappointment stayed with me. locks exist only for you to return to old locations. You will get the ability to open them in the middle of the game.The story is a complete failure. Illusions of choice. Empty characters. I don't even want to talk about the end of the game. This is a disappointment. I don't know who decided it would be okay.When I saw Hogwarts for the first time I thought that I would explore the world like in Witcher. Don't expect it. There is no mystery here.I would still give a like for this game. I spent so much time there. And the emotions that you get at the start are incredible. But the end made me so sad."
107,lumen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/schillings/,563,30,0,68.0,February,16,376,0,1,"I'd rate this neutral if I could, but having to pick between good and bad I gotta pick the latter I'm afraid:Pro:- the World: Hogwarts is awesome, Hogsmeade is nice. The rest is... serviceable- combat is better than expected- music- visuals- voiceacting- atmosphere (in Hogsmeade/Hogwarts anyway)Cons:- all the copy pasted open world garbage: It's all so basic and identical that I don't think you could even simplify it further. 'Cairn dungeons' is the phrase they use to describe a tunnel of 200m length with a chest at the end. They copy pasted the very same cairn 'dungeon' about 150 times. Spoiler: The tunnel has right, left turn. Don't get lost.- combat falls entirely flat towards the 2nd half. Same enemies, no customization and the stat system shows it's flaws: troll 3 levels above you will 1-2 shot you which is fine, but a troll 5 levels below you can't even touch you.- there's about 10 enemies in this game total. And that's being generous. Goblins/Dark Mages/Trolls/Spiders. These 4 cover 99% of enemies you'll fight.- performance is still fairly poor. It runs okay'ish on higher end hardware but nothing more. And on this point: The promised 'Day 1' patch came 1 week after pre-launch and did little to nothing.- Difficulty: I played on hard and was a breeze. I understand this isn't a Souls game. But there's difficulties for the casuals, where is the difficulty for people who like a challenge?- Controls are kinda clunky, both on controller AND M/KB. Consumable wheel especially.- bunch of minor bugs, but mostly non- consequential. The only notable one for me: unfinishable sidequest (Biscuit)- you spend way too little time in Hogwarts. And the game encourages quicktravel and following the map blindly way too much.- accessibility settings aren't well thought out. I wanted to play without minimap and assistances to stop myself from mindlessly going from one world objective to the other, but there's not even a compass without the minimap...- Hogsmeade? More like Alohomeade. Seriously, there's nothing here other than shops and about 50 Alohomora 'Puzzles'- doesn't matter at all what house you play- this would've been better as a regular RPG focusing on Hogwarts and its immediate surroundings. With a regular character experiencing Hogwarts first time instead of all these grandiose plots. But its Warner Bros, so of course you're some random 5th year who just so happens to be the best wizard of all time. Excelling at everything the moment you touch it.  Oh and your magic is special too of course, no one else has it.- ... and of course you're the hero too, no choices on that matter, no dark path."
108,Zoneling,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zoneling/,214,9,0,22.7,February,13,575,66,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is the best Harry Potter game to date, but as a game on its own merit, at its current price range, it leaves something to be desired. This game is a  for Harry Potter fans, or fans of the Witcher 3's combat and exploration. This game is very similar to the Witcher 3 in a LOT of ways, from the style of the combat, to the four equippable spells, to the repeating side-mission-esque puzzles and minor boss fights.For everyone else, however, it's a thumbs down. For 60 euros, you're getting maybe 20-25 hours of actual content. The rest is copy+paste side-missions and exploration. Now, the team here has made a AMAZING environment, but its big heavy-hit is nostalgia. Without the nostalgia, the environment is impressive, but not nearly as much as it is for a fan of the series.The story is awful. I'm sorry, but I have to be honest here. It's so bland and childish it's kind of embarassing. And it leaks into the characters and conversations too. The protagonist literally massacres hundreds of dark wizards and goblins, as a 15 year old, and nobody, including themselves, bats an eye at this. The actual main plot is not explored nearly to the extent that I wish it was, instead giving you a moustache-twirling villain, with hopelessly under-explored motives.If you're here looking for the magical story-telling of the books, RUN! It's not here!This is really what ruins the game for me. As I will cover later, the game actually has good characters that I'd love to see more of, but you rarely see more than one of them at a time. You interact with them in the same way that a WoW character interacts with quest NPC's, and that's a real shame.What that means is that the main plot is mainly just you, the bland self-insert, doing literally everything. Sometimes another character is along, but it's just for the ride. You're the chosen one.The combat is good, very good, but it's not THAT good.In fact, the story ruins more than that, because it means that your main interaction with the beautiful environment is just... collectibles. The story utilises the awesome environment so little, in fact, often you are spirited away to completely separate mini-dungeons, where you then fight off boss-goons to advance.Just... why?Oh yeah, and of course, the actual story is also super short, meaning you get very little content for your money. And replayability? Forget it. There are no decisions here. All playthroughs will be the same pretty much, especially if you try to complete your side-quests.The other characters fit well into the Harry Potter universe, without being carbon copies of book characters. In general, I found most of the characters pretty memorable. My favourite was Natty. I just thought she was nice.None of the characters feel out place, and there is a pretty good selection of main characters to interact with. Sadly, only one of these characters really interacts that much with the main story, Professor Fig. He's the only one who is really there from start to finish, and even then only really as a mentor character. You really miss the shenanigans and shared adventures that the books portrayed. Sadly, this just adds insult to the injury that is how they are used in the main story. I NEVER, not even ONCE, felt like I needed any of these characters. Except for teaching me a few spells, I, the main character, do EVERYTHING MYSELF. You don't get the feeling of complimenting talents like you do in the original series at all, it's just you against the goblin horde, assisted by Professor Fig who does boring study-stuff for you.What a waste!The real attraction is the combat. As I mentioned, it's very similar in feel to the Witcher 3. Now, if you've played the Witcher 3, you know that all runes except the protective one are basically useless compared to just hitting stuff with your sword.So imagine the Witcher 3, but with awesome spells, and you have the combat in Hogwars Legacy. If you're good at cycling spell sets, you can do combos with an array of up to 16(!) different spells. The skill ceiling is insanely high on these, and it's a lot of fun to watch the fireworks so to speak, as you sling burning goblins into each other, back to you, set them on fire, and back again. It's A LOT of fun!Oh my goodnees, the environment! This is hands-down the most fun I've had exploring since... ever, probably. You get to bloody fly, and they barely restrict it! And it's awesome! There's so much to see, so much to collect. For completionists like me, it's both a dream and nightmare at the same time.Most places have little lore tid-bits for you to collect and read, and the environment is lovingly hand-crafted, with a real attention to detail. Especially Harry Potter fans will really appreciate it, but honesly I think it's impressive no matter who you are.The only thing that really ruins it a bit, is the population of this world. Similar to early Cyberpunk, the sidewalk characters do.... literally nothing. They just walk around aimlessly, or stand idle in their set positions. Sometimes they say some neat things, but it's generally pretty disappointing when we're so used to better in games these days.But otherwise, the environments of this game are beautiful. Graphically it's a bit last-gen, but the art direction is superb, and to top it off, it actually runs pretty well. At least, it does for me."
109,b3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/b3nvfx/,19,,1,29.9,February,11,"3,759",0,1,"What appeals to me most about Hogwarts Legacy isn't its mastery over just one aspect of the game, but how it seems to achieve so much in a singular title. I have spent a considerable amount of time on several recent AAA titles but nothing comes close to complete at this.To elaborate, Forspoken had amazing gameplay and parkour mechanics but the NPC interactions felt stiff and clearly weren't very polished. Spider-Man similarly had great gameplay and cinematic story-telling, but it didn't feel like a very personalized experience more so than a trip to the movies. Hogwarts Legacy was different. You don't dive straight into any long intense combat sessions or get super flashy moves from the get-go, but instead emphasize gradual progression and an immersive experience.For starters, it's much more rewarding, and it gives you time to absorb the rich history, lore, and present-day slice of life the developers have prepared for you. I'm about 10 hours into the game and every dialogue I've been in so far was fully voiced, even your own character. So many things are happening simultaneously in the school, random events will trigger as you walk around and it really goes to show just how much love the developers have placed into this game to curate such an immersive experience.Definitely World-building, 100%. Even though the whole ""theme"" of Hogwarts is a magic school, few places inside felt completely the same. I'm surprised at the variety of assets they created. I'll see things I've never seen before, walk up, study them, and there are even field guides that tell you what they are. Every part of the school feels unique and the experience was in short, magical. From the different animal skeletons you find, the moving paintings, the ghosts loitering around, the moving (empty) knights in armor, to even the students walking to class and all the conversations I can eavesdrop on. There's already so much to talk about and I haven't even counted the open world.The relationships you meet at school don't feel at all superficial. They don't always mention it directly, but just their expressions, choice of words, and tone of voice are enough for you to draw your own conclusions about what has happened behind the scenes, making the game feel more expansive than it already is. I'm really enjoying talking to people and despite having the option to skip text as you read, I have yet to skip a single dialogue, all so I can hear the voice acting in full.Attending classes, meeting new professors, and exploring Hogwarts Castle didn't feel as restrictive as I would have thought. On the contrary, I had so much freedom to do whatever I wanted, even explore the open world that I've never grown weary at the thought of being forced to go to class or feel trapped in a linear gameplay loop.I usually have pretty high expectations for real-time combat systems, but Hogwarts Legacy genuinely did it justice. It was surprisingly fun, and I find myself craving to meet new foes and fight as soon as possible. It's not as hard as dark souls, but I'm certainly seeing some semblance of one. You can cast offensive magic spells but starting out you won't be reliant on them to decimate your foes. Instead, you'll be using the most fundamental basic attacks, defending, countering, and dodging the majority of the time. It takes some time to master but it feels a lot more rewarding than being a walking auto-killing machine.Next would be Flying. They did it right by not forcing it into a priority mode of transport like most games. It makes traveling the open world more enjoyable, there's a Stamina System (for boosting) that keeps the player's attention and the no-flying zones help limit the player's reliability on them. I find that the moment we get some sort of mount or fast-moving mode of transport, players will be using that ALL the time and they start missing out on all the wonderful details in the world, the voices that play in the background. Flying only plays a small part of this, but I've seen many games where world-building has become less important than getting to the destination quicker in an effort to min-max time and resources.There's the beasts and plants mechanic, talents, customization features, dialogue choices, and lots of things that make the world richer and more personalized. I'll cut it short here since I think this section is already pretty long. All in all, games should be an enjoyable experience, and I think Hogwarts did a great job of focusing on the healthier aspects of a game for the players.Although they did a lot of optimizations to keep the experience seamless, the experience can sometimes be jarring and offputting. There weren't any loading screens whenever you move between areas, but you'll find your game lagging very frequently as a result for short bursts of time before it becomes smooth again.It's caused me a lot of headaches to be honest. I'm looking at a pretty big screen, and the lag spikes paired with the intense motion blur cause me bouts of motion sickness. If you're reading this and you have the same issue, I highly recommend you turn off motion blur, and also increase the field of view to +20 in the display options.I'm not familiar with the minimum graphics requirement, but I'm running a Ryzen 5950x, RTX 3060Ti with 64GB RAM, and the benchmark recommended settings are set to Medium. Even with Nvidia DLSS, going any higher will result in a significant hit in performance, especially when entering any cutscenes. On the Steam Deck, it runs pretty smooth on the Low Graphics Settings, but the experience was pretty much incomparable. In the case of Spider-Man for example, the experience on PC and Steam Deck felt almost identical and the graphics were still crisp and smooth, but it wasn't the case on the Steam Deck.This turned out to be fairly long. Woah. In any case, everything above is completely based on my own opinions having played the game during the Early Launch Period. There may be patches and updates in the future that addresses the concerns I have above. Despite its flaws, Hogwarts Legacy is still an amazing game, and compared to any other full-priced AAA title on the market, as long as you have a love for fantasy, magic, and RPGs, you'll definitely get your money's worth. That would be all."

While the graphics may not be the most spellbinding, they are still decent and do a good job of bringing the world of Hogwarts to life. The gameplay, however, is as smooth as butterbeer, and the story is a delightful romp through the beloved world of Harry Potter. I was absolutely spellbound by the ability to create my own wizard and attend Hogwarts, experiencing all the magic and wonder I've only ever read about.

112,Homer Morisson,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hmorisson789/,296,20,0,63.5,February,16,970,0,1,"As great as the main story and most ""relationship line"" major side stories are, the world is utterly empty for the most part, there is ZERO ""I'm a student at Hogwarts"" gameplay outside of 1 or 2 short cutscenes per class, that's it.Your choice of house doesn't matter one bit, your dialogue and behaviour choices are always the exact same no matter if you're Slytherin or Hufflepuff.Using the Dark Arts? No one cares... you can literally cast Avada Kedavra right IN FRONT of your professors, and they do not even react, let alone cause you any consequences whatsoever.Hogwarts itself, while visually impressive to be sure, has zero point zero percent ""Sentient Castle"" feel... nothing... there aren't even the iconic moving staircases... they only fade in and out visually, but they are nonetheless 100% static, always connecting the same point A to the same point B.Room of Requirement also is a major letdown, as it has zero roleplaying value, it is simply a room full of resource nodes, and the Vivaria are just the same... sure, for a few minutes it might be nice to watch a Hippogriff young offspring frolick about, but that's all you're getting... the animals themselves are also just glorified resource nodes, all you can do is brush, feed, harvest, repeat ad nauseam.The stuff you can summon both in RoR and Vivaria is also just scene dressing... if you were thinking of actually entering that Cottage you spawned in your Vivarium, think again.... if you thought you could sit down on those comfy chairs you just summoned, think again.Same with everything outside of the RoR as well... think you could go to the Great Hall, sit down at your House Table and eat, interact with friends/NPCs of your house, etc? Think again.The few things Hogwarts Legacy does well, it does really well... but everything else, and especially the ending of the main story, where your choices make zero difference, with there not even being any Epilogue to speak of... it all feels very rushed, and the game pretty much in all aspects aside from Main and ""Relationship Line"" story fails utterly to live up to the potential that is there in abundance.On top of all that, there's the abysmal technical state affecting a huge number of players even on 4090-level gaming rigs, and the fact that the game is massively shorter than what the devs promised... if I hadn't gotten it for free, I would've honestly refunded it, or otherwise felt majorly taken for a ride.Given that the game puts our ""Legacy"" so front and center, there's very little communication thereof while you play the game... for the most part, there are literally ZERO consequences to your actions, it simply doesn't matter what you do or don't do, if you use the Unforgivable Curses or not, not even what you decide during the crucial final minutes of the story... and as I said above, there isn't even any proper Epilogue, nothing to actually show you how your choices changed the world around you, i.e. what your ""Legacy"" actually would be.Nothing at all. And that leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste... so much wasted potential... this game could have been a true masterpiece... as it stands, I cannot in good conscience recommend it for full price."

119,Jedo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/,31,1,1,70.2,February,17,"4,038",0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy has been a wildly entertaining experience so far. I haven't touched anything related to the game since I finished all the OG books, but diving into this game brought back some fond memories from my childhood.I think the biggest part of this game that I loved is how it captured the vivid scenery of Hogsmeade as described in the books. The game also managed to deliver that first day of classes type excitement from year-to-year—albeit in a condensed late-bloomer 5th year package. So far, this game has been the best depiction of the wizarding world in game format. You honestly feel it the moment you get sorted and even more so when you first exit the school to travel to Hogsmeade! This game's open world is vast and beautiful, and I haven't been so happy to fully explore a game like this since Skyrim. In the blink of an eye, I noticed that 70h had gone by without me even thinking about it. If it wasn't obvious enough, I really enjoyed my time at Hogwarts.As far as performance goes, I recognize others with stronger GPUs had issues. Personally, I did not experience any major issues on my end with my RTX 2080. I maybe experienced stuttering for about 1-2 minutes total out of 70h of play, but relative to my peers I basically had a stress-free experience.The combat is beautiful and definitely has flashy moves, but I do think some of the cooler spells come a little bit too late into the story to fully enjoy. In that same breath, the ability to fly with your broom also feels like it comes quite late as well (or maybe it just felt that way because I was taking in the beautiful sights).When it comes to exploration, the huge amount of collectibles may be intimidating but they don't feel like a chore because majority of the collectibles serve a greater purpose than just non-essential pick-ups. Most of the collectible categories come with a good bit of lore to really enhance your understanding of that world, and the rest are polished cosmetics for either your character or base-building. It was actually fun collecting them all!My only gripe about this game which I'm sure will be fixed soon is that I am currently locked out of 100% because the Biscuit side quest's lock is bugged (I opened it prematurely) and won't spawn. I'm not too bothered about it though as every other element in the game was fun to play out through and through!! I know this game is very controversial, but even a bad parent (author) can raise an excellent child (story) that can outgrow them if given the right environment and attention. This game has grown bigger than its creator, and the developers+designers that worked on Hogwarts Legacy really put their love into it. It's really hard to create anything this beautiful if you come at it with a hateful heart. Give the game a fair look if you can be a partial person. Screw the author, but seriously the rest of the team did a great job."

That's it, you are actually playing another ""RPG"" with the same formula commonly implemented by companies like Ubisoft, the typical generic structure that works as a basic rpg and that's it, don't expect wondrous features, special gameplay, none of what you are thinking will find it in here (the same generic structure that you could find not only at most recent Ubisoft rpgs -ACs-, but also from some games by WB Games as well, like Middleearth: Shadow of War).This game, that qualifies as a rpg because of this generic implemented formula, is a letdown, specially coming from someone who grew up with the HP saga (read the books and everything).Yea, you got Hogwarts to explore and everything, but you don't have the feeling of being a proper student at it, there's no class framework, you just attend one class for 1 or 2 times, then you are free forever to bs around the castle (expected something like famous Bully, from Rockstar, a system that makes you feel you are a student).Teachers that teach you spells that don't even belong to the classes they are teaching (Wingardium Leviosa, for example, a charm spell being teached by the professor in charge of Herbology, what?).Game lacks of spells tbh, and if you thought you could be a dark wizard (one of the main points some people bought the game, including me), it's all a LIE, yea, you get the three unforgivables, but the whole world doesn't react into you using them, you can't openly kill people, only designated enemies (other dark wizards and dirty goblins). No morality system what so ever.Even the main storyline, tricks you into choosing an outcome, but in reality, there's no evil ending, you can't be the Dark Lord Voldemort would be proud.Filling the whole game with collectibles in order to hide the fact that the side quests are kinda poorly written and boring, the whole ""mini game"" (let's call it that way) around taking ""care"" of beasts (felt like a cheap Tamagotchi attempt), how other students or even professors don't react if you start to cast around them in an unresponsible way, there's no crime/punishment system so to speak (like what Bully had for example).I could go on but that's basically it, a somewhat decent game by looks only, but with somewhat mediocre gameplay, an ""rpg"" game clearly designed to people who are not gamers, casuals and for potterheads who belong in the two previous categories mentioned. Expected much, much more from Hogwarts Legacy, just a *big* letdown. 6/10.Bonus Track: the whole thing about not including Quidditch was retarded as best, it's one of the main features any follower or HP fan will ask, and you don't need to read any book, just watch one of the frigging movies to realize that!"
124,DRACER,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IDRACERI/,50,3,1,103.3,February,14,622,0,1,"Harry Potter: Hogwarts Legacy is a magical adventure that will transport you to the wizarding world like never before. The game immerses you in the world of Hogwarts and offers a unique experience unlike any other Harry Potter game or movie.The graphics are stunning and bring the iconic Hogwarts Castle, the Forbidden Forest, and Hogsmeade Village to life. The attention to detail is impressive, from the spells you cast to the creatures you encounter. The game's soundtrack is also enchanting, setting the perfect mood for your journey through the wizarding world.One of the highlights of the game is the character customization feature, which allows you to create your own wizard or witch and personalize their appearance, abilities, and spells. The game's story is well written, and it offers a captivating adventure that will keep you engaged for hours. You will be able to explore the castle and interact with familiar characters from the Harry Potter universe, such as Professor Snape and Albus Dumbledore.The game's spellcasting system is intuitive and satisfying, and it offers a sense of power and control that is unmatched by other games in the genre. The combat system is also well executed, and it provides a challenge without being overly difficult.If I had any complaint, your character feels too ""solo"" at times, I didn't feel like I made many meaningful connections.In conclusion, Harry Potter: Hogwarts Legacy is an exceptional game that will captivate both fans of the Harry Potter franchise and gamers who love action-packed adventures. It offers an immersive experience that will transport you to the wizarding world and leave you spellbound."

As a youngster who grew up with Harry Potter books, I finally had the opportunity to visit the famous school of witchcraft and magic, and I am generally pleased. Almost every corner of the castle is actually full with nostalgia and magical charm that all truth fans might desire. The world is filled with details and exploring them is a lot of pleasure.But you can not get around and fly in the ointment: The Deluxe version was a horrible idea since allowing people to play the raw game for extra money is strange, especially because the game will recieve a first-day patch that will fix the difficulties the game had during first 72 hours, such as loading times and kind of bad-ish optimistation/performance even with 30 rtx series.It is truly wonderful to see such work being done by a company that previously only had expertise with Disney Infinity as a title of this size. I personally wish Avalnche the best of luck and hope to see more intriguing ventures in the future!"

Playstation owners get access to the Haunted Hogsmeade quest, which includes access to an extra dungeon, the Shopkeeper's cosmetic set, and access to a special Hogsmeade shop in which you own. The Haunted Hogsmeade quest should've been a DLC. This is a big failure on Avalanche and Portkey. Because of this, I'm leaving a negative review. With this many players, they would've made way more money off of it as a DLC than with any contract as an exclusive - Especially since the Dark arts pack is listed at $20 USD.

133,sul,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Les_Miserables/,32,2,1,136.6,March,22,674,14,1,"Enchanting, mesmerizing, captivating, magical, whimsical, fantastic. These are all magical words, and they’re some of the few words I’d use to describe Hogwarts Legacy, so make of that what you will, or read the rest of my thoughts on this incredible game.Hogwarts Legacy has been, to me at least, a magical journey in the full meaning of the word. It has taken me back to my childhood, where my obsession with Harry Potter was a bittersweet escape from reality. It is a hard thing to pull off to centralize this kind of fantasy, and it has been a thing millions of people always dreamed of for decades, it’s understandably hard for any game developer to satisfy the immense scope of the expectations for a game that promises more or less an adventure as a student in Hogwarts, I had always been highly skeptical of this game as a result, point of fact, when I saw the first gameplay showcases late last year, I wrote this game off. I was like “yep, this is trash”. Suffice to say that I have swallowed my words since then, and I have been proven thoroughly wrong, and now count the game as one of my most treasured experiences in video games.One word; Huge. 120+ hours later I still don’t have its layout mapped in my head, and I’m still now discovering new secret locations even after combing so many parts of the castle many times. It has so much of the iconic locations from the films and books. The great hall, the iconic courtyard in front of it, the creaky wooden bridge, the grand staircase, and much more.Throughout my engaging playthrough of the game, the school itself was, for the most part, consigned to the background, while the story of the game unfolded, or while I explored the beautiful world. At the end, Hogwarts felt exactly just that; a backdrop. Most classes, what few there are, are just a cool introductory cutscene, from then on, the teachers will give you ‘assignments’ to learn more spells. The classes are more or less presented as missions rather than a routine activity or part of the school, and as I went more and more through the game and performed some cursory retrospect of my playthrough, I quickly realized that the time I spent in the school itself was but a minority of my entire playthrough.My experience with Hogwarts Legacy’s massive open world is hard to sum up it. Every time I thought I discovered most of the map, I’m immediately surprised to know that there’s a whole new uncharted realm that I haven’t been to. Idyllic glades and creeks giving way to the most charming of villages, mountains and ridges crowned with the ruins of long-lost castles, cliffsides pockmarked by mines, tunnels and caverns astride them, dense forests concealing ancient barrows, all consecrated in a whimsical atmosphere meant that I lost track of time when I was going through this beautiful world. It’s so full of amazing things to do or discover that I never felt a moment of tedium even after spending 110 hours into the game, most of which were spent combing this huge world. There are also 3 seasons, each isn't just a dressing, it adds some cool interaction to the world, like snowmen who fight you in winter. The open world features many of the famous locations from the books & films, the Hogwarts Express, Hogsmeade, The Forbidden Forest, etc. And it’s mindboggling how much detail and care was put into presenting all of these. Every iconic location is in of itself a world. There are 27 spells in the game, including the famous unforgiveable curses, and some consumable items like mandrakes (AOE stun) or Chinese chomping cabbages (ferocious critters that attack enemies) and the Thunderbrew potion which calls a miniature thunderstorm over enemies. The spells offer a pretty wide variety of combo possibilities, you can juggle small enemies in the air, tossing them back and forth, up and down, freezing them, transforming them into crates or even explosive barrels (which you can then toss at other enemies), and outside of the spells your character also possesses a special affinity towards “ancient magic” that allows them to just OHKO enemies either by calling thunder on them, blowing them up into smithereens, transforming them into chickens, pick up objects around the world & toss them at enemies, etc.The game pushes you into its story brusquely in the first cutscene, framing the background of your character who is capable of seeing and crudely manipulating the “Ancient Magic”, so off the start, your PC already has the “I’m the chosen one” badge. This might sound unappealing, but fortunately the game doesn’t go ham with this theme and handles it really well. Beyond core narrative, there is an adventure that awaits in Hogwarts. The PC will meet many students, form close bonds with them, and some of them are really, really well written and compelling characters (especially Sebastian Sallow). These characters will oscillate between being parts of main story questlines and being secondary/side characters, if you will get this game make absolutely certain to play their questlines because the writing is really *chef’s kiss* so good and I enjoyed their quests very much.The 3 main student friends you will meet in Hogwarts are Natsai Onai (Gryffindor), Sebastian Sallow (Slytherin) and Poppy Sweeting (Hufflepuff). Unfortunately for some reason Ravenclaw doesn’t have a major story character (though I enjoyed Samantha Dale’s quest very much). Outside of major house reps, there is a lot of other students you’ll meet and do errands for throughout the school. There are several compelling villains, some the player will bring the fight to, some will bring the fight to the player, some can only be fought in side quests. You will slowly discover more and more about them, and some aspects of them seemed to have been red herrings (which the narrative has a healthy amount of to keep the player guessing about what’s going to unfold towards the end).The soundtrack is so good and is mostly inspired by the music score from the first two HP Movies directed by Columbus, but there are some tracks that feel more reminiscent of the 5th and 6th movies. Some tracks like ""Soaring Above Hogwarts"" give me goosebumps 90% of the time I hear them. There is unfortunately a dearth of player agency, though the game presents a long list of dialogue choices, most of them are for flavor, but some will have story consequences (such as deciding a character’s fate). There are 3 different endings (but they don’t have any requirements, it’s more like you decide what your witch or wizard will do with something they find at the end). Most side quests will have multiple options at the end. One of the byproducts of the huge scope of this game is that they added a lot of sandbox stuff to the side, mainly condensed in the Room of Requirement (RoR). It’s something you’ll unlock about 1/4th into the game, the game gives you a room and free reign to customize it however you please. You can collect or purchase hundreds of items, furniture, décor to put into this room. And the amazing thing is that it also iteratively grows throughout the game, adding several Vivariums where you can keep magical beasts you collect across the world, these Vivariumae, each unique and different, are in turn customizable with a different pool of stuff.It was hard to write this. When I finished writing my first draft of this, it was really huge. I'd write way more if I could but review char limit. Yes, you should get this wonderful game."

136,manollette,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031724543/,34,3,0,57.4,February,24,683,0,1,"This is less of an ""I don't recommend this game"" and more of an ""I'd hold off on a good sale for this game"". Hogwarts Legacy does a lot of things right. It really captures the ""feel"" of the HP universe, and the story, setting, and world are everything I hoped they'd be for a game like this set in a universe I grew up reading about. It really feels like you're a student at Hogwarts.The wand combat is a little easy - which is not helped by how dumb the AI is in a fight - but it flows incredibly well. Switching between spell sets is intuitive & fast, and it's very fun to watch. Most enemies in the game have mechanics that allow you to kill them with incredible ease, if you use the right spell/combo at the right time. Flight controls are pretty clunky and awkward to get down. The facial expressions are pretty 'uncanny valley' creepy at times, and the voice acting can be quite bad (and quite good) in places. My character sounds incredibly spiteful spitting out the incantation for 'Crucio', but when I get it cast on me in a cinematic, my guy sounds like the pain he's experiencing is on par with banging your shin on a piece of furniture. The main story is also nothing special; very generic bad guy stuff. The side stories are far more interesting. The first bad note for me is that replayability is nonexistent and your choices don't matter. ""Be the wizard you want to be"" for WB apparently equates to ""Be the cookie cutter good guy we've shoehorned you into being, but you can make a small selection of decisions, kind of, at the end of the game right before it ends and nothing else happens"". Decisions that should be impactful barely get a little end-of-story ""and then this happened"" blurb. Following that, HOLY HELL did they try to shove every time-waster they could fit into this game. HL is the epitome of collector games. ""Collect your magic sources, collect the balloons, collect the landing pads, collect the trials, collect the animals, collect the plants"". As a completionist, I haven't been this bored out of my mind since playing the first Assassin't Creed games collecting the 100 little flags or whatever. The amount of inane, pointless collection in this game is absolutely obscene to me, and easily 3/4 of my 60-hour playthrough was just going around collecting garbage. If I had just focused on the quests, this would've been a 15-hour game. If I just did the main quest, it'd probably clock in at a bit under 10. And that's the main reason for the negative review: even though the core of the game is good, there's way too much filler, and no game that is only good for one playthrough, that would take a reasonable person under 10 hours to finish, is worth $60. If this ever goes for half off, absolutely buy it - it was certainly a fun ~15 hours."

This was advertised as ""make your own path"" kind of game, yet it can't be further away from the truth. There is one path, and it's the one the game gives you. There is no becoming a dark wizard, or a good one... you're just the character the game tells you to be.The whole game is lifeless, NPCs don't react to anything you do, you can talk to some of them but that's it. You can go around casting spells, no one will even look at you or react the slightest. You can go and enter people's house after forcing their locks, go through their chests, they won't say or do a thing, they just act like you're not even there. Most of the time you can't jump to places, invisible walls everywhere, making exploration very linear and flavorless. Combat is fun, but I'm still looking for difficulty. Basically entered one of the most dangerous places, the Forbidden Forest, after 2 hours playing and defeated everything that came my way without breaking a sweat, there is no real danger or even sense of danger, and of course you can't attack centors, because yeah... you're not a bad person, so the game won't let you do bad things. You can fly on a broom, and again, it's slow, no sensation or feeling of speed, you can go into an obstacle at full speed and you will just stop, no impact, no animation, nothing. You just stop like it's okay to ram into a wall. The only decent thing about the game so far is the story. It's well designed, for now, but there is not much choices or decisions to take, and the only few really don't change anything to the story... you just go with it and follow the game's lead. It's basically a playable cinematic.So to sum it up, it is yet again a very expensive game that brings nothing new to the table, with empty promises and seemingly half finished features. Was expecting this to be a Skyrim with HP world, turned out to be a plain adventure game you can't even play with your friends.4/10EDIT: So... difficulty got better, after turning it to difficult, it gets interesting if you face multiple enemies at once. That being said, I still think it's a bit weird that our character, a 15 years old student, can take on dark mages and other such threats so easily, but that's just how the game was made I guess.I've just finished the story, it was okay, nothing incredible, not bad either...  Some of you have mentionned NPCs reacting to certain things.. so I went ahead and tried all that. So yes, you get a line of reaction here and there when you cast a forbidden spell, but that's honestly just not enough. Lines are always the same, and that leads to pretty much nothing. What I was trying to mention is more like RDR2 type of reaction. Stand too close to someone, they'll ask you to move, make a mess, pay the consequences, etc.Of course i'm aware this was not exactly advised, BUT. The description clearly says ""Be the wizard you want to be"" among other things, and the rest probably was just my expectations, yes. We're in 2023, this is an AAA game, it's advised as open world, RPG. I REALLY thought they would at least add some RPG element, and somewhat lively NPCs.I have read some people saying I was picky, talking about the broom, but in my opinion, such details are what make a game great. I remember people complaining that you could just get out of a full speed moving car in Cyberpunk, and your char would be standing on the road as if nothing happened. This is the same level of details. You can fly full speed on your broom and hit everything on your way, you won't be falling, ever.I also read from the comment that, at some point, you can make choices, etc... I've currently finished the main story, and yes, I did have some choices to make. But what good are they if they don't mean nothing to your game experience? Like... just go throwing forbidden curses everywhere, people will still greet you the same, everywhere. You don't exist to their eyes, and they don't give a damn wwhat you do, which is also exactly why you can spend the night roaming the forbidden forest instead of being in your bed at school and no one will ever wonder what you're doing and where you've been. You've got an ultimate choice to make at the end of the story, literally a ""Are you good or evil?"" kind of choice, and whatever your answer is makes absolutely no difference... that's just empty choices.I'm currently trying out mods, and some of them might just make the game a bit better.And lastly, it seems some of you got triggered because I kept playing the game despite my review. As it clearly says, I find the story decent, and I still wish to finish it. Also at no point I said the game was bad. I think, and again, this is my opinion, that it's too expensive for what it currently is, and that it could have been a complete banger if only they would have worked on it some more to add modern RPG features before releasing it. But it does have some good points, as mentionned, combat is fun, at least for now, and the world is well detailed, which makes it even more of a pity that there isn't much to do in it aside from the same old puzzles we've known for years.If you like the game, it's cool for you, honestly. This is just some point that made me disappointed in the game, expectations or not. Go ahead and tell me why you like it, instead of acting like I've just insulted your family.Good gaming people."

Game has massive fps drops, memory leaks and occasional crashes on a more than decent rig, even after day 1 'performance' hotfix. Things that helped me greatly:1. Installing Ascendio mod from Nexusmods.2. Swapping DLSS version to latest with DLSS Swapper (free app btw).3. Turning off ray tracing and VSync in game settings.The story and puzzles are mediocre. Game is rather linear. Where it thrives for me personally is combat, it features some souls-like elements, spell combos, potion and plant usage. But I barely died in fights even on hard difficulty. Don't go for anything lower than hard unless you're a casual.Overall, for me as a HP fan, it's 10/10. You can traverse Hogwarts, discover secret rooms, talk to ghosts, use a variety of spells, learn unforgivable curses, get some relics, visit legendary Ollivander shop and much, MUCH more. All the things I dreamed of since I read my first HP book. For me as a gamer, disregarding my HP affection, the game is 6.5/10.I did greatly enjoy the game but do not wish to support devs releasing AAA games in the current state as well as releasing console exclusive content (you can open your own shop in Hogsmeade is you're a lucky owner of PS5, but for us poor PC plebs performance issues is the only exclusive for now), hereby leaving a negative review."

The castle feels pretty alive and and it has many of the environmental elements I would expect from Hogwarts. The environments/areas outside the castle are similarly polished.Unfortunately, such appearances only go skin deep. There is very limited interactivity with your environment outside of the scripted quests or the various treasure hunt type items. You can't interact with any of the people that aren't vendors or active in a given quest, can't sit down in a chair or on a bench, no real commentary on player actions whatsoever. I have yet to feel drawn into the world as none of the characters are ever really present to engage with. I have no companions unless they are needed for a quest, there are no rivalries to be had (which is rather more noticeable as I went Slytherin) and that's well before any of the immersion breaking progressive nonsense is added in. Short of it is, I don't ever feel like a student at Hogwarts, I feel like a ""Mary Sue'd"" outsider partaking in a magical murder mystery theater.Speaking of quests, they are also ""meh"" for the most part. The main quest line is rather engaging and keeps you moving forward to find out what happens next, but the side quests are quite boring and often just boil down to your standard ""go fetch"" type quests. I have not found any side quest of substance as of yet.Combat is one of the saving graces so far. Generally quite intuitive and enjoyable. Presents a decent challenge while also making you feel like a spell slinging bad-ass on occasion.Oh, and the loot.  Seriously the loot system and types of loot is ridiculous.  The mechanics aren't horrible, but the immersion break is.  My eyes ache from the rolling whenever, after traversing an ""ancient"" dungeon/crypt/cave, bypassing puzzles, slaying enemies, etc. I then spy an impressive looking chest, only to open said chest and be awarded with... a new scarf/house robe/glasses. -.-  Still have a ways to go in the game, so I'm gonna keep an open mind till I complete the game, but so far... Meh."

After almost 80 hours into the game, I've had a generally good experience. It's been fun so far, however, there are a few things that have left me disappointed. I was seriously upset over the broom system. I mean, all the brooms are the same, except for upgrades. You should have gotten a Nimbus 2000 and flown out of the Hogwarts courtyard, and THEN when you got the Firebolt, you should have been able to hit the afterburner and gone from map edge to map edge within a few seconds. But nope, that fell flat. And another gripe is the Merlin tests. After you solve each test, couldn't they have made a way to disable the Merlin animation?? I'm getting flashbacks of skinning animals from my Red Dead Redemption 2 days. That seriously gets old. And the cave layouts could have been better designed. Instead...you run a few feet, turn left (or right) then another turn and you're at a chest. Open said chest and back outside, then it's over. Yeah, some have a few puzzles, but the majority are the same ol' same. Also, where is the spell upgrade for Revelio? I wanted an option to have this spell be extended for at least a min. Instead, you're spamming that spell like there is no tomorrow. And I don't think I've used any of the potions (except Thunderbrew) since I had to brew a Focus potion and drink it for one of the class requirements. It would have been nice to have these extended too. Maybe doing more potion classes and learning to squeeze a bezoar with a side of a knife instead of slicing it...and then learning to extend the potion's effects for longer than 15 seconds?? Seems like you'd be spamming those things too in the middle of a long fight. That's one of the reasons I don't use them. After you get out into the big wide world, the grind becomes real, it seems. And another gripe...why didn't they have a 5th spell set for using it in the Vivarium as well. I mean, putting the bag, the feed, the brush, etc...on the vivarium spell set would have been nice. instead, you're having to move everything around to brush your beasts for that all-important hair/feather. I feel they could have tweaked the game more. And another thing, I just don't see the draw for skins/outfits unless they actually served a purpose. I played a sniping game where I got a ghillie suit. I thought to myself, ""Nice, I can be more invisible."" But it didn't do anything to help you in the game at all. The enemy could see you just as well with it on, as off. So with all the different hats/glasses/gloves in this game, I usually change the appearance back to a generic hat and don't use any of the different styles in the game. Skins just don't appeal to me. But after all this griping, don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the game, but the latter half is just monotonous."

It has done absolutely nothing in the performance departmentLet me start by saying that when this game works it is fantastic and there are tons of people the game runs well for that are around my specs or even lower with 10-series GPUs. I am not trying to ruin that for anyone and I entirely understand why people love this game and are going to upvote in reviews or even get mad down in the replies. However this is not the case for everyone and plenty of others with high end systems are having problems and the game is truly impossible to experience with such horrendous stability issues. Performance problems are being spammed on their official bug tracker website, under their most popular replies on all recent twitter posts, and discussions from the community on Steam/Reddit. So downplaying it cus you want a hive-mind to circlejerk your favorite game is foolish. Ignorant comments from actual robots such as ""mUH gAmeE wORk sO uR cOmPUteR bAD"" are everywhere and completely useless to the discussion or finding out the issue/fix, these comments will be ignored and probably deleted.It is absolutely unacceptable to sell an early launch of a game as a product, make people pay more than base price, then have a large chunk of players with a massive range of specs and settings realize after the 1-2 hour tutorial when you finally get to roam around that the game is absolutely broken, unplayable, and unoptimized. If you have to wait for a patch or game ready driver then why even sell the early release of the game at all?My specs more than clear any requirement for this game as well as any others on the market, yet during cut scenes and exploring the school it is absolutely unplayable, locking my fps to 10-15 as well as slowing down my entire PC including wallpapers on my second monitor until I close the game out entirely.FULL SPECS:3080tiRyzen 9 5900x32GB of DDR4-3200 RamSSD (I have even moved the game to another SSD and I still get poor results)3440x1440 (Have tried lowering resolution as well)No, turning settings down does nothing before you comment. Turning off RT seemed to give me some extra performance temporarily however I still hit the wall of 10-15 FPS every playsession.I have also tried:Disable SMTEnable Control Flow GuardUpdating/rolling back drivers(Got the newest one from 2/8 as well)Changing to a new SSDDisabling second monitorUpdating DLSS manuallyMy review is going up negative and will stay that way until the end of time regardless of patches. It is horrible business practice to sell people a product that does not function for a large percentage of the user base. They even went the extra mile to charge people more for an early release, when the product you purchased refuses to work. You shouldnt have to buy something then do two dozen work-arounds that never even do anything as you try to do the devs job for them.Rant over."

168,MustacheMan2009,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Edgyrain/,19,,1,60.7,March,8,834,0,1,"Hogwarts legacy is a game to distract you for a bit. You can run through the entire story, by itself without other content the game offers, probably in a bout 10-15 hours depending on how good you are in combat and how fast you can access the fast travel system. That being said, I have almost 100% the game (achievement wise) within' the 60 hours I have played it. The combat is simple yet complex in it's hidden combos it hints at within' the dueling fates system. E.x. being, ""Slice a frozen enemy."" Besides helping you perform devastating combos with different spells though, there is no real use to the system besides getting a completion bonus for completing a certain amount of them. I don't believe this game has much replay-ability, which is fine for me, but if you were curious about a NG + mode, there is not one. The story is great, but I wouldn't play through it more than once. Side quests are fun yet simple and can be summed up like this- Find person in trouble, Ask what's going on, Be told someone else can do it and not to risk your life, Go however many meters to objective, Obliterate the enemy or collect the item they need, Come back and announce you pwned the quest, They act shocked, Then you can extort them for more of a reward or just say lol you're welcome. They do have some lore attached but it's only to the side quest that you're doing. Not much trivia after the fact if you catch my drift. One thing I love is the interactions with the NPC's after doing certain actions. They start speaking of your accomplishments as you continue to do things around the world. Same goes with enemies. An example being releasing a certain enemy type from spider webs, and then they start talking about it in battles with that enemy type for the rest of the game. Very cool the first couple times.... then they just repeat themselves and never stop mentioning it lol. A special feature that became old a bit to fast unfortunately. The open world is also filled with various puzzles and activities to do. After a while though, it almost feels like a chore and loses meaning once you obtain the challenge log's reward for doing a certain amount of whatever lies on the map for you to do. Speaking of the challenge log, that is where a lot of the fun lied for me. It's almost like a scavenger hunt that tells you exactly what to do at the start of it. There are five different categories, each being named after different aspects of the game. Exploration, Combat, Field Guides, ETC. Each has a said amount of tiers that award you with different things. Some being inventory space, others being cosmetics for your equipment (which you can change at ANY time ANY where in the game.) After you complete them, there aren't many achievements left to the open world besides doing every single one of the Merlin Trials littered throughout the region though. So for me, once I completed it, I sort of lost my momentum playing the game. There's plenty else in this game that you can explore and discover, and if you're curious but not sure to get it or not? Wait for a sale, always a safe bet. The game is worth every penny spent. Although I don't think I'd buy the DLC or deluxe edition. Not really needed in an RPG in my opinion."

177,Z4nterox,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Z4nterox/,238,28,0,53.7,February,19,361,0,1,"Let's start with an important piece of information: I am absolutely obsessed with the world of Harry Potter. Like many of you, I grew up with the stories, read the books, watched the movies, went to Hogwarts and never really left. I've read all the fanfics (in a general sense, not ALL fanfics of course) and every time I read about Hogwarts it's like coming home.  This game fails at almost everything it should do as an RPG. There is absolutely no depth to this game, the characters, or the story. The open world is completely pointless. Now that I've played it and experienced it, would I buy it again?Yes, but not at full price. Wait for a sale. That's why this review is marked ""not recommended"".Because, after all, it's still a lot of fun running around Hogwarts or Hogsmead; or just fighting enemies with magic. There's no denying that. Is it a game that I will remember? One of those you never quite leave behind? A little bit, but only because it's Harry Potter and I keep imagining what it could have been. Do you leave that aside? No, then it's not.All in all, the biggest feelings I have about this game are the following: Disappointment at what it is and sadness/longing at what it could have been. It's all right? Not the best I've experienced but definitely not bad either. It was original, I'll give the developers that. Don't think about the logic behind some of the things that happen and it's all good. It was entertaining.Really annoying for me were the interruptions in the narrations of the individual questlines.""Hey, something super important and really exciting is happening right now. We need to act right now!""""All right, great. What happens now, what do we do, who do I have to kill?""""I'll make a plan and then send you an owl. Until then this suuuper important and exciting thing will just have to wait. Bye.""""..."" Yeah, no. It's an RPG without the RP. Your choices have almost no impact. Learning the unforgivables? You're a hero! Blackmail everyone and be a total arsehole? You're a hero!!! The only decision that matters comes at the very end and decides which of the three endings you get. You start at Hogwarts as a fifth year. Everyone else has already been together for 4 years, making friends, creating their groups, and getting caught up in house rivalries. You  be the new awkward guy who doesn't know anyone and has only one job: To get off your butt and try to catch up with your classmates and maybe make some friends in the process.Instead, you're instantly good at EVERYTHING. Flying like a pro? No problem. Killing dozens of enemies left and right? Sure. Unforgivable curses? Yep. Brew potions, grow plants, and rescue and care for animals without fail? Absolutely! You're a Mary Sue character. The chosen one of the chosen ones.To sum it up: You make absolutely no sense and are definitely not human. Sebastian: ""Hey, you're new? Be my best friend. Here's my life story.""Natty: ""Hey, you're new? Be my best friend. Here's my life story.""Poppy: At least reasonably well written. The only character I somewhat cared about. You're a Slytherin? Natty  doesn't care. Still, instant best friends.You're a Gryffindor? Sebastian  doesn't care either. Again, Sebastian and Natty don't act or behave like people. They have no depth, no initial character arc, no real history. Poppy is not completely exempt from this either. Why does this game have an open world? Can someone please explain this to me, because I really don't get it. The world adds absolutely nothing to this game. It is full of pointless tasks without end. Take the Merlin trials for example. There are 95 of them. 95! And they are completely pointless. These trials are not hard, not engaging, not fun. They're just time-wasters with an unskippable ending-animation.Aside from that, the open world feels dead. Sure, there are smaller ""villages"" and enemy camps and such, but they don't really add anything to the game. At least for me, they don't. This is one of those of open world games that shouldn't have an open world. Strangely devoid of life. That's one way to describe Hogwarts. There are no students other than fifth graders, except for a few underclassmen as quest givers. Where are all the other students? I don't know, just disappeared, I guess.The NPCs that are around are dummies. They stand around doing the exact same thing over and over again. How many times are you going to run up the wall? All day, every day! The brawling armors have more character than these students. To be fair, there are quiet a few funny encounters between those students.And where the hell do these guys sleep? Not in their beds, that's for sure!And then there are the classes. Or what should be classes. Instead, it feels like kindergarten or something, but definitely not like classes at supreme school for magic.And rules don't matter to you. Magic in the corridors? Yes, please. Wearing a school uniform at Hogwarts. Boring!Pain. Pure and utter pain.You may be a wizard, but I guess you've never heard of backpacks with space expansion charms. Your inventory is almost always full. You'll either have to return to a merchant every half hour or start destroying stuff. I can't remember a worse game in this regard. And don't even get me started on the gear itself. I found legendary gloves at level 16 and didn't have to swap them out until level 36. ‘Nuff said. Just don't try to think anything through logically here. I mean, sure, it's magic and all. But still: ""Hey, you. My husband, a fully trained wizard with a lot of life experience, was killed by a troll. He had a locket on him. Could you, a completely untrained fifth year Hogwarts student, please go and kill the troll to get the locket back?""""Yeah sure, no problem."" ""So, character,  you really need to get off your arse and catch up to your classmates.""""Yes, Professor Weasley. Oh, open world. Bye Hogwarts.""  One: Alohomora. Why is there a freaking minigame for Alohomora. I don't remember Hermione getting out her gamepad and wiggling the sticks around to open doors. And the minigame isn't even hard, in any way! It's simple: you turn the sticks until the gamepad vibrates, hold that position for a while, see a non-skippable animation/scene change, and the door is open. Every single time. And there are a whole lot of locked doors. There are even locked doors behind locked doors. I've already mentioned the Merlin trials. The menus and transition sequences into the menu and between menus are really not the fastest either."
178,EnforcerKiller,https://steamcommunity.com/id/EnforcerKiller/,11,,1,28.3,February,11,676,0,1,"As someone who has never read a Harry Potter book nor seen any of the movies, this is an absolutely fantastic first dive into the world of Hogwarts for me. From the very beginning of the game, I was immediately drawn in by the atmosphere, cutscene quality (especially the characters) and the background music. It gave me the feeling that this is gonna be a good game just from the first 10 minutes of play. After 15ish hours of the game (have not finished it yet nor do I think I'm anywhere near finishing it), I can safely say this is my GOTY pick for the moment. It's funny to think about, since before the game released, I was heavily skeptical of how the combat and the dialogue looked, but it turns out I was worried for nothing after all.There is one major complaint, however. The optimization is not great. For reference, I'm running a 3080 with 32 GB DDR4 RAM and a 7700k. The only outdated part in the list is the 7700k. Before the day one patch, my performance was a very unstable 20-80 fps at Medium-High settings. I've only done minimal testing after the day one patch, but my first experience was my game crashing alongside my GPU due to a VRAM overflow. Before the crash, I noticed that my performance was significantly better, so it was really upsetting when I ended up crashing after a decent first impression. After that I switched everything to Medium, which lead me to slightly better performance without the crash this time. I still have to do more testing to come to a definitive conclusion, but overall I do not think it's well-optimized, especially with how much VRAM it hogs for no real reason."

188,Japani69Katti,https://steamcommunity.com/id/japanikatti/,14,,1,90.8,March,13,800,0,1,"Do you want to experience the wizarding world in the 1800s? In Hogwarts Legacy you get to be a student in Hogwarts who holds the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart. You get to embark on an epic journey through familiar and new locations as you explore and discover magical beasts, customize your character and craft potions, master spell casting, upgrade talents and become the witch or wizard you want to be.Hogwarts Legacy is a potterhead's wet dream manifested into a wonderful experience of a game which offers a detailed and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and it's neighboring regions, which are packed to the brim with things to discover, things to collect and lore to seek and read.Some negative about the world building and everything in it, it's a collector's dream. That's not for everyone for sure, there is a lot of repetition and the map is quite big with not as much variety as there should be. I enjoyed the collecting myself, as I really like collecting things, but it's definitely something that you need to be aware of.There is a great amount of customizing when creating your own witch or wizard, with good range of skin colors and cosmetics and even a way to change the pitch of the voice options. Changing the pitch does make the voice sound a little bit robotic in my opinion, but it isn't too bad, and is a nice addition. You also have your own ""homebase"" that you can decorate and customize with a lot of options. The combat is nice and smooth, but can be easily exploitable, especially after you receive the unforgivable curses. There is a way to heal spam and the AI of the enemies is not that smart which makes the combat sometimes really, really easy. Sadly the named foes and quest bosses lack in uniqueness with no real variety in their combat abilities or behavior either. The story progression feels surprisingly smooth and portrays the growth of the main character very well where you get to hone your talents and improve. The progress of time is very well portrayed with the changing seasons and the day and night cycle. The main story itself is quite interesting, but has an underwhelming finale that leaves you wondering how your choices affected the other characters around you.There is also some inconsistencies that are minor annoyances, like if you use an unforgivable curse in public, no one bats an eye. Your friends do mention that they do not like you using them if you are fighting with them, but otherwise there is no real repercussions for them, which makes them less unforgivable.There is a great variety of side characters in the game that are very well built and are quite likable and unique from each other. The writing of the friendship quests is interesting and shows the growth of the main character's friends as well as how it affects the main character themselves.For me, the game took some over 90 hours to complete to 100% on normal difficulty, with all collections filled and challenges completed, as well as the few extra achievements that are given when you reach the map chamber with a character from each of the houses. I also spent a lot of extra time wandering around and taking screenshots, which boosted my hours a little bit. There is really no replay value to the game, since there is no different endings or choices to make. All of the collectibles can be acquired on one playthrough and the other 3 playthroughs only take about 2 hours each to reach to the map chamber.Is this game worth it then? Yes, absolutely. It's a fantastic game, filled with content and is definitely the best game made of the franchise up to date, in my opinion. There is certain political issues regarding the game, but you can enjoy the game and still not support those ideals.as an ending note, I wan't to add that be you a man, a woman or anything in-between or outside of, you are loved. You are appreciated by me and many others and I hope that you get to live your life the way you want to live it."
189,OVERWATCH SUCKS,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198354174326/,541,27,0,10.5,February,11,272,94,1,"After having finished the game this morning, Hogwarts Legacy is no different from any Ubisoft game you have played in the last 15 years. The game is boggled with meaningless side quests, and the story is lackluster. With the Harry Potter IP, so much more could have been done. I am just disappointed.I do not understand who made the choice to remove any actual sort of customization to a game like this. You select character preset, and change their hair, eye color, etc. That's it. No ear shape, nose shape, jaw, nothing. Seeing as most other games offer that at the bare minimum, it's hard to see why they removed it. They lock it into a sense of realism, which is weird for a fantasy game. If I want green skin, I should be able to have green skin. The main draw of the game, Hogwarts, is both a blessing and a curse. The animations of the stairs building, ghosts popping in and out, and the joyful music playing are probably the best parts of the game. That's all there is to it however, It just looks good. You cannot interact with any of the students. It's like an amusement park attraction. The only option is to walk around, observe, and eat an apple. The only other game I played set in an environment like this was Bully, and that game offered way more freedom than the developers here have allowed. It's hard to immerse yourself when you're pretty much watching a movie about your character, rather than actually playing as them.The story is nothing special. It's not bad, but I was not excited to keep playing it. Can't say much else without spoiling.I know I should not say the Witcher 3 side quests are the cream of the crop, as that is just overstated at this point, but it is what it is. I can't help to compare them to the cookie cutter ones we got here. Go collect 6 gobstoppers for this kid. Go find this obscure cliff from the mirror to find a chest with ugly glasses in it. Ubisoft-type missions and heavily prevalent. Side missions have no multiple endings, and they always end up predictable.In Hogwarts, you will get into plenty of scraps. a good ol' bout with some real scum. You will have to use your spells to blast your foes, so hopefully there's lots of them, right? Well, there's only  spells. Yes, you hears that right, only . That's without even mentioning that you can only equip 4 spells at a time. They took the Mass Effect Andromeda route of limiting your combat for the sake of, i don't even know. With only 4 at a time, I felt extremely limited in what I could do. The animations themselves are great, but when looking at a game like Elden Ring, who has  spells, and the game isn't only a wizard game, you realize that much more could have been done. Skyrim even has  spells. And just like Elden Ring, that game has much more than just magic. Also, after comparing the difficulties between hard and normal, it is only a health bar difference. Enemies will damage you more, and you do less damage. Underwhelming if you ask me, when you could have had them use more strategy in taking you down.I know people won't like this, but Forspoken magic looks a lot better than this game. No one has actually played it, so no one has actually seen how good it looks.This is by far the worst part of this game. Everything is locked behind a level based lock. most of Hogwarts Legacy is hidden behind locks that you must progress the story to unlock. You cannot explore at your own pace. I say it again, the developers choose when you get to have fun. It is a shame, as the world is beautiful. Riding the broomstick is amazing, I spent a lot of time just riding around. Mounts are great as well, love the threstral mount that I got from the deluxe edition.This one is a little nitpicky, but the doors feel weightless. Your character just pushes them open extremely fast, its honestly very jarring. The huge doors in the fountain area open effortlessly, which is extremely weird to me.This is the one thing that has left me completely confused. You only get XP by collecting lore scrolls around the map. WHY? No XP from defeating monsters, no growing stronger from your battles, you have to click left on the D-Pad, listen for a bell noise, and find a scroll to level up. I hate it. Don't forget the flying scrolls that you just grab out the air effortlessly. Hogwarts Legacy brings nothing new to the table. The graphics are the best part of the game, everything else is a either a weird gameplay decision, or a mechanic jacked from another game, yet done far worse. I would say this game is good of you love Harry Potter, and do not really play video games. Otherwise, this game is way overpriced for what it offers, and you may get bored easily once the initial honeymoon phase wears off around a few hours."

Almost every activity in this game ranges from okay to pretty good for the first couple of hours after which it becomes unbearable, boring and tedious and that coupled with the fact that there are hundreds of those activities, that really takes a toll on you. The side activities are boring, the combat is kind of unique but extremely repetitive (as it really doesn't matter what enemy you are fighting), the puzzles are mostly childish (some of them are okay though), the open world is needlessly huge and feels incredibly dead, the story and characters are cringeworthy (thank god you can skip the dialogues) and the RPG mechanics are tacked on and completely underdeveloped which is why the get in the way of having fun rather than reinforcing it. It is not all bad though, Hogwarts itself looks amazing and genuine and it really feels like the poured their hearts into designing it, Hogsmeade is also decent and the season changes were a nice touch. The room of requirement and the whole vivarium gameplay was also a cool edition but that kind of customization is not interesting for me personally, especially when it doesn't feel rewarding at all as the combat (even on Hard difficulty) is pretty easy. The unforgivable curses are properly overpowered and fun to use but as the choices in this game don't matter at all those curses are treated as everything else in the game and that was disappointing. The looting is also stupid as it is completely random which more often than not robs you of feeling any sense of reward after exploring something hidden and hard to find. At the end of the day, this game wore me out completely even before the halfway mark and I had to force myself to get to the end of it which I really shouldn't have done.  So I personally recommend this game to only the Harry Potter series' fans who only wanted to have a huge, Triple A, open world HP game where they could just fly around, explore Hogwarts and perform some iconic spells, for the rest of us who are looking for a unique, fun open world experience this is NOT it my friends, if not for the amazing Hogwarts design I'd say that this is a proper UBISOFT-style open world title as all the same tired, tedious and boring tropes and design choices are in full throttle here."

197,Mr.Ora[N]ge,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mr_orange13/,24,,1,48.8,February,11,"1,241",6,1,"is the best Hogwarts magic game of all time. I had a lot of fun playing this game, I liked it, although it has its problems.I pre-ordered the game hoping it wouldn't be terrible. And I did not regret it, I waited and passed it in 49 hours.The game has pretty nice graphics. I played on ultra settings without RTX. Particularly pleased with the castle, which was very well created by the development team. A stunning castle, with many details and secrets.The open world also pleases with its beauty. In addition, it is quite large and even filled. The village of Hogsmeade is also done very well, the developers deserve respect.The game Hogwarts Legacy takes place at the end of the 19th century and tells about the students of Hogwarts. Your character is a student holding the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the magical world apart. You are belatedly accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and soon discover that you are no ordinary student: you have the rare ability to sense and manipulate ancient magic. Only you can decide whether you will protect this secret for the good of all or succumb to the temptation of more sinister magic.Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world, single-player action role-playing game with multiple difficulty and accessibility options. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry will offer classes such as spells, defense against the dark arts, herbology and potions.When creating a playable character, the player can choose their appearance, faculty, and gender. Players can customize their character's voice, body type, and wand type. Leveling up gives the player access to talents, upgrades, and skills. The game also features environment customization elements where players will be able to customize the Room of Rescue as they level up in the game.The player's character will learn to cast various magic spells, brew potions and master combat abilities. As you progress, players will be able to develop their own special fighting style. In combat, items purchased or crafted can be used to harm enemies or create obstacles or enhance the player's character. There will be taming, grooming and riding magical beasts. Dragons, trolls, hippogriffs, and nifflers are shown as creatures that can be interacted with in the gameplay video. Some creatures can be used in combat, such as the mandrake to stun enemies.The gameplay is quite interesting and multi-level, although it does not seem so at first glance. To understand the whole essence and feel it - you just need to try it yourself.The game has a lot of different collectibles that you can collect, although this is not mandatory. At the same time, some gathering helps to open new abilities, expand your inventory, or give you some things. I wasn't able to collect all the collectibles because there are so many of them (about 760), but at the same time I completed all the challenges.Many players will not like this game, many will not even try it, but those who still pass it will get an interesting and new experience, because there are very few games in this genre. If you watched the Harry Potter movies or you just have an interesting Hogwarts, I advise you to go through this game and not listen to anyone."

However this is where the praise ends, because this golden palace is filled to the brim with sh*t.The major problem:There is no immersion. You are a perfect Mary-Sue without any backstory, everyone loves you, there is no friction at all, there are no consequences, there are no friendships or romances, there is simply nothing that defines you and your journey through Hogwarts other than the fact that you are perfect and chosen. All other characters - bar Sebastian - are lifeless and dull, interchangable really. Almost every corner reeks of cut content (the mechanics for Quidditch are there, but it wasnt finished, Sebastian clearly is supposed to be a romance, the other three ""companions"" however werent finished at all, most noticably in Poppy and Amit.)Instead minigames and ""riddles"" are thrown at you at any moment to breath some life into this, but unfortunately it only breaks the immersion more. Again you are the only one to solve these riddles, because you are perfect.The other big issues:To this day I am having severe graphical issues. The first 2 weeks this game was almost not playable due to poor performance. Now the performance is alright, but textures dont load or load extremely slowly. Even on medium settings.The combat is fun for like an hour or so, then it gets tedious extremely quickly, because there are only like 5 enemy types or so.I dont even wanna go into detail when it comes to the overall storyarc. Its so bland, I just wonder how people like that can call themselves authors and how anyone can greenlight that crap. Overall this is the biggest disappointment since Cyberpunk for me."

203,Ryzzie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cuddlycub/,20,,1,70.8,February,11,274,2,1,"Before publishing a review for a game, I like to take my time and experience a good amount of what the game has to offer. Unless of course, the game has major issues that need to be adressed immediately. Thankfully Hogwarts Legacy is not one of those games, we don't have to beta test this game and wait 6 months to a year for the developers to actually finish it. Look at what happens when a publisher actually gives a development studio time to finish a game, instead of forcing it out the door early. This game just shows the importance of getting a game right the first time.Hogwarts Legacy has become one of the best games I have ever played, and one of my favourite games of all time. Incase you don't realise how big of a statement that is for me, I have been playing video games since I was 4 years old, and since then I have played thousands upon thousands of games. Honestly, I'm not a big Wizarding World fan, but I did watch the Harry Potter trilogy for the first time in 2021, and loved them. This game has given me a reason to explore this universe in more depth, and is pulling me in to become a fan of the Wizarding World. Rarely do I ever stop in games to read descriptions about characters, locations, objects and the such, but in this game I found myself stopping to do that quite often. I would spend a few minutes reading about a historic figure in Hogwarts, or about one of the many rooms in the castle, and I learnt so much more about this universe by doing so.The combat is incredibly fun and satisfying, to be as effective as possible you will need to pull off combos to deal the most amount of damage in a short period of time. You can evade enemy attacks by either rolling or blocking incoming spells/melee attacks, pressing the deflect button quickly will deflect an incoming enemy spell in a random direction, but if you hold the deflect button while an enemy is casting, you can deflect their spell right back at them and stun them. With larger enemies, you will need to dodge to succesfully avoid damage. Sometimes enemy wizards/witches will have shields to protect them, these shields are colour coded in connection with your own spells, for exaple if an enemies shield is purple this means you will have to cast a purple spell to break their shield, this is an excellent way of making button mashing/click spamming useless, since no player will be able to push random buttons and win every enemy encounter. Overall combat is fantastic, and also visually stunning.The music is beautiful, and perfectly compliments what is happening on the screen. A peacful and relaxing tone of music for exploration which sets your mind at ease, to intense and lively music during combat. Games like these just show you how important good music in games is, how they can elevate the moment and give you a better experience because of it. Not much else to say about the music other than it being excellent.When you get to explore Hogwarts for the first time, it really makes you appreciate this amazing universe that J.K. Rowling has created. Hogwarts itself is extremely beautiful, every area within the castle is visually stunning and unique. If you are someone that has always dreamed of exploring this universe, you will not be disappointed. You can also explore the area surrounding Hogwarts, if that wasn't enough there is also seasonal weather which completely changes the aesthetic of the map visually, and even certain aspects of the castle.Another thing I love about this game is how it rewards the player for exploration, the game encourages you to explore because doing so will grant you superior gear, wand attachments, potions, money and all kinds of collectables. The world feels immersive, NPC's will partake in certain activities depending on where you are, students will be browsing and reading books in the library, having lunch and talking to one another at a table, teachers will be going through school work in their classroom among many other things. This creates a more immersive experience for the player, further investing them into this world.There are no microtransactions in Hogwarts Legacy, this needs to be emphasised and commended. These days it is such a rare sight to see games that don't include microtransactions. Microtransactions ruin every game that they are a part of, I will always have respect for developers/publishers that refuse to put microtransactions into their game.Overall I think Hogwarts Legacy is a fantastic game, even if you aren't a fan of this world there is still a lot of enjoyment to be found within it. My hope is that the developers can continue to support and update this game adding more content to it. Imagine if they add a multiplayer mode where you can play Quidditch with, and against other players, if they ever do I will be there. Cooperative dungeons would also be pretty awesome. I'm very excited to see what is in store for Hogwarts Legacy in the future."

Not a harry potter fan, nor the target generation, but still starving for an atmospheric open world game once in a while. Selling this as an rpg is extremely questionable. Graphics 10/10, amazing details and atmosphere, must have had a horrendously good budget. But then .. with such a level of potential ... then ... under the hood, a game where no decision seems to have weight, not a single piece of gear dropped having any impact (you can regularly just visit the vendor to buy highest gear quality on your level, which are mostly reskins anyways, anything below highest quality being vendor food), any combat situation being easily manageable even on hard (coming from i.e. gw2 elementalist) and a story ending in just -well- ... meh. Also, the UI sometime, forced minimap rotation, locked cursor on page swaps...I decided to finish it since i liked the visual design a lot, found it neat in many occasions and had that 'now I am invested'-feeling and wanted to see the ending. This is barely an rpg, maybe an open-world'ish adventure, that does not remotely come close to cyberpunk, witcher or even good old gothic or oblivion in terms of depth, complexity and freedom. Probably worth it if you are a diehard fan of the franchise and want to experinece an interactive part of the harry potter universe."

I will now say i Recommend the game due to less crashing and fun gameplay. In it's current state i cannot play for very long before the game closes down on me. I have a 2080/i5 7600K, 16gb RAM. I should be able to run this game. It's the first game i've had frequent crashes on since buying the PC. Temps are fine, i've tried all the tricks available online. Sadly nothing helps. So for now it gets a bad review for being unplayable (for me). I hope a patch will help with the crashes. The game is interesting though, so if not for the crashes it would get a recommendation."
215,BILLIE WESKER,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DEATHXRONIN/,50,1,1,337.2,February,11,194,53,1,All politics aside this is a solid game. The creator is entitled to their opinion.The ultimate love letter to the Wizarding World. Been dying to play this since its first announcement. I've read all the books countless times and seen the movies more times than anyone. This truly makes you feel like a wizard and has that whimsical dark feel to it. I love how you can choose to be good or evil with no consequence. Haven't had this kind of system since Fable 2. The way I play I'm pretty much a school shooter with magic. Psycho Mode. Love the tonal shift from School which reminds me of Bully to everything outside the safe zones which become ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ killing floors. I also love how sadistic you can be towards everyone. For once we have a game that truly doesn't feel like anything else. Entirely unique as things should be. One of the best RPGs since Skyrim. I actually feel like doing everything there is to offer. So immersive. Highly recommend it. Of course another 10/10 in my eyes.Avada Kedavra!!!!
216,Jason Plays,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JasonPlaysNMS/,7,,1,64.2,February,12,318,0,1,"I have not watched the movies or read the books, just wanted to get that out of the way from the top....This is an awesome game with a ton of stuff to do in it. The map is much bigger than I thought it would be and the locations are detailed as hell. The combat is pretty deep, but not insanely so. Don't come in thinking you are getting some really deep RPG mechanics. Same thing for the armor / clothing in the game. The gear has stats but it is a very surface level system. That is all ok for me, the game plays really good and everything feels really good and polished. Not having watched the movies, all of the stuff in game is new to me. You can tell that the developer did all they could to cram in as much as they could for the Harry Potter world and it shows. If you are a fan of the books / movies it will be awesome, and if you don't care about any of that stuff it is still a very good game. If you are interested then jump in, it's pretty good."
217,Fenrir Deimos,https://steamcommunity.com/id/qpmz/,"1,264",172,0,17.4,February,13,157,153,1,"I am not a HP fan but I was pretty excited about this game. It's the first major non-movie-tie-in game in a setting that is, admittedly, is a pretty original one. No matter what you think of Wizarding Worlds or whatever it's called, you can't deny that the setting itself is pretty unique and unlike anything else among the major IPs nowadays. And on this, the game delivers. The world is vibrant and interesting, the atmosphere is great, the architecture is beautiful and it's all filled with a lot of small details that make it really a blast to explore. At least for the first 5-8 hours of gameplay. However, personally, I quickly lost interest in the game because it gets bogged down by a lot of... inconsistencies and problems. First, about what I call “inconsistencies”.Don’t be fooled by the marketing campaign. The game DOES NOT deliver on its promise of making you feel like a Hogwarts student. As a matter of fact, the game has pretty much nothing to do with the magic academy student-like experience. The game tries to pretend that this is what it is about at first, but you will quickly realize that it’s just a poorly chosen “aesthetic” that is dissonant with everything else in the game and, for this reason, does not work at all. The game’s story is completely inconsistent with what you’re doing and how it forces you to behave in it. The best example to illustrate my point would be a particular side quest I found in Hogsmead about 7 hours into the game.An adult woman, about in her 30s-to-40s from the looks of it, is asking the main character to “follow the butterflies” into the Forbidden Forest, because she’s interested where they lead and is herself scared of going into the Forest because… of her Hogwarts background. The teachers told her that Forbidden Forest is off limits to students because there is a lot of dangerous stuff there that will get her killed as students are not yet prepared to deal with it.Let me emphasize. A grown woman who studied at Hogwarts and knows for a fact that entering the forest is forbidden to students and is scared to go there because she doesn’t want to get killed by dangerous stuff out there… asks a Hogwarts student to go into Forbidden Forest. Not because she’s desperate, not because this is a matter of life and death to her… but because she is curious where the butterflies fly off to. Unbelievable. She’s not the only one who will ask the main character, a Hogwarts student, to do stuff that is in direct violation of Hogwarts rules in a way that doesn’t even imply that it would be breaking the rules. Quests like that are everywhere in the game. The characters will ask you, a Hogwarts student, to kill deadly Acromatulas, collect stuff in the Forbidden Forest or take on a camp full of dark wizards without even remembering that they are talking to a student. Even teachers will do that. But then when we need to go to the restricted section of the Library, suddenly the rules are in place again and you have to sneak around the librarian lest she tells on you to the headmaster. I just returned from butchering an entire village worth of dark wizards and I’m being threatened to be told on to the headmaster?This is the core of the problem, I believe. The gameplay systems are centered around chopping up powerful dark wizards for a regular Saturday morning exercise, but the game never acknowledges it is something a student should neither be capable of nor even attempt to do. So it doesn’t let me feel like a student, because I’m clearly more powerful and involved in dangerous stuff than a student should be, but it also doesn’t make me feel like a powerful wizard because Mrs. Scribner threatens to tell on me to the headmaster and I am supposed to take it as a serious consequence for my character. What am I supposed to feel while playing Hogwarts Legacy, then? I have no idea. So I just stopped caring. The game would be much better off if you played as an adult wizard instead of a student. But no, of course, the marketing team needs to make false promises about how this game will let you experience the joys of being a magic academy student. This is what the “Wizarding World” is about, right? This way we’ll be able to attract the core fanbase without actually making the game for them! The worst part about this is that they were right - just look at the number of positive reviews and concurrent players. They’ve played us for absolute fools!Now onto the “problems”. Many people have already stated them in other reviews. Technical issues on PC (although I, personally, don’t have many issues. The game plays at stable 60 fps for me on medium settings. On a laptop. But I digress), collection quests being the main thing you will do in the game, lack of expected features like Quidditch and so on. I don’t believe these are really all that important or take away from the game as much as the other problems I mentioned,  so I won’t focus on all that.My biggest gripe with the game aside from what I already stated above is its UI/UX and Inventory systems. They are a disaster. You’re being littered with pointless clothing items that don't have any differences between them aside from one stat number. And you get a new, slightly better item like every five minutes. So you’re forced to open inventory (which is not instant, you have to wait until the effects animation plays out) to change the item to get that 2 extra defense. Every five minutes. The “layer” setting that changes the items' looks only applies per item instead of overall. So you have to manually change the looks for every item you equip every time. Every five minutes. That is unless you prefer looking like a clown - in googly eyes glasses, a pointy hat, and a colorful star-riddled merlin-ish cloak. If you want to craft a potion, which you can only do in a specific location, you have to wait 15-to-90 seconds for the potion to finish cooking. There’s no way to make it brew faster. There’s no mini-game or anything. Just waiting. Oh, and you also can’t put several potions in a queue either. So you can’t dump ingredients for 10 potions at once and go explore to pick up all of them later. No, you have to craft one potion at a time and wait 15-to-90 seconds for it to finish so that you can brew another one. What a waste of time. One special type of cancer that is present in this game is the locking of quick bars behind the talent tree. You get more spells than your quick bar allows you to have already at 2-3 hours into the game, but the ability to unlock talents (and with them a second quick bar) only becomes available after 8-10 hours. And you can’t use spells without a quick bar, so you have to open a menu (and wait for the animations to play out. Again) every time you need to reassign Reparo to Lumos or whatever else is required for solving a puzzle. And you have to do it quite often.All of this disrupts the flow of the game. Instead of playing, enjoying the combat, or exploring you’re stuck dealing with slow menus. This review is written after I played for about 10 hours. That is what the game says in my save file. But you might notice that it says 17 hours on my steam profile. The additional 7 hours are most likely spent in these menus. Yeah, It really adds up.Overall, gameplay-wise, aside from the things I mentioned, it’s a pretty solid open-world RPG-like game. It’s neither better nor worse than any other open-world game available at the moment. It’s just the same as all of them. I will not try to evaluate if it's a good thing or a bad thing. It’s a matter of preference, I guess.  But the game has too many issues regardless so I wouldn’t recommend getting it at full price. Especially if you’re a Harry Potter fan who wants to “feel like a student at Hogwarts”. You won’t get this experience in this game."
218,Tenebres,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055822324/,140,4,0,9.4,February,11,244,46,1,"I had high expectations and was curious on how the developers would implement gameplay into the world of wizards. However, the more I play this game, more disappointed I become. Review is not final as I'm yet to finish this game, I'll update it once I'm done with it. Now, let's begin.GOOD sides.1) Environment - very well re-created world of Hogwartz and its surroundings, beautiful landscapes, place is massive, enjoyable to explore. There's a certain focus of attention to details that's been put when creating locations, including funny scenes and moments like two statues slamming each other every time you pass them.2) Music - Love it. Gorgeous music (Except one in Hogsmeade), it perfectly transfers those vibes from HP1-2 games and movies. Very well done.That's really it, at least so far for me. Now, bad sides. There's plenty and I don't care about what others may say, it's my personal taste and belief.BAD sides.1) Boring premise of the main story - yet another ""you're a wizard"" moment where you're that rare kid with super powers that very few others have. I wish it was more grounded with you being a regular student who got him/herself into trouble with friends and now are trying to solve things you may have ruined to begin with. 2) ""Loading doors"" - they ruin immersion for me even if the game is installed on SSD but there are a few moments when I can't enter a different location for a few seconds as the location itself is being loaded and thus the door won't open right away. A minor annoyance. 3) Hogsmeade music.4) CHARACTERS. Oh god, why. Game is set in 1800s, it's pre-Victorian era. Yet we have characters from other, far away eastern or/and southern countries. Transgender characters. Lesbian characters. Etc, etc, etc. If you want to make a game that follows nowadays trends, do a setup in 2010s+ year, not in 1800s. Otherwise it completely obliterates all that magical charm that the environment tries to establish by having modern trends clash against it. Absolute waste.5) Cutscenes. Feels very rushed. Some cutscenes are short, some characters reply without any expression or care. Classes last for a few minutes and it's always you doing things. Learn a spell. Click click. Voila, class is over lads. It feels that devs put a lot of effort in re-creating the environment and then they were told: ""Yo, you have 1 month to release the game"". 6) RPG Elements. It's good to have a variety of items to wear but they also grant you offensive and defensive attributes which force you to constantly ""upgrade"" your gear. Not to mention that your inventory is limited to 20 items, which is very small. I'd rather have the game make us think and become creative with spells rather than ""brute force"" your enemies instead. Complete miss on this one imo.7) Camera angle central pivot point is too low. If you make a perfect horizontal view, it'll be on a belly level rather than shoulder level. So when you begin to look around, your own character takes plenty of screen space. 8) Some technical glitches with shading, texture buffering being too slow.9) My character loves to lock his head left or right when running around rather than look where he runs to.10) You have a large variety of spells but you can only have 4 active ones at the time with 1-2-3-4 keys and (at least) I haven't figured out how to add more to the active slots. 11) Whole UI feels like the game was designed for the consoles but was ported to PCs. It's not that bad but its that evident. 12) Population - while the game has day/night cycle, I don't see students & teachers going to their beds in the evening. Location ""despawns"" populus behind your back. You can be semi-afk staring at a beautiful painting playing a nice melody and suddenly, location is empty because its night. You look around once more, its full again as its morning. But you don't see them coming downstairs or upstairs, they just appear. Its this odd feeling when world is sort of alive but it isnt. Feels more like a checkbox to me at times.Review is yet to be updated once I'm fully done with the game."

Within the first hour I witnessed a dragon merk someone, and got to hang with Fig Newtons.  Can't get any better than that.Or can it...?  As of a matter of fact it does.  The game does an excellent job easing you into the world.  Although the introductions can be understandable perceived as too slow for some people (the skill tree takes way too long to unlock in my opinion).  Once things begin to kick off it really does fulfill the genuine open world RPG experience even from the perspective of someone that isn't a huge Harry Potter fan.  The final product is certainly better than most Ubisoft titles (and it has achievements too.... look at that).Presentation is important which Hogwarts Legacy fully understands.  My only major complaint is PC performance occasionally stuttering - even after reducing settings to lowest.  Maybe it is my card (RTX 2060), but it does feel unoptimized in some areas of performance.  With that being said, I never felt like the game was ""unplayable"" due to those issues so hopefully it will improve with future driver updates.  I do think PC port performance criticisms are extremely valid, but the game is still designed well to be enjoyable despite these issues.I don't regret buying it at full price, but nothing wrong with waiting for a sale either.  Definitely earned my stamp of approval regardless."
221,Twitch.tv/Eros_Legacy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/l_Eros_l/,24,2,1,59.7,March,5,26,1,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is an action role-playing game set in the 19th century before the events of the Harry Potter universe. The player takes on the role of a witch or wizard who uncovers a secret that could change everything in the wizarding world.As a Harry Potter fan, I was blown away by the game's impressive world which has an enormous map full of content to explore. The castle's design is stunning, with intricate details that make it feel authentic. Finding book pages with fun-facts about the world adds to the immersion.The gameplay is versatile, allowing you to choose between stealth or wand blasting to complete missions and points of interest. The combat is simple but can be overwhelming at times. However, the story feels a bit shallow, and your actions don't seem to have much impact on the world around you.Despite the minor flaw in the story, Hogwarts Legacy is an incredibly fun game that kept me entertained for over 100 hours. While it may not have much replay value, the game's price tag is worth it for the hours of entertainment it provides. I highly recommend picking up Hogwarts Legacy if you're a fan of open-world games or the Harry Potter franchise."

What small amount of time I have played I have enjoyed, but it's been painful. I have an RTX 2070 Super with all drivers etc up to date, and I have had lots of problems with slowdown, lag and freezing. The frame rate tanks into single figures at times. Graphic issues are also everywhere with pop ins and unloaded textures. I have tried every fix going at this time, and I had got the game into a somewhat playable state. But no more. There are people without issues it seems, but for the most of us, this game is badly un-optimised and needs more than a patch or two. Sadly I'm past the refund window, but I shall hold out and wait for official fixes as there is a lot of fun to be found here, just not today. Save your money and wait a while."

So far the story is good, combat is alot of fun and the graphics are great.Performance isn't to bad, could use a little more optimization but its not as bad as some have said. Mainly atleast for me it comes right as a cutscene starts or ends, rarely ever when I am actually playing.The voice work and music is also very well done, great animations, fun side quests, the puzzles are a blast and its fun to rip around flying with your broom! It's a wonderful game that is alot of fun to play.Thoughts After 10 Hours Now:Positives:- Graphics are great- Atmosphere is very well done- Game world is well crafted with lots to find for people exploring- Combat is a blast and way better than it has any right being, gets better as it goes to- Music is ace- Voice acting is good- Cutscenes are very well done- Animations are slick- Tons of side activities and side quests to do- Controls are good- Flying around is a blast!Negatives:- Performance could be a little better- The story is decent but not amazingGame is amazing and an early GOTY contender, check it out!Can't wait to play more, its an early GOTY contender just like Hi Fi Rush, what a start to 2023 for games, its only Feb and we have two wonderful ones so far, lets hope this continues for most the year :)**Beat the game, I would say it was a 8/10 for me, very good... went in hoping for 7/10, got a better game than I was expecting******The whole game was finished on the Steam Deck, it works great if you use Proton GE-49, turn in game FSR off (but on for steam deck), turn settings to Low but put Textures to Medium).

Combat is fun at times, but all the loot you get is worthless, the talents are for the most part useless, and the entire game consists of constant, unnecessary, horrible dialogue. Instead of saying ""that was some good flying"" its 10 voice lines back to back complimenting eachother and talking about their broom for example, I could not care less. The classes are the same thing over and over throughout the whole game and the performance is horrible. The open world is empty and the enemy variety is nonexistent. Its nothing but a game to keep you occupied when you have nothing else to do. I wouldnt buy this unless it was 30$ and even then i'd be hesitant. Wayyyy overhyped, and i think that atleast half of the people saying the game is insane, is just saying it because of the controversy and because they dont want the twitter morons to win. In the beginning its fun but you soon realise that every mission is the same thing. Go from point A to point B while following an NPC that walks slower than your walking speed, sit through 2 minutes of dialogue, go into castle / cave and fight wizards / goblins, get 0 rewards except for the occasional spell you'll rarely use, sit through another 2 minutes of dialogue and tp back to hogwarts to repeat.Solid 6/10Enemy variety: 3/10World design: 10/10Combat: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Optimization: 0/10Immersiveness: 4/10Blue screen count: 4 (literally more in 24hrs than my whole life)Bugs: Beyond countingRandom fps drops: beyond countingNOT a bad game, but in its current state and price, you're better off playing the LEGO games."

230,Robin,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031205864/,43,4,0,16.8,February,22,305,3,1,"This is probably the final nail in the AAA games coffin for me. The first couple hours are fun and intruiging, as the world looks and feels magical and interesting, however after about 12-15 hours it becomes very boring and shallow and the lack of any real gameplay becomes apparent.You play as Mr or Ms. Ultimate Fashion Sense and Mary Sue (or male equivalent) of the game, who hasn't even attended any magic classes so far in their life, yet somehow excels at all them. No doubt thanks to the very many, and incredibly simple, button presses the players has them do. Somehow uncovering ancient secrets and riddles that are also in plain sight all around the map and require incredibly simple inputs to solve, yet somehow all the wizards and witches in all of history couldn't match the genius of this one 5th year student with no magical education. But hey, it gives the player something to grind at least.So as it turns out you're a master Stargazer/Beast Tamer/Grave Robber/Broom Flyer/ all without training. Also somehow a fighter of no match, seeing how you can single handedly walk into a camp full of grown poachers and dark wizards and kill them all without much issue. And of course, that's what 5th years students do in Hogwards, what could go wrong, right?While the combat is by far the most fleshed out system, even that one feels a bit wonky. First of all, you're limited to sets of 4 spells at once. You CAN switch to different sets of 4 spells any time, but the controls are a bit clumsy. You hold a shoulder button and at the same time press a face button to cast a spell (so far so good) or use shoulder plus  d-pad to switch sets (bit clumsy in the middle of hasted combat, but ok) but for defensive stuff you need to simply press a face button (and of course that overlaps with the attack buttons, except you gotta let go of the shoulder button that you've been holding down all this time). Also you can just shoot your wand with no particular spell by pressing the same shoulder button. So in reality it will often happen that you want to dodge but will instead cast spells and get hit, and you need quite some time to get used to the fact that the same button presses will be both block and attack, depending on the shoulder button. Not the worst system, but doesn't feel very fluent either. Enemy attacks however are also not that great, you will always get a warning ""halo"" around your characters head that's either yellow or red, depending if you can deflect the attack or need to dodge it. That's nice, as you will often get attack from off screen and couldn't see that otherwise. In practice that simply means you're gonna focus on your characters head for most of the combat and dodge whenever it lights up and them spam spells while it doesn't. While you also need to break through shields using different color coded spells that's about the extent of the depth the system has to offer, worse when there are multiple enemies and you need to try and target a specific one with a specific spell. All in all, combat, despite the range of spells, just never quite feels good.The story is actually quite interesting, however there's so much filler it's getting more and more a chore to press forward. One moment you're uncovering ancient magic or try and sniff out details of a major conspiracy, next you fly around popping balloons or looking for random puzzles in Hogwards. My guess is there's so little actual story they had to draw it out. Either way the pacing is terrible as a result and whenever you think it finally gets going it won't take long before the next stopper and filler period comes in.Graphically the game looks amazing of course. And I think that's pretty much what AAA games are these days, lots of people working and adding lots of shallow systems that look good and don't require much thought. There's tons of small stuff to grind on the map that give small incremental upgrades to your character or gear. Worst of all storage space for picking up gear. So often you're in a dungeon not even able to loot chests because storage is already full and you need to remember next time to go to a shop and sell all gear you don't wear, which takes also unnecessarily long time, requiring a 2 second button hold for each individual item. Yawn. Then there's capturing beasts (or rescuing them, since we're the good guys right?) so you can harvest their fur/feathers/etc so you can upgrade your gear or add magical enhancements. The adding magical enhancements is quite and interesting system as it at least isn't just a simple stat increase on one of the two stats you have (offense and defense. Very creative there) but the tedium surrounding it is annoying. You can also grow your own plants that you can then harvest to then make potions. All actions which have an actual ingame timer ranging from 30 seconds to grow a simple potion to 10 minutes to let stuff grow. The growing makes sense, but making 6 potions is basically just you standing there doing nothing for 3 minutes while a small animation plays out. yaaawwwwnn.Then of course there's the usual problem of animation want to look good and cool, but then sometimes it won't function property in actual gameplay because of terrain that's in the way or next to you etc. It feels like that's almost expected these days in titles such as this, so I guess everyone's used to it by now. Still disapointing.But hey, you get to press a simple input and watch a beautiful 3 second animation play out while grinding small incremental upgrades and isn't that what AAA gaming is all about?"

Therefore I might miss aspects of the game, that a fan would like/dislike.This game is incredible! Far beyond what I expected and I can't get enough! I've never personally seen a game with such wide variety of gameplay, done so well. You'll decorate large rooms and medows, catch magical beasts and care for them, grow plants and make potions, stealth your way into forbidden places and brutally hunt down goblins with your ancient magic. This is only the surface of the game and after 29 hours of gameplay, I haven't even seen half of the world yet.Controls feels great, its easy to change spells and the combat is very satisfying. You'll also encounter a large amount of different puzzles, all of which are very well done and generally easy to figure out. Running on ultra settings, graphics are amazing and the world itself is one of the most beautiful ones I've ever seen. The game needs a bit of optimization, but I haven't personally been effected by it beyond a couple of minor FPS drops. I'm sure a patch will be released soon, so I wouldn't worry about this, but do keep in mind, that this game currently is on the heavy side.This is the type of game I would recommend to everyone. You are sure to find something you'll love here and with the difficulty settings, you can either make this an effortless story or a challenging adventure."

However, I was expecting this game to be a more ""choose your own story"" adventure game. I would've preferred if you started from year 1 in Hogwarts and could make something of yourself i.e, becoming a dark wizard or going into the ministry, your choice of ending. But this provides none of that. Instead, you are thrown into a set linear story path that you cannot divert from, the game isn't necessarily bad, but it is just a waste of opportunity and budget since I don't think another Harry Potter game that is as high quality will come along anytime soon. The graphics are absolutely beautiful to look at, and the cutscenes are well animated but I could not find myself actually getting into the story. I do not want to be special from the get-go, I wanted the game to give us that choice of whether we wanted to make something of ourselves or not."

I love learning about the past of the Wizarding World, and I was surprised they figured out a way to make the Legacy experience interesting and captivating. Give it a try! The first 2 hours will let you know whether this game is for you! But if you're a fan, take a bite of nostalgia with this game. The scenery and character graphics are beautiful (except for the cats, who dropped the ball on the cats?), and while the character creation could do with a more in-depth update, it's not as bad as people say, but I do agree it's somewhat lacking. Still, you can play as someone who is still wholly the character YOU customized, and it shouldn't detract from the overall experience and nostalgia that this game provides. Get lost in Hogwarts! I am a Harry Potter fan and have been for decades. It was my childhood, teenage-hood, and adulthood favorite stories and movies. As I grew up with them, I don't care about whatever negative news or publicity has been getting around in relation to J.K. Rowling. She had no participation in this game, if you do your research, so no one should be discriminating against any other individual for their love and passion for this game and the Harry Potter series. None of the negativity changes how these novels helped me through traumatic times in my life, and it never will. Harry Potter holds a wonderful and magical place in my heart, and no amount of garbage, lies or unfortunate truths will sway my passion for these stories. So don't let others control you and tell you that you're a terrible person for playing this game. They're intolerant and desire tolerance while not accepting ANYONE for their own beliefs. Ignore, move past, and make YOUR own decision."
244,Ellye,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ellye/,8,,1,38.7,February,11,"1,130",0,1,"Early impressions are extremely positive, this is one of the best open worlds I've experienced in a game so far - for example, I never felt any desire to use Fast Travel or to turn on quest tracking, because moving around the world is way too fun. They made the whole place interesting. You know how games with huge areas will have a lot of doors ""painted"" in the walls that you can't interact with? This game has even more doors... but all of them are functional. There's places to explore everywhere. And, personally, I'm not exploring for some ingame rewards (those are, frankly, a bit meh) - but because it's been really fun to explore.The gameplay is pretty fine so far, playing on hard some of the combats can be a bit of a challenge in a good way. The game incentives you to make combos while dodging/parrying enemies, leading to a very action-y combat experience that feels good.I really love how the main character can be pretty talkative, and actually talk about the weird things she sees instead of keeping everything to herself like way too many game protagonists do. Great voice acting for the female MC too, I haven't heard the male one to comment. Overall, voice acting for most everyone is good, but there's one glaring exception: there's one minor Hufflepuff student that has the single worst voice I've heard in my entire life, and that voice doesn't seem to match his face or his face movements at all, it's bizarre.Regarding performance, I'm having a stable 60 FPS, but I'm having to play on lower quality than what I've expected, having to set everything to Low and use FSR2. Loading times are pretty good, at least, and I don't have any noticeable frame drops; just a pity about the low quality."

There's a lot of detail and interactable objects in the game world that just make it a joy to experience. The game also provides a multitude of activities to choose from and it's easy to find yourself so immersed that you lose track of time.Combat is a bit simplistic, like a dark souls-lite with many different spells to combine and a combo system to tie it all together. However, it is still fun and controls feel very responsive. Countering attacks and chaining different spells together are both satisfying and rewarding. Talents are also available to tailor your gameplay preferences by adding to your abilities anywhere from spellcasting, stealth, and consumables.One thing I do wish was improved is the variety of dialogue options. Most of the time you only get a couple options to choose from, it makes it feel almost kinetic. However this doesn't prevent you from being a total A-hole if you want to be ;)Tl;Dr: Buy game, gud game.

As a Harry Potter fan, I was thrilled to pre-order this game, and I'm happy to say that I haven't been disappointed.The story is excellent and fits perfectly into the HP universe. The game starts with a generic ""chosen one"" scenario but gets better as you progress through it. I will keep the information private, but the story is engaging, and I would love to read it as a book.The gameplay is overwhelming and features many amazing and satisfying mechanics. Exploring every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings is a treat, with many collectibles and puzzles to uncover. The side quests are exceptionally well done, allowing you to understand your fellow students better. The combat system is fantastic, featuring a variety of spells that can be combined for different effects. The fast travel system using Floo powder or brooms is a great touch, making travel and exploration even more fun.The RPG elements could be better, but the character creation and skill tree are still outstanding. The voice acting is excellent and adds to the game's overall atmosphere.The atmosphere is simply stunning. Hogwarts is massive, and the attention to detail in the handcrafted halls, rooms, and dungeons is breathtaking. The neighbouring villages and landmarks are just as atmospheric, making you want to explore every inch of the world.In conclusion, Hogwarts Legacy is a must-play for any Harry Potter fan or RPG lover. The gameplay, atmosphere, and attention to detail are truly unique and make this game stand out in the gaming world.9/10 - Just fix PC FPS Drops."

253,¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/,8,,1,86.5,March,20,"1,908",1,1,"Allow me to begin this review by saying that, as a Harry Potter fan since I was a kid (practically grew up with the books), Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter game I've always dreamt of, allowing me to finally visit Hogwarts as a student myself, having my own adventures instead of following the plot from the books.The story is set around 100 years before the books. You play as a Hogwarts student who just recently got accepted into the school, and as a fifth year no less! While this may seem weird, as one would expect to start from first year, it's both explained in the story, and honestly allows the player to jump straight into the action, instead of going through the basics. Anyway, at the start of the game, you're just about to depart to Hogwarts alongside Professor Fig, who's been getting you up to speed with some basic spellcasting. Things don't go precisely well on the journey there, and you end up getting involved in the latest goblin rebellion. Honestly, I can say I enjoyed the story, though the best part of the narrative comes through the companion sidequests. While there's four main companions with a certain involvement in the main story (one for each house), only three of them get their own personal side story.When it comes to gameplay, it's an open world action adventure game with some light RPG elements. While there's dialogue choices throughout the game, they don't really affect your relationship with other characters, nor do they lock you out of content (well, you can choose not to learn the Unforgivable Curses). Combat is done through spellcasting, while at first you only have a basic cast, as you progress through the story you unlock new spells, including, as I mentioned above, the Unforgivable Curses. Now, the game basically allows using them willy-nilly, and there's no consequences for going on a murdering spree; of course, it can be excused as you're fighting Dark Wizards and evil goblins. Beyond that, you can also get a broom to get around the map (no Quidditch, though), or even a hippogrif mount. There's also different skill trees in the form of ""talents"", which give you different upgrades, and while you can craft equipment, you can upgrade certain pieces of equipment. Also, a great plus is that you can change the appearance of your gear to that of any other gear you've found, so you don't end up looking like a madman wearing mismatching clothes.There's lots of stuff to do in this game beyond the main story and the side quests; perhaps too much, at times, as it can feel a bit tedious going for 100% completion. There's different mini puzzles in the form of Merlin trials, broom races, and at one point in the story, you unlock the Room of Requirement, which works as a sort of ""base"" where you can brew potions or grow plants to use in combat. Plus, you also get to rescue animals and put them in your own personal shelter, treat them well, and they'll give you resources (of course, it can feel a bit morally questionable how you ""rescue"" animals to get their resources, but the game makes it look like you're at least treating them fairly, and you can even release them to the wild).Graphically, it looks gorgeous. Hogwarts itself is very detailed, as are the surrounding areas. And the map is huge, too; not only do you get to explore Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest and Hogsmeade, but there's also plenty of little hamlets spread throughout the map, all with their own little collectibles, merchants, and side quests. The sound design is also very good; the dialogue is well written and the performances are all very good, and the soundtrack is excellent; some tracks resemble the movies, but the game has its own style as well.Now, to talk about Hogwarts itself, it's fantastic. The design of the castle resembles that of the movies, but there's still many details you'd find only in the books, including characters; Peeves, the poltergeist, makes an appearance here, as well as the different house ghosts. Since you can go to any House, they all get a very detailed common room, and a positive I have to note about the game is how they made Slytherins not be complete jerks. Sure, it's always seen as the ""evil house"", but over here, while they're still very ambitious folk, most of them aren't hateful people, just a bit of overachievers. The professors you meet are also great characters, and while there may not be as many lessons as one would expect in a game that's all about being a Hogwarts student, you still get a nice taste of student life.All things considered, I must say I definitely recommend this game, and it's certainly a contender for my personal GOTY, though we'll have to see what else comes out this year."

You are dropped in the game and you are immediately a super hero. I should also add you have absolutely no back story. At least when Rowling introduces us to the boy who lived it starts from the beginning and develops Harry prior to Hogwarts. Not only are you the immediate super hero, you start off as a 5th year student. Likely to do with the larger demographic of HP fans are in their 30s now and the studios thought it might not be appealing to play as an 11 year old but you still could come up with something... Such as starting off the game as a first year at 11, and that be the tutorial and as the tutorial is going along you're quickly going through the years where you learn who it is that you are playing as and at the end of the tutorial is when you are beginning your 5th year. Instead they decided to just throw you in as an underdeveloped character beginning his first year as a 5th year as this already amazing wizard that the player did nothing to achieve that in game. Admittedly my suggestion is shallow at best too but it is still far more developing than what we got. Then to make it worse, when you're going through your classes you're constantly showered with ""Wow thats amazing, it took me years to figure that out"". Alas, the immediate super hero. Your character is also aware of who the main antagonist is and who his right hand man is, yet you, the actual player, has no idea. I mean who Ranrok is as a character. You personally have nothing to go off of. Lets talk about risk vs reward. There isn't any. Early on during a quest you get a notification saying that you cannot wander the castle at night without risk of getting in trouble. Yet I do it every single night and literally no one stops you. There are several times where I have broken the rules and there is 0 tangible punishment. You help steal ingredients from the Potions Profs office. Then you get caught but thank god you made such a good potion and the professor just says ""Well I like people who take responsibility for their actions. You made a great potion today. That was no easy task"". Going back to showering the player with ""wow youre amazing"". Also I should add that you don't actually do anything to make the potion. It is all done in what is essentially a cutscene. Another example of there being no punishment, when you learn how to fly you have the option to veer off course with a classmate and take the scenic route thus breaking the rules. You get caught, the prof says both of us will be penalized by taking a hefty amount of points away from your house and that should deter you from doing it again. THERE IS NO HOUSE CUP!! Therefore there was no punishment. Therefore no reason for me to taper my behavior. Also why the hell is there no house cup??? Wasn't this game supposed to give you a feel for being a hogwarts student? AND ALSO why the hell is there no Quidditch?! You get sorted very early on and the headmaster, who is kind of a villian but you never interact with, says ""Due to an injury on the quidditch pitch there will be no quidditch season this year"". What injury?? The school year just started.. The students just arrived so how could there have been an injury. Why is there no quidditch?? Flying is in the game.. So is the Quidditch pitch. Outside the quidditch pitch, there are students in their quidditch house robes volleying bludgers around. You also find the snitch flying around in the room of requirement. Quidditch isnt even a complicated game. The assets are there. Put it in the game. Mark my words, Quidditch already exists within the game at launch and they will soon release Quidditch DLC and that DLC will just allow you to play it rather than adding it to the game. Similar to what EA did with Mass Effect did years ago.  Also in the main menu screen, the snitch sometimes flies around your head basically mocking you.Side objectives are mediocre at best. Its just mostly go collect this stuff or go kill these goblins and bring me my loot back. On the topic of quests in general, the game just points you exactly where to go which is odd in a game that is supposed to be immersive and open world. Rather it just holds your hand. There is one side mission that has you look for these objects that are usually high above you and even if it is not your specified objective if you enter a room and one is in there your character will tell you to look up in a very indirect but direct way.Then there is gearing.. Why in an HP universe game is there gearing?? Even then It also lacks depth. It honestly feels like an exploration device cause they could not come up with anything clever to entice you to explore more.The only real cool thing about the game is adventuring the school. However as a whole due to the fact of extremely shallow story narrative and very forced plot devices and no house cup and quidditch, I would strongly strongly advise that you do not purchase this game until they come out add features to it to make the game worth playing or it is on a massive sale"
268,Zylo,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199031804934/,6,,1,45.5,March,14,102,0,1,"Get ready cause this is a long one, might even want to grab yourself a cup of coffeeAs a fan of the Harry Potter series, I was excited to play Hogwarts Legacy, and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed. The game offers a vast, detailed, and impressive recreation of Hogwarts and its neighboring regions, which is packed to the brim with locations to discover, collectibles, and activities to clear. For a Potterhead like me, it was a dream come true.The combat system in the game is varied and satisfying. As I learned new spells, new combat opportunities opened up, which kept the game fresh and engaging in the long run. The customization possibilities are also excellent, featuring a myriad of cosmetics and skins, and my own customizable 'base' to furnish by hand at leisure.The progression system in Hogwarts Legacy portrays my growth as a wizard quite well, giving me new tools and utilities to access previously-locked content and areas. I also liked the solid roster of side characters; most of them are likable/unique enough, and their writing isn't complete garbage.However, the game is not without its issues. One major issue is the excessively repetitive open-world activities that create bloat and annoyance for those who want to complete all side activities. Additionally, combat balance issues with potions, 'healing spam,' and unforgivable curses make most fights quite too easy, especially when upgraded.Another problem is that most named foes and quest bosses are just normal enemies on steroids, with no variation in mechanics and no unique behaviors. I also noticed some inconsistencies with lore and character behavior. For example, if I used unforgivable curses in public or during quests (with witnesses), nobody seemed to give a damn.Moreover, I experienced significant frame-drops inside Hogwarts when transitioning between different sections and in specific places throughout the castle, regardless of settings. In some cases, fall damage doesn't even register on enemies.Overall, it took me 42 hours to complete Hogwarts Legacy, taking considerable extra time to clear all optional content and find around 90% of collectibles/secrets on Hard difficulty. However, I don't see a reason to replay the game once finished, except for achievement hunting, as the content is linear.Despite its flaws, I think Hogwarts Legacy is worth buying, especially if you're a fan of the saga. The amount of content and quality are more than fair for the proposed $60 price, expected from an AAA release.In conclusion, Hogwarts Legacy is by far the best game ever made based on this franchise, but it's not a masterpiece by any means. Fans of the series will almost certainly like it, but it's still drawn back by its issues."
269,Agent York,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxtrot-12/,34,1,0,32.0,February,11,597,4,1,"I can't believe I am giving this a negative review...I did enjoy my time with this game, hence the 32 hours, but I can't just blindly add to the wall of blue. .After playing this game nonstop for the early access and the BLINDING nostalgia and love for the franchise, I don't think the game is as great as everyone says it is., let alone Crucio as well as Imperio. All I got was a single off-handed negative comment and THAT WAS IT. I kid you not. It was a similar story with my fellow students, but I can forgive that just a little bit more.. Sure, you DO get to learn the unforgivable curses, (and that was my favorite side-story..you can even deny to learn them if you really want) but does it change much in the overall story? No, not at all. You can't be the precursor to Tom Riddle (lol) In fact, they seemed to have no effect on the final boss mechanically, though that was probably intentional. Without spoiling much, the final boss was far from normal.I enjoyed the 'main' student relationship-sidequests (and no, there are no romance options. I am not complaining, just letting you know). My personal favorite questline was the one with Poppy Sweeting from Hufflepuff.OH, and Quidditch is cancelled this year by the Headmaster! Haha...I couldn't believe it! Hopefully it gets added VERY soon.Anyway, yeah I would still rate this game a 6/10 due to the sheer fact that after the nostalgia, I feel the promise rings rather hollow. No quidditch. Perhaps some updates/dlc will help, though I have my doubts, even if it will be fun at first. Fun at first, but you quickly discover you are no factor in changing the story for good or bad."

It’s truly a dream come true and things like customising my wand even though it really serves no purpose made me insanely happy. Things like the Common rooms and castle not being as interactive don't even bother me, because throughout Hogwarts, I just wanna be on the move and explore. Yes, I do wish we could sit in those gorgeous Common room couches or take a quick nap in our dorm’s bed to alternatively manual save/time skip, but either way, as a seasoned gamer and Potterhead alike, this game, flaws and all, is freaking incredible!"
276,SUOMENLINNA,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012510262/,10,1,1,81.3,February,14,193,0,0,"really good so far. easily the best content in the IP since the original books. solid game play, excellent visuals, and a good narrative. Hogwarts itself is a real work of art. I cant think of another game that has made this in-depth of an interior structure. I came in expecting set pieces, all the locations from the movies, connected by intricate but linear hallways, and un-open-able doors; but the castle is entirely believable as a school, and only the room of requirement is instanced. common rooms, classrooms, bathrooms, suites for teachers and visitors...etc...etc...etc...for HP fans: its not even a question, you already own it. for anyone into RPGs and fantasy as a genre: its a really good choice. for #allies: come on....the devs worked really hard, there isn't anything in the text that's anti-trans, and Rowling made her bag before it even opened for pre-ordersas to the bad that I've noticed:Some stalling issues, endless loading screens on some fast travel that forced me to end process, and a pair of hard crashes thus far; but this is all to be expected for an open world game in week 1. I have faith it'll get patched. The IP has more money than god.some (more than less) of the dialogue is stilted somewhat. The VA is only 'passable'. But it's not a deal breaker, as i can rationalize it as ""its the 1800s bro, that's just how people talked"". Just be aware that the folks saying ""best writing of the year"" are probably overcompensating to fight the review bombs. some visual nit picks: while robes are nice and billowy, skirts on fem outfits are highly static. long skirts are accurate to the period, but there is more reason than thirst trapping for short skirts in gaming; its easier to get away with skipping clothing physics if the fabric is above the knee. and trousers all look like 'trousers'. essentially the clothing could be more aesthetically pleasing. but this is all stuff that can be modded. also sad there is no romance sub plot. had I looked that up BEFORE buying, I may have held off for a sale. favorite part of HP was his tumultuous dating life. I realize that the Devs are probably correctly concerned that the twitter mob will start calling them pedo's if they have anything more than platonic friendship for the 16 year olds in the game; but it's a boarding school story, come on. When I was 16 who was dating who was half my personal drama. I'm not here asking for CDPR style sex scenes, but the story is worse for not having a cute boy/girl we can spend the whole school year pining over and culminating in *gasp* holding hands at the end."
277,MysticalCyan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ISwearImAColor/,5,,1,57.1,February,15,519,0,1,"As a Disclaimer, I received this game for Free, and Completed it 100% Entirely earning the Collectors Edition Achievement and beaten it on Hard, without using Potions or Plants, connecting my game to Pottermore, as well as having the current DLC. I wanted to experience all this game has, and give it a fair review. I also live streamed the entire game and it is on my channel at .Story is Phenomenal, Music is Fantastic, Combat is Good/Okay some enemies feel clunky but combos are phenomenal to pull off, UI is a mess and swapping spells is pretty meh, taking care of beasts is charming and fun, creating potions and crafting is incredibly lackuster. inventory space is lacking, environment looks great! At first. Once you seen it already, you have already seen what it has to give, also feels like the game didn't go far enough in Hogwarts, also there are some bugs which are not THAT bad thankfully. I rate the game a 8/10 and hope they release expansions or dlcs, to improve upon what is here! I really hope this isn't a release and drop game.More detailed explanations below. The story is fantastic, and the characters are all incredibly fun to get along with. Some of the twists and turns you encounter is very fun to see, and many of the quests have tragedy spoken about it all over the place. It's a bit dark in this time of Hogwarts but the experience is quite Epic and I find the story telling and characters to be one of if not the most phenomenal thing in this game. The Music is incredible and really gives off this magical experience when playing the game. They honestly nailed it really well, every track fits well with the situations, although there are moments where the music is either a bit too loud or just disappears during some encounters. Despite that, the Music is one of the major highlights of the game as well as the sound of spells and explosions. Very boomy, very nice.Textures and Facial Expressions on medium were okayish, weren't the best looking but also weren't the worst! The effects for magic however was amazing and they did a really good job on teleporting and spell colors and the vibrancy of some environments really popped and it was a wonderful thing to experience as it felt just like the movies.Spell combinations were a huge highlight in this game, it was a very nice experience to use the utilities of each spell off of eachother in order to win in combat. I absolutely adored the spells HOWEVER. Enemies are quite . Some of the enemies will teleport to hit you, some of them will all attack you at once, and you have to Shield / Dodge multiple times because if you dodge/block one spell, you won't dodge the second either. It is quite unfortunate, and a bit frustrating to experience that as getting hit on hard difficulty despite traits/defensive stat basically meant 80% of your HP was gone no matter what. Spells were great, enemies were meh. A very weak part of this game unfortunately, the fact that you have to rotate 4 spells at a time was kind of frustrating, it made swapping to different combos kinda of finiky. Same with trying to utilize consumables, you had to select out of your pool of them in order to just utilize one at a time, its why I didn't rely on potions or plants during my playthrough. Revelio spam is also kind of annoying.Taking care of beasts is great! However, the lack of inventory space early on for both gear and beasts is kind of frustrating, same with the 4 species limit in vivariums, I really wish we could just have a huge field of beasties all mingling. Creating potions and crafting is legit non existent, you gather materials and then you just wait 15s - 2 minutes for a potion to be made, which you only make one at a time individually and cannot craft in bulk or gather in bulk. Its a time waster, I honestly wish there was a potion crafting minigame and you made potions in bulk as well as could sell excess materials for galleons. Crafting gear and gear in general is honestly kind of lame, once you have good traits you basically are just over powered, I used traits to boost all spells globally in damage and it just carried me as long as I didn't get hit as defensive stats don't matter. Exploration was also tedious and very very wide. There was a lot to do that didn't really contribute to anything aside from achievements. Another thing, is while you can explore everything and enter almost every room, once you have seen it already, you have seen all what it can provide. There is nothing really new and the world slowly becomes incredibly dull and empty aside from the seasonal changes from progressing in the quests. There are also no house points you can earn, and some things and activities you can't really do. This game on side stuff, really didn't go far enough in my honest opinion to make the roleplay experience of being in Hogwarts authentic. Honestly, I never really encountered many bugs, most of them were visual or just me getting stuck on a rock. However one major bug I encountered was entering a end game dungeon and beating it, and the NPCs spoke in the subtitles but were not there. Once I got that quest LITERALLY at the end of the game, the NPCs were there but because I beat the dungeon already, it just skipped to the end. It was very jarring and I honestly feel sad cause I missed an experience. I very much hope this game gets updated and more contented added in the future. While it did great on certain parts, it felt like it didn't go far enough on others, and felt shallow in multiples areas. The Main Story was great same were the characters, and the initial view was wonderful.I had a great time playing it mainly because of the story, music and views, with some frustrations related to combat, inventory, ui, and side activities either being subpar bland or jank. I recommend this game, and as above I give it a 8/10 and really hope it gets improved upon. The story, music, and setting in of itself really makes the game worth it in my opinion, and I will be paying my friend back in full for allowing me to experience it. I also raised $600+ dollars for the Trevor Foundation while playing it, the issues people are experience regarding the cultural thing. Just, all I will say is, Dislike the Artist, Love the Work. Magic is for Everyone, she who shall not be named cannot prevent it from being shared."

I will just say that the hype was definitely worth it because I'm absolutely in love with this game.The story, the atmosphere, the whole aesthetics in general are great. Even though the game is singleplayer you never feel alone. The map is huge and it's beautifully done with so many details and places to explore. Just walking around the map is already so calming and cozy. There is many iconic places around Hogwarts and many things can be recognized if you read the books or watched the movies, just that it plays before those. But it's also an interesting world for non Harry Potter fans. However I wish they added a tiny bit more details like being able to sleep in your dorm, being able to eat or take a shower. Would feel more realistic to me. Also I feel like some voices don't fit the characters, for example Arthur Plummly and Everett Clopton.But otherwise I really can't complain, the game is amazing and I really hope they will add some DLC 's in the future."

The game feels very straight forward when it comes to puzzles and quests. When out exploring the enemies I encounter are the Humans, Goblins, Spiders, Dugbogs, Corpses, Wolves and sometimes Trolls. for a big world it has a very limited amount of enemies. Hard mode still feels pretty easy, together with potions and all that you're pretty much unstoppable. Exploring in the forbidden forest doesn't feel that scary and dangerous due to how strong we are and the lack of different enemies. The game is Astonishing! The Graphics is AMAZING, it feels very immersive and nice to explore in the open world. The combat feels so nice and satisfying, makes me also feel powerful. Hogwarts is so big and full of mysteries. The Pet System is awesome!. The amount of customization choices we get to have is very good!. I love how much details there are in this game, A lot of content! The NPC's always surprises me with funny things. The Stats, Gear, Mounts, Wands and Talents/Spells is just AMAZING. Good job! The quests are really getting me hooked, and the friends you get in this game is amazing! You can really connect and feel different things about them.  Considering all the cons we also have to remember that this game is what it is and that's how they wanted to make it. We might want things that is similar to other games but at the end of the day this game is how it is for a reason. I love and appreciate the amount of work and effort the developers have put into this game!I got the Pre-ordered ""Hogwarts Legacy: Digital Deluxe Edition"" and LOVE the gameI've been grinding this game since I got to play it, and I yet have SO MUCH MORE to do in the game, not even close to finishing it!you might think that I am over exaggerating with my ratings but that's how I it is, honest with how I feel about the game. 8/10 Expecto Patronum on them haters all again :3"

The way they talk also feels right for the period and setting of the Game, but take that with a grain of salt since my native language is German. The world itself was well made and I have often taken a break to just stare at the murals and paintings in Hogwarts.The combat is incredibly fun and is a lot better than I expected and decently challenging.The map is big and with all the challenges and things to discover it feels full and alive.So with the Game so far I can honestly say it was a good buy and recommend it to everyone interested in Harry Potter or action / adventure RPGs.

Under the HP Cloud is a very shallow standard mediocre (but very pretty looking) collect-a-thon game, almost as empty as AC games. If you want to shut down your mind and run braindead through the landscape to fight the ever same enemies und proceed through the not interesting at all story - it's the game for you.

305,SexBub-Bomb,https://steamcommunity.com/id/iam_le_mon/,7,,1,73.4,February,11,564,1,1,"Writing this about 10 hours into the campaign.Aight first things first : The game is terribly UNOPTIMIZED (atleast that's what I've noticed on my system). The stutters are absolutely horrible at times sadly. The recommended settings by the game itself (Medium on 1440p) was struggling to maintain constant fps at times, especially in Hogsmead and during fights. DLSS didn't seem to make a highly noticable difference to performance either (but yes you get a few extra frames). And Raytracing even at the smallest level is out of the question in case of my 3060. As of right now I've settled for 1080p with a mix of medium and low settings.And for the gameplay part, the fact that we have a game like this set in Hogwarts after all these years makes me so happy (and I'm not some hardcore Potterhead). Its been really fun so far. I heard that combat was not that great prior to playing this but I've found it be pretty good actually. As for the spells, you have to attend classes, do assignments and side missions (not boring ones) in order to learn them which is kinda fun. I believe I've only scratched the surface when it comes to exploring the whole map and from what I've seen so far it's just so beautiful. Hogwarts looks so so good and extremely detailed. And you get to enter almost every single room with a door (I've been inside almost every room I've seen so far except for the ones that asked to me to level up). Recommending this because I hope (and trynna be positive) that the optimizations issues will get sorted out in the next few updates :) Also this is a review of the game and not any indication of how I feel about the statements made by the creator of the franchise. I hope people try to separate art and the artist and see the game for what it is. :)"

Interactive Entertainment.The action takes place at the time of the impending goblin uprisings of the 19th century in the Harry Potter universe. The story of the game is thus a prequel to the works of Joanne K. Rowling, who is not involved in the development of the game.At the start of the game, as is usual in role-playing games, the player creates their own character. This is a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who receives a belated invitation to the school. The player then has the opportunity to choose which house they want to belong to. The player soon discovers that he is no ordinary student, possessing an unusual ability to perceive and control so-called ancient magic, which is exceedingly rare and potentially dangerous. The player can choose how to use this ability as the game progresses. In addition, it will be possible to customize the character and develop his skills.The game takes place in an open game world in the Harry Potter universe. This will contain already known, but also new places. In addition to the Hogwarts wizarding school, the wizarding village of Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley and the Forbidden Forest are known as venues. The player will also be able to interact with creatures from the Harry Potter universe.+ best Harry Potter game+ magical and enormously detailed game world+ fun flights with broomsticks or beasts+ harmonious soundtrack+ a lot of fancy clothes and improvements+ countless side and collection tasks+ many accessibility settings- nice, but rather emotionless main story- pale main characterIf you like Harry Potter or want to become a fan in the future, you should definitely access it here."

Loading times take just a LITTLE too long for my liking.  NPCs a little uncanny valley-ish. Water does weird things when you go swimming.  But games never get that right. You start as a 5th year and if I HAD my preference you'd start from the beginning as a small kid with the world being more innocent and fairy tale-ish and it would go through the entire time of Hogwarts with your character growing and the story gradually getting more serious and mature as the game goes on. Kinda like the books. I suppose that's a little too much to expect and such a game would be spectacularly large.  For the most part I think it delivers exactly what you'd want from it.  The graphics are generally awesome.  Lots of stuff to explore.  Lots of little attention to details that fill out the world. Puzzles and mysteries and spells, etc. Items and treasure. Combat seems to be handled well so it's not too cumbersome.  Plenty of cats to pet. That alone deserves a thumbs up.  As for the controversy. Well ironically the game is pretty darn woke and inclusive. Almost to the point of immersion breaking. Almost. But you either are all in on that or just roll your eyes and get on with it.   Otherwise nothing political really enters the game. It just seems to be a well made PG-ish World of JK Rowling simulation. Which I imagine is what people want."
316,KingKrouch,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KingKrouch/,6,,1,2.0,February,11,839,0,1,"Above average for an open world game, has a pretty engaging combat system (to open world AAA action RPG standards), and outside of the stuttering issues (Which unlike what people have been claiming, are still an issue on Radeon graphics cards), mediocre raytracing implementation, and high VRAM utilization (Those two reasons are why I'm holding off on playing more), the PC port has absolutely zero things to nitpick about. Has plenty of scalability and upscaling settings, has PlayStation/Switch/Steam/SteamDeck button prompts support, native PS controller support, native ultrawide support, arbitrary framerate support, most of what you'd expect from a modern PC port in 2023. The port stuff is especially surprising, as outside of this, Fortnite, and HiFi Rush, most Unreal Engine games on PC may as well be low-effort Xbox debug builds that ship unpolished (I've boycotted making any game mods for Unreal Engine games, as they share the same problems, and are holding back PC gaming). Glad to say this is not the scenario here. Good work, even the console versions have a framerate cap separated from the quality settings, so they should be fantastic on future hardware like the PS5 Pro or PS6 (for example). Keyboard and Mouse input also has separate UI related tweaks from controller input as well (Being able to drag and drop spells onto slots, having the spells laid out in a horizontal manner, being able to scroll between spell pages with the scroll wheel).I do however wish the game had an option to not use a Over The Shoulder perspective, and the option of furthering the camera (The FOV slider is a band-aid for a shotgun wound).If you are wondering why my playtime is short, it's because I played on a relative's Steam account as Family Sharing was not enabled until the game left Early Access. I played about 10-20 hours on that account in offline mode. My save transferred over without problems.The big controversy from a vocal minority on Twitter/ResetEra/Reddit is a nothingburger. Not like anyone on those websites should have their opinions taken seriously. I thought an IP as big as Harry Potter was gonna be the thing to cause a gaming crash to happen (due to the massive wave of terrible/soulless/incomplete/buggy AAA game releases), but I was left pleasantly surprised by how high the bar got put. I hope Avalanche gets to work on more licensed games. If they patch the problems with the game after launch, then it's already better than the treatment FromSoftware gave Elden Ring on PC, despite fanboys astroturfing it as a perfect release. This and HiFi Rush are probably GOTY contenders."

It hasn't hurt my gameplay in anyway for me as its only small dips but it is noticeable even with my 3080. So far it has not happened at any time during combat.

The game's immersive world, deep lore, and engaging gameplay all combined to create an unforgettable experience.One of the game's standout features was its setting in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The attention to detail in the environment was impressive, and I felt like I was really exploring the magical world I grew up reading about. From the Forbidden Forest to the Hogsmeade Village, every location felt like it was ripped straight from the pages of the books.The game's story was also well-written and engaging. As a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, I had to navigate the challenges of school life while also uncovering a dark mystery that threatened to engulf the wizarding world. The game's moral choices also added to the sense of player agency and made me feel like my decisions had real consequences. But I later found out that my decisions had no real consequences and that there is no honor system like in red dead redemption 2.The gameplay was also excellent. As a student at Hogwarts, I had to attend classes, learn spells, and engage in duels with other students. The game's RPG mechanics allowed me to customize my character's appearance, skills, and abilities, making me feel like I was truly crafting my own wizarding experience.Additionally, the game's sound design and music were outstanding. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of orchestral and magical themes, perfectly complemented the game's setting and added to the overall atmosphere of the game.Finally, I have to say that the game's attention to detail was impressive. From the intricate spell animations to the various magical creatures I encountered, it felt like every aspect of the game was carefully crafted and thought out.Overall, I would highly recommend Hogwarts Legacy to anyone who loves the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The game's setting, story, characters, gameplay, sound design, and attention to detail all combined to create a truly magical experience."

Graphicly, it's just about what you'd expect from a AAA game in 2023. Even if you're not playing on the absolute highest settings on some next-gen system, the game still looks gorgeous for the most part. On top of that, the game takes place over the course of a whole year, which will take you through different seasons that change the look and feel of the world and it's really just a pleasure exploring the same places, but from a different perspective. Storywise, the main plot is pretty simple, stop the bad guy from becoming the most powerful wizard. That being said, it's still pretty satisfying and it takes you on quite a journey to achieve your goal. Besides the main plot, there are a few side plots that do a great job of keeping you engaged in them. In my opinion, these side quests are the real highlights of the whole story. Gameplay and exploration is where this game shines the most. The combat, contrary to how I expected it to be before the game came out, is really satisfying and engaging, with plenty of spell combos and multiple ways to approach it, whether you want to go head first or take it slow and stealthy, you can do so. Enemy variety is as it should be, it doesn't need any more or fewer enemy types. Exploration feels rewarding and there is A LOT to explore, collect and interact with. Where there are puzzles, they are simple enough as to not get too confusing, but also not so easy as to become boring. There are a lot of different mini-games world events scattered all over the map, which is quite large. From doing Merlin Trials, which are themselves very diverse and have a good amount of diversity to not get too repetitive,  to constellation spotting at night, broom flight challenges, rescuing beasts and caring for them, treasure hunting through all kinds of places or just freely flying around casting Revelo every 5 seconds, they are, in most cases, fun to do. Unfortunately, it does lack one very important and crucial activity, a fishing mini-game, but I guess nothing is perfect. The Worldbuilding and NPCs are pretty complex, with plenty of small towns to explore, and charming side characters, each with their own little story and dialogue, and lots of houses for you to rob from facing no consequences whatsoever. Every shopkeeper has their own life story that are eager to tell you about. Overall, while Hogwarts Legacy might not be the absolute best RPG out there, it is a really solid one. And for what little it lacks in some aspects, it makes up for tenfold in enjoyment and pure fun. There are very few issues with the game, and I can't really recall any major bugs. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter universe, this game will certainly meet all of your expectations and will satisfy your Hogwarts student dream. And even if you aren't a fan of the universe, I'm pretty positive you'll find a lot of enjoyment and entertainment from this game. If you are just a big fan or RPGs and you don't know what to play anymore, this will be a very good pick. And for any completionist, the achievements are simple, mostly straightforward, and will have no problem 100% it."

335,Oskej,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Oskej/,51,4,0,61.2,February,13,176,2,1,"We should start with the biggest issues I have, finishing at some minor inconveniences.The world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts Legacy has the benefit of the real world essentially creating endless possibilities to warp it and change at will fitting the fantasy world of wizards and witches endlessly trying not to bring muggles into their business. This alone should be enough to make one hell of a universe… universe that Hogwarts Legacy barely expands on, that Harry Potter movies altered to bare minimum, enough to make couple of movies out of it. The thing is, videogame is not a movie, and it requires quite a lot more work to create believable, enjoyable and well put together world that does not need explanation outside of environmental storytelling on its own.Second most visible and painful problem is the checklist well known from Ubisoft productions like Assassins Creed, so called fillers that they’re giving players to sink hours into completion that has nothing of value, but cosmetics, upgrades, craftables. Hogwarts Legacy has quite a lot of them, and I can only assume that they were made purely to fit the popular world designs of triple A games that we were fed for past couple of years. Once you try any of those collectables once, all of them work pretty much the same, and there’s way more than enough of them to give you a headache, especially if you’re a completionist.What also stands out is that every cave has exactly the same design, every bandit camp is the same thing, and there is simply not enough unique locations to do something better with it.I should put it in the first place, but considering that game with mute protagonist and NPCs that you can talk not even once to in order to complete the game, it lands on third place, just because it exists in this game and it is beyond annoying.Most of the characters are boring, and their dialogue is something you would see more in a parody of Harry Potter more than actual and serious game.Side-quest dialogue is stiff, and feels like not enough budget was put into minor background characters, while everything was pumped into cutscenes including characters vital to the main story. Considering that I did not finish the game yet, and I’m probably not even halfway through it I can’t really have an opinion on main story, but so far every single side quests I completed was just a simple fetch, kill, gather quest that also feels like a filler, in addition to world design issues I stated earlier. I believe there are some quests that are interesting, but I am yet to complete them.Nearly non existing. This one is essentially dropped from Avalanches to do list. You can spin the globe, pet the cat, have some beasts, whatever. Interactions with what matters are not there. You can get one liners from some students in the castle. Every interaction that starts the quest is something you would expect current AI robots to do. It is not believable. Characters just stand waiting for you to approach them, do your thing, come back and then never interact with them again. For a videogame following this design you would expect to find characters asking for help midway through the thing they ask you to do, not just stand and wait for their savior. If you take into consideration games like Red Dead Redemption 2, Hogwarts Legacy is 10 steps back in terms of interactivity with the world. I will not mention the whole ‘choice matters’ thing, because there is no choice to nothing. The most important to me, certainly not to others.I will start by saying that designs in this game are wonderful. Ambience and aesthetics of the castles interior are on par with Elden Rings.The problem starts when you’re getting bored of the castle and you want to explore outside of it, because… there is not a lot to explore. If you take the checklist locations you’re really left with couple of places that shine the most. I think that while with real life locations, such as Hogwarts being in UK, worldbuilding gets the most opportunities to shine, while world design can get tricky to pull off, and you can clearly see that just flying around the map. Couple of extraordinary locations on a simple map with just mountains and plains is something that Horizon Zero Dawn was suffering from, and it is a shame."

A few small game glitches so far but nothing game breaking or that breaks the immersion for more then a split second. So far 8.5/10, polished, well thought out, amazing game so far.  (NOTE: I bought the deluxe edition and I  have not made it far enough in game to unlock deluxe edition exclusive content, this review was solely on the base game content so far) GPUs/graphic comments: I am running on 1080p Ultra Graphics setting (no ray tracing enabled (yet) and I am currently using a RX 6700 XT eagle and have has no issues, for those with an older graphics card I also tested it briefly on my old RX 580 8 GB and was able to get 45 FPSish on medium/low I recommend a 6700XT or better for ultra but an older card can swing medium/low it if you don't mind poorer graphics )"

A beautiful open world meets tedious, unfun collectibles and side content of which there is way, way too much. Side quests are utterly forgettable, as is the main story. combat starts robbing your of your soul after the 200th encounter. The map and overall atmosphere was great. and I don't hate the game. won't recommend full price for it though.It also has bad performance issues and glitches, the voice acting feels very off too. female main character sounds bored and disinterested as ♥♥♥♥. massive potential that hasn't been used. I'm very disappointed in the game."

Turning off ray-tracing helps with the crashing issue a little, but the game still crashes sporadically more so when fast traveling. Overall, I'd only recommend this if you like collectathons, this is worse than Assassin's Creed in that respect. They have you collect objects that literally mean nothing with zero attachment to them, and expect that to be the post-game experience. I enjoyed gaslighting my friends, stealing things from people to get reactions, and wearing a pumpkin for a majority of the game tho. Other than that, pretty boring.The no consequences for your actions seems like a half baked system that they didn't have time to finish, especially when considering the final fight of the game.________________________________________________________________________This is only a temporary review to say that performance has been noticeably worse since the last patch. My game has crash 5 times in 3-4 hours of play since the update. It is especially problematic when fast traveling frequently and walking around Hogesmead. Another issue is that lighting has been pretty bad since the most recent patch where they updated ray tracing. Indoor environments are lit like the light source was a bright as the sun and in the room. In the over-world lighting is pretty inconsistent as well, where things vary from really bright to normal. Textures and pop-in have also been worse since the that patch.The game has had issues from the start but they have mostly out the stuttering. Hopefully these other issues can get ironed out fairly quickly. Overall, the game is solid albeit with rushed design at times where things don't make sense as to why they are in the game. As someone with no experience with the books nor movies, the game could do better in explaining past events in the world that they allude to in the field manuals.This will get updated once I finish the game."

343,Virtualmass,https://steamcommunity.com/id/virtualmass/,190,22,0,31.3,February,15,564,12,1,"I can't recommend Hogwarts Legacy at the current price of £50.This game is feels really rushed. The first half is incredible, the prologue was a completely unexpected cinematic gem, Hogwarts itself is a joy to explore, the initial lessons offer nice flavour about the spells you're about to learn, the characters are unique (albeit a bit cliche) and you're really feeling that 'I'm a student at hogwarts' vibe. Then you get your broom and the game becomes a generic open world RPG as if Harry Potter himself has joined the Assassin Brotherhood. Everything that makes the first half so interesting is gone, lessons are uninspired cutscenes and you then you learn an unrelated spell after, the world is littered with repetitive tasks/collectibles, characters become the same blend of 'good-natured but incompetent' and quests become 'go to dungeon, kill baddie, retrieve thing'. The final half of the story lets down the great introduction by offering no meaningful choices and an unemotional, obvious finale. Itemisation is shockingly poor. I picked up a 'legendary' item within my first hour of play which was discarded by a basic item in the next hour. There's no interesting item attributes to focus or balance just offence and defence when you could have had spell cooldown, damage, critical, debuff, stealth detection etc... The talent system also felt pretty shallow with most of the spell talents just adding an AoE component. The inability to unlock every talent and/or respec is just criminal. Personally I felt the potions should have been harder to obtain but with longer durations/more powerful effects. It just became an chore to brew them and apply them constantly. It would have been much cooler to hunt down a rare creature for a material, to brew into a potion that gave me a 5 minute buff or even something permanent. Witcher 3 is really best in show for this. That being said, I found the combat plants a fun thematic inclusion.Combat was generally quite fun and a challenge at times. The air-time mechanic was probably my favourite aspect of the combat. It did however feel like there were really only two classes of enemies - those that could be crowd controlled and those that couldn't. The controls for combat were not great and found myself messing up whilst trying to switch up spell slots on the fly.Credit where is credit is due, the world is beautiful. Hogwarts obviously is the masterpiece but there are really fantastic sets throughout the world. Overall this game has great potential and I hope the success it has achieved will inspire fundamental changes in DLC or a much deeper sequel."
344,RPG Gamer Man,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013723081/,54,6,1,93.3,February,28,"1,003",5,1,"NOTE: This review was done on Version Build 1121649.Hello friends! Welcome to my review of Hogwarts Legacy.Alot of real life people arguing about this game and causing a big mess. In my opinion, if you want to just play the game and ignore the real life jank, then do it. You do not need to follow what everyone else says, do your own thing. Now that i got out of the way, let me talk about this game. The game revolves around the world of Harry Potter and the Wizarding World. Harry Potter is not in this game, but it is in the same place he attended wizard school in the movies. The game takes place in the past around the 1800's, the turn of the century. Alot of things in harry potter movies are somewhat different in this game. Also, you can explore various locations around the wizarding world, including scotland and hogsmeade. Many of the spells from the movies are also in the game, and you can learn them throught the year. The game itself is pretty open ended and you can even explore and put the main quests on hold until later. Be aware that some places will not be accessible until you learn certain spells. This will block where and how far you can explore. The season also changes the further you go into the story.The game is also open world, like a ubisoft title game. There are also collectibles hidden around the world you can find. These will take some time to find if you plan on trying to find them. The game is not perfect. It does have some bugs in it, and the developers are currently fixing it still at this point. This means it could improve from what it is right now. Anyways, the following is my PRO/CON list:PROS:- A open world game in the wizard world of harry potter. If your a fan of the movies, you may want to play this game.- Collectibles around a open world.- Side quests.- Ability to learn new spells thought the year.- The first game in more than 10 years where it is linked to the wizarding world.- Easter eggs in the game that link them to the harry potter movies, including a quiz by a npc.CONS:- There are some bugs that can mess with collecting items in the game. It can cause errors on the map in the game. I experirenced a issue where it showed a field page i collected, but never disappeared off the map.- Repetition of the game is a big problem. If you do not want to do it, take a break and then come back to play it some other time.- The open world seems too open at some points and wish to have more things to do in it.- Many places you explore look similiar, especially the treasure vaults.- Some people are complaining about stutters or other issues, but i hardly had any and im on a 3060 graphics card. Make sure to set benchmark in the game to get graphic settings correctly.Do i recommend the game? Yes, because the last harry potter game i played was lego harry potter series on ps2, and really missed the games. In the end, it is whether you have fun with the game if your a fan of the movies or not."

One of the best AAA games in the past decade. It’s just so much fun!What I like:- Excellent snappy combat- Gorgeous graphics, truly next gen. (for a price)- Interesting quests (there are fetch quests but they are short and sweet)- Main Story so far is entertaining, much like a HP spinoff movie.- Loads of content (10 hours in, barely scratched the surface)- Great characters and voice acting.- Exploration is unparallelled, you never know what you find in the next nook, pretty much all doors are open, the castle is GIGANTIC, and that is only part of the map.- An amazing collect-a-thon! I loathe collectibles (looking at you Assassins Creed) but Hogwarts somehow makes it fun and rewarding.What I don’t like:- Awful PC performance, especially if you want to use Ray-Tracing (my RTX 4070ti struggles on ultra)- Controls are clunky at times. Not the worst console port in that regard though.- Some QoL issues and gripes.- Underutilised house quarters, perhaps there could be a tiny bit more interaction with the world (eat, sleep, wait, maybe minigames)- Underwhelming gear and loot, feels pretty much as Cyberpunk 2077, you just swap out gear for the highest number one and toss the rest. (huge missed opportunity there)Overall the game is a 9/10 for me, truly next-gen and a labour of love. Also for a huge open world RPG it is relatively bug-free too. Performance is bad, but there is DLSS and graphics can be toned down. I am willing to look past that though, because the game does live up to the hype!"

The story begins on your way to your first day at school and the sorting hat ceremony. The wizarding world is in a threat of a powerful Goblin, Ranrok. Throughout our academy year we would need to combine both study during our classes and exploration of the found portkey and what's behind that.Unfrotunately, to fully enjoy the world of Hogwarts you need to have a decent specs PC. Outstanding visuals, modern technologies such as ray-traycing, DLSS, FSR etc. Breathtaking world and school itself developed to the smallest details from what you've seen through the movies.Music that reminds you all the movies from ""Harry Potter"" and ""Fantastic Beasts and where to find them"" won't leave you indifferent. Voice acting is another piece that will make you drown in this magical world. Though, not recommended to move your voice tone from default, otherwise that might sound a bit ""robotic"".That's exactly what every fan has been dreaming about. Learn unique spells and combain them so you can beat every single enemy as they have it's unique strategy to defeat. Fly on the broom or mistic creatures from the universe. Customize your character the way you see it and your point skills the way you want.Is it a masterpiece? Yes, it is.

Simply put, the Harry Potter novels are accessible to the understanding of most people, have a mass sign, however, unlike many one-day books, they have a deep foundation of myths and fairy tales, closely intertwined with the real situation of the developing World (although these political, social and other aspects will be more accessible to adult readers than to younger fans of the book series)./, лишь написала роман о юном волшебнике по имени Гарри Поттере, но в настоящее время это выросло в размерах и является одним из самых узнаваемых и окупаемых брэндов Мира.Секрет романов о Гарри Поттере скрыт в сердце каждого из читателей, от мала до велика, – это симбиоз воображения и логики, страсти к приключениям и романтизации окружающего, узнавание реализма и сопоставление его персонажей с самим собой. Проще говоря, романы о Гарри Поттере доступны пониманию большинства людей, имеет массовый признак, однако, в отличие от многих книг-однодневок, имеет под собой глубинный фундамент мифов и сказок, тесно переплетающийся с реальной обстановкой развивающегося Мира (правда, эти политические, социальные и прочие аспекты будут более доступны взрослым читателям, нежели младшим поклонникам серии книг). is an immersive fantasy RPG set in a beautiful open world with stunning scenery, charismatic and memorable characters, a fantastic combat system and tons of mechanics. This game is not only for fans of the Harry Potter universe, but simply a wonderful game in itself. Avalanche Software did something really special with Hogwarts Legacy, and it justifies the hype. At the very least, it sets a solid foundation for future Magic world games. And we can safely say that this is the best thing that has happened in the franchise since the original books and movies./ — это захватывающая фэнтезийная RPG в красивом открытом мире с потрясающими пейзажами, харизматичными и запоминающимися персонажами, а также фантастической боевой системой и целой массой механик.

Avalanche Software сделала нечто действительно особенное с Hogwarts Legacy, и это оправдывает возникший ажиотаж. Она как минимум создает прочную основу для будущих игр в Волшебном мире. И мы можем с уверенностью сказать, что это лучшее, что было во франшизе со времен оригинальных книг и фильмов."

At launch its a bit rough around the edges but the game definitely has potential of being the best game no doubt for the franchise. Fans should be excited for this cause even being a non-fan, I can enjoy the world, its got the charm of the movies in them, a bit too PG-friendly dialogue for my taste but its not so subdued of violence that it gets boring.Combat is comparable to Batman Arkham games, some depth but easy to master.The games world is pretty huge, the Hogwarts Castle is MASSIVE, and it'd not shock me if the game operated like CDPR's Witcher series where expansions or content drops can expand the areas or world to explore more areas once more development happens.People who Spite-Bought this to help the devs or who got it to simply counter the more obnoxious individuals who exist in society will have the ability to actually play and enjoy the game rather than let it sit there unplayed. Lots of things to do and to explore.I hope the games success will make the developers able to make more games of this quality and improve further and give us even better games down the road that's different from their typical/average releases (As wikipedia would show what they were doing before this game).Troll the insufferable and insecure cyber-bullies to your hearts content."

K.

What a fantastic game! It's so nice to see a huge open-world banger of this scale launch so well, for once... (at least from my experience, so far!) ... As someone who grew up with Harry Potter, watched all the movies a few dozen times each and read all the books in 2 different languages, I get goosebumps every time I launch the game! :')I feel like Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world experience that more games in the future should try to match. The open-world interactivity is quite surprising, really. There are a lot of much bigger budget AAA titles out there (looking at you, Cyberpunk 2077, my old friend!) that would really benefit from the Hogwarts Legacy open-world treatment, where random items can be interacted with, which play their own unique set of animations, such as picking up food / drink from stalls and consuming them, brewing potions in real time, etc... those classic, 'old-school' immersive sim elements that seem to be dying more and more with each new AAA release where quantity is favoured over quality.Hogwarts Legacy is also a game I like to 'taste' ... to take in really slow. After 50 hours, only now did I receive my broom stick. Most people would have received their broom in the first 10 hours or so... The game has finally opened up in all its glory, to me. It feels like the fun has only just begun. As I am a completionist, I see a good 200-250 hours of gameplay per playthrough. And of course, I plan on re-playing the game with different builds, dialogue choices for the sake of role-playing, and trying out all the different houses (currently, I'm a Gryffindor according to the online Wizarding World Quiz!) , as well as making a female character at some point. So, I wouldn't be surprised if I clock around 1,000 hours total by the time I've done everything I ever see myself doing in this modern masterpiece of a video-game. It's art in its purest form. The combat slaps, too! Haha! xD It's quite addicting, it works so well, and the different combos that can be pulled off by mixing and matching spells feel super rewarding. The game might be aimed at 12+ , but it goes pretty hard and it's actually a pretty complex, deep and rhythmic system if you don't spam the same buttons all the time!P.S. - I will be updating my review and talking about different aspects of the game I experience the further I advance."

366,BadHairDayVibes,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198405375527/,18,,0,57.7,February,21,156,0,1,"TLDR: It's a decent game, the story is alright, but it's filled to the brim with cutscenes and dialog, tons of ""fetch"" quests. About 25-30 hours of main story, which goes by quickly. I'm not impressed by the graphics whatsoever, and I still suffer a lot with lag spikes and glitches, even tho I have a decent computer. Detailed Review: The main story gets sorta boring quite quick, it's a lot of ""get this for me"" or ""speak with"" quests. Feels a lot like filler, rather than actual main stuff. Getting side quests and main story mixed up, is really easy. Combat is fun in the beginning, but as time goes, it gets monotonous, and it's about 60% of the game. The finale boss battle is probably the best one, yet unbelievable tedious. Dialog and cutscenes take up A LOT of the game, which isn't an issue for me normally, but it drags out in Hogwarts Legacy. You can't really pick up any quests without having to go through 1-5 minutes dialog or a cutscenes of sorts. Which also counts for the side quests, or the many extra things to do, such as the Merlin Challenges. Something I really enjoy is spending time with magical beasts, it's dull, but enjoyable and generally working on the Room of Requirement, is really relaxing - once you've collected everything. Colleting can be a big part of the game, It's not necessary whatsoever, but it's a good break from questions. If you're expecting some connections between Harry Potter and Hogwarts Legacy, dont buy the game. There's a few similarities and Easter eggs, but not nearly enough for buying it. And no, theres no option of any ""romance"" in the game. None. So don't buy it for that either. My biggest ""issue"" with the game is, how bad it is to play on PC. Even after a few updates and patches, I'm still suffering with a lot of lag spikes, map glitches and delayed gameplay. I have a pretty solid gaming computer, that runs most games. Not Hogwarts Legacy tho, not even on low or medium settings."

If Denuvo is removed and the PS-exclusive quest is added, then I'll flip this review.The game is a solid, well-deserved 7/10, but it had the potential to be a 9/10 or better. Some of its faults are definitely moddable away, we'll see what the community cooks up.Let's start with the good things. As a Hogwarts simulator, it's the best we've ever seen. Pretty much everything is  recreated in great detail, you can  open pretty much  every door, look around everywhere , and the game world  is so large it could've been  half the size and literally nobody  would've complained. It's massive. It does have some omissions though. Wizard currency is only talked about. Your money is just ""gold"" (a few lines of dialog accidentally refer to it as galleons but most of it calls it ""gold"", and if that was indeed galleons everything would be insanely expensive at 1800s prices).You can't sit anywhere but the ground, or sleep in your bed (sounds minor but over time it starts to feel weird). Teachers don't give ""X points to [house]"", but ""points to [house]"" (other than a cutscene or two). These are meaningless, I went to check my house's points and our hourglass had a grand total of 0 gems in its lower compartment after I won those points. It was easy to count.You can't IMAGINE how inconvenient travel was before Ignatia Wildsmith invented Floo powder!There are a few continuity errors: seventh-years' future OWL results are mentioned when it should be NEWTs, that kind of stuff. Nothing major.There is no Quidditch. Fair enough, that would've been a huge development undertaking, and the game already has issues with dev time allocation/budgeting. There is an explanation in-game as to why, and it makes sense in the game world.The game's faults are broadly in two categories: technical issues, and the writing/execution of the main story.The game still has Denuvo despite it having been defeated. To absolutely no one's surprise, most of the performance issues with this game are on the CPU side, even on ""Low"" settings. I had to manually reactivate through their website 4 times (I started counting after the third) because it wouldn't do it automatically. Feels nice to be a valued customer. Guess what kind of players do not have this issue at all.Graphics are... weird. You can see the ground loading in front of you in small tiles for 10+ seconds, even on a monster PC. Regardless of your settings, even on RT Ultra, there are some weird screen-space shadows (not ambient occlusion) that disappear as you rotate the camera or NPCs walk in front of them. Regardless of your settings, lakes will use screen-space reflection with the laughably bad reflections that entails, especially if you fly over them. Regardless of your settings (I'm noticing a pattern here), reflections stop working near the edge of the screen. If you turn RT off, a lot of reflections stop working entirely. Mirrors turn into blackboards. This is not exactly a groundbreaking problem, games a decade or more ago could solve this. This game was made with Unreal Engine 4, the tech is there for multiple different kinds of non-raytraced reflections.The game ships with an outdated version of DLSS that you can easily swap and get better results. The player shouldn't need to do this.There's a crazy amount of fog, beyond ""we get it, it's Scotland"". We're talking PS1 Silent Hill levels of fog, and very often. Get a fog removal mod.Consider disabling about half of the HUD elements as well, for better immersion.Binding spells to buttons is BAD. What's even worse is that to make it slightly less bad is locked behind TALENT POINTS. Most talents improve your spells directly in the game world, but some of them only serve to make controls less horrible. Your character does not gain any power, you just get to pause less often to rebind your spell slots. You could suffer through full manual rebinds, save all those talent points, and your character would not be an iota less powerful, only you more annoyed.Broom controls scream lazy-remapped-controller-port. There's an entire vertical axis on your mouse that's not used, and it would solve nearly everything with it.On Hard, around level 30 or so, enemies become HP sponges. It's not any harder to defeat them, just pure tedium. You can (and should) make it faster by using plants and potions, but this gives you another form of tedium as you have to replenish them (which is on half-to-1 minute timers).The true final boss is the camera controls and a target lock bug. Your character moves differently when there's a target locked, but even if you have unlocked it, sometimes it only frees the camera but not movement. I have died multiple times to this alone. Unbind that button entirely (it's Caps Lock by default) to avoid this. You don't need target locks, even on Hard.Items are MMO-like random drops. This makes zero sense in a single-player game. I went through the entire story without the default school uniform skin dropping that everybody else is wearing, and I was frequently checking the clothes shop to see if it was selling an item with that skin regardless of stats.And now for the elephant in the room. The main story and the writing. Where do I even begin...It's as if a different team made the main story. The world has such an enormous level of care and detail in it that you would completely understand if the devs had to cut some corners, but they barely did.The main story is the opposite.The writing goes out of its way to save voice lines and not even acknowledge choices that you made. Not the basic ones, not the Earth-shattering monumental ones. Mass Effect 3 would be proud of the extent of choice-cancellation, if it was done through good writing. It wasn't.Your character is 100% unisex. Disagree to do something, you'll discuss the specifics of doing it within 7 seconds anyway. There are some actual cringe scenes where someone that you're supposedly on good terms with only talks about you in the most generic, distant terms .The only choice that seems to be acknowledged is .  Unforgivable curses? This is really unexpected, given the enormous amount of voice acting that went into random NPCs talking or random events playing out that are only there for world-building and you might even miss. There are conversations between students that you can simply walk past and ignore, that are way longer and better-written than what you get as the hero. Hell, NPCs have things to say if your character is wearing PJs!Many quests don't handle the objective being complete already. Have you done the thing that I want? Sorry, I still have to tell you these two lines about my now non-existent problem before I can get surprised that you took care of it right after.I can't shake the feeling that two different teams were involved here. This is a AAA game, the devs should've had the budget for a few dozen extra voice lines on top of the insane amount that's already present in the game, especially considering the size of the map that goes above and beyond what anyone would've expected. Games more than a decade ago could pull this off, and with full voice acting. We could've sacrificed a copy-paste Ubisoft open world village or two for this.Bonus: there's a PlayStation-exclusive quest. Screw that. Buy the game once it's been added to PC."

I generally don't write reviews before I finish the games, but want to make an exception. Firstly, it is absolutely gorgeous and is filled with a myriad of tiny little details that make up the whole atmosphere of the world. There are these amazing gargoyles that always say the funniest stuff as you dash past them, or suits of armor with their quirks (don't want to say more, because it's fun to discover all of these on your own). Apart from stunning views, the clothes look really well-made, the textures are great on anything (apart from maybe faces).The gameplay is A LOT OF fun. Whether it is puzzles, mini games or combat, it all feels smooth, polishes and a lot of fun, just like it should be. I have only encountered one bug, when the game crashed, but other than that, nothing game-breaking. For the first time in  recent years I felt like a bought a whole product, and not a half-assed unfinished mess.

Awesome hair, too!""Hogwarts Legacy offers players the opportunity to jump into the magical world of Harry Potter and create the perfect witch, or wizard, of their dreams with a decent set of curated presets, a good selection of character customization options, fitting styles suited to the wand slinging you are no doubt going to do, and honestly some of the best hair I have seen in a video game to date. While you don't get direct control over the sculpting of the features of your characters face, or body, the game offers enough choices to allow for some pretty unique and interesting characters regardless. The skin colors also don't, for some reason, offer very many lighter or paler options... although this may just be a trick of the lighting in character creation. The detail of the character model, and I assume the rest of the game as well, is also quite impressive and the visuals are an absolute treat. The character creation system does funnel you into a specific style which I believe makes total sense given both the world you are jumping into and the role you are assuming in the story being told. As for the specifics there are, as mentioned, a lot of great presets to pick from, both male and female body types, face shapes, skin color choices, a few starter pieces of eyewear, a massive selection of hair styles, textures, and colors that look absolutely fantastic, no facial hair (which kind of makes sense), some complexion and skin options, eye and eyebrow customization, and finally two voices with control of their pitch. (The pitch doesn't really work all that well as of right now) You also get to pick whether you are adressed as a witch or a wizard.That's it! Overall I am quite impressed by the lot of it and had a blast going through all the options. You can find my full character creation video linked below for my reactions and all the rest.

The open world is pretty large and absolutely beautiful. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series, you will most likely enjoy the game. The music and sound effects are very much like the movies and are one more step to making you think you're not in a video game. The combat, though not the flashiest, feels extremely fluid and satisfying. Side quests are actually fun and meaningful, just like in Red Dead Redemption 2. Exploration is extremely fun, and you are always coming across something new to explore and investigate. Although the NPCs are a bit dull in this game, unlike RDR2, I still highly recommend playing it."

The game truly captures the magic and excitement of attending the prestigious Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The attention to detail in recreating the iconic school is astonishing, and players will feel like they are really part of the world. The combat system is engaging, and the progression system is deep, allowing players to tailor their character to their own playstyle. Although there may be some open-world padding, it is outweighed by the overall enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of Harry Potter universe, Hogwarts Legacy is a must-play."

I got the game as a gift and after 30 hours into the game, I have to say, it is much more incredible than I have ever hoped for in my wildest dreams. Hardly found any bugs and all of those were only visual. The world is HUGE, gorgeous, detailed and you have tons of things to do and collect. The atmosphere is incredible and I cannot praise this game enough. The amount of love and care this game received is enormous. Thank you so much for bringing back the quality, that AAA names deserve.Good luck for the rest of the game releases this year, because for me Hogwarts Legacy holds the GOTY title for sure."

However that's it, the majority of main quest and side quest are quite boring, meaningless and repetitive. Last, the open world design is so old style, put it in few years back it is still good, but now, it feels so tired to see all kinds of marks in world map to tell you what to do and challenges listed  in backlog.Overall, I really want to give thumb up after first 5 hours game play, but after 35 hours playing now I decide to give thumb down, I cannot recommend the game only feels great in first chapter."

The game is incredibly beautiful and has brought every page of the books to life. It is both imaginative and creative and has been so very well done that I have been pretty much awestruck each time I've entered a new room. From the 'Kings Cross' to the cherry blossom in the greenroom observatory, you're taken on a journey that I truly don't want to end. Although the castle has been one of the highlights of this game, it's important to note that there is SO MUCH more to it.The map itself is huge and comes with a lot of detail and challenges. There are a lot of side quests, and its a game you really do need to grind to get anywhere. There's a good mix of enemies and it puts your skill to the test. I like that you contribute to your combat inventory rather than buying items at shops - i.e. the mixing and making of potions. I also like that each store is different, so you're not guaranteed the items you need, forcing you to explore the map a bit more.The game-play itself is fantastic. It is easily adaptable for anyone wanting to start playing but is not used to this style of game and has a fairly simple structure that can be learned quickly. If I could compare the mechanics and interface of this game, I'd say it comes pretty close to God of War for me (don't come for me about this because I do not care).Basically, if you've played God of War, you'll have a good understanding of the inventory, skills, and other features of this game and its layout because they feel similar, making it easier and more appealing. I would even say that smaller collectibles challenges also have a small resemblance to GoW (think the 10 mask artifacts, nornir chests, etc), but it feels subtle enough that I'm possibly one of the few people who feel this way.The customisation of characters is decent but please do not play it expecting to have an exact replica of yourself. This is not Sims. There is a good range of skin-tones, faces, and colours to choose from for hair/eyes, though it's not as important as you'd think as most of the game is spent looking at the back of your own head unless in a cut scene.So far the storyline is great and not what I expected which is even better. I am currently spending more of my time exploring and collecting as I am a treasure goblin that needs to collect things before I move on, however, so far it has been nothing short of great. I love that you can walk around freely, and that you can skip conversations, both great features. The music score is also really well done. I enjoy the idle exploration music which can bounce between sonatas, adding to the ambience.I have had a couple of issues with FPS drops, but overall it's not too bad and it doesn't last long, usually a couple seconds here and there. My specs are: AMD Ryzen 5 5600x 6-Core, 32GB, RTX 3070.Overall, if you're sitting on the fence about getting this game, I'd highly recommend you do. A lot of the time, hype trains do not live up to their expectation, but this has exceeded mine.10/10UPDATE: I have now clocked the game and have gotten all Steam achievements. For anyone who is grinding, it's a good challenge - difficult, but not overly hard, and the map indicates where you're missing things which is incredibly helpful. I enjoyed the little missions and the different places the game took me to, I especially liked seeing all of the common rooms. Without a DOUBT, Slytherin stays on top.Again, 200% recommend. I will be doing a second full play through as a male character - I have to admit, the female characters got done dirty, so I will only play as a male for the rest of my games, they look way better in outfits (and that's all I really ever grind for - outfits and trinkets).Enjoy the game!"
386,Zach_peterson4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zach_peterson4/,28,,0,18.3,February,18,186,0,1,"Let me begin by saying this... I do not hate HL. It was fine. But the review says ""Do you recommend this game?"" and to that I say no. The game is a Harry Potter fans wet dream. Obviously... But to someone like me who was just a casual fan of HP, it isn't all that great.I went in with the hope of a good RPG experience. Which it delivers in some aspects. I'll organize this in a what they did well vs wrong for simplicity sake.What is done well-------------------* Graphics - Visually stunning with my high end PC. * Story - Engaging and well driven. Enough said...* Full - The open world is not barren. There is stuff everywhere. And there is detail within the detail* The characters - Voice, emotion, animation, etc. It is all there. And it is done well.What is done wrong-------------------* The wallhax scanning thingy - I am somewhat of a collector when I play games so having this game full of them started out as a nice thing. Unfortunately it became a nightmare when I would have to span revelio ever 10 seconds because the bell noise got louder and then randomly quieter. It was like I was being constantly gaslit by picture on the wall that doesn't even look special at all. It became a tedious process of going to a new room and spamming scan until I found every collectible in the room. Then move to the next room and do the same. Horrible.* Broom mechanics - As a general rule of thumb I play all 3rd person games with a controller. So keep that in mind. I did not test on kbm. Having altitude control bound to the same stick that controls the camera is literal hell. Just map a face button to ascend and descend. Other games do this so much better it's insane.* Factions - What house will you pick? Well it doesn't matter. Aside from certain clothing items changing colors it really does not do much. You get a different location where your commons are. That is it. HUGE loss on replay-ability and HUGE loss on weight of the choice.* PvE variety - Not many types of fantasy enemies in my fantasy game. * Combat - I have seen other reviews compare the combat similar to the Arkham games. I see the comparison. But If I had to choose who does it better I would 9 times out of 10 choose Arkham. Spells are cool and combing them can sometimes be cool but it just gets old fast. Like imagine playing Elden Ring and the first weapon you get is RoB and just use that through the whole game. Don't let me yuck your yum tho. It you liked it, great! I just didn't.* 1st world problem - I played it on a 49in ultra-wide. If you have one. You know what I am about to say. The menu system has everything spread out and it takes an eternity to move the cursor around to equip stuff. Again if you know, you know. I almost considered just using my mouse in menu to speed things up. I am by no means expecting devs to cater to an audience of like 2 percent. But the ability to turn up the speed of the cursor would have been nice (if there is one, I could not find it)* Loot - The Destiny style loot system where your loot is based off of your armor at the time of opening has its critics and its fans. I am sure you can gauge where I stand based on where this part of the review is. I am sure I missed some good and bad but here is what I got. For the 2 people that did not buy the game on release, this should be a good metric to gauge on. If you are here for HP lore and stunning detail then pop off. But if you wanted a good RPG experience then you may have to look elsewhere. To anyone thinking this is some kind of review bomb, I hope you get help. Please read the full review b4 making your mind up on which political side I am taking."

Your choices impact nothing in the story or the characters, you will just get some different dialogue and also there aren't different builds in the game so this means that replayability is basically non-existent. A lot of assets are not done in the same style which makes some things feel disjointed. Its almost like they didnt have much of an art direction and each artist did as they pleased. The character creator has barely any options and its mainly presets. It is also unoptimised with a lot of stuttering and FPS drops and there are loading screens basically everywhere and asset pop-in even when installed on an NVMe SSD. There are some bugs as well, more noticeably voice pitch changes sound like a robot.There are some good things like the music and character design. Every NPC is voice acted with some fairly decent actors. The lightning and atmosphere is done really well and also its just really cool to move around the wizarding world and see such a large part of it.Overall I'm fairly disappointed. It could have been so much more than what we actually got and I feel like if another studio developed the game it would have been so much better. But it is a step in the right direction and hopefully we will get more games like this which get increasingly better by each release. If I were to give it a rating I would say its about 6.5/10."

I was not a big harry potter fan or a fan of the universe that we are in this game, but boy O boy, I spent hours and hours just collecting the various collectables before even taking a step towards the main quest.Puzzles are a joy to solve rather than a tedious task. The world is brimming with lore and its a rare site to see a character conversing with other NPCS in a RPG game. The Combat mechanics are a blast and its refreshing to use our wand and spell casting and using devastating combos to blast away our enemies is amazing. I found it refreshing to play as a one of the member of the other 3 houses than Gryffindor ( OFC I chose Gryffindor as my house xD )well optimised so far ( can confirm as I saw their gameplay ) ( it even runs on low preset with GPU like 1650 ) without stuttering or crashes.

It's not a game i'd recommend, even if you are a Harry Potter Fiend, though i can imagine HP fans will enjoy the game much more than most.Almost every mechanic in the game is executed in the most basic, functional form; no attempt is made to innovate, improve, or even make it unique to this game. If you have played any other games in the past 10 years, you have almost certainly experienced every mechanic this game has to offer, and likely a better executed version.In essence, entirely ignoring all of the controversy surrounding this game it is frankly not worth your time nor money; it has nothing to offer. Those speaking highly of its acclaim are either blinded by their love of the setting, or supporting it due to its controversial nature.Speaking with the controversy in mind the game should absolutely be avoided."

Some very salty activists are spoiling the plot because they can't stand how successful the game is, which is a touch odd given the game's seasoned with a pinch of wokeness, just enough NOT to ruin the overall taste, mind you.I digress, I pre-ordered this game solely based on how good 2002 Chamber of Secrets game was, I didn't even watch trailers not to spoil any of the fun for myself... and I'm happy to say this game is a gem! The gameplay's smooth and satisfying, story's quite interesting but first and foremost the world is full of puzzles, collectables and I keep on getting mind blown by its sheer vastness and detail. For me Hogwarts Legacy is up there with Witcher 3, I salute the developers for their dedication, ingenuity and care and J.K. Rowling for creating such an awesome world!P.S. Activists don't want you to have fun and might spoil it in the review section too!"

397,onionunion,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fingerspitting/,12,1,0,32.7,February,11,348,1,1,"Hard to believe it's been over 20 years since the first Harry Potter movie, and the fans have all grown up, made and forgot about their Myspaces, gone through their Doctor Who/Sherlock Holmes phases, made and deleted their tumblrs, glossed over Fantastic Beasts and watched Ladybird and Celine Sciamma's movies instead.Some of them got married, some got kids of their own and the simple pleasure of lusting over quirky British men doesn't do it anymore so the masses demand era-appropriate entertainment for a franchise that's been semidormant for a while. And era-appropriate entertainment it sure is.Hogwarts Legacy is a flavorless, unimmersive ESG hugbox wrapped in a Ubisoft carrot-dangling open world time-waster.The story and plot are beyond generic, the writing is dull and horribly underedited and you won't remember most of the cast in a week.The game's world is peppered all throughout with cynical corporate box-checking inclusivity, making this version of the 19th century Scotland demonstrate the kind of demographics even modern day Los Angeles can't boast.There's no curfew, no timetable-management, no mini-games or interesting activities. There are no real friendships or relationships outside of the dull main quest. Hogwarts students don't feel attraction or repulsion towards each other, they don't do anything and have no goals. What little depth they bothered to add to the rare side characters is all but negligible.The Houses -- seemingly one of the main themes of the entire franchise -- do nothing but determine the colors of your robes. There are no rivalries, no factions, no infighting, the House points mean nothing. The whole thing is all but discarded.Nothing you do or say matters, you can slam into an obstacle on a broom and nothing will happen, the loot is mind-numbingly boring and pointless. Learning the unforgivable curses, the inclusion of which is spoiled in advance by the overbearing UI, warrants no reaction from the Wizarding world. The combat bears no challenge, the time of day can be changed with the press of one button and most of the game, once again, is spent brainlessly following what the UI tells you to do rather than, you know, PLAYING it.Hogwarts Legacy is filled to the brim with signs of how little effort went into its open world, with extras spawning in and despawning as you rotate the camera, people floating in mid-air, people simply disappearing every night, none of the NPCs reacting to anything you do and all the other stuff that would be endlessly ridiculed all over the internet if it were any other franchise, but I guess it's okay when it's 'Arry Pottah."

I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!Here are the ingredients you will need!Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce."

Combat is basic magic casting, but the game has a great storyline and is an action fastasy roleplaying game. Quite feels like that Rockstar game ""Bully"" in terms of gameplay. Nicely created characters and you can fully customise your own. The game guides you quite a bit and linear at the start, but I guess that's to make it easier for younger players. You can choose your house in Hogwarts Legacy through a Sorting Hat quiz or manually pick (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff), which could lead to replay value and different experiences per house."

You also don't need any prior knowledge of the Harry Potter universe before starting the game. It can be enjoyed by anyone.There's a massive amount of content here. Tons of quests, people to talk to, areas to explore and things to collect. All beautifully presented both as a narrative and graphically. The game obviously borrows a lot from other games in the open world genre, but also introduces many new mechanics - all of them working exceptionally well.Personally, I've experienced a few technical issues, but tweaking the settings largely eliminated most of them. The option menu is great and gives you a lot of liberty, but your experience might differ.It's also becoming increasingly rare to play a game without any form of microtransactions, which makes it ironic that the game is published by Warner Brothers - one of the absolute worst offenders. Avalanche Software seem to have gotten complete creative control with this one however, and they've done a tremendous job.2023 already have some heavy hitters released, and I'm pretty sure Hogwarts Legacy will be fondly remembered for years to come."

You 100% Streisand effected me into this game, which is amazing may I add."
404,Bryan Adams,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WoCunt/,8,,1,85.8,March,1,56,0,1,"Unlike a lot of other people, I had absolutely no expectations for this game. Actually, that's not entirely true, I had 1 expectation which was that I wasn't going to play Hogwarts Legacy. And no, I didn't hold that expectation because I couldn't bear the thought of playing a game loosely based on the works of a bigot, it was due to the simple unavoidable fact that I do not care about Harry Potter. Despite watching every single 1 of the I don't know, 5? or so movies and reading half a book, I never truly got it. It's just a wee lad magicking around, presumably in his imagination as he needs to escape the hellscape of his living situation under his uncle's stairs. Add to this the LEGO Harry Potter games not being anywhere near as good (IN MY OPINION) as the excellent Star Wars and Indiana Jones games, I was left in no way hyped for this game, and yes I know this isn't a LEGO game, which honestly minus points. After apparently entering some sort of trance and adding this game to my wishlist and then watching a friend play through some of the early sections I decided to buy it. After owning the game for only 12 days, I already have over 60 hours and 100% of the achievements. You really wouldn't think I have a full time job. I know J.K Rowling is getting a lot of hate lately and rightfully so but thank ♥♥♥♥ she decided that Hogwarts would be in Scotland. This game really wouldn't be the same if it were in England, granted some areas of the country could be made to look pretty great, the world we get to explore throughout this game is truly spectacular and incredibly well designed. Also, having gone to school in England I know first hand that the character who's eyes we experience this game through would actually just have been bullied the entirety of their first year after joining school late. Actually, that would probably happen in Scotland as well, going to have to mark that down as a severe inaccuracy within this game. Why are all the students so nice to someone who shows up a few years late to school and generally just nails everything? Every time I wake up in the dorm room, I am expecting another black eye or maybe a lewd drawing on my forehead, but no.After reading through the list of achievements, I expected I would need to complain about needing to reach the map room on all 4 houses, however as this only added an extra 3 hours of gametime, I didn't mind doing it, plus I got to do more Herbology lessons. Whilst on the topic of achievements, although I have no qualms with replaying the early levels, I really wish I didn't have to live through all of the Merlin Trials. Not because I found them too difficult, but due to the gall of Merlin forcing me to sit through 95 unskippable cutscenes. What a prick that man was, and truth be told I'm glad he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dead. Even when I am stood on top of the centre of his little leaf outline, I do not appear in the cutscene, how self-important do you have to be? The world doesn't revolve around you Merlin, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless pile of bones, it revolves around the sun, maybe if you spent more time learning science instead of being a ♥♥♥♥ you might have been able to notice that no one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ likes you. At least I am only forced to see him being made out of leaves, because if I had to see his presumably hideous face NINETY FIVE times, I probably wouldn't have completed the game without prying out my eyes. Seriously, this guy makes me want an entire 9 hour storyline about the adventures of Peeves and Ignatia Wildsmith. That would be infinitely more enjoyable than hearing ""Not so tricky after all, Merlin"" one more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time.I don't know if it was hidden within the digital deluxe version that I didn't pay for or maybe it is in an upcoming DLC, but I couldn't seem to find Dogwarts. Did this get cut or I just missed it? I thought it would be in the room of requirement but alas, 'twas only Deek and that would ruin my immersion.The lack of quidditch didn't really phase me too much, because again, I don't care about Harry Potter.  Besides, the story and various side quests give you enough of an opportunity to become the best student at just about everything else so adding another thing to the list of activities the playable character naturally excels at would probably be overkill. I mean, you already get to beat Professor Ronen at Summoner's Court so there's not really a higher peak in that regard. The guy is practically a god, and I wholeheartedly believe that he let me win that game just to boost my pride. Obviously I am not saying that Ronen is truly some omnipotent being, I just mean he is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cracked at grabbing balls from across a big plank while in competition with children.The story reminded me of the Mark Twain novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which for the uneducated is a fantastic read, and the subject of a wonderful 1949 film starring Bing Crosby. Now I'm not saying that the writers of this game copied from this book in any way, but their decision to make Merlin the primary villain of the game is a tad suspicious and should really be investigated as to where they came up with that idea. My word is Merlin a colossal waste of space. I hope he is not resting in peace but instead burning in hell like the evil piece of ♥♥♥♥ he is. I cannot stress this enough, NINETY FIVE UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES. It really puts Ranrok's crimes into perspective, I mean, what did the guy even do? Want a little bit more power so he could presumably enslave humanity? Big deal, were the machines truly the enemy in The Matrix Resurrections or was it the mere existence of the movie? At least I could skip that by never watching it, which isn't an option when it comes to Merlin's moon-sized ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ego. I cannot believe when seeing the first Merlin trial completion I thought ""huh, that was pretty cool"" because after Merlin trial number 72 I was ready to shoot the ♥♥♥♥ like he shot Hank Martin in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.That prick aside, the characters in this game are very well written as well as the interactions the playable character has with each of them. It is a shame that at times you are forced into more linear storytelling as early on you can keep your experience with Fig a secret. Later in the game the character just blurts out to everyone that will listen that they can see and use ancient magic which completely negates the option of hiding this information from people in the first place. What if I don't want to trust everyone in Hogwarts?Now onto one of the best aspects of this game, and no I am not referring to Professor Garlick, but of course the music beautifully composed by Chuck E. Myers, Peter Murray and J Scott Rakozy. You don't really need to know that they were influenced by the work of John Williams, because of course they were, he's the best. Just kidding, of course I'm talking about Professor Garlick. It really is a shame that this game isn't more like Bully with you regularly attending classes to improve your grades, but instead you attend probably under 10 classes in total with a handful of additional assignments. I think it would add to the enjoyment of the game to feature more time in the classroom but primarily because it would mean attending more Herbology classes and as a result getting more time with Professor Garlick. I don't think I really need to go into detail as to why getting to spend more time in that classroom would be a bonus. If the sequel to this game isn't the story of you playing the replacement for Professor Fig, and you get to spend the entire game attempting to seduce Professor Garlick, I will be severely disappointed. There are already far too many stories in the Wizarding World focusing on kids.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, almost as much as I enjoyed writing this review and would have to place it firmly in my top 7 games on Steam. But seriously, ♥♥♥♥ Merlin and everything he stood for."

When the gameplay was first revealed last year it almost seemed too good to be true... But, I am so happy to report that everything that was showcased is present in the final product, and even then it feels like a only a tip of the iceberg and whilst it does have some minor flaws, the majority of the game is amazing. I'm over 30 hours in, yet to beat the main story, and every single minute/hour that has passed by has been fun - not once have I felt the game become tedious or boring.Hogwarts itself is masterfully created and the amount of love, attention to detail and care that has been soaked into it is a huge accomplishment. Even if you were to get the game with the intention of  to explore Hogwarts, I would wager that it'd be money well spent. The castle is oozing atmosphere, magic and life. Every corridor has it's own thing going on, whether it be students chatting away or messing with spells, instruments playing to themselves, or peeves being a nuisance; it's full of secrets and puzzles and hundreds of collectables that provides some lore. You've got the main story, side quests, classes, assignments and more to partake in, as well as the huge world full of hamlets, camps, dungeons, caves - the list goes on & this is a game where you can be distracted and kept busy for a very long time. The music, sound effects and ambience is some of the best I've ever heard in a game; it's so enchanting! As you progress through the game you start to unlock new things such as flying, the room of requirement, the vivarium & more. The room of requirement is a heavily-customisable place where you can brew your own potions and grow your own plants. It can be decorated and changed almost entirely, from decorating the walls, floor and ceiling, to placing furniture, statues, rugs, paintings and much more. The Vivarium, similar to the Room of Requirement can be customised and it's a place where you can bring rescued beasts that roam the world. You feed, play and tend to their needs, and in exchange receive resources that allow you to upgrade your gear. There is just so much to do in Hogwarts Legacy that even after playing for 30 hours, I still feel like I am only just scratching the surface. The game has lived up to it's high expectation and has delivered on every promise that was set-forth. This is a labour love, and it's also a love letter to fans of Harry Potter but even if you are not a fan, you can still expect to have a wonderful time.  If you enjoy Harry Potter:  and If you don't enjoy Harry Potter: Edit: Just finished the main story and loved it. Easily my GOTY."

This game does a fantastic job of depicting Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and a solid job with its combat and execution of the story, but falls short in other areas.I spent hours walking around the castle, looking at all the finer details and failing to uncover all its mysteries and puzzles. It is a beautiful masterpiece worth touring in its own right. I also spent time visiting all the shops in Hogsmeade and enjoying the spectacle. Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are the main strengths of this game world, with the rest of the world being no different than anything you might find in another open-world game. Once you leave these two areas, things get bland fast.It's a good, solid game but after beating the main story I am not motivated to continue, and I certainly have no interest in replaying from scratch. The gameplay is a bit shallow and there isn't a reason to dig deep into the systems. But it can still be fun for a bit."

No matter what you buy, you are supporting some sort of unethical practice. So by their own logic, these people shouldn't buy anything at all. In the end, they are just hypocrites who like to hold others to impossibly high ethical standards that they themselves don't follow. I find it even weirder that people are willing to tear down a game that has nothing to do with JK except that they're using her famous IP... something many companies have done over the last decade or so. Why so willing to f*ck over the game devs just because of the IP they're using? JK has no hand in the game whatsoever and is barely getting royalties from it, only because it's her IP/Brand. If she had a hand in the game, then that would be more understandable, but that's not the case. This is the equivalent to showing up to a birthday party and calling everyone at the party a bigot just because the party is Harry Potter themed. Now that.. well, all that is out of the way. I absolutely love this game with every fiber of my being - it's everything I hoped it would be and more. The world is vast and the castle alone feels huge, I can't even count the amount of times I'd get distracted just simply exploring the castle and being in absolute awe by the design of it all. I love the way they've handled collecting items and solving puzzles, the collectibles aren't just a simple go here and find this, they can be behind puzzles and encourage exploration, which I've gladly enjoyed doing. Combat may seem simplistic compared to other modern games but hey, I found it to be pretty enjoyable and I have yet to tire of it. The game allows for a level of customization I honestly didn't expect but I appreciate all the same. Your Hogwarts house determines what unique area of the castle you live in, you can transmogrify your gear with a good amount of options you collect and you have a personal space to customize and decorate!Everything feels smooth and honestly it plays pretty well, I will say there have been a lot of lighting bugs here and there, I'd enter a bright, beautiful room only for it to feel like someone turned the sun off. It is a MASSIVE game, the general main story takes 20-30 hours to complete and that isn't counting collectibles or side quests, so many collectibles, I've been playing for 11 hours now and I have yet to unlock my broom LOL. The whole world feels alive, ghosts flying around, students having conversations, everything around you is doing something. It's been a while since I've played something that felt so fleshed out. I could sing praises on this game all day long but all in all I wholeheartedly recommend, whether you're a huge HP fan or simply an RPG fan, chef kisses all around."

My review is not about Rowling's political takes or any controversy, but about the state of the gameplay experience.10/10So, let me talk about the game. It is incredible. I am not, and never have been, a fan of the Harry Potter series. This is not for any reason in particular, I was always just too busy obsessing over Tolkien's universe as a kid. Every time I tried to get into the books I failed to do so and went to another series. This does not mean I can deny the sheer brilliance of the world-building and comfort it provided many other children, however. This is now a comfort I know myself.This game has made me love Hogwarts. it has gotten me into something I always thought I hated. I have given it the true chance I never gave the books (but now will). It makes me feel so free and so cozy. I have never experienced a more immersive game in which I play as a witch and utilise magic so wonderfully. The school is warm and welcoming, the characters are well-designed and voiced, and the creatures are all so unique. I am immediately immersed as I open the game and load into the school.From class ""assignments"" to serious story quests, there is always something to do in terms of tasks. Outside from this, I find myself spending time flying around on my broom for no reason other than I love the way it feels, or exploring the Forbidden Forest just to see how lively and beautiful the world is. Jumping mushrooms, singing flowers, and rolling birds. I have never before experienced such a magical game. Sometimes, it makes me feel like a witch as intended. Other times, I escape the school grounds for a while and feel like a fairy.The school itself is also so whimsical, from speaking portraits to poltergeists and ghosts that feel as though they are just like any other people (or at worst, annoying) rather than frightening. As someone dipping into Rowling's universe for the first time really, I am blown away by just how comforting everything is even when taking elements that are otherwise portrayed as ""scary"" or negative. The game takes elements from some of my favourite genres, too, allowing you to do so many things. These include botany, potion-brewing, and DECORATING A HUGE SPACE! I spent ages playing with furniture, colours, and wallpapers last night after unlocking my unique room. Seriously, I keep discovering more and MORE to do in the game. I see myself spending hundreds of hours in it.As for soundtrack, it is as beautiful as the scenery. The writing is, too. Everything is. In terms of inclusion, it marks every box. I am a woman who is attracted to the same sex and running into Nora Treadwell was absolutely heart-warming. An older lesbian couple who is passionate about archaeology and history?! Precious...Please play this game. Please do not let the opinions of chronic Internet dwellers take this magical experience away from you by convincing you that somehow your purchase funds any sort of bigotry. And if you are those people, touch grass. I have already had multiple people block me on this platform just for playing the game. It is utterly ridiculous how such a wholesome experience is being twisted into something so sinister when it should not be."

It makes you feel like you're in the midst of a Harry Potter movie.Another great aspect of the game is the lovely characters that you meet and interact with.

It's fun to engage with them, learn their stories, and explore their backgrounds.Furthermore, the deep exploration of the game world is a standout feature. There is always something new to discover, whether it's a secret passage or a hidden treasure. The game offers a rich and immersive world that makes it easy to lose track of time.There are a variety of fun mini-games that provide a break from the main quest. Lastly, the intense combat in the game is both challenging and rewarding. Battles require strategy, timing, and good use of spells. It adds an exciting element to the game and keeps you on your toes.Overall, this game is a must-play for any Harry Potter fan.

I've spent the better portion of an hour there on the first day of release for us that pre-purchase the Deluxe Addition. It seems to be flooded with Racists & Transgender Haters. You would be hard pressed to find anyone that just wants to talk about the game in general without one of those  morons hijacking the thread. Needless to say, I haven't returned there.The game is enchanting, and wonderfully done. I have no issues once I figured out what graphic settings gives me the best bang for my money without loosing the immersion. My settings are Ultra, but I leave  disabled until some sort of Optimization patch comes along, the graphics are gorgeous enough without it, and my pictures speak for themselves. The game also supports NVidia's Insel Photo Mode.Getting around is easy enough for me, and there are several ways to do it, but I'll let you discover them for yourself. The voice acting is top notch in my opinion, and the characters are both charming, and engaging. Cut-scenes give the game more depth, and you'll get to know some of your friends, and acquaintances this way. The game is a story, so try to live it.I find this game is best played in a dark, or dimly lit room. You'll see why once you play it. Try to leave the real world behind you once you close the door to your room. So give the game a chance without any forum BS to sway your mind.If you come here to spread your Hate, Flame & Troll, I'll quickly delete your comments, and block you. I could care less how many Hilarious & Jester awards your childish mind gives me. They spend just a well on goodies as any other award. So if you want to waste them on me... go for it!I play games for my enjoyment, and nobody else's. That's the way I believe they should be played regardless of Race, or Gender haters trying to influence yours, and my enjoyment. It's just a game."

Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.And have you noticed that only Europe seems to have a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911."

The rougher spots of the game are certainly in the performance department- although this varies from pc build to pc build from what i have seen; as of typing this i'm installing the day 1 patch, but i have been playing since the 7th during early access.Story i can't really comment on too much since i'm admittedly still quite early into the game; there is definitely this vibe of allowing you to go off the beaten path and just do what you want at your own pacing, so that's what i have done, i've spent most of my time exploring and trying to get into places i'm not allowed. (naughty Slytherin student goals)This is without question a game designed for the fan of the Wizarding world in mind; but I feel like the average gamer who loves open world games and collection/trophy hunters will also really find some enjoyment.I am very much looking forward to seeing what the devs have planned for this game post-launch, but for now, i still have SO frickin much to do in this game."

Hogwarts and Hogsmeade areas are made with love and attention. But after 30 hours, the game becomes more repetitive and boring (Merlin's trials, dungeons, clearing camps and monsters stays the same). The open world is a redundant part of this game. Also, the creation of potions was disappointing part because you do not participate in this process (a good example of how to do this more interesting is potions craft in Kingdom Come Deliverance).I hope developers will understand their mistakes and maybe will improve it in the future DLCs.P.S. Just want to say thank you for interesting additional quests with your future friends in-game, they are one of the best parts of this game"

438,zingmars,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zingmars/,4,,1,61.7,February,23,"1,379",0,1,"Not a huge Harry Potter fan, but I suppose it's okay overall.The first thing is that the graphics look fairly decent. Performance wise though - it does push your hardware quite a bit. I tried playing it on my old machine (GTX 970, i5-4690, 16GB DDR3) and it was playable - but only at 720p (w/ FSR2 upscaling it to 1080p) on low settings, and you only got 30fps (20fps in some intensive places like Hogwarts and Hogsmeade). If you're used to consoles it might be playable, but overall you'll need a somewhat recent PC to play this.What impressed me most was Hogwarts itself. The place genuinely feels like a huge labyrinth, which is what I would expect from a magical castle. There's always some secret somewhere... Which brings to what I feel is the game's biggest weakness. The world is designed as your average open world Ubisoft game. The map is pretty big, but it's also filled with time wasters - dumb puzzles (that repeat), collectables, the occasional enemy camp that has the same enemies every other camp has. Oh, what's this? Yet another Merlin trial? Yeah nah, I'll pass. The game also does try to push you to re-explore places (i.e. with the lockpicking skill upgrades), though you quickly realise there's no point in that because all you're getting is just samey RNG loot.Story wise it's about what you would expect from modern AAA. Some quests are decent , some are just not that memorable. The main story line is... okay, but it's just not that praiseworthy. The funniest thing to me, and probably to many others, is how you can be an edgy, unforgivable-curse casting monster and nobody will really care about it. There's a huge disconnect between what you are (a 15-year old student) and what you do (a mass murderer, a poacher that ""saves"" the animals (wink-wink)). I know it's just the game being a game, but it does feel a bit weird at times. You can literally cast the worst unforgivable curses in front of your teachers and they'll be like ""please don't kthx"".Overall it's a beautiful game, that apparently does an okay job at bringing the world of Harry Potter to life. It held my interest long enough for me to beat it, so I guess I can recommend it. If you're into Harry Potter you'll certainly enjoy the world, though I'm not sure if that demographic will like the collect-a-thon parts."
439,iGotMoxy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/igotmoxy/,5,,1,79.7,February,16,615,0,1,"If you'd have told me ten years ago that the guys that produced Rage 2 (and the arkham games, and mad max, but that doesn't fit the sentiment i'm trying to create here) created a subdivision for Harry Potter related games and hired out the group that developed thehunter: Call of the Wild to make an open world story driven collectathon set in the wizarding world... i'd have told you that game would probably be a mess.SURPRISINGLY... I only have three real complaints. Pacing of the story had moments where I could feel the padding. A sence of urgency is placed on the Main Story and then someone just says ""yeah, but not yet"" and your forced to go do another trial.Second Complaint is Audio. Some of the story moments were recorded with live recordings. Like someone just took a cellphone outside and just recorded the sounds of a backyard, or a fireplace. no adjustment of the levels no detail work. Just loud and jarring. Couple that with cleanly edited voice work from talented professionals in a booth and it makes for an awkward listening experience. Then some of the voices you could hear where modulation was being applied or no editing happened at all. an example; NPC is giving me a quest, our characters are outdoors, I can hear the echo from the NPC's voice as if it were happening in a closed space. Like the sound you hear if you recorded your voice in a room with no dampening on the walls and a wood floor. Lastly... Lockpicking. I'm a wizard that can summon lighting and instantly kill trolls, reduce the size of giant spiders to be able to step on them, or turn a living being into an exploding barrel and throw them into another living being to cause an explosion that harms everything around them... but I have to go through a mini game to pick locks. I get it... but like... let wizards do wizard things and leave the tedium somewhere else eh?That's it. The only things I really would give this game grief over. and I didn't even mind the pacing that much because the combat was FUN. I didn't care how the main story got padded out because I knew they were going to send me into another fun fight. I enjoyed going out and picking up Revelio pages because the world is interesting. Some of the puzzles, the Depulso rooms especially, were a joy to try and figure out.I wouldn't call this a GOTY by any means, it follows a lot of the same tropes you'd expect from this genre, and does fall into some of the same pitfalls because of those tropes, but Avalanche did an amazing job for a developer that isn't known for this genre."

From my childhood to adulthood. This game is deep and mysterious, capturing the brightest and darkest elements from the world of Hogwarts. The direction the developers have taken represents a revival of the Harry Potter series - one that is led by fans who understand and love the world and can expand it in a meaningful and authentic way, much like Dave Feloni's & the Andor team did for Star Wars.As a lifelong fan of the Harry Potter books and movies, I was enchanted by the magical world and as a young child frightened by the darker moments in the series, such as the Chamber of Secrets. The combat in Hogwarts Legacy is truly fantastic and only improves as you progress through the game. I have only experienced a glimpse, but I am already imagining how my late-game dark wizard character will play, drawing inspiration from the best moments in the movies. The combat is fast-paced and aggressive, reminiscent of the cafe ambush scene and the battle against the Death Eaters in the Order of the Phoenix. It's clearly inspired by games like Batman: Arkham and Shadow of War, with quick strikes, deflects, and parries that are highly satisfying. On top of this strong foundation, there is an extensive array of spells that allow you to dominate the battlefield in creative ways, whether you choose to incinerate your enemies, batter them with kinetic force, or strike them down with dark magic. I have unlocked the ability to modify my spells with ""ancient magic"", and I envision a build in the late game where I can curse my enemies, disarm them with expelliarmus, and then strike them all down with avada kedavra as the greatest dark wizard of the age. These modifications to basic spells (which are already enjoyable to combine) will make you feel like you're playing out the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort in the Ministry.As a fan of RPG's, including Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and The Witcher (though I was disappointed by Cyberpunk's lack of impactful player decisions), I appreciate morally ambiguous stories. Hogwarts Legacy offers constant opportunities for player choice, some subtle and others more significant. There are many small choices that affect your relationships with other characters, who you can accompany on quests, and your reputation in the game. For example, winning a practice duel in class can earn you respect and admiration, while losing might result in disdain. Although I am still early in the game, I have already encountered fleshed-out NPCs, each with their own agendas and personalities. I recently completed a quest where a Slytherin girl tried to manipulate me into retrieving something for her from a dangerous location. I agreed, but only in exchange for a reward, which earned her respect and surprise. Alternatively, you could have completed the task out of kindness (or to gain her favor) or kept the item for yourself.I could continue to sing the praises of this game, but I think it's clear that there is a great deal of love and care put into it by the developers. The setting is rich and immersive, and the graphics are gorgeous and customizable. I am eager to see what other surprises the game has in store, and I look forward to future DLC. It's worth noting that, in 2023, it is becoming increasingly common for games to be incomplete at launch (such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Darktide), but so far, Hogwarts Legacy feels complete and well-rounded. I highly recommend it to fans of the Harry Potter franchise and to RPG enthusiasts alike."

Despite all the controversy, we as gamers have to appreciate the time and effort that went into this masterpiece. Beginning character customization does fall a bit short with few choices and not a lot of room to customize your features, but by far the story makes up for it all. You gather more cosmetics throughout the game and you can change how you look no matter how far into the story you are. I was also able to switch between keyboard and controller without any issues at all. There are a few bugs in the game, but nothing too noticeable on my end. I could say so much more about how great this game is so far, but it's better if you check it out yourself. I highly recommend this game to any who grew up with the nostalgic of the Wizarding world or a big fan of fantasy RPG.Well, I'm back to defense against the dark arts class now. Gotta get my fellow Slytherin more points so we can get that House Cup. :)"

467,LunaKBN,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154127554/,8,,1,81.6,February,28,110,0,1,"I spent most of my free time playing this game since its release. The combat is fun, there are plenty of combos to make use of while fighting, but spells could use some rework (mostly Alohomora with its absolutely pointless minigame) and seeing the same types of enemies half a minute within walking from one place to the next - or even quicker while flying - gets boring quickly.The world itself is beautiful and well-made, yet it still has a certain emptiness to it. There is some dialogue between the NPCs found in it, but they repeat the same thing over and over and over again without reacting to anything the main character achieves. It is also supposed to be an RPG, yet there are usually only two dialogue choices (not counting questions before accepting a quest) one for a goody two-shoes and another for a rude character. The problem is, even the choice that is worded rudely before picking sounds as if the first option was picked. They are practically the same. That is my biggest problem with the game. Nothing matters, nothing reacts. You can't talk to NPCs, not even students inside Hogwarts unless they give some sort of fetch-quest or collection quest. I usually play good characters, so it is not an issue for me, but for those that want evil or grey choices during quests will be disappointed. I remember one (1!) out of dozens of quests, where my choice mattered. Where is the RPG in that?Don't even get me started on the collections. Other than the field guides that contain lore for the world, all others are completely useless and are only there to lengthen the playtime. So are the trials that are all over the world and so easy and repetitive that it makes you think what Merlin thought of his fellow students' mental capabilities when he thought them up. He certainly had a lot of time on his hands, though...And the story. What is there to say about the story? It's... there? I guess. I really like this game, but there is nothing in the main story that I am completely in awe of. It's all just mediocre and shallow. The twist about one of the characters was very predictable and most of the side-quests are as forgettable as the NPCs that gave them. The ""companions"" are not so bad, but they could have made it so that they could be dragged along on adventures whenever. And the main character. The ""Fifth-year"" is a completely blank, soulless character with no background, no personality, no explanation as to why they start their studies in their fifth year. It's never explained why, only the fact that they are not the only ones that this happened to. That's just lazy writing if you ask me. The main antagonist's reason for hating wizardkind is... well, mentioned in a sidequest. The last boss fight was good at least. Not much of a challenge over level 30, but still good. There should have been more bosses like that one. Overall I'd still say this game is worth a playthrough, but I doubt I would start another after finally getting 100% on my first."

Ходишь по замку и деревням, трогаешь всякие летающие топоры, кнопки, животных, разрушенные стауи, говорящие цветы, летающие мётлы, живые картины, поющие кусты, котов, чужие сундуки и т.п. Всё звучит, шевелится и радует глаз. Именно в звук много атмосферы уходит, но не сказать что он тут какой-то особенный. Нормальный звук.С контроллера играть удобно. Мало тактильной отдачи.  Ужаснейшее управление полётами (с клавомыши тоже ужасное).  Мне гораздо удобнее с контроллера, чем с мышью.На Ultrawide опять не всё хорошо. Катсцены с рамочкам.

But I was looking forward to this because of the developer Avalanche. This is indeed a VERY excellent open-world adventure, with *tons* of well designed magic. Pros: The atmosphere of everything is very magical. Magic spells are very well designed and make for some fun puzzles and very well balanced for combat.Combat itself is also very well designed, where every spell has a function depending on the enemy or situation. Not super hard, perhaps a bit too easy on Normal (when compared to fex God of War, which has a lot harder boss fights). I would probably recommend Hard on your playthrough.The main story is well written and engaging. You always want to know what happens next.Cons: There were some major performance issues on launch (3080 Ti here), should get better with patches.Some of the facial and gesture animations look a bit underwhelming (when for example compared to God of War or Heavy Rain).A lot of the puzzles were a bit too easy to figure out.9/10"

I had high expectations but it honestly surpassed that.  There is the main plot but lots of side quests. (I'm a sides quest gal).  The area is fairly large.  I've played it for 12 hours so far and only barely touched on the map.  I'm still constantly getting lost in Hogwarts as you can explore every nook and cranny.  It brings the enviroments of the movie to the game, but also takes some things from the books (such as Peeves) to fill in the gaps.  I was surprised how you can wander everywhere.  Go from green house to kitchen, to library to classrooms to bathrooms.  I think the moving stairs was clever how they did it so it didnt impede progress.  The ability to fly far and wide is amazing.  Going from Hogsmead to landing on one of the bridges inside Hogwarts to stroll around the castle feels seamless to me.  I have yet to get into the beasts portion of the game as I've been doing side quests and exploring.I found the world building amazing.  I love the tiny details of paintings moving, statues watching you, house elves cleaning and disappearing.  Listening to conversations that dont affect the plot but dont sound out of place, and the amount of work in the BG NPCs that you cant interact with, they have nothing to do with the story, but living their lives and you get a peek into it with their interactions. I will say the combat was initially too challenging for me.  I found trying to juggle all the keys (going from numbers to ctrl, space, mouse and arrows) while trying to watch for attacks and counter spells a bit overwhelming.  They let you change the difficulty setting but not so much allow you to rebind the keys, which would be a nice QOL.There are a few minor things so far, glitches, and also not explaining how the clothing/gear (how to change its appearance) was lacking, but it doesnt bother the game play at all. I know a lot of people do not want to support the game because of politics and peer pressure.  I respect that.  I myself was gifted this game, but if I wasn't I probably would've still purchased it.  It really does the world of Harry Potter justice, and the team at Avalanche clearly love the source material and did it justice."

The world is beautifully designed but feels very hollow after a few hours due to the lack of story and consequence. As others have mentioned the main character is overpowered, which wouldn't bother me too much as I tend to be more of a casual player, except there is just no depth of story to the game or even interesting puzzles to compensate for it. On sale it might be worth a few hours of ""wee I'm a witch/wizard"" but the game falls pretty flat after that. I am having a hard time even remaining interested in the story after unlocking most of the spells. There is absolutely no point to most of the side quests or tasks other than experience farming and as mentioned the main character is already overpowered so what is the point... The Merlin trials are extremely repetitive and don't offer much benefit. I hardly noticed any difference in broom performance after completing the upgrades. It all just falls very flat for me.Performance has been pretty crap as well. I happened to upgrade PCs midway through playing: On my old GTX 980 rig the game ran smoothly, but textures would frequently fail to load causing the graphics to look PS2 era. I recently upgraded to a new RTX 3080 setup and the graphics look great, but I am still noticing a bit of stuttering regardless of my settings.Aesthetics - A+Story - MehGameplay - very meh"
480,Nox,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sarnox/,4,,1,142.9,February,11,"1,668",1,1,"Amazing - This game has a bit of something for everyone. Open world exploration, lots of collectibles, secret & puzzle solving, engaging spell slinging fights, customizable build load outs based on player preferences, immersive story, full voice acting with a ton of attention to detail to make the surroundings feel alive, and a lot more I'm sure I'm forgetting.In most games that have attempted such a broad scope of design when integrating many systems and lore from source material together, I would have expected the pieces to break at the seams, but somehow this game still delivers a cohesive, fun experience and stays true to the source material. Not only does it nod to many smaller references from the books and movies, but expands on the world building - setting the stage for potentially more cannon material in the Wizarding World.My favorite discovery so far has been a brewing pot in the last stall in one of the lavatories, one of many small bits of fun you'll encounter while exploring the castle. Even for those unfamiliar with the world, there is a ton to bite into. If you're a fan of exploration and open world RPGs with many side quests and mini games, you'll thoroughly enjoy this game.The first HP game ever released was very well received, but followed a myriad of half baked sequels that each drifted further away from the original vision. Hogwart's Legacy has brought back the original intent into an era that made it technically feasible to support such an ambitious vision. I can't wait to see what they end up doing for DLCs or a sequel."

488,inDe_eD,https://steamcommunity.com/id/therealpcjake/,4,,1,64.5,February,12,326,0,1,"Yes. Especially if you like Harry Potter universe. Worth playingWhen this game was announced, I was immediately excited. I am a big fan of the Harry Potter franchise, and although I'm aware this takes place in a completely different time, and is more-so a spinoff / extended universe / lore game, it still had my attention. The game was delayed a few times, but I'm okay with that if it means a more polished product. I pre-ordered it and played it for the 72 hours early access for deluxe edition pre-order buyers. I am not finished with the game after ~25 hours (I am about 55% total completion as of writing this review), but I am definitely enjoying my time and have little to no complaints. Also, figured I would mention that I am very experienced with this style of game, and have likely completed a lot more than the average person may have in those hours. I am focusing side / exploration missions first, story after.I absolutely love the combat in this game. It is intense, and there is so much going on but it doesn't overwhelm you or require you to be an expert at games. There are 'ultimates' (in a sense, they aren't actually called that in-game), and you can even interact with the environment and control some of the environment while battling enemies as well, to keep you entertained.The exploration is reminiscent to that of the first 3 Harry Potter games on PC, allowing you to walk all through the castle (which is absolutely gigantic, by the way), as well as outside of Hogwarts grounds, up in the mountains and hills. Outside, you can also fly around on your broom (after a certain point early in the game), making it that much better.There are lots of missions and collectables and things to unlock throughout the game. This is nothing new per se, as it is just like the Far Cry games, however I am a completionist, and love to try and finish every single thing. Some of the more mundane collectables are also useful because they can unlock extra outfit overrides and outfit perks after collecting certain amounts of them.By all means, the story isn't a crazy, 'new' story. It follows a certain trope () but it isn't annoying or horribly boring like Borderlands 3 was (for me). So it's good, but it's nothing we haven't  seen before.There are levels, skills (referred to as 'talents'), perks and stats for your clothing pieces (same idea as Cyberpunk), upgrades to the broom, upgrades to clothing, clothing rarities / qualities, etc.The graphics are great! It's not groundbreaking, but definitely great to look at, inside the castle especially. It is all I ever wanted when I was a kid, but unfortunately that was not possible back then.Choosing your own House at Hogwarts does have some effect on your gameplay. Many missions and side missions are different, each house has their own common room, and things can play out slightly differently. It's no 'Detroit Become Human', but there was at least some attempt, which I like to see.Choosing your wand length, wood, inner core, your house, patronus, and all that was cool to do. Even though it doesn't really affect anything, your wand you don't really often see up close, it's still fun for those who are very into the franchise.As mentioned before, lots of the side missions and exploration tasks can get repetitive in nature, though they are all physically different, the idea is the same. Doesn't bother me, but could bother some. If you've played Far Cry, it's the same deal. For me, I couldn't care less about this. However, I can't deny it; the mouth animations when someone is speaking is  a few years behind.You may not experience any, however I have experienced things such as falling through the world randomly,  and almost getting stuck in certain areas in the highlands while trying to get into areas on my broom, but it's mostly my fault because I was trying to cheese the game. I have not encountered any softlock issues, any horrible game-breaking bugs, just some minor issues, none of which directly affected me really at all.As an example, in shops, where you can sell your clothing pieces (basically your armour), if you have like 20 pieces you want to sell, you can't select all, or even just click once to sell an item. They have a preventative measure in place so that you don't accidentally sell something you want to keep (because you can't buy things back), meaning I have to hold left-click on each item (could be upwards of 30 items if I have a full inventory) for about 1.5s. Not that big of a deal, but if they allowed you to buy-back or even do a sell-all or multi-select, it'd be a lot better. Another example is the character creation screen. Who in the world thought that a slider (with no images for reference) for hair colour was a good idea?! You can't simply pick a color, or have a gradient bar to see what colour you're selecting. You have to sit there and scroll through a slider bar with about 25 different colours and just try to remember which one you liked most. You can see the preview on your character but good luck remember what specific selection on the line was the one you wanted. There are a few other small issues like that, mostly based on preference and my playstyle, but in my own opinion I think there are a few overlooked UI / developer choice issues that could be made a lot better. .Do I recommend it? Yes! It is fun, entertaining, though nothing groundbreaking. It is a  win for Harry Potter fans, as they haven't had a game in like 10 years and the last 3 entries were horrendously bad. I am a huge fan of the first 3 games, as I grew up with those, and this is like a modern take on them, and I could not be happier. The game isn't as demanding as some in terms of computer power, which is another bonus."

The main story was underwhelming and could have been better but I wouldn't take it away from the whole experience of the game as it definitely surprised me. If there's any DLC down the line, I would certainly look forward to indulging in that. 9/10."
490,Johnny-Drama,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024997635/,6,,1,24.5,February,13,41,0,1,"I cannot recommend this game enough. Every time I feel like I've seen the best thing in this game's world, it keeps surprising me. As a fan of this series, the DEVELOPERS have absolutely outdone themselves. The moment I walked into the Room of Requirement, it was as if they had pulled the visions from my mind. It was perfect. The attention to detail from the dining room to Hogsmeade are beyond words. What's even better are the house common rooms, two of which we never saw in the movies. My wife is playing Ravenclaw and WOW that common room's details are astounding.The story is intriguing, the battle system is awesome and feels like the quick, fast-paced action we saw in the movies. Flying is a bit wonky, but you do get better. Overall, I was not expecting this game to be as BIG as it is, the world map is massive. It's fun to play, rewarding to search and discover secrets, it really is everything a Potter fan would want.For those slamming the game because of JK Rowling, look, she's filthy rich, whether you buy this game or not, it won't affect her life at all. On the flip side, there are literally hundreds of people who worked over 5 years to make this game a dream come true. You buying the game says thank you to them, keeps them employed and rewards their hard work.On top of that the devs even included a trans-character in the game for good measure and a proper ""EFF"" you to JK Rowling. So don't trash this game in review bombs because of her, stand with it and the inclusion of a trans character, but more importantly, support the developers for making a game so accurate to the world, that blows the mind."

Since you have missed the first four years you are assigned a mentor to bring you up to speed on what you will need to know. On your way to Hogwarts, you take a flying carriage, not the train. You find that you can see ancient magic. Then your party is attacked by a dragon. You escape using a port key that lands you in Gringots…and then things start to get interesting.Hogwarts Legacy is an open world game set in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, about 100 years prior to Harry's birth. This means that while knowing the Harry Potter lore is helpful, but not essential. You start off by creating your character. Your appearance can be either male or female. The game does have a number of NPCs with same sex relationships, if that bothers you.One thing the diehard fan will have issues with is the fast travel floo system. This is due to a number of things, you require floo powder to use the floo system and the floo system connects chimneys. Once you get out of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade the floo system connections are frequently attached to fireplaces, but not the whole system. However you don't need to be near a floo end point to use the floo system, you can use it anywhere in the game, except for the few times it is locked out due to the story or if you're inside an instance.You will have to complete tasks so that the professors will teach you additional spells. To learn a spell you have to follow a path pressing certain keys or buttons to increase the speed of your token. Fortunately you only need to do this one time as the game would be quite difficult if you had to do it during combat. After you learn a spell you can pin it to your spell bar. The spell bar holds four spells and you can have access to up to four spell bars. The only spell this does not hold true for is the spell to open locks, you must play a mini game every time. The mini game is not difficult, but it is rather annoying when you're doing it for the 40th time.Combat is hard. Especially since you are normally outnumbered, you versus however many enemies there are. You are taught this early on in the dueling club. Where you are given the option to fight with a friend. Foolishly I thought that not having the friend would make it a fair fight, nope same fight with no help, or something else for them to shoot at. As you progress through the game enemies will protect themselves with different protections which require a specific spell class to break, and you only have four to work with. I played with a keyboard and mouse, I do not know if a gamepad would be easier or harder. Later on it was easier for me as my keyboard allows me to create macro keys, so I can easily switch between a larger variety of spells. The problem is that with so many spells you have a choice of cast or move, you can't do both with a keyboard and mouse.The graphics are beautiful, you feel like you're living in a movie. The world is huge. You are not simply stuck in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. You have the surrounding villages and countryside to explore.Every launch the game has to prepare the shaders, depending on your computer this make be quick, 30 seconds to a minute for me, or longer.There is plenty to do in the game. Collect gear, better gear means you'll have an easier time of things. You can upgrade your gear by adding additional traits to it. You have your standard quests and lots of side quests. There are five different categories of challenges: combat, quests, exploration, field guide pages, and room of requirement. In side of the different challenge categories are a number of different challenge types. As you complete challenges you will gain additional gear, appearances, and upgrades.You can do everything a wizard does. Grow magical plants to fight for you or as potion ingredients. Collect and breed magical creatures who will supply you with the things you will need to upgrade and enchant your gear.As you level you will earn talent points that you can use to customize your character to suit your play style.The more I played this game the more it struck me as an MMO, without other people.

498,Sammy the Wizard,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SammyP6/,4,,1,63.5,February,27,"1,105",0,1,"After over 60 hours with Hogwarts Legacy, I have beaten the main story, done all the side quests, and found many of the collectibles. It may not be the RPG they marketed it as, but it is still a fantastic game. With no real class selection, choices that matter, or build variety to find, it's hard to call Hogwarts Legacy an RPG, even if it has a few light RPG elements. Unfortunately, these days it seems that any game with even the slightest hint of an RPG element is marketed as an RPG and Hogwarts Legacy does manage to be a fantastic open world action adventure game, so I cannot say I am overly disappointed or surprised.At it’s core, Hogwarts Legacy is a very standard open world action adventure game. If you are not a fan of AAA open world games, you’re probably not going to like this. It doesn’t really do much that is unique or different other than being set in a really cool fantasy world with an amazing castle and executing the formula very well. It does have performance issues, especially in Hogwarts and Hogsmead, but they were not enough to ruin my enjoyment. When the game is not having a lag attack, it runs pretty good.After a decently long and super cool introduction, you enter Hogwarts as a 5th year student. The castle really does feel magical and maze like. Between the early game quests that take place in the castle and all the collectibles and loot scattered about, I spent the majority of my first 10 hours inside the castle. There really is just that much to see and do inside the castle, but this did lead to a few balance issues. Early game I was swapping out ever single piece of gear 3 to 5 times between each combat encounter, and when I finally met my first boss, I was way over levelled.I really appreciate that each piece of gear you get is saved as a skin that you can apply to any piece of gear of the same type. There is a pretty good variety of skins, although most of the shirts seem to have a very blue colour pallet, maybe because that is my house colours. Like most games with character customization, you pretty much end up standing out in a crowd. You do have a pair of default house robes that you can wear, but that’s boring. It would be nice to see NPCs change their clothes, especially when not in Hogwarts, or when the seasons change. It is a little odd being the only one wearing a scarf and gloves during the winter.Something I find really impressive is how the game handles loading. Every door seems to be a sometimes not so hidden loading screen. For the most part doors just swing open as you walk into them, making for a completely seamless experience while traversing the world, including Hogwarts castle itself. Sometimes the game does not load quick enough and a small loading circle appears by the door handle. This never lasts for more than a few seconds, so when it works, its amazing, and when it doesn’t, it’s not even a minor annoyance. Combine this with the fact that you can use your broom from courtyards inside the castle and directly fly to areas outside the castle, and the game feels open in a way that other open world games don’t. For some reason, there are some outdoor areas of Hogwarts, and the entire village of Hogsmead, where you can not use your broom.The game consists of doing main quests, which often take you to very cool locations, side quests, which are fairly standard, and assignments for your professors, which teach you new spells. The main quests and side quests are usually pretty interesting, although some side quests don’t even try to hide the fact that they are fetch quests. The assignments do often feel like fetch quests with no real story attached. You do gain new spells from assignments, so at least you get a good reward for doing them. The game is not going to win any awards for writing, but it is good enough to keep my interested.The game does a good job of slowly introducing you to new mechanics so that you never feel overwhelmed, but at times it does feel like things are introduced too slowly. Most of the mechanics are pretty neat, but many of them feel they could have a bit more polish. Broom flying is very nice, even if the controls are not the most intuitive. The Room of Requirements is super cool, even if what they call green is more of a teal and placing items is a bit awkward. The most notable bad mechanic is lock picking. I really do not like the lock picking mini game in this game. It is not explained well, its not fun, its animations are much longer than they need to be, and it feels out of place. I’m using magic to unlock the lock, not picking it, so why is there a lock picking mini game?The combat, on the other hand, is great. This is some of the best combat I’ve seen from a game that is not a shooter. You have a good amount of spell variety. Spells feel impactful and powerful, although mid game enemies do get a bit tanky. Blocking and dodging feels good. I do wish you could have more than 4 spells on your spell bar at a time. It’s not a huge deal to switch spell bars with my mouse wheel, but with so many easily accessible unused keys on my keyboard, it would be nice if I could use some of them. It would also be nice if the Room of Requirement spells were on a dedicated spell bar that only shows up inside upon entering so that they do not take up space on your regular spell bar.Outside Hogwarts, you have a fairly standard open world with collectibles, towns, puzzles, loot, caves, bandit camps, etc. I would say the world is a bit above average, but I also really like fantasy and fantasy environments. The world is not the biggest world I’ve ever seen, but it does not need to be. I would much rather have a small and dense world than a large and sparse one. Hogwarts Legacy is decently dense and the open world activities are fun and varied enough. I thought I would not do them all, but then I checked and noticed I only had a small handful left, so I ended up finishing them off.Something I find very odd is that many of the ruins and bandit camps have mini puzzles to get their loot. These puzzles are very simple and consist of things like moving some objects and doing a bit of parkour. The thing I find most strange is that you're a wizard with a flying broom. Most of the time these puzzles can be entirely ignored if you just take out your broom and fly to the loot. It just feels very odd that they would spend time making all of thees tiny puzzles that can easily be avoided. It feels like they forgot that flying was a thing.In my playtime I have not had many bugs, unless you count lag and frame dips to be bugs. The worst bug was when I randomly fell through the world. Then I remembered I was a wizard with a magical broom, so I flew back up and continued as if nothing had happened. I’ve also had a few floating objects that were clearly bugs and not part of the games magic, and a texture issues.Hogwarts Legacy may not be anything groundbreaking, but it is a fantastic game and other than performance issues, my only complaints are very nit-picky, like the Room of Requirements not having a proper green or lock picking being very annoying. The story is interesting, the characters are decent, the world is truly magical, the music is great, and the combat is fun. There is not a lot more you could ask for."

500,AdventjX,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adventjx/,41,2,1,82.6,February,13,452,0,1,"Honestly, the best game I've played in 2023 so far and easy contender for GOTY. When looking at exploration and progression, it might even surpass Elden Ring - and that says a LOT about this game.: As of writing this review, I've completed 54% of in-game challenges + 14/45 achievements. Still have many mechanics to unlock and enjoying every moment of it without being bored.Whoever designed the spell combat in this game deserves a raise. This is Harry Potter done right and truth be told, a game of this caliber should have been made when the Harry Potter hype was at its peak about a decade ago! But better late than never. While combat takes a backseat in this game (as hard as that is to believe; to be elaborated in the next section ), Hogwarts Legacy took every well-done combat system that exists in this day and age of action-adventure games (ie. Assassin's Creed, Arkham series, Dark Souls, etc.) and mashed it into a solid system with its own identity that's difficult to get tired of. My only gripe, if I were to nitpick, is the limitations caused by the spell pages. It's hard to mix up many spells as I would like to and combat may be become clunky, but perhaps a sequel - if any - will provide more options.As mentioned above, even though combat was discussed first, it takes a backseat in this game. Exploration is where this game truly shines and I found myself spending hours and hours just running around Hogwarts/Hogsmeade and doing quests & chores without fighting a single enemy. The idea of unlocking different mechanics and spells in this game that can be creatively utilized not only in combat but in exploration, combined with a progression system designed to help you take things gradually without being overwhelmed, makes every quest and step enjoyable. All in all, here's the best way to put it: I haven't even unlocked the endgame spells and I WANT to put it off so it feels like I'm becoming a truly powerful wizard through every quest and step I take. This game helps you to enjoy the process, not just seek results.Glamour/Transmog (single player or MMOs) is such a simple yet delicate mechanic that can make or break a game. And Hogwarts Legacy hit it out of the ballpark. Not much more to be said. Pick up a gear, have that design unlocked, equip it as your appearance at any time. Do the same for your wand and broom? Couldn't ask for any more than that.Merlin Trials and such may become repetitive, but not to the point of considering them tedious. The Room of Requirement and its vast design potential really caught me off guard and is a welcome addition to the wizard experience. After having experienced Island Sanctuary recently in FF14, the concept of taming animals for resources to upgrade gear and using conjuration stations to grow plants and brew potions was the icing on the cake to an already amazing game.Just like watching a movie, each quest had me engaged to the story and progression and had me waiting for what's coming next. Truly well-written main story and side quests, particularly for anyone like myself playing this game for the nostalgia alone.Haven't confirmed any sources for the Quidditch DLC, but it must be on its way right? It'll be free RIGHT?!Options are slightly lacking in the versatility department, but not a major complaint considering the nature of the game. For an adventure game of this caliber, the options they provided were ENOUGH, but not entirely plentiful as one might expect.With a solid combination of combat + exploration + side content, the trifecta for Hogwarts Legacy is a complete enjoyable experience with replayability potential. Add nostalgia to the formula, and it's the perfect game to play in 2023. Nowadays, that's a hard combination to master. The first game in a while that I pre-ordered for full price and zero regrets. PS: I don't support pre-orders but this game was just too hype lol"

It feels like a love letter to the Harry Potter Universe and there are so many little details that make the world feel alive. Combat is punchy and fun. The visuals are gorgeous and nostalgic. If you enjoy intensely fun magic combat and exploring a fleshed-out fantasy world that's overloaded with the mystical and magical, you'll love this game. If you're already a huge Harry Potter fan, this game was made for you.Now, I cannot say the game is in a perfect state right now, as that'd be dishonest. I received the early access copy as I'd pre-ordered the Deluxe edition. My computer specs are:- RTX 3060- i5-12600k- 16 GB 3600 MHz DDR4 RAM- NVMEWith those specs, playing at Ultra settings at 1080p with DLSS Quality and no Raytracing, the game has been playing at 75 fps (my monitor's native refresh rate) with dips into the 60s here and there. At High settings, my fps was pretty darn steady. As many others have mentioned, the PC version is plagued by stuttering issues. Even tweaking my settings down to medium or lower does not solve them. Hopefully a day one patch solves this. It's really my only complaint.Despite that, though, I've been very much enjoying my time with Hogwarts Legacy. Once some patches roll out for PC, I think my rating would bump up from an 8/10 to a 10/10. I'll update my review if my opinion changes as I continue through the story.Now, if you excuse me, this Hufflepuff needs to get back to her classes ;)"
507,CATAWAKE,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fuckcatawake/,10,2,0,103.0,March,16,242,0,1,"Skip to the end for the summary if you don't feel like reading all of this.With Hogwarts Legacy, you really won't find much to do with Hogwarts itself, despite the fact that you play as a student, nearly all of the game itself takes place far away from Hogwarts. Nearly all of the side quests that you will recieve is either some kind of ""collect the thing"" or ""fight this guy"", over on the other side of the map. Quests in Hogwarts are usually just classes, which feels lame considering how impressive the level design actually is for the castle. There are passageways and secret areas everywhere, unique puzzles exclusive to the castle, you'll even find a guy walking sideways on the wall.Interesting how your character doesn't become super jacked at the end of it from running on all those stairs. There are three student questlines, one for Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Seems they spent their budget on the Ravenclaw line pasting the same 5 merlin trials over and over again. All three are just them being overly trusting with their life story, and when you finish one of their quests, they never let you go on to the next one, not even giving a locked quest or anything. ""So basically we have this insane plan and we'll need to find the place and find out the truth at the bottom but meh i'll send you an owl or something"". Though I will say Sebastians storyline was more interesting and had much more depth than the main storyline.Main storyline itself is pretty lame. Goblins want equality and freedom from oppression and your job is to go around on a rampage and kill them. Wow I'm such a hero! There's also a bunch of ""keeper trials"" which are actually fleshed out dungeons with mixes of combat and puzzles, even an actual boss fight, but... why? None of this information through these quests and cutscenes actually matters because the goal of the game is to kill a guy. There is no changes in plot, other than .The unisex main character is just a Mary Sue. Everything they do is right, perfect, they're good at everything, they get exclusive right to the Room of Requirement, instantly a master at wandwork and spells, planting, making potions, et cetera. They also just don't STOP TALKING EVER! Every location, even a pile of rocks will have some form of pointless dialogue from the character.Even in the last cutscene for the House Cup awards, there is no recognition for the house you chose, theres little difference at all in the game apart from one quest in the first two hours of the game. In all the bloat they recorded for the NPC's and the main character, you'd think they would mention something about you being in the house you are in. Nope. In fact, they don't even announce the name of your house when you win the House cup, they say ""This students house"", while you stand there awkwardly in the hall when everyone else is sitting down. What a terrible wrap up. I played the game on the hardest difficulty, and so should you, as the game really isn't that hard to begin with, you'll even have   potions that make it even easier. Bosses themselves have like two attacks, and dodging is way more fun than parrying with protego. I don't really use combos that often bc the enemies die quick anyways, bu the shields enemies have are pretty annoying, because this guy has a yellow circle around him I have to make sure I have a slot or two dedicated to spells that can get through that, and even when the guy hasn't fully got up from the attack, they'll always re-protego and now its time to either put another purple spell in, or wait and dodge before you can hit him again. Combat is boring and tedious. Also ♥♥♥♥ ashwinder/poacher ranger spell spam.There is no consequence for using ""unforgivable"" spells, like mind control, stun, and insta-death. Even characters won't say any relevant things about it other than ""I didn't like that"". In the books and movies, people who use those spells are sent to Azkaban for the rest of their lives, but not you! Even the people still treat you like a glorious hero, despite being a genocidal maniac no better than the enemies.The world is scattered with map markers and camps and merlin trials and spider nests and blah blah blah. There is no filter option in the map to hide all the stupid treasure ""dungeons"". The world is scattered with bloat, copy pasted merlin trials which there are 95 of, and all have an unskippable identical cutscene at the end of them. Why?I feel like the game would breathe much better if they dropped the open world, and only focused on Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and maybe a couple close surroundings like the forbidden forest. I like getting all achievements in a game before I close the book on it, and boy was this painful.Hogwarts Legacy is yet another open world game filled with bloat and pointless fetch quests. Most puzzle solutions are just given to you by main character self-talk, and most of them you'll find identical replicas everywhere. If you'd like to play as a student, seek elsewhere because 99% of the game is outside of the castle in random stretched out areas. Little about this game is actually fun, and performance wise, the game is choppy and drops frames quite frequently, even with the reccomended specs and 32 GB of RAM. Combat is annoying and easy, and nothing you do, or who you are matters.This is a rushed game, and you shouldn't buy it."

They did a fantastic job piecing together bit and pieces of the castle we've seen (described) in various media, while adding brand new areas that fit seamlessly within the lore.

517,Mlemlom,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dootdooter/,52,1,0,27.5,February,11,337,0,1,"Overall, this game won't do anything you haven't seen before already, mechanically.  I'd say the actual weakest part of the game is the actual gameplay, although it is entertaining enough to carry itself.  Most of the enjoyment I've had so far has been from exploration, which is something I look forward to in everything I play.The character customization is not what I'd consider good, although it's probably acceptable for most.  There seems to be a wide variety of different clothing options that you find regularly, and (having tested on two different saves) the loot is randomized.  The shaders on the hair are absolutely awful, and despite spending quite a while sifting through them and looking at them in different lighting environments, never found anything that looked good.  There seems to be something... wrong with many of the faces and eyes, particularly the girls, to me.The story (which I am not far into) seems intriguing enough, typical fantasy spiel, as you might imagine for the genre.  Many of the character voices are somewhat unusual, even jarring, at times.  When not over-acting, there's a serious ""robotic"" voice / pitch issue for both the player character and NPCs at times.  The lip syncing is quite unnatural and distracted me at times, as well as the strange empty eyes that most NPCs have.The combat is what I'd consider ""rock, paper, scissors"" combat.  You need to cast the right type of spell, generally noted by its colour, to break certain defenses which also share the colour of the spell type that must break them.  While it is not difficult even on hard difficulty, it can be very fast-paced and reaction-heavy when fighting multiple enemies.  That alone makes the combat pretty engaging, but there is no real depth or complexity I can note beyond this.This title is certainly not worth the listing price and if you are dead set on getting it, wait for sales... or perhaps pursue a more morally acceptable avenue of acquisition.  I can certainly see it becoming a micro-transaction hell in the future.It is not a terrible game and is more good than bad, on those terms.  Nostalgia will certainly be a winning factor for many fans of the series, and I suspect that is a large catalyst for its seemingly overall success.  Suffice to say, the thick controversy over this title does it absolutely no favours.  The way some of the more sensitive subjects are handled in-game feels like something between a haphazardly forced afterthought and a poor joke that leaves the entire room uncomfortable.  The more I progress through the game, the more I find myself thinking these instances were not mistakes.Speaking purely from a reviewer's standpoint on a game, I cannot see it being worth the price.  It's not ground-breaking, it's not amazing, and does nothing new for the open world genre.  It's not terrible, but it's not ""overwhelmingly"" and ""positively"" good, to me, at least.  As it stands now I cannot really recommend it, especially concerning the price and what you get for the content, not counting moral / ethical reasons.I'm sure nobody has come to the review section to hear my personal feelings on the controversies involved, so all I'll say is:Some of the behaviors I have seen absolutely disgust me.  Y'all need to do better.Be better."

The entire world feels like a bland Assassins Creed game with a million pointless completionist tasks that bare no significance to anything or anyone. Ironically, there's no sense of magic in this game at all. Attend Hogwarts for a whopping 8 hours of school-time and watch cutscenes so you don't have to experience the tedium of class life, fly slowly and with great limitation to exotic locations such as Hill and Rocks, or Paddock, perhaps the illustrious NPC Village of static dialogue. Visit and explore Hogsmeade; In under 10 minutes because there's literally nothing to do there except buy a few things. Murder hundreds of humans and goblins along the way, whilst bitterly murmuring about the diabolical things these witches and wizards are planning. Evil deeds that can only be halted and disrupted by the angelic magic prodigy that is the stout and dependable ""Shlemhrimhrer,"" named aptly because companies don't know how to be PC without being absurd. I don't think the people who raved on about and rated this game so highly have ever played an actual decent open world game. Or any RPG."

I was thoroughly entertained for numerous hours by the game's excellent balance of exploration, magic, and adventure. One of the things I loved about the game was the attention to detail that was put into recreating the world of Harry Potter. It was truly immersive and exciting to experience the Hogwarts castle, Quidditch games, and magical animals all come to life. Also, I liked how the character evolved along the course of the game into a powerful witch with special spells and powers.However, while the game is amazing in many ways, it does suffer from optimization issues. I faced stuttering and low fps throughout the game, despite having a decent PC that should have been able to handle it. This did detract from the overall experience, as it was frustrating to have the game lag and stutter during crucial moments.Despite the optimization issues, I still highly recommend the game to anyone who is a fan of the Harry Potter franchise, or anyone who enjoys immersive RPG games. The game's attention to detail, engaging storyline, and magical world make it an experience that is not to be missed."

And no one who is either of those qualities touched it. It's a sick thing in the media to try and paint anything negatively and they weave tales that suit whatever narrative. SO PLEASE DO NOT take those smear articles into consideration. It's not fair to the game creators at all who DESERVE the love for this game it has warranted. That aside, While the character customization is VERY lacking, and the characters look mostly 30 yrs old once in the game, and wanting to play a feminine pretty wizard or witch is nigh impossible due to the bad character customization, and how it maps the face in game (you always look like you are on drugs and have a stomach ache while smiling literally all the time) the game is still great. It's the best game I've played since Witcher 3, and I am thankful no early access on development, they did the RIGHT thing and waited until they could produce a COMPLETE product, without taking everyone's money for a semi finished product and hype. The game is beautiful, the story is interesting but not overwhelming. The things you can do are setting the bar for future games. I have played 20ish hours and only 20% through the game. It is refreshing to return to a time of polished, unrushed, complete games. I can't give it a 10 because of the characters looking so bad and the lighting on the hair making it look mostly bad if not darker tones, but this is a solid 9/10 from me."

The ""relations quest"" design is interesting and engaging, provides fun activities to do besides the main quest, and hands you twists and turns that will keep you immersed in every story told throughout the game. 40 hours in, and I'm only done with 50% of the game. The level of spell craft and combo craft in this game is insane. So many combinations to choose from, and allowing you to mix and match spells to make your gameplay experience unique to you.There are builds showing up online, but I have found that there is no ""best"" or ""right way"" to get/be strong. With the gear options, every build or spell-focused wizard/witch can reach the top damage numbers with some hard work and dedication.Do I recommend this game? ABSOLUTELY. Avalanche did an amazing job with this game, as it's exactly what I needed.For anyone who is review bombing this game due to J.K. Rowling. Yes, there are royalties that she receives. Yes, she was brought in to help with the game on a few occasions. But, the royalties are small, and the help she garnered was castle/world detail and that is all.

It doesn't excel at anything it attempts, the story is mediocre with no emotional moments or pay-offs, the characters are uninteresting and as black and white as they can be, the story is very predictable. You have your typical villain and his lackeys, who are bad and yourself and your friends , who are jolly good. There is no depth to anyone. Your choices don't matter in the slightest, the only difference is you're either incredibly well mannered and compassionate, or slightly sassy. The open world is nice and shiny, but in a true Ubisoft fashion it is filled with countless repetitive, uninteresting tasks, which you have to do a hundred times over. Every 'treasure vault' is just a chest with a generic item. You sell 99 % of your items anyway, the tiers of equipment are useless, the mechanic of hidden attributes, which you have to uncover in the Room of requirement, is redundant. The lockpicking system is atrocious. The amount of craftable items is small and the game is easy enough to not really have a need of them anyway. Little events in the world such as a suit of armor destroying another one for humming happened every single time I went through the area. Because of that you can't appreciate it as a little secret/detail if you see it for the twentieth time. Facial animations are pretty bad. The puzzles are not diverse enough. Combat can be fun at times, but the variety of enemies is so small and they only have 1-3 attacks per enemy type. The order in which you do things doesn't influence any dialogue options, finding a fetch quest related item before accepting the quest isn't met with an alternative voice line 'Oh, I already found it', instead you have to go to the same place and pick the item up again to hand it over. The lack of thought that such situations could happen is what differentiates a great game from a bad one, it's all about the little details and they just couldn't pull it off here. Using unforgivable curses results in no consequences for you. Hogwarts legacy was all hype, it benefited greatly from nostalgia, but failed to deliver anything but a mediocre and forgettable experience, which offers zero incentive for a second playthrough."

Probably would have recomended it if it didn't crash every 4-30 minutes now. The first ~9 hours were fine, but now it crashes a lot. It feels like it wants to do the world justice, which it does in a lot of cases. But it absolutely doesn't in others.As said by others you don't feel like a Hogwarts student at all. Lessons are very much on the sideline, and only done to get access to some spells and potions. The 'Forbidden Forest' is forbidden, but for some reason you can just go wander into it without any problems. You just have to deal with some spiders and poachers from time to time. The world is gorgeous and Hogwarts itself is massive and you can really get lost there (if you dont use the quest tracker).At the same time it, Hogwarts and to a lesser extend the rest of the world, feels very empty. Yes there are other students and Peeves is doing his usual business but you can barely interact with it. Most of the interaction is meaningless and does not recieve any reaction from others in the same room. You can blast a firespell into a group of students and nothing happens. This makes the game really feel 'on rails'. In the 'Forbidden Forest' you encounter a lot of creatures who do not react to your presence at all! Yesterday I strolled passed a group of Centaurs and they didn't seem to notice me at all. The stuff that is there is very polished and works very well. The combat is fun and engaging. But after a while the things that you cannot do start to bother you. For instance, you can't jump over the railing of a staircase, there are invisible walls everywhere. What year is this? Let me fall to my death by jumping over a railing if I want to. Or at least make the wall look like it is some magic barrier, as if it is a magic protection. Now it just feels lazy.The RPG aspects are a bit shallow (maybe I am spoiled by Skyrim). I don't feel like I have a lot of choice in how to build my character. The gear feels very generic, the talents don't feel like impactfull choices. Just pick the talents for the spells that you use because it straight up upgrades them. I wish the options for combat were more varried. Now it is basically just blast spells. I think a lot more could have been done with potions, herbology, conjuration, transfiguration etc.The more I am thinking about it the more flaws I start to see. I am starting to sound like a salty old man (probably not too far from the truth ;)). But it feels like a game with so much wasted potential! Would probably be a 6.5/10 for me if it wasn't for all the crashes."

The combat was challenging and very fun with the limited spells that I knew early on. After a few hours of exploring I found that while the castle and surrounding area are very vibrant and alive, there is zero immersion. You're not a Hogwarts student, you're a protagonist who lives in a talking castle. You don't get to actually do anything in the castle. You can't sit at your house table and eat breakfast in the great hall. You don't receive/lose house points for anything. You don't get to participate in any classes, instead you watch a cutscene and get some random quest, which will reward you with a spell. You can't PLAY QUIDDITCH. Every character in the game talks ♥♥♥♥ about the headmaster for not letting them play quidditch because Avalanche even knows that it should already be in the game. Why do you start as a fifth-year? Imagine getting a game like this with seven years of being a Hogwarts student. Instead you're a fifth year and that year never ends, you just stop going to classes.The end of the game was the most disappointing for two reasons.1. As I got towards the end of the game I started to get excited again because all of the quests are preparing you for and leading to your O.W.L.'s. I thought at least I'll get to do this interactive quest to test my knowledge of the HP universe and of the game that I just spent 70 hours on. It's a cutscene. And your character isn't even in it. You don't get grades. All it means is that there are only side quests left to do. 2. All of your choices leading up to the ending mean nothing. It doesn't matter if you learned unforgivable curses and tortured people in front of your teacher, or if you refused to learn any dark magic. You just pick which ending you want and watch a cutscene. If you pick the ""bad"" ending there are no consequences and nobody knows that you made that choice. Maybe my expectations were too high. I'm a massive Harry Potter fan. I listen to the audiobooks when I drive, when I'm falling asleep, when I'm walking my dog, all the time. I've read/listened to the books at least 15 times but I honestly don't know how many its been at this point. I understand why so many people absolutely love this game because it is fun, but it's lacking so much that I don't think I'll be able to force myself into playing again just to see a different common room."
556,Colonel Patrick Sanders,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ColonelPatrickSanders/,5,,1,71.5,February,22,767,2,1,"Hogwarts Legacy… Where to start? As one of many it has always been my dream to get a good Wizarding World game. I'm a huge fan of the Wizarding World and Harry Potter. From the books, to the movies and everything around it. And with a smile on my face I can say, this game does not disappoint.I went into the game with little expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. Is it perfect? Well no, but it’s everything I ever wanted from a Wizarding World game. Let’s first dive into the good stuff. The best part of this game is easily the world, and most importantly Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. Both are filled with details, things to explore and references to the movies and books. Of the whole world, Hogwarts itself is easily the best. I even dare to say it’s one off, if not the best location ever made in a video game. Everything is just right. It is full of secrets, puzzles, lore, details and things to explore, it’s correct in comparison to the movies and books and it feels alive. It’s just.. Perfect. The beautifully crafted world, together with great graphics and excellent sound design made exploring everything a joy. One of the games where I did not use fast travel the whole time. I would also like to give a little shout out to the devs for introducing seasonal changes. There’s not many Single player games out there that change the ambiance and decoration of the world based on the season.What the game also does right, is distributing content evenly across the length of the campaign/game. Even 20 hours into the game you’re still unlocking new mechanics, spells and locations. This made it not too overwhelming and constantly gave me a feeling there was still so much to do and dive into. I was also pleasantly surprised by how deep some of these (side)mechanics are. Even stuff that can be ignored completely like potion brewing, beast taming etc can go quite in depth.Combat is also much better than I expected. It never becomes repetitive, is challenging at times and enemies having various shields that need to be broken by specific types of spells, together with the player constantly learning new spells keeps it fresh.I’m also really happy they decided to put in something for everyone. From exploration to combat to flying on your broom to beast taming, to potion brewing and even building your room of requirement and various puzzles. There’s something for everyone to like.Now on to the less good points. The main story is rather weak if you ask me. Some side quests/stories are more interesting then the main story itself, and personally for me it just didn’t click. The missions you do are fun, and the locations you visit are great but the overarching story just didn’t do it to me. I also had trouble fitting it in the Wizarding World because the whole plot around which the story revolves has never been mentioned in any of the books/movies or whatever, and the way it’s proposed here, makes me feel it’s important and special enough to have been mentioned.As I said before, the world itself is well-made and fun to explore, and there is something to see around every corner, but for people who don’t care about 100% completion a big part of it is not interesting at all. I personally think they did well by introducing various puzzles, chests and enemy camps around the map. They don’t feel as repetitive as some other open world games, but in the end it is filler content. They should’ve made the main story take place a bit more around the map, but instead it was rather focussed on certain area’s.Also performance is, at the moment of writing, unstable on PC. I have a high end PC, and even though I run the game on 140fps+ most of the time, at times I get frame drops to like 20fps. Especially during combat this is really annoying and it breaks the immersion while exploring.I do think that if you strip the Wizarding World setting from the game, it’s still a good game, but nothing to write home about and in certain aspects quite average. The wizarding world setting and the attention to detail really is what makes this game.Overall, I would highly recommend this game. It’s not perfect but I think that everyone that even remotely likes the wizarding world/harry potter universe will absolutely love this game. Whether you’re a die hard fan, or just like the movies, you will love the references and attention to detail. The world they created, and especially Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are absolutely mind-blowing and set a new bar for developers."

570,Scardigne,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199474049312/,6,,1,78.9,February,14,3,1,1,"PLUG -MOD TO CHANGE TRANS BARMAID TO A MALE - Currently working on a new nexus mod to change the trans barmaid to a male which will be found on the nexus within a weeks time.Don't worry, your kind gestures and awards are saifu with me, I have 21 years in the game design art industry and would love to know your thoughts, as always hope you enjoy the rest of my published mods and I hope you all look forward to the future hogwarts mods.REVIEW -There's still a Potter-esque main story of universe-shaking stakes (one which your fully customisable transfer student inevitably finds themselves at the centre of) but, in a game with over 100 sidequests and dozens more leisurely pastimes, Legacy shines brightest when it leans into emulating the complete Hogwarts experience, sorting hat and all.That's largely thanks to the clear affection (and budget) which Avalanche has poured into its creation of the game's open world, which includes the entire school grounds and surrounding areas such as Hogsmeade and the Forbidden Forest. Whether travelling by foot, broomstick, or Hippogriff, Hogwarts Legacy is an indulgent treat of fantastical tourism for longtime Potterheads, marred only by occasional loading stutters and texture pop-ins that can snap you out of its immersive spell.Much of that fan service will inevitably be lost on series newcomers, of course, but even for those less versed in the wizarding world, Hogwarts Legacy has something to offer. Combat, in particular, successfully adapts the source material's spellcasting into a satisfying battle system that's as much a challenge to your reflexes and tactical skills as it is a spectacle of particle effects and flurrying physics.With over two dozen spells to learn, alongside more advanced actions such as parries and combos, it can be a little overwhelming at first, but – once mastered – Hogwarts Legacy's magical melees showcase both the brutality and the sophistication of wand warfare in a way that the films or books never quite could.This combat pairs nicely with the game’s role-playing progression systems, too, which allow your character to continually evolve across the hundreds of hours you could potentially spend navigating its world. Avalanche generously hands out rewards for your time at Hogwarts, no matter where you might decide to spend it, with a near endless bounty of cosmetic items, talent points, spells, and more to unlock throughout your excursions, both scholarly or otherwise.Not all of this loot holds equal weight or utility, but thankfully it's not the only carrot on the stick to keep you enrolled. The school is nothing without its inhabitants, and the class of 1890 are a rather brilliant bunch, its many pupils a pleasure to spend time with alongside the equally endearing faculty members. Charismatic teachers, such as the scene-stealing charms expert Professor Ronen, will keep you coming back to classes to learn, and there are plenty of other enigmatic figures to encounter, both within the depths of the school's many secret areas and beyond.Voice acting can be a little iffy in places (the male avatar, in particular, comes across as a strange mix of wooden and incredibly posh), and the dialogue doesn't always land — too often dumping lore on the player with reams of exposition — but these blind spots tend to be the exception, rather than the rule. On the flipside, Simon Pegg chews the scenery as uppity Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black, and the game's soundtrack is fantastic, building off and around John Williams' iconic score rather than overly exploiting it.More broadly, however, Hogwarts Legacy also falls into the same traps as many other big budget, open-world games of its type. With so many avenues for progression, the game can frequently overburden players with convoluted menu management work, as they become weighed down by multiple resource types that bloat out and needlessly complicate the experience.Equally, in a world this big, not every activity feels either important or enjoyable, and there are many spaces that feel unoccupied and lifeless, there for the sake of it rather than to provide any lasting value beyond the surface. Established fans will likely be willing to forgive these more prosaic features, but others may instead come away with the impression of a compromised game not quite able to hold up to the promise of its own ambition.Still, there were plenty of ways in which Hogwarts Legacy could have really botched the spell of delivering on an authentic wizarding power fantasy, especially one burdened by decades of expectations. Thankfully, by resisting the temptations of the live service model (or perhaps avoiding the cautionary tale set by 2020's Marvel's Avengers), Avalanche has conjured up a vision of Hogwarts that – for the most part – looks and feels worthy of its namesake.There may be tension at the seams where it tries to hold the sheer scope of its aspirations together, and its fan service can only do so much to patch over those gaps, but Hogwarts Legacy nonetheless succeeds as an easy – if uneven – time killer. Whether this is your first time to Hogwarts, then, or you already know the way from the Common Room to the Library like the back of your hand, Legacy offers a generous slice of role-playing escapism, not to mention a viable remedy for shaking off those late stage Winter blues."

Rejoice, fans of the Harry Potter universe and welcome to Hogwarts!I've purchased a Deluxe edition, so I had time to evaluate the game from many sides, run around the world, swim in the lake, collect jumping mushrooms, visit battles and start studying dark magic while many were waiting for the official release of the game. - it is incomparable here. Living leaves, grass, living surroundings, waves, paintings. Absolutely everything that caught my eye caused genuine delight. - it's just off the scale! I feel through the screen as if I really am a Hogwarts student. This is one of the few games where I listen to all the conversations of the characters, even if they are talking to each other and not to me. I look at the room, at the team of my faculty, at the world around me and I am absorbed. I didn't have such excitement about games after I passed The Witcher 3.When I'm playing, I want to play even more. ""No sleep, I have to see that village over there,"" and it's every time.The game absorbs, the game captures, the game gives you more and more new each time.  - with animation, of course, they tried. There is a lot of it! Moving chess, paintings (moving not only frames, but also images in them), foliage, grass, clothes. All elements have animation and physics. - let me just say that they delight me. I am amazed and in love. - you know, it's like plunging into real life, where you really do some important things, and not just running around in the form of: find and bring. Everything makes sense here. At least the main quests. They immerse you in the story without any problems, It tells you what is happening and what is needed from you.  - I got the impression that a real person, not a bot, is giving me a task. In conversations with NPCs, you can see their enthusiasm, anxiety, excitement, interest. I would even say that the NPCs here are like real people, yeah, they just perform their algorithm and will not do what you want. Otherwise, they behave like real players. - impressed. I thought for a long time and imagined how it would be implemented. It turned out that it was beyond praise. Again, I will say about the Witcher 3. Very similar emotions from the battle scenes. Spell combinations - you can choose your style of play: go ahead, or act covertly (as far as possible). - A huge number of skins and visual for the main character.• We have been waiting for this game for a very long time• Sometimes the game crashes without any errors. The picture just freezes and that's it, Crashed.Honestly, guys, I'm holding back a lot right now not to reveal all the cards about the game. Among my friends there are both fans of the Harry Potter universe and those who don't like this universe. But I haven't heard from any friend yet that he didn't like the game. We all bought a Deluxe edition and we all have similar emotions.

I was running the game at about 30 to 40 frames with ray tracing on at ultra and at the same settings so I suggest keeping that off. I see frame drops in demanding areas or when loading in a completely new area. People saying this game is literally unplayable are full of it. Unless youre someone that can only play a game at 100+ fps and must play at 4k with everything maxed out with ray tracing on. This is easily one of the best games Ive played in a long while. Theres so much to do and there is so much detail that was put into this game its crazy. Already invested 14 hours into the game and Ive still barely scratched the surface of the story.

The secret wizard dueling club is just 1v2->1v3->1v4 to winning the tournament!

Stutters are so bad, i can't even play the damn thing anymore. It's the first time a see an update ruined the optimization this much."
599,RavenMad13,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jlcooper13/,7,1,0,99.8,March,13,120,1,1,"First, I’ve been truant a lot.  In fact, I haven’t been back to the castle in probably a month of in game time and no one is looking for me.  I don’t have to sneak out, I can wonder all hours of the night, no howlers saying get your butt back to class, and not even my friends are looking for me.  No one misses me at school when I’m meandering the countryside for days on end looking for landing platforms and astronomy tables.  Where is the struggle?  I should have to sneak past prefects and use hidden exits in order to leave the castle at night but alas, those only happen on main quest missions.  Other than that, it’s a free for all.  Second, okay developers what is up with the shadows going crazy all the time.  I have tried playing with all the settings but about an hour after playing the shadows and image layering go haywire.  I have played with settings and everything else, but still weird shadows.  Then I go from human to automaton vocally.  I chose the lower pitch male voice and randomly I sound like a robot.  To fix any of these things I have to completely close out the game and reboot.  Third, there are lots of things to do and at first I was stoked at all the content, but then…I was bored.  It feels like busy work.  There are 3-4 cave designs so once you’ve been down a couple you have been down them all and for very little gain as the gear doesn’t scale to your current level.  Merlin must not have been a clever man because the only challenging puzzle is the cube flipendo one that is more annoying than difficult.  Fourth, poachers and poaching.  So, I can capture a handful of magical creatures so I can harvest their fur, whiskers, and warts to upgrade my gear.  Other than the fact I’m not killing them, am I really any better holding them hostage in my only little menagerie?  I can also breed them and sell them to collectors isn’t that nice?  I must spend 15 minutes grooming and feeding these beasts to get materials which again feels like busy work.  I hate Farmville like timed elements.  Really, if they are giving me a house elf that I can’t free then maybe he should be doing all the feeding and caring and then once a day I can collect the materials from a box?  Then potions, honestly the only one I use is the health potion, because the battles are over before I have exhausted all my spells let alone pulling out a thunder brew.  If I can’t sell potions, then having my own greenhouse in the room of requirement is a waste of time, because I can find all the health potions I need in the world.Fifth, the little things.  I liked having to smack the wings off a key, but I didn’t like after finding everything it was an item that was far below my level so all I really get is a skin.  The prize must match the effort developers.  Scale the gear to level please!  So, here you are walking around at a normal pace in Hogsmeade listening to the sights and sounds enjoying the ambiance, I breeze into the tomes store and wham, I’m now walking like I’m thigh high in the swamps of sadness.  Developers, this is an unnecessary mechanic.  Keep the walking pace the same!  Conversation pace, I wish there was a 2x button because the dialog is slow.  I want to feel engaged enough to listen to their whole rants, but if my eyes can read faster then the pace of the dialog it’s a skip for me.  Speaking of dialog, I would have liked voices that are distinctly goblin and voices that are distinctly dark wizard.  They have variety with so many areas could they have had a distinction with those voices.  No need for a killing curse, because in the end they all die and disappear without ever having to use the killing curse.  If they disappear, they are dead in my book.  Lastly, brooms need stats.  I can’t tell the difference from one to the next, please tell me stats on brooms and why I should bother spending 5k on a broom.In conclusion, not quite sure this game was worth the price for pre-order as I never use my griffin to fly anywhere when a broom works just fine, I think I could have waited until the game was $30.  I wanted to love this game after reading all the books and watching the movies multiple times.  Yet, the more I played the more I became bored.  The side quests of caves, trials, and whatnot all became repetitive and the prizes really didn’t feel worth the effort.  The crafting elements felt unnecessary and I’m a person whose spend 800 hours building settlements in Fallout, so I LOVE building, but I was disinterested in the building mechanics in this game.  The potion crafting felt unnecessary, the beast collecting was another time waster but unfortunately necessary for materials to upgrade.  A game shouldn’t feel like a slog or like work.  I feel this game put in size to make it bigger but, it’s just a lot of time wasting vs. being engaging.Games are meant to be fun or at least have me feeling vested.  The only thing holding me to finish is the fact I paid money for the game.  I don’t even feel a need to do another play-through.  So note to future players, pick the house you want and play how you really want at the beginning because it makes little difference.  You can YouTube all the different endings without the tedium."

605,Amiga500,https://steamcommunity.com/id/seancoolcom/,4,,1,66.8,February,11,600,0,1,"Let me begin with the fact that I am not a Harry Potter fan. I did not read the books,  I watched the first movies 20 years ago because my girlfriend back then wanted to watch them. I did not care much. I dont remember both, neither the movies nor my ex gf.So I started Hogwarts Legacy and expecteded an average and typical open world game - just embedded into the Potter Lore with some neat stuff and NPCs and the typical quest structure.However, after playing the last days and only having finished the first parts I must admit that Hogwarts Legacy gave me RDR2, Skyrim and Deus Ex flashbacks.I did not anticipate having that much fun.Hogwards Legacy is an extraordinary game with astonishing love to details and so much passion. It is a great open world game, the scale sets the bar for immersion and atmosphere really high. I hope Ubisoft takes notes.Why or how is is so great: It is the exploration, the mechanics and how you interact with everything.The sense of wonder, the pure giddy joy that I get with each and every new quest and location, the choice of which activity I want to spend my current gaming session with, the view, the environment, the scale of this game, everything is so well done. The music fits, the sound fits, the fights are a mix of tactical approaches and pure chaos, I love it. The whole ambiente feels organic, it is an audiovisual masterpiece.All quests and storylines feel good and motivate to explore.  I never really get too invested in the story of a game, unless it's exceptional.And yes Hogwarts Legacy does not invent gaming new or again, but it was is exceptional enough in many segments that I find the story and characters interesting and I get dragged into this world.The last years I didn't think I could feel like this exitement and joy about games anymore, but Hogwarts Legacy has well and truly proven me wrong. Thank you Avalanche, Hogwarts Legacy is proof that games are indeed a work of art.It is a game about ""magic"" that feels magic in so many moments and left me in awe.This is now a 9 of 10 for me and a must buy and must play for Harry Potter fans. Some criticism:- The inventory management is not good.- Most of the time it runs buttersmooth, but in some areas and moments the fps go wild, I get everything from 120 Ultra Raytracing fps down to 50- despite the amazing world and ambiente you have to do the typical fetch and do this and that quests. Hogwarts Legacy uses the established recipe of open world ""go walk and work"" quests, so do not expect wonders here game design wise."

Time to write my review:I'm no Fan of the Harry Potter movies/Books, maybe only watched the movies once or twice.This game was a blast! I had almost the same experience as Elden Ring last year. This game felt like Elden Ring's Little sister and i loved it!Part of me wished there was no ending to this game. Because when i finished the main story i felt hollow inside knowing that the end was near. I Wanna keep playing this game, but with almost the Field Guide at 100% there's gonna be barely anything left to do then do Battle Arenas or raid Bandit camps over n' over. It is to early to ask already for DLCs,I Know Avalanche Software said that there are no plans atm for DLCs, but i atleast hope that the rumors and leaks of POTENTIAL DLCs for Quidditch and a Rumored Missing-Quarter of the map are true.This game is gorgeous and it be a waste to leave this game as it is now without DLCs.- The Combat is really well done- The Character customization is Decent- The amount of Freedom in this game is amazing!- The Outfits and enhancements are neat.I hope for DLCs in the FUTURE!"

Just to put things in perspective, most of us have been waiting for a game like this for a really long time. Open world Harry Potter/Hogwarts game. So I feel like anyone could have came along and produced that game with modern day graphics and we would have been happy regardless. I feel like thats what this is, its really just a sub par story, sub par game, sub par combat, sub par puzzles, with some Harry Potter lore sprinkled on top. I got excited and hoped that maybe I could play out a Dark wizard story line, well this is not that kind of RPG. Its very linear, even if you use dark magic and unforgivable curses it doesn't alter the story at all. Your characters demeanor never changes, he always resembles some soft sensitive, harry potter wanna be student. One moment im using the killing curse, the next moment I am politely accepting a quest to help someone find their lost rabbit. IDK man I just feel like this could have been done so much better. I think the idea of starting as a 5 year was a poor choice, I think basically just stealing the world of hogwarts and then creating some bs story that has nothing to do with Harry was a poor choice. Yea Idk, i was waiting for this game for a long time, overall just pretty disappointed."

630,H. Grypus,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080523508/,3,,1,76.1,February,25,137,0,1,"I finished the main story of Hogwarts Legacy last night, and wanted to finish it before providing my thoughts.  So, without further adieu, as for as AAA games goes, this one takes the cake (and eats it too).  Most AAA titles have been very disappointing, or lack luster.  They don't try new things, and I think HL sets a standard for that in the gaming community.Story: I loved it.  You're a student, and they don't just ""forget"" that fact and send you on a journey.  From classess, classmates, professors, and nearby villager problems, the game does a great job in melding and cohesively briing together a world.  Side quests, and companion quests also directly link to the main story, usually, in some way or another, and even those that don't, aren't necessarily bad.Side Quests: On the topic of side quests, thank goodness, there are not 7281 fetch quests.  Sometimes games, especially AAA games, fall into this rabbit hole of ""more is better"" and HL doesn't.  It spreads the quests out, and most usually have a unique story, or something driving them.  Sure, theres a fetch quest, but they aren't all the same *cough cyberpunk cough*.Side ""missions"": These are where HL lets us down.  Merlin trials, cairns, popping balloons, these are tedious, and unnecessary.  I'd rather half or even 1/3 of the Merlin trials, with actual complex puzzles.  Do better.Characters: Lovely, just lovely.  Each with a distinct personality, even side characters you meet once or twice are just full of life and vigor.  Love it.  There is one companion who gets shafted, I won't say who, but unfortunate.World: $%^# yes, its beautifully designed, flying is MAGICAL, and I truly mean that.  Magical beasts, plants, its all great.  Even decorating your rooms, the amount of features is astounding.Enemies/combat: While there are few enemies, each enemy has really neat interactions, if you're willing to learn them.  Specific spells that affect them, and ways to disable or deal massive damage.  This, along with the general combat, is fantastic.  More variety would be nice, but I do prefer less variety and quality and I think they made the right choice here.Overall, there are some improvements, but not many to say about this game.  I will, very briefly touch on the controversy and negative comments surrounding this game - don't be a bully and don't harass people and pretend you are better person for it.  Education, awareness, and joining local initiatives helps a lot more than hating someone for playing a game.  Do better."

The Slytherin common room is lavish and ornate, a bit cold feeling but beautiful. You can even see the kraken in the lake through the underwater windows sometimes.- There's actually so much space to travel, the area surrounding Hogwarts is all open to fly to and filled to the brim with things to do, Merlin trials, dungeons, chests, secrets.- The entire castle is absolutely gorgeous, the textures of the materials used are also amazing, granite, gold, wood. Incredibly lavish and intricate. - The room of requirement is highly customizable, even down to the ambience of the room, dark and gloomy, bright and cozy.- There is full trasmog built into the game, you keep the appearance of anything picked up and can change the look of any item equipped, for free, at any point. Also the uniform options look awesome.- I wasn't sure how the combat would turn out but it's actually SO GOOD! And the talents you unlock later really make you feel so powerful!Cons: (most are super minor!)- There's some issues with performance but there are fixes out there that work and my game is incredibly stable after them.- You don't really have much reason to go back to the common room, you can't sit on the chairs or sleep to pass time.- Some voice lines are reapeated too often, like the floo network lady and Deek.

I personally have not encountered any bugs so far, have not experienced any crashes, had some problems with the frame rate in the beginning but not disturbing (disabling ray-tracking was the solution for me) but there will undoubtedly be a fix soon enough update/fix coming soon.

640,Zolnol,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zolnol/,8,,0,48.1,February,15,210,2,1,"As a Harry Potter fan: the game looks deep and rich at first but after a few hours it becomes obvious that it's extremely shallow. Everything is an illusion.The RPG elements barely exist - no meaningful relationships and no repercussions for negative player behaviour. Every character that you encounter feels more or less the same, there's very little soul to them. Classes have no depth to them, either just a short cutscene starts, or you learn a new spell and amaze everyone in the class in 30 seconds. Then you're out. No quidditch, plants and potions are pretty limited (less than 10 of both) The Room of Requirement feels like a chore with the low wait times, if you want to be efficient you basically have to go back every half an hour to check on things. The game runs horribly on PC - these graphics have no business making 30 series cards sweat one bit - yet they do, with constant fps drops and overall bad performance. Movement feels clunky, I dread every moment where I have to swim or do parkour. Getting around with the broom is frustrating too, if you don't have a huge grassland under your ass, you'll have trouble landing. Enemies are repetitive and shallow. Puzzles are kindergarten level with no thinking involved. The only time you can't solve a puzzle is because you haven't progressed far enough yet to get the required spell. The only positive things I can mention about this game is Hogwarts and Hogsmeade - they are made really well - although they are also the most stuttery parts of the game which takes away from the enjoyment. The combat feels good too, it doesn't surprise me that these 2 points were the main marketing materials, every other rough part of the game was hidden. Combat also suffers by the extremely broken mechanism that is stealth. After you unlock it you can just wander around camps and one shot everyone for the rest of the game without having to engage in real fights much. This is on the hardest difficulty too. This game had so much potential but at it's current state it's nothing more than cash grab bullcrap for mindless Harry Potter fans who'll defend it with tooth and nails. The game will hopefully get actually developed in the coming years, just like Cyberpunk and the new Warhammer. Looks like nowadays this is the standard for game developers: cash-in early with a game you can barely call early access, then take your sweet time adding all the missing things.I hate that the game is what it is, I wanted to love it so bad - but it crossed a line where I can't turn a blind eye. I will still 100% it and wait for future updates, but my dissapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. I feel sorry for the people who's standards are met with the ability of being able to pet mutant looking cats."

I really enjoyed it. love seeing all the 1/10's even though they won't play the game based on their view on the author. If you haven't played, don't give it a score. Your opinion is invalid. When you ""REVIEW"" something, you're giving your opinion on all the hard work and effort MANY people with families and aspirations put in. If this is you, look at your behavior and the words you choose and see what we see. People who believe in your cause are beginning to associate your behavior with hate and malice."

However, my experience was ruined when i found out that my choices didn't matter and that the ''evil'' ending literally makes 0 difference since after picking the ending option it just continued on like what i said and did, Didn't happen. I don't recommend this if you wanted a ''real'' Harry Potter RPG, everything is on rails and what you say doesn't matter. it's like playing fallout 4 with magic sticks. but if you like that kinda game where it's basically just let the game force you on it's set path and enjoy the ride, then go ahead. It is really good overall, but after finishing i feel like my fun was taken a dump on and everything i sat through was a waste of time because it wasn't gonna change anything anyway."
645,Novster,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135333746/,4,,1,85.6,March,24,96,0,1,"I found it enjoyable and immersive, with plenty of opportunities for exploration. I also appreciated the implementation of the fight system and the many ways in which you could engage with enemies. However, I was disappointed with the absence of a moral system in the game, as the choices you made in the dialogues did not have any real impact on the NPCs' reactions. I'd like want that my choices to have real consequences for me and a greater sense of moral ambiguity and complexity in the game's dialogue options.Despite this shortcoming, I still found the game to be a good experience overall, especially for fans of the wizarding world. As a game studio's first attempt at this type of game, it is impressive, even if it wasn't entirely unique.I must say that the attention to detail in creating a believable magical universe is remarkable. I really liked the exploration of this world."
646,Liri Brightstar,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198250073110/,3,,1,77.8,February,11,91,0,1,"I absolutely love the game! No amount of reviews can explain how beautiful and immersive the game is, you really have to try it yourself. It's really massive and it is everything I expected as a fan of Harry Potter and an open world game like this. I could spend days just exploring Hogwarts Castle alone and I'd only be scratching the surface. The battle system is extremely fun and addicting too! It was such a surprise to use unexpected spells and combine them with other spells during combat, not to mention a lot of combos. Oh and how much I love the main story quest, it's as if I'm watching a movie yet at the same time I am in it. Love the game, years from now this is a game I will still come back to."
647,Kaladin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hansdc/,5,1,1,59.0,March,6,172,0,1,"An okay game by itself. A great game if you like the series. They definitely nailed the setting and the combat. Another highlight is the soundtrack. The story is okay but could be a bit more fleshed out (don't expect a deep RPG). Some great ""wow"" moments though with the set pieces. Tons of side-content that varies in quality. It's all optional so you can skip the usual open world filler (and frankly, there's quite a lot of that). From a technical standpoint the game looks great and runs well for me, but I have a beefy PC.Strongly recommended if you like making cows do 360 mid-air flips with your magic."
648,Kaatosade,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaatosade/,3,,1,59.2,February,11,174,0,1,"We're gonna ignore the political snafu and Rowling's inability to pull her moronic head out of her hamster hole. Speaking strictly on the game itself...The PROS:This is a HUGE love letter to fans of the books and films alike. And if you've obsessively read and watched all the Potter media you can consume, like I have since I was but a wee babby, you're going to enjoy it that much more. Hogwarts is a character in its own way, just as much as Harry, Ron and Hermione are, and the people who made this game's version of the famous wizarding school know that. Every single nook and cranny and centimeter of flooring oozes detail. I turned off my minimap and quest directives (I cannot recommend this enough to any player) and let myself get lost in the castle. See a door? Well, it's not a painted wall. You can go through that door, if there's no lock on it (if there is, come back later once you have the spell sponsored by LockPickingLawyer). Every single floor is explorable. It's insane how large Hogwarts feels.The paintings on the walls play music and converse. I walked into the central hall and was gobsmacked by the angry visage of a dragon animated in the stone walls. I chased flying books about like an idiot and had a grand time. I pet every single cat I could see. I ran after a pair of ghosts in a domestic violence incident. I turned a corner, and watches Peeves slap a stack of books out of a student's hands and whip down the hallway, cackling maniacally. When I entered the lavatory, a mirror complimented me on how amazing I looked, and then when I came in later, it told me I had a gross face. Animated suits of armor push and shove each other and make movements in your periphery. Students chatter on about rumors of your adventures and whatever story beats you've finished. I have yet to see one of these random events repeat.Combat is flashy, snappy, and oh-so-much fun. Some complained about how boring and silly the wand combat was in the movies. Worry no more! Once you unlock talents and start investing points into your spells, it gets more visually bright, more chaotic and varied with each point you spend (I suggest first getting the talents that allow more spells to be assigned to the D-pad so switching on the fly is much less annoying). There’s potential for a variety of playstyles here, and I've barely touched any of it yet.If I’d not known who was composing the music for this game, and you told me that John Williams did the scoring, I would have believed you 100%. The folks who worked on the score have clearly done their homework. There's many nods to the film's iconic themes, the instrumentation and style follows directly in Williams' footsteps. It really is that good. It feels like a natural extension of the tracks we've come to recognize from JW, but still easily stands on its own. Sound design is straight outta the movies. It’s a treat.The world is fit to bursting with content. I've only just got to the point in the game where I've unlocked the majority of the main features, and I'm at a loss of where to start. Fly about the castle and admire its architecture? Be a loot goblin and bash down every door looking for someone's private stash? Be a Newt Scamander and care for the magical beasts? Become proficient in the Dark Arts even though it is strictly against my moral code? Obsessively find the best pieces of furniture to decorate my little slice of home in the Room of Requirement? Explore the Forbidden Forest? There is no shortage of things to do. In fact, there's so much to do that it may feel a little overwhelming. Which brings me to...The CONS:While the game is full of things to do and see, much of the content outside the walls of the castle can become predictable. Fetch quests, deliveries, there's a bajllion collectables to find... I've seen people liken this game to Assassin's Creed: Valhalla in this regard, and I can't say I disagree. The Scottish Highlands did not have anywhere near the same amount of attention given to it as Hogwarts did (I can't blame the developers, entirely, there was hardly any source material to build off of outside Hogwarts/Hogsmeade). While the game opens up to the rest of the world fairly early on in the story, you may be like me and not find yourself out in it too much, because it's just not nearly as enjoyable to experience it. The majority of characters are pretty forgettable. I've got a few favorites (harm a hair on Natty or Garlick's heads and I will riot), but even those characters aren't ones that are going to be iconic in any way. I haven't been terribly impressed with the story, either. It’s an average tale, but set in the wizarding world, so at least it's got magic in it. But the tutorial portion of the beginning of the game? Wowza. Wish the rest of the story could be as exciting as that, but regretfully, that doesn't seem to be the case so far. I'm hoping I can come back and update this review about how wrong I was.Everyone and their mother on this Steam page is aware of the performance issues on PC. I don’t doubt it's really bad. Avalanche needs to get in gear and fix these problems ASAP. The PC port has obviously not gotten the same QA as the console versions. Maybe I'm just really lucky, but I have not had any significant performance hiccups, crashes, or glitches (although with this game, you can call the glitches magic!) except twice: entering the Owlery (I probably had 5-8 FPS for a good ten seconds), and the first few seconds of the sorting ceremony cutscene stuttered. That's it! I've had a pretty blissful ride thus far, and I'm working with specs that just barely pass the minimum requirements.Sadly, the NPC's are just as detrimental to the immersion in the game as they are a compliment. While I enjoy eavesdropping on all their conversations, they don't really do anything outside their little bubble within a short range. They don't go to dinner in the Great Hall, they don't go to classes and sit down, and they have very limited interaction with the player’s presence and actions. Actually, I think there's the possibility that the students and faculty get raptured every night, because when I go to my dormitory after dark... every single bed is empty. All the classes are empty. Halls are empty. The Castle is silent, save for the ghosts and armor and portraits. It's rather disconcerting. Where did they go? Why, Avalanche, why are they not able to rest their weary heads at night? How am I supposed to stand over their beds and breathe down their necks if there's no one to stand over? Red Dead Redemption 2 set the precedent for AI pathing and behavior. This game ain't meeting that bar. It tried to jump and busted a kneecap on the bar.In conclusion...It's been a long, long road to get a Wizarding World game in my hands where I can be a witch and get my own wand and an assigned House that isn't stuffed with predatory IAP. It may not be the immersive RPG experience of going to classes and getting to know your peers like a lot of us hoped for, but we have come a long way from Harry Potter on the PS1. I’ve had an unreasonable amount of excitement while playing this, and I can’t thank the developers enough for giving me such a special experience. This game is like biting into a fresh, warm pumpkin pasty and taking a swig of butterbeer. It's so delightful and cozy and FUN.It gets a solid 8.5/10 from me. TL;DR: I have not had a single hour where I didn't have a gigantic, stupid smile on my face for a prolonged period of time. I may need an ambulance. My face hurts. This game's amazing and it's made me forget my need to drink water and eat food to live. I've reverted to the wide-eyed, magic-obsessed seven year old reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone on a beanbag in the library. Only Hogwarts Legacy can sustain me now."

I love that the story is ""audio"" to really give the theatrical/cinematic feel to them!GAMEPLAY: I'm really impressed, truely good! The maps are HUGE so brooms, and mounts are a great way to get around (also there's instant teleport/travel which is awesome). Weather has natural changes which is great (not the same weather everyday like some games. COMBAT: Not turn based (thank you!) its real time! Lots of options with combat, dogding, teleporting, blocking and great magic spells. There's also options of stealth, pokemon type plant helpers, potions, the works! The combat and overall gameplay was really thought out. Great level up system too with choosing your playstyle on a tree system (for those who are familiar with assassins creed tree system types).GRAPHICS/ENVIRONMENT: Gorgeous! I have a really really old computer so the specs are below requirement. I had a bit of lag issue (my fault) however I got some memory sticks (min 16GB) to help with that, and instantly the issues were resolved. I would definitely recommend to have at least 16GB to really enjoy the beauty in the game. Besides that everything else was awesome, I love the soft touches and feel to the overall look of it (reminds me ALOT of Fable). The effects are epic with the magic spells and combat, the decor is enchanting with all the pictures and items that move and talk and quack (yes quack). Such a beautiful game I can't express it enough, you'd have to see it for yourself!++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Summary: Overall I'm very impressed with this game, I feel as though there will be many updates in the future to help iron out any further bugs that may arise (I haven't come across any just yet), but overall I really really really recommend this game for anyone that loves a good story, adventure and magic!! Thank you for this game its really great so far!"

The win10 fresh install did nothing. With Win11 + Ascendio3-ini-changes I'm getting 50-144fps in Hogwarts (average 100) and at least 70fps+ in Hogsmeade. All on ULTRA and DLSS (Quality) minus RT.This is much better, but still unacceptable that some random dude and his random ini-changes actually give many more FPS and reduce stutter than the devs. Also this immense fluctuation in FPS is very annoying. Still WAY better than before though.Now I can continue PLAYING the game and maybe change the review...----original review follows----I really really tried, but this is a performance-mess I cannot bear to ""play"" any longer.At best I'm getting around 50fps when looking at a wall on LOW-everything. Even patched with Ascendio2/INI-tweaked. Most of my play-time is tweaking, restarting, being dissapointed, rinse repeat. I even threw a quick clean-install-windows into the pen. And hell, the massive load-times, including a shader-cache-refill each effing start, don't make it any better.Settings don't really matter, the delta between lowest and ultra means one-figure-fps-gain.And guess what enabling RTX does to the frames? Yup.Luckily I'm no HP-fan (I even dislike HP) or else I'd be VERY upset. The whole thing is very cute, much love in the details and all, exploring the castle is a pure bliss, but this is a joke that gives me literal headaches. I'm waiting for the pirated version now to see if it was Denuvo or just bad optimization.And yeah, ""It's all my fault"", ""I don't know what I'm doing"", ""50fps is more than enough!"", ""my rig sucks"", ""you're stoopid"", ""the human eye can't perceive more than 30fps"" etc. Spare me."

This game gets voted down because of the creator of the IP. Yes, what she did is wrong, but the only relation she has to this is the royalties. This is a game made for Harry Potter fans, and is easily enjoyable by everyone. You can like something without liking who made it. Ignore all those who are trying to oppress and shame you for wanting to play this, their views on this are faaar too ironic to be taken seriously.Now, about the game. I'd give it an 8. It's a fantastic game, but the sheer lack of enthusiasm coming from the main character's voice ruins what could be an amazing story. In my opinion, the side quests are what make this game. This is the first time in a while that I actually enjoyed side quests and side stories, they are so well done and the characters (for the most part) are so well written.I would give this a 9 if it weren't for my own expectation. I was under the belief that the story would be affected by what house you are in. This is only the case in one quest (Hufflepuff has the best version of this quest imo). Other than that and a few dialog lines, your house doesn't make any difference.I completed the story in 28 hours, which included faffing around and side quests, so I probably could have done it in under 25. Usually when I finish the story, I stop playing the game, but I still actively want to complete the side quests, regardless of there being nothing to gain.TLDR; Ignore the haters and the reviews that deduct points due to JKR, this game is a solid 8/10."

The story and extras are easily over 100 hours long and i cannot wait to see what modders do.That said the character generation should have allowed body types and less pandering to certain others should we see but the game as a whole is a solid 8-9/10 in my opinion.Great game buy it asap"

Ah, turns out he was gazing at a magical projection of some sort of cosmos - there is just so many little to big things of interest in the world to explore, I find it very refreshing - as in recent years, big games like hitman make a big world but there isn't as much depth and surprise in terms of exploration.I also appreciate how they blended the tutorial into the story-tellin, it was not a boring ""here is a training yard, practice this, that and those, then start playing your game"".The few interactions I had with the available characters were good in terms of different personalities and considering the dialogue, I look forward to learn more about them in the future.The developers really did a great job with this game, and if they do decide to make another with say, one of the other magic schools in the HP world, I'd be in even if I'm not particularly a fan."

It kept me glued to my seat and inspired me enough to complete it achieving 100% of the objectives. This meant completing all of the challenges as well as getting all the collectibles.At the moment, I don't believe the game has much replay value, however, it was well worth the price tag for over 100 hours of entertainment. If you honestly break it down it's about 40 cents per hour of entertainment if you took your time to complete everything like I did."
678,kyoko,https://steamcommunity.com/id/avkyoko/,3,,1,82.2,February,12,906,1,1,"Currently, the game is suffering with really bad performance and stuttering, but what I have to say about this game is not bad at all. This game is probably what any ubisoft open world game wanted to be, the open world is one of the most amazing ones I have experienced so far, every corner of the map has some small details or something happening, when you're walking in Hogwarts or outside, you're going to see small things happening that are enough to make the world feel alive.The story is never a drag, between main story and side quests, everything is fun, everything add details and fully voiced, it's impossible to not feel immersed when playing this game.The character creator is probably the only thing that I wish was better, I feel like it's very limited with how you have to use ""standard"" faces instead of being able to customize your face. I would also not recommend tweaking with the character voice, only the standard ones work well in general. The combat is one of the strongest points in this game, while a lot of people talked about how ""basic"" the combat feels, all the movement, spells upgrades, you can basically set up what combo works best for yourself and just have fun with it, the combat feels very dynamic and fast, you can work your way by dodging attacks or parrying, you can move enemies around the battlefield, you can handle any encounter your own way.Personally, I would recommend following a bit of the main story until you unlock more spells, but you can always just do whatever you want in the map and go back to that later.This is probably one of the ""must"" have games for this year, and you're not going to regret getting this one, it's one of the few triple A games that are worth the full price."

Most upset that you can't just be Hermione and study super hard and learn all of the spells without progressing through the main story, which I found predictable and boring. ""Open world"" my ass. Exploring around and running into locked doors constantly you can't unlock until halfway through the story is not magical. UI requires many extra clicks to get where you want, with slow loading times. I have a state of the art brand new computer and it's crashing constantly.The characters are designed very simply (compare them with something like Dragon Age for example, where even the humans have unique features and strong personalities that are woven into the design) and with poor animation. Their stories are interesting but they have maybe only a line or two of extra dialogue if you want to talk to them more at any given moment. A fair few things are copied over from the movies, while so many things that would be amazing moments or references aren't there.Good combat. I was surprised about that. I would probably rate it slightly positively 6 or 7 out of 10 without the crashes. But feel like it's worth a negative review while those remain."

If you are a normie like me, then it's just a decent game. Not going to blow your mind or anything. The biggest praise I can give this game is that it's clearly high effort. The devs cared about the atmosphere of Harry Potter, about details, about characters, about making a diverse and interesting cast.Gameplay-wise, it is as close to the Bully sequel as we are going to get. Go in with this expectation, not expecting Red Dead Redemption: Wizard or Hogwarts: Torment.Technical issues: no glitches so far. The game is mostly running well on Ultra, but occasionally chugs when it needs to load nearby areas.The bad: voice modulator should have been cut. It's so bad and audibly artifacted. The Trans Character is obviously a female VA with a voice modulator and it sounds as bad as when it's applied to you. The menus are also pretty slow to use, especially when you need to go over the map screen, which takes time to load.The keyboard controls end up being too clunky for comfortable comment - better use the controller.Overall - it's a very solid 6/10 AAA game. Better if you are a big Potter fan."

689,David0vić,https://steamcommunity.com/id/david0vic/,6,,0,23.7,February,18,479,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a very mediocre, generic and formulaic modern open world game that's saved from being a bad game by the Harry Potter license. They've done a good job of recreating Hogwarts and it is honestly really cool being able to fly around and above the castle on your broom seamlessly. I had fun in my first several hours playing the game just exploring the castle and the areas outside around the castle like hogsmeade. The more you progress though the more you realise how little the game has to offer. One of the biggest offenders is how lifeless the world feels with the lack of interaction in general. I compare it to Bully which came out 17 years ago now. When you walk around the school in Bully it feels like you are a part of that world. There is a time mechanic where you need to get to class on time and go to bed on time etc. All the NPC's have their routine they're following making you feel like the world is moving regardless of you being there rather than it feeling like the world is waiting for you like it does in Hogwarts Legacy. The difference between the level of interaction compared to a game released in 2006 is honestly really sad but that's just one of my many complaints. The general lack of role playing is also a big issue, you don't feel like a student in this world at all. You go to class like less than a dozen times from what i recall just to learn spells so you can go on mass killings in the world. The story and writing in general is lackluster, lack of well written characters to latch on to and connect with to pull you through the story. Main character has no personality. No consequences for your actions and choices have zero impact on the outcome in the end. Combat gets extremely repetitive and tiresome. The R2/RT spam is ridiculous i felt like i was on autopilot throughout most of the combat. The lack of enemy variety didn't help either. The gear system is terrible because of the level scaling making exploration pointless knowing you will never find a really good item that will last you dozens of hours because everything is scaled to your level. There is nothing interesting to see outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade because of all the bland check list side activities they've added to pad out the length. Boring level and puzzle design in the caves and dungeons. UI feels like it's ripped straight out of a modern Ubisoft game. Graphics are inconsistent, sometimes it looks like a good looking PS4 game and other times it looks like an early PS3 game. The performance is awful because of the amount of VRAM it uses, i had to find a fix online for my RTX 3070 8gb because it ate all my VRAM like it was nothing. Maybe it's justified if the game looked amazing but it doesn't. The game overall doesn't feel like it's a full price Triple A game, it feels like a budget title. Makes sense that the developers last game was Cars 3. 4/10 (Mediocre)"

The game looks good and plays solid. I loved flying around, busy world with lots to explore and to do. So why not higher than that? Due to two major reasons: 1. You basically don't have any impact on the world and vice versa. The world is not responsive to your situation. Examples in spoilers: -  -  -  -  2. Story writing can be so. much. improved....- - - These are, in my opinion, things the developer should work on for a possible game 2.

It is a beautiful crafted world with environments that contain many secrets. The visual effects are top notch and the shaders look absolutely gorgeous. It definitely gives the right magical feeling to this game. Even though it is called Hogwarts Legacy, the world map is far more massive than just Hogwarts. You will have a blast exploring and traveling. The graphics are top notch and definitely live up to the new ray tracing standards especially when maxed out. The story so far definitely fits in the Harry Potter universe and can feel a bit cliché at times due to that. The gameplay is very enjoyable and the magic battles (so far) feel quite snappy and smooth. There is still a lot for me to discover, but for now it definitely lives up to what had been promised. The puzzles vary in difficulty and some require magic in order to be solved. I think that the diversity makes it fantastic.This game is what I dreamt of as a child."

714,Ragnarok0130,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ragnarok0130/,4,,1,77.8,February,22,323,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG that I’ve wanted to play for over 20 years. When I stop playing Hogwarts Legacy I look forward to the next time I boot up the game and return to the Wizarding World. Hogwarts Legacy is like Skyrim is for me, hours evaporate in the blink of an eye while you are in game without realizing that so much time has passed.I played Hogwarts Legacy on a Win10 Pro machine with an i7-8700, 16GB of DDR4, and an NVIDIA RTX 2070.  The only tech issues that I experienced were during the early access period when I would get random frame rate drops. The frame rate issue was almost completely resolved on my rig by the official release week patch. Hogwarts Legacy does use Denuvo anti-piracy software so I wouldn’t doubt if many of the performance issues reported by players stem directly from Denuvo.The story is fun, the game play and mechanics feel solid and polished and the wand combat is dynamic and fulfilling resembling what we saw in the Harry Potter movies. Avalanche gave us a polished, feature complete game which is quite the feat considering the unfinished, feature incomplete, broken state that most games launch in the era of Live Service Gaming. There are also added features where if you link your Wizarding World account with the game it will import your house, your wand and patronus from the website which is a really nice bonus. You can choose to manually select a house instead of using your Wizarding World house that you were sorted in so player agency is still king. Avalanche did a wonderful job faithfully recreating the world described in the books and shown on screen in the Harry Potter movies. It felt wonderfully nostalgic wandering through the corridors of Hogwarts discovering new areas and seeing deftly placed fan service Easter eggs from Harry Potter lore.The open world feels vibrant and full unlike today’s staple generic empty Ubisoft open world design that we’re all so tired of. Side quests feel organic to discover and fun to do so they don’t feel like open world busy work. The NPCs have actual personalities and conversations with them don’t make me want to spam the next button to end the conversation. I actually want to fly around on my broom and discover every inch of the open world, explore new areas and dungeons and I look forward to my next combat encounter. I even enjoy caring for and breeding beasts and growing/brewing plants to make potions in the room of requirement.Enemy variety comes in predictable pre-assigned varieties, especially when fighting the Goblins; the Ashwinders have a bit more variety in my opinion. There are also infamous foes that you encounter which offer a bit more variety but generally play similarly to other foes of their faction. Despite having only a finite number of enemy archetypes like most games, the combat remains engaging and fun and spell combos can really up the damage as certain spells synergize best with other specific spells such as the Glacius/Diffindo combo.Let’s address the elephant in the room, yes Hogwarts Legacy is much more diverse than the 19th century United Kingdom was, and even more diverse than the Harry Potter movies were in the 2000s, however it doesn’t detract from the game or the story and its easy to head cannon that perhaps the wizarding world had more migration due to their smaller numbers and a closer knit society. Basically it’s a non-issue that shouldn’t affect one’s enjoyment of a stellar fantasy game.Overall I give Hogwarts Legacy a 9\10 for giving Harry Potter fans a mostly lore accurate, feature complete, fun, and engaging game. My hope is that Avalanche gives us future expansions to Hogwarts Legacy so the adventure can continue."

I did not expect this at all, lately I've had terrible luck with pre-orders and I said to myself if this game is trash, its the last time I'll pre-order anything. Well its my most played game in February, I've never played a single player game for so long and nothing else (not counting the Steam Deck). Although I'm glad I've finally finished the story and I can get back to playing other games again, there's this cool afterglow that I don't know how to explain. Usually I'd be sad after finishing a great game, but this time it hits different, like has my search for a great game come to an end?I won't straight up and tell you that this game is GOTY 2023, its up in the top 3 possibly yes, but there's another one coming out in December that I'm keen to play, question is if it will have what it takes to compete with this one in less than a month?Now on to the actual game, I won't go into any spoiler-ish details, but I'll say that the supposed 'Good' ending felt a bit dry, like there wasn't any recognition for my hard work and I would've rather chosen the 'Bad' ending. I haven't watched all endings yet and I got spoiled by people that are not to be named, so there's that. 'Aight to the scoreboards we go.Story: 9.5/10Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Soundtrack: 10/10Optimization: 7/10Replayability: YupPrice: Totally worth the 60-70 eur.Content: 11/10Total score: Man come on who am I kidding, its a 10 out of 10, best pre-order of my life yet, not one second played has been regretted.P.S. I just noticed something on the store page - it says 'in app purchases', to my knowledge I did not see the option to buy things anywhere, so I don't know what they meant with that."
716,Yusho,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974026700/,3,1,1,16.5,February,21,245,0,1,This game isn't transphobic at allI want my money back
717,tho3maxi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tho3maxi/,3,,0,26.1,February,22,170,0,1,"TL:DR: its a decent open world game and very pretty and if that's enough for you It'll be okay for you.______The BadTechnical:Hogwarts Legacy runs POORLY over all, I noticed a lot of smaller bugs and glitches like lighting being weird, camera angles having seizures, nothing game breaking but annoying things. However, I also had my fair share of game crashes, sometimes even locking Steam so I'd have to restart my PC. Worse is the configuration.While I praise HL for most of its accessibility options, a couple of basic things are missing. FOV is limited and camera distance is not adjustable. After only a couple of minutes I'll have a headache and become dizzy. I managed to increase the FOV beyond the norm by editing the config file but this made the game run very poorly in many situations and the compromise still made me dizzy after only an hour. Even worse, you can not turn off antialiasing (something that would improve perfromance drastically) and the only possible AA modes for me are DLAA (which sucks) and TAA (wich sucks even more), both methods leave artifacts on the screen that just don't look pretty at all.Storytelling:I will not spoil anything, but it sucks. The story line itself might be okay in the end since I only played about half of it but there are serious deficits here. First, it doesn't quite make sense to me. Now, I read 5 of the books, saw the 8 movies, and I still don't quite understand whats going on. It all seems random, dull, and worst of all: slow. Quests are extremely linear and when I was exploring and doing side quests many dialogues or voice lines didn't make any sense (referencing characters I hadn't met yet, telling me to do things I already did, getting thrown into an advanced side quest I stumbled upon with no idea what to do, that kind of stuff) and the characters and how they act don't seem relatable or believable. Also a lot of the quests start with following a NPC to a certain spot after teleporting to the NPC. Following slow moving NPCs isn't my idea of fun or immersive storytelling.The worst part is that you are forced to complete tons of story and quests before you can actually progress further in the open world. If I could have skipped the story and just walked around doing wizard fights, that's what I would have done and I would probably not have refunded the game.Character:While visual customization is a strong point, I could not connect to my character at all. Visuals is all you can choose. The dialogue options, The way my character talked, it all alienated them from me as the player. Its so frustrating because it seems so superficial. If you're making me create my own character, and then force decisions and personality on them, that feels strange. Either let me have control over who my character is or have me play someone who fits the story you want to tell the player.Also, for some reason, we are the innately super special magic awesome person and everything revolves around us. Never have to ask for a favor, always being offered help, everyone always has time exclusively for us or cant be interacted with at all. Just feels very synthetic.Controls:The standard layout is a bit weird, but you can reassign and customize controls so that's not the issue. My biggest issue here is feedback. Combat feels great in general, but sometimes I don't know why I died. I played on hard and most times it was perfectly fine, even taking out bosses beyond my level. But in other fights I was dodging, shielding, and then died. normally when you die, the character falls to the floor. I got death screens with my character running and jumping and rolling that very moment on multiple occasions. With no idea what killed me, or when. I am not sure if this is actually a serious bug but it got really annoying.Music:It does not include quite the same soundtrack from the movies, its very different, albeit a similar theme. That was disappointing for me. Graphics:The overall gameplay graphics are good, see later. However, the cutscenes and ""cinematics"" are a joke. Cutscene animations are terrible, sometimes not even starting in the uncanny valley, most are far from out of it. The textures and models are perfectly fine but there are always some details or animations or effects that shed light on the worst possible parts of the cutscene. The cinematics are just plain bad. I play on native 4k, 60hz and the short season change movie is highly compressed 1080p 30hz garbage. From a full price title in 2023 I expect far better.World Objectives:There are a lot of things to do in and around Hogwarts and that's good. Sadly it's a lot of copy and paste.  Most enemies and puzzles do reset completely when you go away too far, and by that I mean about 30 meters. I've seen a Troll actually vanish and respawn on the hill behind it. I've seen puzzle elements do the same thing. Its annoying and wastes time, breaks immersion and adds nothing to the gameplay. I cant multitask, I cant kite enemies. Why build a big, detailed open world if I cant interact with the world and the entities in it simultaneously? ______The GoodGraphics:It. Looks. Stunning. The atmosphere is pretty on point and the models, textures, effects and assets all look great. The world is beautifully put together, expect for a handful of objects clipping weirdly, being misaligned, hovering or having transparent edges (which is sure to happen in all open word games to a certain degree). But most of all I am impressed with the VFX artists, they really outdid themselves.Hogwarts:The castle is breathtaking. All the rooms, the details, the corridors, the ghosts, the paintings... beautiful. All together it is a very accurate representation of the castle as known from the books and movies. The surrounding area and Hogsmeade are similarly well made. The ambient animations are magical and the world is filled with interesting collectibles.Combat: This is the strongest point of the game for me and even if the whole games was ultimately not for me, I enjoyed  of the fights. It's fast, intense, beautiful, snappy, the sounds are great, it's easy to grasp but hard to master. Fights were always a challenge for me, but never too hard. ______SummaryThe game is not for me. For 20 bucks or less, I guess its fine. But its so damn disappointing. It is weirdly inconsistent with some parts of it being absolutely the best things I've ever seen in gaming and others being done better in 5€ trash games. It is an excellent showcase for an interactive Hogwarts, but it was not immersive. The first 5 hours were interesting, the next 5 confusing, the last 5 annoying. It's hard for me to find the right words. I hoped it would become better but it just became worse. It feels tiring and bothersome to advance. Ultimately, I found no more motivation to play. When I avoid playing a game because it annoys me, its a bad sign.If you love HP, Hogwarts, and some casual fun, and don't take this game so seriously, you'll probably have a good time. I hadn't."
718,klye,https://steamcommunity.com/id/klyeo/,4,,0,35.8,February,22,646,0,1,"Honestly, pretty monotonous and repetitive. The writing is downright terrible and the main plot is so dull. This game is also horribly optimized on PC and has a really bad memory leak that might stop you from playing the game all together. I've had this game crash on me easily 50+ times with a RTX 4080 and it is infuriating. And it's a shame, because visually, the game is stunning...until you see any facial animations. Then, it looks like Mass Effect: Andromeda.Most of my time playing this game was spent wondering ""This game would be so much better if it had x, y, or z."" There's just so much missed potential, it's crazy. No Quidditch, no real minigames, only 3 duels in the entire game that take <5 minutes to complete, a really lame beast poaching mechanic, it's just devoid of things you'd expect in a Harry Potter game. This should have had Yakuza/Like A Dragon amounts of minigames.This game is not a Hogwarts life simulator. If you're one of the many people that wanted something like that, drop those expectations and go pick up a game like Persona 5 or Bully that will actually have things to do at school. Both of those games are better than this. And if you're not looking for those life sim elements and just want a fun, engaging story about magic, there's still way better options out there. Go check out Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.By far the best part of the game is the combat, but it feels like this game is afraid to let you just fight. Most combat encounters are over far too quickly, even on the hardest difficulty. Most quests are just fetch/delivery quests or are 99% really boring puzzles. If this game had a proper arena (and not one that's a $20 add on), it'd be better.Stevie Wonder could see the ""twists"" of the main plot coming. It's terrible. The goblins are clear racial stereotypes and this game has a lot of weird racist vibes to it all.All in all, it doesn't do anything exceptionally and if it didn't have the Harry Potter IP attached, it'd be a flop on arrival. All in all, a very mediocre title carried by nostalgia."
719,Fiireside,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057487370/,3,,1,29.6,February,21,58,0,1,"(SPOILER FREE)Intro -I'm a huge fan of the source material (i.e. the books written by She Who Shall Not Be Named), so my expectations for this game were moulded from years of having my imagination fed in the most fantastic way by the Harry Potter series as a kid. With that being said, I'm going to separate my feedback into a positives and negatives list. Some of my criticisms might seem harsh but this is a AAA full price game so I see it as fair.Positives -.This is a very safe RPG, essentially anyone can play it, regardless of age or experience..Bugs are minimal and are usually just goofy rather than anything game breaking..Combat is fluid and satisfying, it's very easy but with lots of room for mastery..Characters are incredibly well detailed (visually) and are mostly interesting to interact with..Voice actor cast obviously extremely talented..Graphics are in line with a 2023 AAA title..Flying on a broom is pretty one dimensional but is still really smooth and the most fun way to traverse..There are elements of a good story here and there..Forbidden Forest is decently atmospheric..Some of the landscape is beautiful..Professor Garlick.Negatives - .The game is insanely childish, from the art style of beasts and enemies, to the actual story and lore, rarely will you find the same dark and chilling elements of the source material..The game is just very generic, they haven't innovated within the genre at all..The game is frustratingly repetitive, you will see the exact same enemies, fight them in the exact same way, hear the exact same voice lines, solve the exact same puzzles, pick up the exact same loot time after time after time..The puzzles are all mundane and essentially just copy pasted all over the map, if you want a game with interesting puzzles play Arkham City or Tomb Raider. .The looting system is silly, you spend so long after a battle spamming F on the ground to pick up everything only to run out of inventory space until you solve more mundane puzzles to expand it..Hogwarts Castle itself is unimaginative and bland (the saddest part for me), has absolutely none of the charm you'd expect and feels far more like a generic hub than a secret wizarding school..No Quidditch?.The main story is a bit disjointed but passable..There is one singular decent side quest that I could find, the rest are all mid or worse..Movement is clunky, which would be fine except quite a few puzzles rely on movement which just makes it frustrating.And then, my biggest issue with the game, by FAR, is the actual feel of the world itself. The open world has absolutely no flow. It feels like exploring a pre test version. There's no real thought or creativity put into it. If you've played Red Dead 2, you'll know what an open world should feel like. In this game, enemy placements are haphazard, the small dwellings and towns are forgettable and there's just so much dead space in-between. There's no charm or intrigue when you explore. There's plenty to 'do,' but only if you enjoy doing the exact same things over and over.Conclusion -Might be confusing as to why I recommend this game after so much negative feedback. It's because the game functions well enough and there is some fun to be had here. For completionists and those who enjoy a light, feel-good game this is probably something you'll enjoy. For anyone looking for a really gripping story or for exciting, innovative gameplay, I'd suggest avoiding it. Overall, an aggressively mid game that ironically has no magic to it.5.5/10"
720,MoNeY,https://steamcommunity.com/id/money-t4gn/,3,,1,44.5,February,20,50,0,1,After completing the game Today (31 Hrs In-Game save - Balanced Run) I can say that this is a MUST BUY not only for Potterheads but even for folks looking to step into this for the first time. Open World side missions CAN be Improved with better rewards. The Story is one of the strongest and surprisingly amazing to play through (Main Quests + Associated Side Quests). Combat is really really fun with good boss fights here and there (Less button mash comparatively but not souls-like moveset. Don't mash R2/RB alot or you'll miss out on how good spell casting is).Navigating the World is also well laid out. Travel through Floo network or go broom broom or rather do Mounts (I personally loved crusading on my broom rather than Mounts).Creature collection could have been improved a little but its still good and WHOA The Room of Requirements stuff was awesome to do.My recommendation if you're picking this up is to play the game how it pans out since it is well coordinated balance of Main Story line and linked side stories altogether. Do Combos in combat to have a good time around it but keep timings right for perfect deflects.Ran really well on my RX6600 at High settings with FSR 2.0 Quality at 1080p but would further be optimized as time goes by.Kudos to WB and Avalanche for an amazing journey into the Wizarding World!

728,VonDoom4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vondoomcz/,3,,1,56.9,February,18,128,0,1,"Hogwarts triggers a real nostalgia for Harry Potter movies and books. Flying on a broomstick is one of the most iconic and epic moments this game can offer and exploring Hogwarts and its surroundings feel just magical. The entire game is beautifully designed that I can hardly find anything negative. It definitely gave me the same vibe as RDR 2 or The Witcher 3. When a new addition arrives, I only hope game writers will spend more time on quests which are very primitive though as said this whole awesome adventure makes up for a bit dull story."

I recommend it to everyone n anyonePROS:-Really fun game, the mechanics are so nice and the combat is very fun>Checkpoints are often. Game quicksaves before you can do anything stupid-Walking down stairs has its own animation-Art style is a very cool-Runs well like 90% of the time, 7% probs being my fault-Replayability. As expected, I will be doing at least 4 plays of this game as each house has unique quests.- Graphics quality, I play on two machines, one at Ultra settings and the other at medium. Game looks great on both.-Character Customisation, Hair colours aren't flat. They have undertonesCONS:-Have encountered few technical issues such as crashing on 72hr prerelease day 1, random ps2 graphics that was fixed by verifying files n downloading patches. Got stuck in one quest cause the marker didn't move, but the regular checkpoints saved me.-Character customisation CONSFACE- Limited to a few facial presets, can't sort by male and female like in other games and they're all mixed in together which is a bit annoying.SKIN- I like that the darker skin tones look natural and don't just look like they got orange and moved the brightness shader down. However, the skin colours don't go very light. I tried to make a character as similar to my own appearance as I could, her hair colour and eye colour were fine, but the skin colour only goes as light as ""Sun Kissed"". I will probably look for a mod for this in the future."
730,Haylez,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Haylez25/,3,,1,111.7,February,16,95,0,1,"I am hooked. Best single player RPG that I have played in a while.As someone who isn't a 'massive' Harry Potter fan, and was more interested in this game for being an open world single player RPG I have been completely blown away. This game exceeded my expectations and then some, and I have loved every second playing it. The world is positively 'magical' and full (I love learning all the lore), there is always something to do and explore, and the story behind the game has me completely invested- even the side characters stories! There's some many little things as well that change within the game, whether through your direct interaction or otherwise, noticing these and searching for them really makes the world feel alive- the attention to detail is fantastic and I rarely use the fast travel mechanics because of it.I am writing this while I am probably just over half way through the game, and I really don't want it to end! I already know I'll be looking to 100% all the achievements and will likely end up playing through this again with different houses and choices. It's not often that I get so hooked on a game that I can play for hours and not realise it, and I really hope that the dev's / publisher behind this continues to expand on this game and its success, with DLCs and additional story lines, even ones focused on the side characters we meet along the way and the impact of certain choices i.e Sebastian, Natty, Poppy etc. (Honestly, it's also really refreshing to buy a game and it be playable right off the bat. Not slapdash 'cello-taped' together and missing content like many other big games seem to be shipped out nowadays.)So If you're been looking at getting this game but for some reason haven't committed to it yet, do yourself a favour and dive right in, because its completely worth your time and well worth the price."

Despite featuring controversial mechanics that may turn off some modern gamers, the game surprisingly pulls them off quite well. The high-quality design of the castle and its surroundings will delight fans, as they get to explore familiar places in greater detail and engage in a variety of activities. While the plot may not be groundbreaking, it serves its purpose in casting the player as the chosen wizard tasked with defeating the main antagonist.

I loved the enormous castle, the fun and sometimes tricky puzzles, and the story. I also cannot compliment the voice acting enough - what an excellent job. I would go through just about every dialogue option there was just to listen to the characters speak and further immerse myself in the world. Yes, the ""student life"" aspect could have been improved, and we could have attended more classes and felt more like a student with a curfew and other restrictions in place. Is the game perfect? No, but what it did it did very well, and - in my opinion - that more than makes up for any lack in other departments.10/10 recommend"

Roaming around hogwarts and finding all the details and secrets is amazing and took up a good chunk of my first 3 hours playing before i really did many missions. The story is ok, wouldnt say its anything spectacular or memorable but its a good experience nontheless. Where this game really shines is its exploration and combat, there are so many challenges to do, things to unlock and puzzles to complete. after every major class you seem to get a spell that unlocks even more challenges too, its a really nice loop where everything isnt just thrown at you instantly. combat is super satisfying with the combo's of spells and beautiful animations. with every spell you learn you can strategize and think how it will fit into your current combo or just think of a new one, you can spend hours mastering this because every spell fits into eachother so well. it would have been nice to have maybe a few more spells and to have a different way to access your ""utility spells"" like you do with some of the other spellls in the game (like alohomora FE). i also would have enjoyed a slightly more expanded merchant system, hogsmead is great as an area and has a lot of nice shops but as soon as you're out of hogmead the only thing vendors seem to have is 3 different types of leaves and some fur, maybe a broom sometimes. addressing the hate this game has been receiving, i think its completely unjustified, this game was made by developers who have gone on record and state they do not agree with JK, they have in fact done a full 180 and implemented a very inclusive system, even going as far as to introduce a trans character, but that isnt good enough is it. you hate the woman and everything even loosely associated with her must burn. grow up or stay mad, this game is a 10/10"

I played on story mode difficulty because I love to explore with minimum combat.  There is so much to do on this game its impossible to be bored. I struggled with small things like how to reskin clothing and redeeming merlin trial rewards but thats what googles for.

No forced live service bullshet like premium currency, always online, weeklies, season pass, and massive cash shop from the get go.It's not Elden Ring but it beats almost all popular AAA games released these days.

There are minor bugs that I have faced, nothing game breaking tho. I wish they would consider allowing us to attack others and maybe multiplayer... The most annoying thing for me is that we cannot buy storage to keep our gear in, I don't want to be forced to do trials to expand my storage.Also maybe consider having more colors in the game and maybe facial hair for characters.Overall, the game is great and there is more for me to discover!"

Last time I saw those insane levels of details was back in 2011 with Skyrim.Just don't play it thinking it's a ""Hogwarts Student Simulator"". Yes, you're a student at the school, but the SCHOOL part of it is barely there, but that doesn't make the game bad by any means, it's still a great game."
756,Murlr,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998168760/,3,,1,70.1,February,12,731,0,1,"After finishing the game and almost doing every collection, i have a bugged NPC that I can't talk to so I'm not currently able to do so, I have to say I loved the game but I do think it has issues.Things I liked:- The story is simple and predictable but I liked it either way, although I was way more invested in the side quests and the characters in them than the main story-line. - Best iteration of Hogwarts I've seen in a video game, the castle is beautiful and just a delight to explore. - Although on the low side, the spells have so much synergy and the combat in this game just flows with some fun challenges to do that the game presents you with. - Finding and doing secrets was mostly enjoyable, especially in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, but if you aim to do a 100% completion it just gets tedious after a while. - Easter eggs and nods to the movies/books are so well done and really enhance the exploration. - The Room of Requirement was just a brilliant add-on to the game that was super fun and useful early and mid-game, but got really irrelevant towards the end.- Flying with the broom was so satisfying, although it did negate some of the puzzles and you could just skip some parts by flying to your destination. Things I didn't really like:- Alohomora mini game was fine the first few times, annoying after the 50th time.- Unskippable Merlin trial cutscene that also gets annoying after the 50th puzzle.- World didn't really feel alive since people don't acknowledge you or the things you do. You can break into peoples homes and they'll just sit or stand there like they were brainwashed. No morality system means no punishment for using unforgivable curses and no one really reacts to you using them. You have a bedroom but never really sleep, never get a stash where you can put any items away, you don't get to interact with any of your housemates outside of quests.-  The Room of Requirement provides you with so many things to build and customize to your liking just so you can never use them. Chairs, sofas, tables; None of them have any purpose other than looking good. This creates the same issue outside of the RoR where there are no ways to sit next to people and just watch their animations, that the studio clearly spent a good amount of time creating, like people getting yelled by Howlers or people just casting spells to climb walls, Peeves harassing students, a one-man orchestra and so on.- Enemy variety is low.- Caves are uninspired and short. Loot is also irrelevant late game since I didn't get a better gear from level 30 to 40.- Most side quests are fetch quests and given by, what appears to be like, the same looking NPC most of the time.- When certain spells and/or parts of the Castle were first introduced, like alohomora and the restricted section in the library, you got to use stealth and interact with people that you don't otherwise do. Prefects and Peeves would stop you or harass you if you were out of your bedroom after dark but that just disappears after the initial quest. Mixing potions and seeing other students do them incorrectly was quite fun but also gone with their starting quest. However, I still think the game is amazing and I certainly got my moneys worth in the end."
757,Pickles,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198818153508/,3,,1,39.0,February,12,486,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a pretty interesting open world single player game. You run around for the main story mission, which is very interesting and a new story for the Hogwarts universe, and you learn spells, make potions, race on broomsticks and much more. There are multiple different kinds of enemies, ranging from environmental to the main story 'super villains' that can attack you through your journey. You make friends, or enemies throughout the game. You have to attend classes in order to progress and learn spells. -'Holy sh!t, what a beginning'-'Where are we going- OMG SO FLUFFY'-""Wait why are the graphics doing that?'When beginning this game, its a wild experience. I was not expecting it to start the way that it ended up starting. You dive right into the lore and story of the game.I will talk a little about the grapics issue later in the review.This game doesn't exactly seem like it would be very friendly to people who have never played any games previously it can be a bit confusing in the start and it kind of has a tutorial, but tutorials only come with every new thing you get in the game, so if you are still confused (and can be impatient like me) you may need to search up how to do things. You could also ask a friend but if you have no friends that play the game it could be hard to navigate. (However that is just my opinion take it as you will)Pretty basic controls for keyboard and it is controller compatible so that's always nice. There is quite a bit of character customisation to be able to make your character pretty much however you want as a student at Hogwarts. Its a little strange that we have haircuts from the 2000's but I like to think that maybe they time travelled into the future and liked what they saw? There is a lot of different things you can do to make money and potions. Someone I know decided to skip the story temporarily right when they could and they went and explored the world. Which is a little risky. Considering you wont have many spells and the enemy's are various levels.The fighting in this game is very interesting and takes good timing and a good lineup of spells/potions to effectively beat your enemy's, it can be hard at first to understand but once you get the hang of it it is pretty fun. Though it can get a bit repetitive once you find your ideal spell's and way of fighting. There are many different mini games that you can play throughout the Hogwarts experience, so far I have personally not beat them. It seems that you can only play the mini games with the limit of the quests they are in, so far I have only seen one other mini game which is in the open world. You can keep pets as well, which can only be kept in your small room that you can decorate, you use them to collect materials which help you with making potions and upgrading things you collect. You can collect materials throughout the world as well to help you with your journey.  There is broom riding and eventually you can get some animal mounts which is fun as well! The last thing I am going to talk about game play wise is the story, it is pretty interesting and easy to get sucked into. You should play through the story at your own pace, however some features that you want have to be gathered through the main story missions. There are loads of side missions, but you have to go and find them yourself unless they are required to finish to move on with the story. As for the open world, I must say that the graphics are absolutely gorgeous other then they can be a bit hard on your PC depending on what you pic. I had to turn mine down to medium and although I am very addicted to the game, I still get annoyed when it stutters every once, sometimes while I am in a boss fight. Sometimes the world decides that it wants to break completely and it seems as though the trees, owls and other students stretch and glitch through the faces of the earth. The only way to fix that is by closing your game and coming back into it. It has only happened to me twice in 30 hours. Sometimes when you escape into the menu the book will also glitch out, it doesn't effect my game play so I continue on, however I do get annoyed by it every once and a while. Other then those glitches which they will hopefully fix, the graphic intensity almost reminds me of Red Dead Redemption 2, but they are not that great when you have to turn the down in order to play without as many stutters. So far this game is not multiplayer, I was speaking to a friend of mine and we both kind of wish there was some sort of multiplayer battle arena or multiplayer Quidditch. You could make your own teams and hassle each other it seems like it would be pretty fun. I have not interacted much with the overall Hogwarts legacy community I have been in the Harry Potter fan community for a while, sometimes their debates can get a bit heated but overall they are awesome people.I have not yet finished the main story line, but so far it seems that once you are done the quests you cant play them again. Hopefully once I am done the game it wont just delete my whole account for finishing, which for some reason is something I am fearing will happen. I haven't even finished the game yet, however I can add an update if something like that does happen. You can make multiple accounts so that you can play in different houses and interact with the different people in the different houses. Other then that it just comes down to if you want to play it again after your first play through or not. Overall its a really amazing game. I am hoping that maybe there will be more features soon, just because sometimes as I said it can get a bit repetitive and in my opinion some of the things they haven't added that they could add, like quidditch, was a totally missed opportunity. I am still however very addicted to the game and I wouldn't say that the missed opportunity are a reason you should not play it. However, I will add this, if you are not a harry potter fan it may not be the game for you. It is clearly very heavily inspired by the harry potter universe. I would also add that if you are not in it for the story, the lore, or you do not like repetitive features in the fighting, I would not recommend this game. If you like exploring the world right off the bat though, this would totally be a fun open world experience."

You can spend hours just wondering around admiring Hogwarts in all it's glory, literally licking walls to see every minute detail.I just can't describe the incredible feeling of finding all the movie and book locations in just the right places. You see the stone obelisks where Hermione sucker punched Malfoy and you know that gamekeeper's hut should be right down the hill, and that's exactly where it is. You see the stairs where Harry meets Malfoy for the first time, and you just know that the Great Hall is right around the corner.

I doubt that any game published in 2023 will surpass Hogwarts Legacy's brilliance.Hogwarts Legacy has everything that RPG open-world game should have - smooth and interesting combat system, great story progression, lots of exploration that can benefit your character in various ways, housing system, as well as mounts and pets. Transmogrification is a great detail as well, no one wants to look like a clown! There are also equipment upgrades and traits that can make your character a lot stronger!Graphic wise, the game is stunning and every single corner looks like it was really made with love and patience. Seasonal changes were such a wonderful surprise. All the side quests I've done so far were not even slightly draining or boring, it's been fun completing them and meeting different characters! Everyone is very unique. Also, all the little events around the castle and beyond make the game feel so alive. Controls on KB&M are really good, haven't tried the controller.Thank you for creating the world I've always dreamed of. ♡Edit: Got 100% challenges done ingame, missing only two more achievements for 100% on Steam, the game is still 10/10. Definitely worth buying."

It's time to talk about Hogwarts Legacy!I am only about... 20 hours into it so this is based solely on that. The game is fine. If you are only looking for a Number. 7/10 as an OWRPG. Probably 8/10 for Potter Gamers.The game is easily the best HP franchise game to date. Going straight into the look of the world, it's really a detailed and expensive world that truly feels older but familiar to the main books. Being able to just traverse the School and surrounding areas without a loading screen is wonderful, and the map is peppered with quest and collectibles that open up as the story goes on making returning a must Side quests even give completion bonuses on top of the standard reward which apparently will lead to your ending. There is usually a Good and Bad choice such as keeping the items... I haven't done the bad but sure it will play to your ending With all this detail is also where the game falls flat in many areas. After a few hours you start seeing the same Picture and Pots that are fragmenting through each other vectors. The school is busy but the students are mostly static or on rails  you can light the floor on fire and no one will react  Say what you will about Cyberpunk but at least they reacted even in it's worst state The open world is filled with Puzzles to do unlike Breath of the Wild (cause that game sucked) it's not barren and filled with only Bomb Puzzles. Each one might be similar sometimes but they utilize all your skills and doesn't punish you harshly if you were not ready for it.The skill tree is basic... 5 routes with minimal trees but they do offer you a chance to have a play style you want.If you want to focus on Stealth or Dark Arts or Potions... Your level is really your only hindered.Flying is pretty solid with upgrades to improve as you move on. Still you are rewarded for traveling by foot as quest can easily be missed.Where the game just... Falls flat ...Some of the side missions to move you forward are unbelievably tedious Zero quidditchZero interaction outside of Quest Givers or Story.House building site that... Could have just been a hub instead of a severally basic house builder.And Wasted time on a basic Tomigatchi simulator where you can place Animals.These features were pointless and seemed like easy additional content instead of focusing on other areas.Again, this is not Skyrim, not Fallout, not RDR2...but it's not bad... And it blows BOTW out of the water.Again Solid 7/10 For now. I can recommend buying it if you are a Potter Fan or need a new time sink that has a very decent story to keep you busy."
779,Senzo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/qSenzop/,3,,1,132.8,February,11,443,0,1,"Mr Potter, it is LeviosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUPDATE: I finished the game and 100% the in-game tracker. Still have 3 achievements left which are only available on 3 other playthroughs (dependent on which House you pick). Overall, the game took me 65 hrs in total to fully complete and I enjoyed every moment of it. So here is the thing..... DON'T BUY IT/ PLAY IT RIGHT NOW, I am going to say the obvious here but it is still very buggy with many quest breaking bugs. 40+ hours in, my game saves got corrupted and the game forces me to play again from the beginning and it took me hours of fiddling to get my original save files back and are able to continue the game normally (even then, my character profile are still corrupted and weird looking). -Some quests will break if you interacted with the quest item prior to starting the quest. -Some collectibles will not be registered but the achievement will unlock on Steam instead. -My character was stuck in a cutscene that prevents them to move inside a story mission and I have to reload from an older save to get out of it, (without an older save, before you start the story mission then you would be screwed). - Stuttering and lag is the most common issue amongst players even if their PC is a beast. Change in season like Fall and Winter will drops your frame rate like crazy. - The funniest bug I encountered was entering the pet haven in your base, and the camera now focuses solely on the pet instead of my main character, whom I can still control but can't do anything else. It is moments like these that the game either hard crashes my PC or I have to shut the game down myself. If this is just any Ubisoft open world games, I would have asked for a refund rather than salvage my old saves to 100% the game. This game does something that no other Harry Potter games have done before, it lets you attend Hogwarts as your character, flying on a broom to explore Hogwarts and Hogsmeade as it was described in the book/ movies. I was immersed in the game despite the horrible FPS and bugs, Hogwarts castle is a sight to behold and thats just 30% of the game map. So for that, this game is can't be any lower than 8/10 for me. Hogwarts Legacy isn't a perfect game, but you can damn well see and feel the passion of the developers who made it, and I genuinely believe that you are doing yourself a disservice if you play the game now before it is patched and fixed."

You can play as if there is no end in the game, and although the challenges are a fun and generous reward system, they also have quite entertaining puzzles. You can also see lots of easter eggs from books and movies.Edit: This game is a masterpiece!"
789,Nawaki,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006368891/,3,,1,53.3,February,11,595,0,1,"I was very sceptical, thought this game will be gimmicky or too corny... a bit like the old games used to be. I was quite surprised to get a solid RPG game with a very nice combat system, decent characters and an interesting story (so far). I am far from finishing the game as I am exploring a lot, but that is another plus - I want to explore, both inside and outside of the castle. Is the game perfect? No, the performance is all over the place, I have random FPS drops at seemingly random locations, and the game stutters every now and then but it is not common enough to bother me, it might bother some. Also, the broom flying controls are... clumsy. Once you get used to them it works well enough but it took me some time. So overall:+ Combat+ Exploring+ story+ characters+ Feels like Hogwarts + customizations - FPS drops- Stuttering- Flying controls (subjective)"
790,Cloak,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShuffleFox/,3,,1,38.4,February,11,514,0,1,"Now i will try not to go too in-depth with my review as i only have 14 hours in the game and i believe i've only scratched the surface of the main story. I'm not the biggest Potterhead in the world, i've only watched the movies once or twice each. So approaching this from a purely subjective standpoint i will talk about the main attractions and what i think about them.The story drives home the Harry Potter feeling spectacularly and feels pretty immersive. It really did provide me what i feel like is an answer to the question ""How would it be if i existed in this universe?"" The Main quests are enjoyable even if they aren't the most action-packed all the time but they do provide you with a sense of progression each time. A new unlock, a new system, a new mechanic.The Open-World is quite vast. Travel is easy and there are numerous fast travel locations that can be accessed without any hassle. Or if you'd rather take the scenic route, the various travel methods feel fluid and dynamic. Providing a smooth experience.  Side-quests are abundant however most of them require you to have unlocked certain mechanics to complete. While some only appear after you've acquired said abilities some will still be available if you don't have the required ability, effectively locking you out from that side-quest until you progress enough with the main story. Which isn't too much of an annoyance but it is there. Other side-content such as encounters that are marked on the map like dungeons and puzzles provide content too. And there actually is an incentive to do them thanks to the Field Guide Challenges. Otherwise things such as these usually get forgotten and only get brought back up from their graves for those who are ambitious enough for a 100% completion.Combat was one i was quite curious about. And i am satisfied for the most part. I chose the Hard difficulty as a gamble to see if it would be unfair and needlessly annoying or if it would provide me a challenge similar to that of a Souls-Like game. The game is still relatively easy even on Hard and even against enemies that are higher level than i. (Leveling also seems to be quite easy as i am already Level 20 out of 40) Combat itself is rather simple. Revolving around basic attacks, timed-blocks and dodges. Like Sekiro and Mortal Shell, the game provides you with an indicator when an attack is approaching via circles around your head. Such as an orange one for blockable and red for unblockable attacks. Which ultimately makes dealing with enemies quite easier. Spell Sets are also quite clever and being able to update them on the fly is a relief. It does feel like an MMO Skill Rotation after a while though as you know your favorite combos and you will keep doing them because they are most effective which starts to make combat a little bit repetitive but i am not too bothered by that. The combat also rewards you for being skillful such as keeping a high combo will reward you with  So overall i am satisfied with the combat system it provides. Can't really talk about the one-time use items such as potions and throwables as they don't fit my play-style.Foraging and farming is like any other RPG. A chill activity that only stays fun for so long but you can't really blame them for doing it by the book. At least the Field Guide Challenge progression keeps you motivated during all such activities.The amount of spells in the game -although i'd likely have wanted more- is enough and it  Spells are managed by cooldowns when you are close to enemies but unhindered when out of combat which is a very smart move. The Stealth mechanics of the game are also very classic. Invisible circle + cone of detection around the enemy. Invisibility reduces the effect but doesn't remove it. Nothing too special but for those that enjoy it, it is a nice little addition.Those are the things that had my interest mostly so i will conclude the review here. I may update it later if i remember anything."

I know at the time I wrote this review, my hours are low but it's because I also own on console and been playing a lot there, so I am more then valid in my response :)Graphics: They are amazing! There are some great details in comparison to get a superb visual aspect and the game runs smooth on maxed out graphics with RTX on. Really, it's probably so far, the prettiest game released to date! Audio: Amazing, you've got all the sounds, musical tunes and atmosphere you expect from this universe and more. Seriously keep all your sound on max because it's stunning!Controls: I personally use a controller because it's easier to play and get around the game with this compared to a keyboard and mouse.Game-play and everything else after: So the game is in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, but do not expect Harry Potter, this is set in the 1800s so before he was even liquid form :)Anyway, you are a 5th year student attending fresh and kind of forced into the world of magic and it all starts to unravel around you, with lots of twists and turns along the way.The story is superbly done, it's so good! I am playing it twice!You can learn skills in a unique way, swap and change, go good or bad, evil or nice and change the dynamic of the game in a way to fit your play style. There is an incredible amount of content to really sink your time into and go out exploring in the open world! Buying different items, progressing different sets, dressing different and just doing what you want!I am not going to spoil this anymore, but this is the game we've been waiting for! If you love Harry Potter or the Wizarding World, then this is 100% the best game on the market for you!There is a lot I could say but then I am not writing a novel to lose interest!Skills, powers, dress code, learning, exploring it's all here!Moving portraits, no Quiditch though, but maybe a DLC? Everything else is here!There does look like DLC might be coming from some of the locked off area's you can see, which I hope is true and I also hope that co-op is added.

794,Exeel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/huth321/,3,,1,29.9,February,11,416,0,1,After playing the game for almost 20hrs I would say the Hogwarts is well worth getting and playing. Gameplay: 7Exploration: 9Design: 8Graphics: 7Tech: 6Story: 7Quests: 7NPC's: 8Dialogue: 7I have never had so much fun just exploring the world for what it offers. Riding a broom is fun but nothing beats running around on foot for things that you might have missed while on a broom flying around. There is some fun hidden quarks of humor in dialogue from the random npc's that you find scattered around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. Its even fun to watch 2 sets of armor have a bit of a fight. There are some major tech issues with fps drops and shuttering but these only happen when in Hogwarts or Hogsmeade were there is a heavy npc count. There is a few in the open world with this issue but it rarely happens. The game with all it has to offer is a 7/10 but this review my change based on any future updates or additions. I can not wait to jump back into Hogwarts to continue exploring and finding all of its secrets it has to offer.  I don't Mind spoilers ether as it makes me want to go see it and experience it with my own eyes through my own hard work of playing through the story to learn how it all happens and to see how it all ends.Also for someone who likes to do 3Ddesign in blender the work in the design of the castle is awe inspiring and makes me want to work harder in that field of work. Thank You to the Dev's for giving me more chances to test my skills to see how far I can go even if I am only starting out.

The excitement of attending charms and potions classes with tasks to complete, the thrill of sparing with fellow students in duels, roaming the great hall and staring at the starring ceiling for as long as i can, to walk in the corridors at night; disturbing portraits with lumos spells :P, all were a dream i had when i watched the first few harry potter movies. Meeting fantastics beasts, rescuing them, taming and feeding them were also a really sweet indulgence i so wanted, and flying the skies on Hippogriff back was a soothing experience.I would really like to thank avalanche studios and Portkey games for making Hogwarts Legacy, and to enable me to revisit my younger self, and making me relive the fantasies of being a part of this world."

Dream came true. Usually i don't pre order. But i had to even more. :trolol: I am very easy to satisfy! (was already satisfied to hear a new game comes out)I was very confident about this game, since i followed it (end of 2021). What can i say.. it's magic, probably. Already told my boss that i am attending a school after work. Didn't tell him that it was Hogwarts.Long story, no sense..I made the Wizard Test online at Warner Bros website. I wanted to go Slytherin.. but the hat made it's decision. So.. i am a Hufflepuff. Connected my account with the game, scanned the QR code and got all the goodies.The intro, the music is beatiful and truly epic. Goosebumps and shivering. Voice acting, animations. I am playing the game with a controller. Super comfy, gives me bit of nostalgic feeling. The controller feels super nice to play with. Also the cast/spells and interactions you do with it.Overall i am astonished so far (remember i am easily satisfied). Put the game on hardmode if you want it ""more"" Souls-like feeling (still - easy), and roll around. It's truly amazing. And i am glad i pre-ordered and started early. I usually don't do this anymore. But this is just an amazing experience for each wizard or sorceress, no-thing else. :trolol:I am playing since Tuesday.First off, no game breaking bugs or anything like that. A few happy little accidents, but that didn't bother me. The exploring of it all (from start to the first run through the school) is just WOW. Taking my time everywhere. If you open menue, inventory and map you can see already what's ahead of you. The map and content is just big and you'll have a blast exploring it.There's so much love in every detail. Spot of interest? cast a spell! Something flying around? cast a spell! Something to reveal? You won't believe but, cast a spell! The more you reveal with one of the first spells.. the more you get addicted to that nicely ""bing"" let's you use it even more.Just to find from where that ""bing"" is. In the beginning you might not be quite sure where to look. Use it as much as needed. Sometimes you have to be close to that ""bing"" and look at that ""bing"".There is a story, explanation of background from the ""bings"" you reveal .. whatever.. btw. you can pet all cats you come across.If you still reading, thank you for your time. I wish i could explain it to you how it feels for me, better.. but i'm not a wizard.This game will only get better. It's already everything i ever wanted since the PS1. :)Enjoy wizards & sorceress'"

So instead of review bombing, celebrate that.

I've played 7 hours (ingame time) at this point*, and am at 5% for Quests, just finishing the first day at Hogwarts. For other progress - Combat, Exploration, and Room of Requirement are at 0%, Field Guide Pages is 41%. There is so much to explore, and I can't even open locked doors yet. Combat so far has been good, though I only have the first 4 spells unlocked*, 2 of which are Lumos (a flashlight) and Reparo (repairing broken stuff). Game looks fantastic and I have not had any performance issues so far, running at the default Ultra settings at 4k and haven't dropped below 100fps - though I do have a 13900k and 4090 :)  There were some slight lip sync issues which I don't even notice unless looking for it, and a couple times the robe physics looked weird.My biggest complaints so far:Transmog is per item, not gear slot. So every time you get a new piece of gear you need to reset the appearance. And considering most games don't even launch with any transmog, I'll take it.Making potions you had to make 1 at a time and wait 15-30sec for each. At least let us make them in bulk so we can go grab a drink or something while it brews.The best thing about the game is the keybindings though! No issues rebinding anything, ESDF works great, there is a hardcoded  but only when that is the only key you can press. It actually took me over 30 minutes to set up all the binds as there are about 200 things you can change, all with primary and secondary options. * Couldn't post the review until game went live, and have played a bit more since I originally wrote it. Currently up to 16% Quest progress now at 11 hours played, and just got Combat and Exploration progress above 0, and I have a couple more spells unlocked. Still can't open locks though."

If you really want it, wait for sales. Aside from the excellent visuals and fun flashy combat system the game doesn't have much else to offer.Unfortunately, the story is not just generic or mediocre, it's borderline non-existent. Although the prologue seems promising, the pacing quickly drowns, because without filler, the story would take 3 hours max. It offers practically no memorable characters. More than that -  you can count on one hand the characters who posses some sort of interesting personality or depth.The main story line offers practically no drama and fails to create any emotion within the player whatsoever. The ""philosophical question"" it presents has a laughably obvious answer. The main villain is shallow and you barely get to see him. With such approach the player has zero interest in progressing the story.Another thing this game does is it tries very hard to not create conflict for the player. Pretty much all people you meet will instantly be friendly to you and praise you  as a genius.The story offers no variability. There's no role play of any sort. Dialogue options are mostly 2 and don't influence anything. Your Hogwarts house doesn't change anything. It doesn't matter what choices you make or if you use dark magic or not. There are 3 endings and in the end you literally say to your teacher which ending you want.Most of the quests are generic mmo-style garbage, like: kill x this, bring me x that, go talk to them etc. Also MAIN quests sometimes reuse locations or just take a previous quest and just remix it a bit. Many times you have to go talk to a person and that would be it. The actual quest will appear after some sizeable time has passed. The open world is vast but all it has is Ubisoft-like filler (bandit camps, puzzles and go fetch quests). Also to learn new spells you have to do grind quests, and there's forced stealth in the game. Have fun :)The combat, on the other hand, is done very well. It is fun and has a lot of variety. The animations are juicy, and overall it makes you feel like a powerful wizard. Among the minuses I can list some enemies (like trolls) teleporting to you during attacks, even if you are on the other side of the arena, the spell casting panel not being the most convenient thing in the world and sometimes the game feeling a little too easy. Also the bosses are very boring.Graphically the game looks very good. It offers beautiful views, interesting visuals and overall is very immersive. The Hogwarts castle is very big, beautiful, authentic and filled with details. If you like exploration, this game is for you. Plus there are broom flights, magical beasts and other cool stuff. The only minuses I can think of are npc animations are sometimes stiff.The resource management (for potions and gear upgrades) is very grindy. Potions have real-time timer to cook. The magic lacks interactivity with the world."

You could cast Avada Kadavra, and they just go about their businessAdults ask you to go to the damn forbidden forest??

No remorse or second thought.  All that kinda killed the charm for me, sorry.Huge respect to the environment team though. Outstanding job."
829,IJspegel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Strava/,3,,1,93.9,March,1,"2,624",0,1,"tl;dr:7/10 - must buy if you're a fan of the Wizzarding world, wait for a sale if you're not. The wizzarding world was the constant franchise of early 2000's. For people like me who went to middle school around the time the books and movies were released, it was a pop culture phenomenon. It was everywhere, you read the books, saw the movies, played those early EA video game adaptations back when they were good. And after the 8th movie came out you were around the same age as the characters, you were done with school and heading out into the real world. This franchise means a lot to the 'millennial' generation and I'd say Avalanche has done a great job capturing what made the franchise so special all those years ago, while still taking into account that the target audience isn't twelve anymore.Fans of the franchise will love this game. Hogwarts has everything you'll recognize from the movies, and even stuff from the books that never made it to the silver screen. The smallest things, like the potion ingredient store closet or the jail cell on the roof they kept Sirius Black in for all of 2 seconds in the third movie. The House Elf kitchens and the ghost ballroom from the books, they're all there for you to discover. It's a nostalgia trip and that alone is worth the price of admission, IF you are a fan.Avalanche has done everything it can to make this game appeal to all, unfortunately they listened to the twitter side of the internet for what would appeal to them. The response this game has gotten online is nothing short of hilarious, the very people this game is made for are trying all that they can to stop people from playing it. Their whims are being catered to at every turn. From the for 1790's Scotland laughably diverse student body and faculty, merchants and townsfolk, to the sexuality of every side character seemingly being non-straight. You'd think they'd eat this game up, but no. I hope that sends a message to the industry that you can not please these people. For people less familiar with the source material, or those who never really cared that much, this game must seem a bit mid. When you get out of Hogwarts you are greeted with a massive overworld that is completely littered with useless stuff. Mostly consisting of what are called Merlin trials, which require you to do a tedious little puzzle to trigger an animation. This gets you inventory upgrades, so you'll have to do at least a few, but there a dozens of these menial things everywhere. As well as the caves, which are all copy pasted from the same handful of templates and get you nothing other than a piece of gear which is always worse than what you already have. You can completely ignore these but they will always clutter up your compass, map and minimap.Combat is simple and can be trivialized with potions and plants, I finished the whole thing challenge dungeons and all on normal difficulty but it never actually got difficult. Maybe that changes on higher difficulties, but the combat isn't what makes this game worth playing anyway.This game shines in it's presentation, like I said, if you are a fan of the wizzarding world you will love this game. But it doesn't quite capture the (pardon the phrasing) magic of going to a magic school and having your own adventure. I think most of that is to do with the lack of interaction with your classmates. You do your main adventure mostly on your own being aided only by a professor. Your classmates are relegated to side quests, which I think is a shame. Because what connected the audience to the story of the books and movies was building this bond with new friends and together becoming stronger than any adversary. Here you are the chosen one who could've done it all by themselves.Portkey games has this phone game 'Hogwarts Mystery' that does that way better. I hope they decide to port that to PC in some from or another now that this is such a rousing success.  Who you are in this game is vague, your origins are not revealed. Who are you? Why are you only joining Hogwarts as a fifth year? Where do you come from? It seems there's a prelude missing and kind of an important one. The choices you make along the way also don't matter to the story one bit.  Avalanche clearly want you to spend the bulk of your time in Hogwarts. You get a whole room all to yourself for you to interact with animals, build the perfect pen for them. Create your own space decorated to your liking, you can sink hours into just that if you wanted to. Technically it runs well enough. It runs on the Unreal 4 engine, so there's still pop-in everywhere when you're outside zipping through the map on a broom. It also does a small frame drop every time you charge into a different area of the overworld map. Inside Hogwarts that all goes away. It does have to load a second or two at doors at times still though. So you can see the seams in this seamlessly connected world, but they didn't really bother me.Enemy AI is single minded and dumb, when you blast someone of a platform or just remove them far enough from their path, they have to run all the way back to where they started. They won't attack you during their little hike until they get there. None of them will ever dodge out of the way.The amount of content here is nothing to sneeze at, and considering the success of this game I'd be surprised if Warner Bros. didn't come out with some cut content as DLC. There's a screenshot of a dragon on this very storepage that is just not in this game. The made character models fro dementors that are only used in one cutscene for one Hufflepuff specific quest in Azkaban. We only hear about stuff happening in the ministry. Definitely room for expansion.For fans of franchise this is an absolute must-buy. For everyone else, you should probably wait for a sale. It's a fun romp, but like I said, without the nostalgia trip it loses a lot of it's appeal."

Combat is cumbersome and the story drags...  Gear is tedious to manage and awful looking and just gets replaced a few minutes later. Couldve been a great RPG, but its not. If your HP obsessive its likely heaven, but not for your average gamer.  Get it on sale and its good buy, but not at full price.70 GB of updates after initial install. What a joke of a game.- Update after some more play, its still ""Meh"" But some of it can be fun. Id get it on sale if you like RPGs- Update again, its pretty good. most frustrating are some of the collectible and puzzled in ""dungeons"" Can be very tedious. World is HUGE and pretty fun to mess around with. I still give it a ""Meh"" rating, but overall 6/10 in general. 8/10 to just play around with to kill time."
840,Snow🧸,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Snowkawa/,7,,0,21.0,February,13,"1,371",0,1,"It’s a beautiful world but it feels empty because none of the characters ever react to anything you do. Outside of quests, NPCs are about as interactive as a table or a chair, you can shoot spells or curses at them but they don’t move or say anything.It’s not much of an RPG, it’s an open world action adventure game with some side quests and almost no customization to speak of. Cyberpunk 2077 removed the RPG label from marketing before release, but somehow, that game still managed to incorporate more RPG elements than Hogwarts Legacy.Performance on PC is also very bad, frame drops are prevalent in both Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and the day 1 patch fixed none of them. I have a 3090 and 64GB of ram but my frame rate with RTX disabled hits the low 20s, enabling RTX makes the game unplayable."

Every game has its negative parts, I do not have a very good PC and I had a bad time because I am someone who has a lot of things open on the computer and on top of that I shared it on discord with my friends, what happened was that it crashed and not a few times. The first time it crashed I didn't lose my game but the second or third time it crashed I lost my game and I was angry because I thought it was going to be impossible to recover but after reading a Reddit page that had happened the same thing I ended up being able to recover it, I don't know how. Finally, I wanted to say that Hogwarts is a labyrinth to say the least and also there are some combats that are a bit boring. As I said before it is a very good game but if you have a not very good PC I recommend that you play it on console."

RAM game eats very much, so if you have even 16 gigabytes of RAM, be prepared to play with lags. The prologue works well, but after the prologue, you can forget about optimizing the game.

Hogwarts is absolutely beautiful. The game is enthralling from the on set and immediately pulls you in. Immersion and the scale and beauty of this game is just second to none. The story thus far remains very interesting and there is definitely a sense of character progression both in power and character development.I am truly loving the scale and size of the game and the amount of content is insane, there is quite a lot to do and a lot of collections and that just keeps you set to explore more and more. Hogwarts castle is just insanely huge and intricate with so many secrets to explore and epic encounters to watch inside and outside of Hogwarts where the world does fully feel magically alive.The games foundation is well set and can only get bigger and better. I do hope they add multi player features and eventually add Quidditch to the game. I am very impressed as someone who wasnt going to get the game immediately and do recommend the game to anyone who has grown up watching harry potter. Its our own little slice of the harry potter world and  we get to fully dive in and explore the very best of it."

868,LoL feLi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Feeliii/,3,2,1,15.9,February,11,249,0,1,"""Hogwarts Legacy is a role-playing video game set in the wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling in the Harry Potter universe. Players take on the role of a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, attending classes, participating in magical duels, and exploring the castle and its surroundings. The game was released in 2021 and has received mixed reviews from players and critics.One of the standout features of Hogwarts Legacy is its beautifully crafted world. The game's graphics are stunning, and the attention to detail in creating Hogwarts and its surroundings is impressive. The environments are rich and immersive, and the game does an excellent job of bringing the wizarding world to life. Players will feel like they have stepped into a magical world as they explore the castle, attend classes, and interact with other characters.Another highlight of Hogwarts Legacy is the character customization. Players can create their own student and choose from a variety of races, including humans, elves, and half-giants. The customization options are extensive, and players can choose from a wide range of hair styles, clothing, and accessories to create a unique character. This is a great feature, as it allows players to personalize their experience and make their character feel like their own.The gameplay in Hogwarts Legacy is a mix of action and RPG elements. Players will attend classes and participate in magical duels, using spells and potions to defeat their opponents. The combat system is intuitive and fun, and players will find themselves becoming more confident in their abilities as they progress through the game. Additionally, players can explore the castle and its surroundings, solving puzzles, and discovering hidden secrets.One of the criticisms of Hogwarts Legacy is its lack of replay value. Once players have completed the main storyline, there isn't much to do in terms of side quests or additional content. This is a disappointment, as players may feel like they have exhausted the game's content once they have completed the story.Another issue with Hogwarts Legacy is its writing. The game's story is somewhat underwhelming, and the characters are not particularly well-developed. While the game does an excellent job of creating an immersive world, the writing is somewhat lackluster and fails to engage players on an emotional level. This is a shame, as a more compelling story could have elevated the game to new heights.In conclusion, Hogwarts Legacy is a well-crafted game that offers players a chance to step into the wizarding world. The graphics and world-building are impressive, and the character customization is a great feature. However, the lack of replay value and underwhelming writing are significant drawbacks that may turn some players off. If you're a fan of the Harry Potter universe, Hogwarts Legacy is worth checking out. But if you're looking for a more robust RPG experience, you may want to look elsewhere.""- ChatGPT"

Graphics are 10/10 - However, I have had to tweak with settings running a 3080ti. Getting stutters every once n awhile. Runs just as good in ultra as it does on medium settings. Not game breaking but needs a slight performance patch. (keep in mind 2000 series users, I have reports of players having trouble with the 2070-2080 cards)Sound is 10/10 - However, I have had issues with character dialog where the volume level of people speaking rises and falls in different conversations. Leaving me adjusting my volume level. Also the sound has issues with direction. Depending which way your character turns/faces you can't hear people talking anymore. Personally this greatly annoys me.Gameplay Combat 9/10 - Could have been better but its good enough to keep your interest throughout the game. Gameplay - 6/10 - This is where the game starts to take some hits. Between tedious potion brewing, Gathering resources, Character development, Gear (No shortcut having to re-equip cosmetics and gear constantly), Gear Progression, Menu Navigation, Choices don't actually matter, No Good/Evil system. Its all super annoying and time consuming.Controls - 10/10 - Now keep in mind I'm using PS5 controller only. And it plays and feels flawless. (Except when trying to mount your broom. Keep in mind that they need to fix the L1 and O key combination times. They way they have it setup you have to wait 2 seconds before pressing O otherwise you'll just dodge)Should you Pre-Order? - Honestly the Dark Arts Cosmetics are probably the best looking gear I've found in the game so far so its worth the extra $10 in my opinion. Especially if you want to try and get as close as possible to a dark wizard. All the other gear looks like ♥♥♥♥. Don't get me wrong this is a great game well worth the triple A price. I myself plan to 100% the game and spend over 100 hours on it. If you like Harry Potter even a little bit I'd say its well worth your money. The story and feel of the game is great.Its just a real shame it fell short of being a true masterpiece."

This is a highly enjoyable game with beautifully crafted environments, unique characters and fun fighting situations.  It's like ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" of fantasy games with it's massive open-world.  For fans of Terry Pratchett's ""Discworld"" book, game, film universe; this is as closest we will ever get to having a game in the same vein.  BTW, Pratchett came up with a LOT of what is in the Potterverse well before J.K. created it.  Hogwarts is like the Unseen University, just more beautiful and with professors that give a crap about education and Hogsmeade is a smaller form of Ankh-Morpork.  Yes, there are the occasional bugs, but that is going to be expected in such a huge world game.  Hopefully the devs will be more open-minded in regards to fixing them than Rockstar, since they just gave up on RDR2."

The devs have focused too much on an empty and soulless open world and a narrative ill-fitted for a lone student.

I'm sure I'm missing a lot of the easter eggs and details, but it's abundantly obvious that this game was a labor of love.The story and voice-acting is the best I've seen in a video game, right up there with The Witcher 3 or the Arkham series games. The ability to adjust the gameplay to your individual style is exceptional and the graphics are gorgeous.I've now purchased all 7 of the books and have begun my journey into the world of wizards and witches.

I don't understand the ""Open world"" effect on the consumer mind, causing rave reviews despite lack of content. The gameplay is almost entirely designed for your brain to go AFK and just autopilot like an automaton, the ""puzzles"" aren't actually puzzles and offer no challenge, every single part of the game is made to handhold you through it. The collectibles aren't even fun because they aren't tied to any real challenges, they're just log completion percentages or main quest rewards or random loot chest drops.One of the main side ""puzzles"" you complete over and over again is literally just simple 2nd grade algebra and assigning the numbers 0-9 to a series of symbols that never change and are presented IN ORDER on a door. At first I thought you at least had to count the number of limbs the creatures had, but nope, you just have to count 0-9 left to right on the door.It had a lot of potential but the devs seem to have a philosophy of ""No barrier to entry"" which means everything has to be dumbed down to the lowest possible ""difficulty"".I'll keep playing to see if it gets any better and update my review if it does but I doubt it. Kind of just going through the motions really.ALSO A *BIT* MORE OF A MEME POINT BUT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE COLLECTIBLE CHOCOLATE FROGS, WIZARD CARDS, OR FLAVORED BEANS IN THIS GAME WITH LIKE 20 COLLECTION SYSTEMS, LITERALLY WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?Edit: It's getting worse the further I go on. Why doesn't potion making have a minigame or mechanic? Or herbology? Or the beastkeeping system? Why is everything just *get resource* *use resource* *wait for timer*? Why are Merlin Trials completely braindead ""Cast single spell on nearby objects""? It's all chores. Where is the gameplay? It's just more and more and more and more examples of the devs being afraid to put ANY barriers to entry or inconveniences, and failing to produce an enjoyable game as a result."

The team who worked on this did a solid job on the world with a tremendous amount of details. The whole environment seems alive with interactivity, and the scenery is beautiful. The moving pictures, the various dialogue interactions and events, the little items you can move, etc. all come together to create a truly unique experience and makes it feel like you are really part of the Harry Potter universe. Also, the fact that you can roam around Hogwarts castle and the surrounding areas without loading screens is a great touch that makes you just want to explore and helps to not break the immersion. There is so much to do and see with story quests and side quests available, as well as dungeons, puzzles, item collection, customization, and different scenarios for each house, which adds to the replayability. Even more, no pay-to-win or DLC microtransactions to ruin the experience. So far, the game has run without any hiccups or bugs after about 10 hours of gameplay. I can honestly say I am happy to have spent the money on this game and feel I have gotten my money's worth, as recent games have been lackluster to disappointing overall.

Terus kemarin tanggal 10 februari juga banyak SJW di discussion forumsnya jadi makin ragu sama gamenya tapi emang intuisi tidak bisa diragukan karena dari awal emang liat gamenya kok kek yg bagus gitu ya, pas udah jamnya early access jadi tangan sangat gatak buat beli alhasil beli lagi untuk ke 3 kalinya tapi yang Deluxe Edition biar sekalian bisa download duluan mumpung Wifi di Thailand kemarin lagi bagus bagusnya.Ternyata gamenya keren abies, biasanya main Fallout atau Elder Scroll itu agak cepet bosen karena walaupun seru tapi rasanya sangat datar aja gitu seru yang buat saya 2 jam perhari udah cukup.Tapi somehow ini game emang bener2 nagih. Explorasi dan vibes tiap region itu bener bener beda. Dari Hogwarts yang bener bener wah ancient abis, Hogsmade yang bener2 homy and cozy, terus Forbiden Forest yang bener2 vibesnya terlarang banget itu bener bener point utama yg gabikin nyesel keluar duit hampir sejuta buat game ini. Walaupun memang variasi musuhnya terkesan repetitive tapi explorasi, view, dan vibesnya yang bikin saya nyaman sama game ini. Dan ya memang tidak ada game yg sempurna ya bund, kadang lagi asik asik liat pemandangan tau tau fps drop dari 50 ke 30 tapi selebihnya itu lancar dan masih sangat playable buat dinikmati. Dialogue scenenya juga udah di set jadi NPCnya ga bener bener random penempatannya, sangat bagus banget drpd Fallout yang kadang kalau kita maksa buat ngobrol tau tau ngebug entah kemana.Overall ini game 9/10 buat gamer seperti diri saya yang suka cepet bosen sama gamenya, sayang aja ada bbrp hal kaya Quiditch dll yang entah tidak di implementasikan atau belum di implementasikan, harapannya cuma kalau bisa ini game ada ekspansi lebih via DLC baik kelanjutan cerita ataupun fitur multiplayer/ local coop karena somehow battle sendirian rasanya agak hampa dan terlalu OP. Mungkin kalau ada fitur companion seperti Fallout dan Elder Scroll bakalan lebih immersive, tapi ya we know its a different developer. Anyway , i still dont want to complete the main story as a Ravenclaw, because the house have many and long sidequest that i wanted to explore first rather than completing the main story, because why not."

The combat is how I expected, it has its kinks but is pretty easy and fun once you get the hang of everything. The flight system is better than I expected it to be. I would have loved a bit more freedom to shape my character and their relationships (i find the majority of the side people to be kinda meh) but this is fantastic groundwork for any future game. Overall i'd give it a solid 7.5/10Edit: As I'm playing more i'm updating my score to 8.5 the game has impressed me more than I expected."

The combat is great and spells are fantastic.The NPC athomsphere can be a bit dull at times if you compare it to games like Red Dead Redemtion 2.The performance is a bit unstable at times so Id be careful if you dont have high end Hardware.The only negative thing that stuck me is the forced diversity through-out the story. I personally don't care about your ethnicity or homeland country Id rather just wanna live into the fantasy without thinking of modern politicts.If you are a potter fan Id recommend getting this asap. If not then wait for a sale"

928,buura,https://steamcommunity.com/id/newFOXPROJECT/,3,,1,36.7,February,14,259,0,1,"Hello to all game enthusiasts..I've never written a review for a game, but I couldn't resist this one..Yes, I love the Harry Potter universe. Let's start with that:Every scene and every landscape in the game is a masterpiece. Each element has been carefully crafted, and it's clear that a lot of effort has been put into it.The game truly reflects the world we imagined from the books. The visuals from the movies and books have been brilliantly synthesized. Instead of using the names from the original story to sell the game, they've been carefully avoided. The references are just right. The game takes place in the 1800s, so there's a different teaching staff, different enemies, and different problems. The variety of enemies and the way the story progresses gave me the feeling of detective work that I had in the books, and like in the books, you find yourself in the middle of a big problem, and you collect bits of information from the many events around you. The story telling in the game, and the progression of information and mystery, made me very happy.The game, like classic Harry Potter games, is full of puzzles that you have to solve and hidden secrets that you have to uncover all around the castle, and solving these and working for them is really fun.The graphics are beyond great. I didn't encounter any bugs or optimization problems. The spell effects, inspired by the movie, are fantastic and look great. I can't find anything to say about the design of the school, it's perfect. Even after spending a long time, it still continues to enchant.Regarding the music, the original music from the movie was not abandoned, and generally new fantastic music has been created based on that theme.The story has a completely new Hogwarts and teaching staff. The characteristics of the teaching staff are completely different from the original story. For example, you may not see the professor of dark arts as a bad character. They have characters that are quite intriguing. In terms of voice acting, they've found a voice that's very similar to Daniel Radcliffe's, and generally his reactions are compatible with Harry Potter. This didn't bother me.The only thing I think the game is missing is that the chosen school sections could be a bit more effective. I would have liked more specific tasks for the chosen section after selection, and more tasks for your section...In conclusion, the game is amazing. It is not unrealistic to think that the producer will make us happy with new tasks and expansions in the future.I wish everyone good games and I definitely recommend playing this game."

It's gonna be up there with the contenders for greatest open world gams.I have critizise , It would be the inventory system, especially for your gear.While i do appriciate the transmog system, It's done to a certain overkill. As many of the gear you pick up looks straight up goofy at some times while others are super cool, they cann both take away parts of the emersion in the cutscenes . You still want to have the best stats possiible and will have to equip the trannsmog every time you pick up somethiing better.I wish you had an outtfitt systems that is easily changeeable, kind of like they have in RDR22, Same goes for mask and hood beiing able tto toogle on and of by the press of 1 buttom (preferbly with animatinnn in game,) Instead of having to navigatre trhough the UI all the time.This so i dont mistakenly roll up with the soriting hats ugly sister  In the dark arttts class, like I'm some Redneck-Wizard!Other tthan that 10/10"

I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and having read the books and watched the movies, this was something that had caught my eye for many years!As many others have already mentioned, this game feels like such a well worked piece of art, in which the devs have really taken their time with constructing the most true to life game possible, whilst staying true to the nature of Hogwarts. I have no doubt that future optimization patches further down the line will help smoothen out some FPS drops that many seem to be reporting, including myself. The soundtrack is beautiful and the audio in this game really needs to be experienced with headphones on for the full immersion experience. If you're a fan of Harry Potter in general, I would highly recommend this game. Even if you're not and would like to experience a beautiful open world RPG with the ability to learn many spells, meet fun and new characters, and enjoy collecting and exploring a great world, then I'd recommend this game too at full price.Take care and happy gaming team :)"

Especially considering the state in which other games have released in the past few years.I was never a fan of the HP universe and the drama around this game is just funny to me. The quality of the experience this game provides speaks for itself. Its a great adventure for fans and people who simply dont care about HP.Spells feel JUST RIGHT!World is very open and you can even reach max lvl and finish main story and still miss lots of great things. One super annoying thing in my opinion is how somehow its more ""woke"" than it should... lets be honest... Its year what? 1800something? Trans? Openly gay people? Yeah sure... No racism?  Its truly a magical world XDI really struggle with how people can think its ok to prosecute people for even playing this game... Its a good game. Deal with it :)"

Combat is pretty fun and can be challenging, even on the normal difficulty; and the story is not that bad, either. PC version has some technical issues, you might have to force yourself to play on Low settings until the devs patch the game. Nonetheless, if you have the money, go for it 👍However, I know there are MANY people unsure out of fear of backlash from friends or rando's on the internet due to the IP being owned by J. K. Rowling. Trust me, I hate her too and am annoyed with the nonsense she spouts from her bigoted brain of hers, I DO NOT support her views or values whatsoever. That doesn't mean I can't enjoy anything that came from what OTHERS have made based from her world; I still enjoy the movies, and I most certainly am enjoying Hogwarts Legacy.You are not a terrible person for getting this game, you are not a transphobe, you are not aiding in her already deep pockets. You are valid, you should do what you want. Boycott if you want to boycott, but DO NOT bully or harass others for buying/playing this game. If you REALLY care that much, use the $60 to donate towards a charity that benefits those that J.K. hates so much. Remove the art from the artist; if the very same actors who have played their role in the Harry Potter movies DISOWN and REMOVE THEMSELVES from J.K. and her ideals, then you can too."

The game is reasonably well optimized. Compared to some of the other ♥♥♥♥ fests we experienced in the last few years, this seems like a rarity in the AAA game industry.The game itself seems very fun. It's definetly something people should enjoy playing at their own pace as the atmosphere, from the bits I've experienced so far, feels very well put together and fitting for the Harry Potter universe. You can see the love people poured into this game and I have no regrets supporting such great products. Kudos to everyone involved and keep up the great work!"

Architecture, textures, sounds, atmosphere,... everything feels like straight out of the movies.And most importantly there are NO MICROTRANSACTIONS ! (those would be a deal breaker for me)Combat is enjoyable and can be great fun when trying new spell combinations or making use of the environment.Definitely better than Witcher 3.The biggest downside are the challenges.I mean they are pretty good and there is great variety, however you have to do them too many times.Merlin trials were very anoying and too repetitive for me because I wanted maximum inventory size.Despite that I really enjoyed just run or fly around and explore without knowing where I'm going or what to expect ahead.I also spent lot of time decorating my room of requirement and magical worlds for my creatures.But I was expecting more assets so there it definitely room for improvement either by patches,DLC or probably most likely MODs.Increasing creature limit would be nice as 12 is way too small.Definitely looking forward playing this one again in a year or so with some cool MODs or DLCs."

I thought they would be a chore, but the game has several ways to point out what you're missing and where, although you may need help with a guide in a few occasions.It doesn't really have any innovation in its mechanics, but it uses good known formulas for open-world RPGs (level, spells and item progression, character and item customization, a small player hub that will expand throughout the adventure and allows you to customize all sort of cosmetics/decoration, and lots of lore, secrets and references to be found."

If that isn't the definitive Hogwarts Experience I don't know what is.         Jokes aside Hogwarts legacy does a great job in effortlessly letting you into the world. The castle is exceptionally well made and running around exploring it a joy.

Incredibly rich and detailed world to explore, borderline Red Dead Redemption 2 levels of graphical fidelity and environment art. Runs pretty damn well on my 2070 with DLSS enabled. You really can explore the castle and grounds in unparalleled detail, there isn't an inch of the place that doesn't look incredible. There are probably an absurd number of secrets to find.It's all oozing with Wizarding World charm, of course, so there's stuff for fans around every corner.If I had a complaint, the dialogue and RPG systems could be deeper, so this is more of an action game with light RPG elements than a true RPG."

957,mojo priest,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072041622/,4,,0,11.5,March,17,172,0,1,"One of the game's positive aspects is the feeling that the developers have managed to create. As a player, it really does feel like you're at Hogwarts, with all of the familiar settings, characters, and spells.However, the game's biggest problem is the extremely boring gameplay. All of the puzzles are too easy, and if you do happen to struggle, your character will start thinking out loud and reveal the solution within five seconds. A good chunk of the quests revolve around farming items rather than engaging in immersive story quests, making the gameplay tedious and repetitive.Another issue with the game is that it feels lifeless, lacking any random events or anything to make the world feel alive. This makes exploring the world feel like a chore, rather than an adventure.Some other problems:* You can stand right next to your teachers and cast forbidden spells like Crucio without them even reacting. * You don't have the ability to make choices that significantly impact the game's outcome* Finally, the game's quest system is outdated, with the game constantly reminding you to return to your quest, making it feel more like a game from the year 2000 than a modern RPGOverall, while the feeling of being at Hogwarts is well-executed, the game's boring gameplay, lifeless world, lack of consequences, and outdated quest system make it a disappointment for those expecting an immersive and engaging experience."
958,Toothcake,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ermonk/,3,,1,45.4,February,11,472,0,1,"I was 10 when the first Harry Potter book came out. I couldn't get into it. My fandom was established with the movies, and even though I enjoy them, I'm not what I would consider a huge Harry Potter fan. But my wife is, and because of her, I've gotten to see the full breadth of what this game is. At several points in the game, she started crying despite herself. She'd get mad about it, chuckle, and then carry on only to be gobsmacked by some other tiny detail that only she could appreciate as a fan of the books. In her words, the devs understood and captured the appeal of why everyone wanted to live in the Wizarding World. Say what you will about the controversy surrounding the HP universe, but I think it's clear that the devs put a lot of love into making a Hogwarts that is for everyone. Mechanics-wise, it's similar to other WB games but the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Confringo combat is frantic enough to be consistently interesting. The side quests are actually interesting and fit within the overall narrative. The only downside is that quite a few of them are collect-a-thons of varying flavors. If you're a lore nerd, then you'll be pleased.Oh, and despite what's been reported prior to the official launch, your House choice DOES actually make a difference. My wife and I had two different approaches to a quest based on House choice, with both of us meeting characters and visiting locations that the other didn't. My gripes are minor and deal more with the immersive qualities in RPGs. You can't sit, the cats meow sounds weirdly demonic when you pet them, and there isn't much reason to spend time in any of the spaces when you're not questing or collecting. I kinda wanted a Bully-style immersive game, but I understand why they went with the approach that ultimately shipped. Haven't finished it yet, but I am happy with what I've played."

Great game!EXCEPT: Holy **** has no one on this team ever played a PC game before? The combat controls for targeting default to Caps Lock to set target. Okay, weird, but I can rebind it to Tab.Second problem - the targeting option I've set Tab to does not toggle through targets; it only selects and de-selects the target.Alright. The solution here isn't obvious, but after a quick Google search I find that the button to change targets on keyboard and mouse is the damn arrow keys? When I'm playing with my left hand on WASD and right on the mouse? Do you want me to sacrifice access to one set of inputs? Or grow a third hand?Fine, I guess I'll rebind one of the ""Select next target"" options to another key. Idk, middle mouse button I guess... But wait! That ""Select next target"" option only goes to the next target *to the right.* End up with the rightmost enemy targeted? Pushing that button again does nothing. You need to also bind the ""Select previous target"" equivalent to toggle an enemy to the left.On controller, you just flick right stick either direction to toggle through them. Easy. On PC, I'm being warned I'm overwriting one of 100 other commands trying to find some logical way to get this to work.Please, devs, I'm begging you: Make a mouse drag function like right stick flick on controller and select the next target in that direction, or make multiple presses of Tab cycle through the targets like 90% of games with a similar lock on system.Other than that, again, great game. Just posted this after a frustrating encounter where I felt like I was fighting the awful PC targeting controls more than the enemies in front of me. I'm swapping back to controller for now."

Not just Hogsmead but also small settlements around have their own vibes and feel cozy. I find myself using a broom way more than floo powder(fast travel). This world doesn't feel empty at all it's jam packed with enemies, puzzle, caves and other activities. Just there for you to explore and that's why it's so rewarding just to take a flight on your broom to your quests and do a little exploring on the way. You will also need those resources for different mechanics in game. I haven't finished the game as of writing this review and I'm not half way there yet. Sure I could point out all the negative points out, but they don't defy your game like in some other titles. No doubt in my mind I will be playing this game for many more PT's with different houses making different choices and shaping my character according to them. In the end it's a huge recommend from me. Just enjoy the game for what it is, definitely made my dream come true. Stop focusing on what others think and explore it yourself."

Will change my review if they patch in some fixes.edit: since the last patch and lowering some settings I've had much better performance. Still not great but Ill go ahead and give it a recommend now.  Aside from performance, the game is phenomenal."

There are a lot of details (in the castle). A lot of stuff based on books and it's quite precise.- You can pet a cat. (Sorry tried to find something more valuable but didn't managed to)Cons:- Main plot. It's not interesting and boring. You do not care about the character or have sympathy for them. Except maybe for Sebastian story and the Poppy's. I felt literally nothing when I finished. I just didn't care after 60 hours. They do not even say anything about protagonist- Your answers do not matter. It's linear. Literally nothing you can have influence to- Bad RPG mechanics. No any karma, steal everything, cast unforgivable w/o consequences. - Repetitive. After 10h you won't see anything new. After Hogwarts grounds you won't encounter anything new even if you opened only 1/4 of the map. Same mobs, same attacks, same crates with garbage- Unbalanced. You literally own everybody after reaching 25+ level. There is no challenge, just tapping mobsIt does not worth those money they asking at the moment -- that's why I do not recommend it."

It is magical, and immersive. The world is big and explorable as you see fit, there's class sessions you can attend, the fighting is fluid and requires you to be on your feet and quick with your wit, and reaction time.

Also so many things to do, so much things to explore.The story, well these weak people have spoiled it, but I am sure most of us dont really cared about the main story and are more into the gameplay part of this game.

It's by far the best Harry Potter and Wizarding World game out there. Definitely recommend!I do however have some complaints:* Character Customization is extremely limited. You can't customize your appearance a lot.* There's no zoom in and zoom out for mini map. The mini map zoom level is always the same.* FOV isn't very big or wide. I'd like a wider field of view than the current maximum of 20.* I'd like to be able to choose whether I want my character on the left, middle or right side. By default it's on the left side and you can't change it.* The world is very limiting in some places. As an example, at various locations I cannot jump onto a ledge or wall even though it's not very high at all. I can jump onto higher things at other places. It's almost as if there's an invisible wall. I wish it was more open world and it would allow me to go anywhere.* No Multiplayer 🥲. I think it would be awesome if friends can jump onto my world and we can explore the world together or instead of dueling with Sebastion, I duel with my friend in multiplayer.* I can only hold a maximum of 25 Wiggenweld Potions in my active slot. I think this limit should be increased to 50 especially on Hard difficulty.* Hard difficulty isn't hard enough. It would be nice if there could be an even more difficult settings than ""Hard"".* There isn't a lot of Steam Achievements. I'd like to have at least 100 achievements I can chase and go after. The current 45 doesn't feel like it's enough."

Hogwarts Legacy is a 60$ game with a 60$ price tag and worth every cent...Coziest game released in a while. Seriously walking around Hogwarts and Hogsmead with all of its detail is astonishing. Combat is great and the spells and how puzzles utilize them is creative. I think the game plays it very safe as to not offedned a certain group of people even though they were offended before it came out. So I hope the next game offensive af.

Story is just boring and furthermore it's constantly interupted by ridiculous tasks to collect something. Somehow developers failed to provide any mystery in a magic world. Not to mention the meaningless dialogue options and complete absence of memorable characters. The world pretends to be full of secrets, but all you can find is another ugly scarf, and you're lucky if it won't conflict with character's hair.Instead of a solid story, characters and puzzles we got leveling, items progression and a ton of routined fights.Overall, this looks more like a bad quality reskin of assassin creed than a game in Harry Potter universe.It's hardly playable past the first 5-10 hours. The only hope it's a huge modding community. Absolutely not recommended to play vanilla."

First few hours are nice, the castle is nice but ultimately shallow as much as the dialogue or the gameplay. The open world itself is probably the worst I have seen so far, full of copy-paste content, with low enemy variety and full of """"""puzzles"""""". The game is bloated and does its best to waste your time on most unengaging things.Writing and dialogue are really stilted and vapid, like you are watching middle school theatre play.The game doesn't run well either and has many technical issues, with stuff like fog and rain clipping through the walls.Overall it makes for pretty bad and infuriating experience.

The game sticks loyal to the books and movies and If you love them, this game is a must-play. If not, then this is still a solid RPG game that will immerse you in it's magical world and give you hours of fun. The only thing I  is that the enemies are repetitive throughout the game while the books and movies are full of magical creatures that they could have added. I believe this is because future DLC contents that will be released.Pro Tip: UPDATE after more hours: The game is still fun, but tbh the enemies are really repetitive and can be boring to engange with them over and over again. Same with spells and combat style."

Like many other reviewers have already written, the main story is quite convoluted and basically a go-there-collect-this-and-come-back. Then-wait-until-i-give-you-the-next-task. No interesting character development, no emotional bonding. Just some plot-driven McGuffin hunt.The dialogue is exceptionally bad. It is basically a wall between me and the game that I actually would like to play. Quite often my main character simply repeats to other characters what I experienced so far while I have to sit there and get bored. Why didn't they put any effort into this?! There are simple tricks for writers of books and movies to make a scene or story more engaging. It is possible for video games, too.I don't really care about any characters in this game - not even my own. Fnishing quests felt like doing a homework assignment - sometimes even literally. My brother and I wanted to play this game over the rainy holidays but it is simply not entertaining. Now we have to buy another game to fill the hours.My brother's remark: Hogwarts Legacy feels like you have to replay Skyrim from 2011 but not in the good way."

Don't forget about a lot of grind in the game - there are so freaking big amount of different collectibles in this game, but the only rewards for finding them - costumes (some are good, but mostly I don;t like them) and a little amount of XP. Also one thing pissed me off - it was game from fans to fans, but a few times in the game for me (twice as gameplay and once in cutscene) there was one moment when I was like ""WTF, why is this happeing with their wands"" My feelings are mixed after finishing this game, but I see 95% positive reviews so I wanted to balance this a little so that's why this review is negative.P.S.

I will also avoid Spoilers.When I started to play I felt the same feeling as I did when I played Fable for the first time:Here is a magical world filled to the brim of possibilities, adventure and to shape the path I choose to journey.  PERFECT!Is it a good game? Yes but excels in creating the illusion of being more than there actually is. Not so perfect...What do I mean with this? Well.For one:Restricted areas of the castle is only restricted during quests. After you completed said quest you can head to the restricted area without any penalty. In fact there is really no penalty at all when it comes to this game. You can run around, with a professor slinging unforgivable curses without a care. Some npcs will however comment on the use of these curses in the like of ""I see you are not afraid of the dark arts"". This leads to the second grand illusion of House points:During the play through you can pass the hall with the hourglasses for each house showing the current house points. For me, they never moved. There was no added nor removed house points except for a scripted event in the beginning of the game, and at the end. This makes the house-cup as relevant as the Quidditch tournament. Third... No Quidditch... Fourth: Economy. This part kinda broke me a little. And here's why. In the game you need money, either to get rare ingredients, upgrades or gear. Now there is two ways to get cash. Sell gear that drops from enemies or can be found in chests around the world, or donate beasts. That's it. You can't sell ingredients you have gathered, you can't sell potions or flora that you have grew. And the prices are fixed. So with gear the lowest rarity goes for 60g, whilst the highest go for 200g. No matter if you have upgraded the gear or what level it is. I tried to donate a Unicorn only to see that it gives as much gold as if I would have donated a Niffler. Why? Well beasts and gear are not hard to come by, not even Unicorns. So it would be too easy to get filthy rich too fast.What was good?Well A lot of things.The sound design and music is really well done and the same can be said about the voice acting. The Ambiance!The detail of the world not only inside the castle but the rest of the world like the hamlets and Hogsmeade. (I wish the dark forest was a bit bigger but hey its alright). The combat system is fun and fast! Basically you learn all the fun spells and then create combos how ever you like. And I must say that the voice acting in the combat is amazing form the Main Character. You can hear the tone in their voice change when casting an unforgivable curse like Avada Kedavra, like the character actually wants to kill the enemy. The Writing wasn't that bad but the conflict where the overhanging/looming threat is, could have been more explored, to my taste it was a bit bland. It's a stunning game when it comes to the visuals, and combine that with the travel system on beast or broom made me skip the fast travel system in most cases. So in summary: It's a AAA game that does what AAA games do the best: A real shiny exterior with the illusion of being more complex. But the parts they focused on is done very well. Exploring the world and Hogwarts is amazing but you kinda feel like an observer running a collectathon through Hogwarts and its restricted sections rather than a student. Or through peoples houses after breaking their locks with Alohomora. What this game needed was more consequences for the Main Character. Now there is no reason not to go into the forbidden forest. There is no reason not to use unforgivable curses. There is no reason not to.. and so on. That's the main issue. Then there is a lot of quest-locks for stuff like one beast cant be found in the world until late game, probably because it gives an ingredient for half of your gear to get to upped to lvl 3 ( max ). And getting it early will make you OP etc.Overall, I enjoyed it! Made me wanna replay the first Fable Game.  7/10Maybe wait when it goes on sale if you are unsure. I'm gonna do a second play through on the hardest difficulty since Normal was a breeze. I might come back to add or change this review depending on what I find."

Great start, verry easy to learn and not to hard to master. I whish for the future of this game some expansion like quidditch and stuff like that. In this case I can say, what a great job. Can´t wait for more expasions if there are some already planned. This game has so much potential. More spells, more potions, and so on. The one thing I have to critisize are the small treasure dungeons. They feel more or less forced to be there.

It is quite addictive I could barely stop playing it the past 2 days but its unfortunate that there are really bad performance issues on PC, I have experienced them myself, still do, and it does take away from the game quite a bit which is very unfortunate because the world is truly beautiful and the game is fun! Basically, other than the lag, stutters and mediocre facial animation the game is gorgeous and enjoyable. The music is immaculate and its implemented perfectly throughout the game."

1019,Mike,https://steamcommunity.com/id/snooogy/,3,,1,57.0,February,13,323,0,1,"Spoiler Free. Finished the game in ~50h, nearly 100%, some achievements left, but mostly trivial collectables, all the stories are done.There will be 2 types of people playing this game which will result in two completely different experiences to you, here's how I see it:If you're a Harry Potter fan - phenomenal. The Wizarding World has never been done this well. The scale of the school, the sheer amount of detail, tiny nuances and painstaking attention to detail you would never notice unless you know what to look for. It really feels like the school was a passion project, not a business project. The characters have been done incredibly well, voice acting is top notch (with some exceptions). There is a lot of fan service, a ton of customisation. Everything is going to look great, feel great, play great and you are guaranteed to be hooked. Not much else to tell you, buy it, have a blast and absolutely enjoy the experience, however, please don't read below.If you're not a Harry Potter fan - it falls short as a video game in a lot of aspects. As I'm personally not big on the HP universe, I don't look at the game with rose-coloured glasses and it really shows that the game is lacking. The school is great, but if you were to remove the collectables from it, it's empty. Very few quests will actually make you interact with the school in a more nuanced or deeper way. Basically, it's as wide as the ocean, but as deep as a puddle. There is no curfew, no way to interact with the students. No real school-system, you do whatever you want whenever you want. Even the ""Unforgivable"" curses are, as someone put it nicely, very forgivable, and you can use them next to your professor and they don't react to it. Your common room exists for about 3 times in the game when you wake up there and has nothing in it. The world around Hogwarts has been beautifully crafted, but again there just isn't much to do, despite looking loaded with markers. There are a lot of collectables scattered around the world, but you soon realise they're copy pasted. I did all 95 Merlin trials (as of now steam shows 0% global achievements so I'm one of the first), and there are only 7 types of puzzles in them(maybe i forgot one idk) and after you do the first 20 you realise they have been just placed all over the world for no reason other than to inflate your playtime. The mini-bosses and camps scattered through the world just give you some blueprint for furniture or a piece of gear. There is a beast capturing system, but in the end its only needed for materials that you use to upgrade gear, which you really don't need to do at all. There are potions in the game, but throughout the whole game playing on the hardest difficulty I used ~20 healing potions total (17 of those in the final fight) and 0 of the other potions as they feel useless.The room of requirement is cool and decorating can be fun, but practically speaking you can plant a bunch of Mallowsweet for the Merlin Trials and that's about where its usefulness stops as you dont need anything else.The enemy variety is lacking. There are mongrels, goblins, humans, trolls, spiders and few suits of armour. They just have a different colour of clothing or some more plates, but they all feel and look exactly the same to fight and get very repetitive very fast. There is also no quidditch, but it makes sense as it would most likely be too hard to make. The main quest is very generic and really not the best piece of writing and there is no choice. Sebastians side story could have been the main quest and it would make more sense. They also advertised Simon Pegg as he plays the Headmaster Nigellus Black, however, the headmaster appears about 4 times total in the game, and only once for more than two sentences, missed opportunity there. That's how I would sum up this game - a missed opportunity to be so much more.I don't mean to dissuade from purchasing the game, I still had fun with it myself and would probably recommend to play through despite all the shortcomings."
1020,Chris,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Chris098123/,7,,0,31.2,February,22,381,0,1,"This review is coming from someone who has completed the main storyline and a good chunk of the side quests. SPOILERS AHEAD.Before I get into why I don't recommend Hogwarts: Legacy, here are the positives:1. The game is generally quite fun and enjoyable.2. Exploration and challenges are somewhat rewarding and give you a variety of cosmetics/buffs that you can apply to your gear.3. A few of the side quest lines are very enjoyable and offer intriguing and in depth story lines with somewhat nuanced characters4. The game is a faithful recreation of the source material5. Length of Hogwarts: Legacy is good - not so long that it becomes tedious (although it sometimes does) but not too short as to feel rushedNow for the negatives, which I feel not many are picking up on:1. The dialogue, voice acting and characterisation for the main characters in particular is absolutely shocking for a game of this calibre. The hero is just TOO good and whilst you can cast unforgivable curses and choose dialogue options that are more negative, it feels so out of place in this game to do those.2. The performance is shocking. I don't expect to be able to run this game at 4K 144fps but not being able to run this game at 1080p on low settings without it stuttering when changing locations is unacceptable.3. The final 1/5 of the game is just a huge disappointment. The final 2 bosses (well, final boss - the second to last boss isn't horrific) are just lazily done. Ranrok in particular is just ridiculous. You spend the whole game learning how to combine spells to devastating effect, then Ranrok just requires you to dodge and spam 3 damaging spells. 4. Saying that, the vast majority of the game is lazily done and here are just a couple of the lazily designed aspects of this game:a) can cast unforgivable curses without ANYBODY, EVEN YOUR TEACHER, saying anythingb) no way to swim underwaterc) dialogue is poor and cheesyd) the system of currency is so lazy - ALL orange items have the same sell and buy value and same for the other raritiesand that is just a few of the lazily designed aspects of the game.5. The entire gear system is just a waste of time really. There is no point upgrading/changing equipment. The rarity of equipment doesn't really matter as the upgrade system is pointless so, so long as you have the highest defence equipment, you'll be fine.That's just a few of my observations whilst playing the game. I should say that I played this on regular difficulty and played it fairly solidly since release. I will also say that I've not particularly taken any notice of the discourse surrounding the game itself and am writing this from a purely subjective point of view."

It truly feels like a complete RPG. There are long and detailed side quests, a long main story. Pets for fans of Fantastic Beasts, Mounts and broomstick riding. The combat isn't intense however it is thrilling. Linking spells together in different ways is quite interesting. Clothing appearance customization is available from the very first moment, as soon as you equip your first set of clothes. The map is massive and has many places to explore and discover. As of writing this review, I genuinely am happy I pre-ordered a game for once."
1024,Ceceli ♠,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mceceli/,4,,1,101.0,February,15,433,0,1,"Disclaimer: this review will be 100% honest, about the good stuff and the bad stuff. You've been warned.They just don't learn. This game has forced TAA and no true fullscreen. Everything looks blurry to the point it makes me feel like I need glasses again. Performance is worse than RDR2, but what would you expect from devs who aren't known for doing Triple A games. Gladly, this isn't a console for peasants. And in the land of PC MASTER RACE we have the option to use Reshade with sharpening to correct that, even though the TAA is still being processed and consuming precious FPS, and even more so because it has f'ing Denuvo. I hope they remove Denuvo once this game gets cracked, because otherwise it would only be pointless and hurt the playerbase.But, putting all of that aside, they gave us a neat option to use AMD FSR 2 upscalling method to bring the game from 720p to 1080p while maintaining the graphics on High and therefore the game remaining beautiful. On a 1080ti with 12700k I get from 75 to 100 FPS. And I can say it's not a port problem because the game is just awful on PS5. People have to play it looking worse than PC on Low settings and with less FPS. Search videos and screenshots to see what it is really like instead of reading what ultra fanboys say on Facebook because their egos can't take it. And they say PS5 is the equivalent of a 3080. Yeah, sure, pumpkin! So there's no reason for buying it on PS5 just to get access to that exclusive mission.Now, story wise, so far it's looking good despite a few flaws. You can grasp that there's a mystery being conveyed, but you have no clue on WTF is going on and where the story is gonna lead you. It just feels a bit lost in itself. But then it starts to shape up and you know what's what instead of feeling like things happened out of thin air without a proper introduction and backstory.Simon Pegg's acting in the role of Hogwarts' headmaster is terrible. He sounds like a soap opera sub celebrity reading a script doing over inflexion in every word. It's not at all like a real person talks and it can come off as cringey. Then there's that student from Uganda that's also super obnoxious to listen to because her phony accent is terrible and her tone of voice and laughs don't match what's going on. But, gladly, as I've seen so far, you'll spend most of your time talking to your professor and mentor, and your friend Sebastian. These 2, plus the main character, are all portraied by very talented voice actors. The main character's voice is very similar to Daniel's voice, so in a way, you get that Harry Potter feeling. Even when you go to Ollivanders, you're treated just like Harry, as if you were the most special person being long-awaited. That was a bit on the nose for me.For the combat, I was surprised. Few people understand that these games - specially Warner Bros games - aren't strictly fighting games. They're more rythm games. And that's fine. You just need to adjust your expectations to it. WB games are not like playing The Warriors, for instance. Anyway, Avalanche Software managed to improve this genre in the most sneaky and brilliant way possible. It's like they brought Guitar Hero to a fighting game. Instead of 5 colors on the toy guitar controller, you have 4 colors in this game, 1 for each action button on Playstation. If this were done thinking on PC, they could have gone up to 5 with no problem since it's pretty feasible to reach the number 5 key. So, essentially, you have to tap those numbers according the colors of yours spells and the color of the enemies' protection spell shields. And this was so beautifully done that they managed, in my opinion, to surpass the misplaced faith in the Souls games, making Hogwarts Legacy much, much more enganging, in all areas, even by not making the same mistakes as well. The combat has so much nuance, possibilities and areas of the brain triggered at once that I shall not talk about it in order to not make this review any longer than it needs to.Lastly, the environment and many side quests. It's like they followed the Marvel's Spider-Man's footsteps on this one. The whole place is beautiful, there's so much attention to detail that it's fun to swing, I mean, fly through the map experiencing all of it. The side quests don't feel like boring chores. They're fun excuses to see everything and level up as oppose to just do a pointless checklist maybe for achievements. For comparison, I tell my friends that Hogwarts is like a GTA, and then you get out to explore the world and there's another GTA. That's how big Hogwarts is. And super detailed! Although not as big, but still super detailed, there is Hogsmeade with several houses and stores to go into for looting or visiting and none of them are copy-paste. I just don't know why they didn't go with Diagon Alley. All you see in this game from Diagon Alley, so to speak, is the inside of Gringotts.This level of effort really shows. Despite wokies being noisy on Twitter trying to boycott this game, it's soaring in sales. As of now, it has reached almost 900k concurrent players on Steam alone!PS.: speaking of wokies, mind you, be careful when posting on Steam Discussions. Steam mods are wokies and they are mad af right now to the point that I got banned for a week from the forum after being called names by more or less 50 people, which I reported and nothing happened, but I, on the other hand, got banned for being ""rude"". So there goes the Steam moderation selectively grooming the community to be toxic and cancerous by condoning people's bad behaviours and harassing me by banning me for merely being a victim of this arbitrary and corrupted system with zero accountability. Little people on power trips. Go figure. This kind of cancer is making Epic Store look better by the minute! No wonder they don't have forums there."

1026,Kaipo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaipi1988/,6,,1,14.1,February,12,108,0,1,"Great game with a ton of fun. If you ever wanted to explore Hogwarts, for sure I recommend. The story line is pretty fun and it does change up a bit depending on house you choose. However I do agree with some of the individuals rating it negative. I feel like the NPCs are lifeless. One of the most uncanny aspects of the game is when it turns night, the entire school is empty. Even when you go into the sleeping quarters there are no students sleeping. It made the game feel empty in regards to relationships and almost like the NPCs weren't real. That is my only major complaint so far I would have to say."
1027,Mason2501,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mason2501/,2,,1,46.0,February,25,192,0,1,"I'm completely enjoying this Wizarding World game!  Giving a fresh take before Harry Potter.  Let's build the witch or wizard you want.  Lot of puzzles and exploration quests.  Wizard dueling.   Witcher like monster hunting.  So far I've enjoyed all the cinematic story and cuts scenes.  Feel like your dropped in book from the series.  I'm ignoring any woke SJW cries to boycott this game. Wasn't really on my list as next game to buy. Jumping into to check it out, I'm glad i did and hooked.  On my new rtx4090 am5 7950x gaming PC its max everything with RT and fluid beauty.  The Story style of game is like a tutorial without a super cheesy tutorial. Each quest unlocks new spells, powers and skills making the game more complex. Enough clothing loot to case and upgrade. Use for looks or stats.   I'm exited to explorer more and discover more and learn or fill in all places seen in the books or movies.  You get sorted in a house, so I guess there will a reason to replay the game for that inside part of each house is if you care.  So far feels great. Loving it."
1028,Freddo1Kenobi,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197990158470/,25,,0,32.8,March,8,334,0,1,"If you are a huge Harry potter / Wizarding world fan, you will find plenty of the things you've read in the books, seen in the movies and they are doing you a huge service by providing a chance of being part of the wizarding world. However, except for the combat, you won't find any overly engaging gameplay, so if you are looking for an intellectual stimulus in forms of puzzles, challenges or an engaging story, you should look elsewhere. This is not a  game, no matter what anyone tries to sell it as in the steam review section. I get that some people are huge fans of the harry potter franchise and world. For you, congratulations, you might have something you will get out of this. For me, as a person who read all the books and watch the movies, enjoyed them, but not much more, this is not worth it. I expected more game, less copy-paste.If you look behind the dress up, this is just a Ubisoft open-world style game that arguably does everything that your average Assassins creed game does, but worse. The game start very slow, which hides some of the open world stuff, and you get sucked into the story because you commit to around 5-6 hours of slow gameplay with many cut scenes. Then it really takes off as you get , start travelling the world, exploring puzzles and getting to do combat with your new earned spells. So hour 6-14 is really where the game shines and you are exploring the world. Hour 14-finish is you realizing that everything that felt new and fresh is what the rest of the game is, anything from 20-60 more hours of it depending on how long you can shut your brain down at a time to just go about it. If you want to do other things than simple fetch quests or the main quest, you do have a few side quests containing some characters that you stick with throughout the game. Of these quests 1 has well written characters with real motives, good voice actors and an impact on gameplay . The main story is just you running around from place to place facing the same generic enemies (there are a few exceptions which were appreciated), and so so so many cutscenes which drags. At the end of it, I felt myself just skipping some of them cause it's just so hard to care about any of the characters in the game, most are so flat.There's not that much more to comment on, the game itself is a collection of mini-games spread out in a mostly empty world and is stringed together by a half-assed story. Although, everyone to their own, if you are just looking for a game to sit with and turn off your brain after school/work and appreciate visuals, this might be it!"
1029,Leonair,https://steamcommunity.com/id/leonairxxx/,3,,1,59.0,February,20,763,2,1,"I would have to admit that I was pretty hyped about the game. It looked great in the trailersbut beyond that it looked fun.For people that grew up reading Harry Potter books, this would have been as close as you can get to receiving an acceptance letter to Hogwarts. You aren't living Harry's story, you're experiencing your own. Games like that are really good and I hope more singleplayer-storydriven games get released.Graphically, it is pretty damn good. Pretty for certain, beautiful for sure. It does have a few issues here and there, the lighting kind of makes certain hair colors appear washed out. Sometimes the stutter gets so bad that you might want to look directly at the ground for a bit til things calm down and your frames go back up.I overlooked all of that because I ACTUALLY HAD FUN WITH THIS GAME. Normally, bugs like that would dissuade people from getting the game. But I'd have to say, there aren't any other game breaking bugs that I've encountered but your experience may vary. I can only talk about what I got from playing this game.And what I got was a barrel of fun. Exploring Hogwarts castle, flying through the world, walking in to Hogsmeade..All of that was just simply fun. If you've ever gone and visited Universal Studios Japan's Hogwarts area, you'll know what i'm getting at.From getting your wand, getting sorted into your house and seeing your common room..It is almost a complete experience. Learning to cast the spells in class, even better.Combat can both be complex and simple. That's how I personally like it. Simple enough to grasp but complex enough that you aren't stuck just doing the same thing over and over again. You have offensive and defensive spells, as well as killing curses and such. You'll be taught to use them and you'll get to test them out on dummies, monsters, animals and people.The clothes in the game are nicely modelled too, the physics don't feel like they'd glitch out at any moment, it isn't a case like in AC Unity where the cloth physics are stuck in 30FPS but you're running at 60+. Though I would have to say, the variations might need a bit more work. Dressing up in different combinations of cloaks, robes and suits is almost as fun for me as just exploring the world. Sometimes I just look for treasure chests so I can get new clothes.There are puzzles and minigames that will occupy your time if you aren't too keen on doing all of the main stuff immediately. But I would urge you to at least get to the bit where you are taught to use brooms. Fast travel is nice and all but broom travel is 10x better in my opinion. The story can be a hit or miss to some people. You're some chosen one with some grand destiny, all that jazz. Let's ignore all of that and do all of Professor Garlick's assignments. (she's honestly the prettiest and the sweetest character in the game. Fight me)I hope for future story DLC (MORE GARLICK-SENSEI CONTENT PLEASE)The modding community for this game is getting its feet wet and there are some amazing stuff coming out right now if you're willing to put in a tiny bit of effort. (like dropping PAK files into a folder. EZPZ)10/10 Bang for Buck, if you don't have the Knuts to spend on this, I don't know what to tell you.IT IS A FUN GAME. FUN WIZARD FANTASY GAME. LET'S GO. RIGHT NOW."

Well, that usually ends in disaster.So why then is this game such an obvious labor or love, full of painstakingly crafted details that keeps surprising you with brand new features even hours into your playthrough, unique quests with replayability potential, vast open world,... It's honestly astonishing and such a breath of fresh air for a big budget studio to not bungle up a game and sell it incomplete with an array of DLC as a dull cashgrab for once.Is it perfect? No. Nothing is. It's not terribly innovative in its gameplay either, but you know what? That's not what the game set out to do, doesn't pretend to be and frankly, what it does, it does pretty darn well.If you're a Potter fan, get this game and let your family know you will be unreachable for the next month or so.If you're new to the universe, this may not be the best introduction, but still presents a solid game in its own right, without requiring previous knowledge of the world (except maybe that magic is real and lives in a wooden stick you swish about to make things go boom).Whether you're an experienced gamer or a more casual enjoyer, the game's difficulty modes are able to accommodate you well. At story difficulty, the game is an open book for anyone to experience, while hard offers solid gameplay and significant challenge for the most demanding of players. There's also a range of adjustments to allow for better accessibility.TLDR - yep, this is the one."

Denuvo Anti-Temper is in the game without any confirmation that it will be removed despite it already being cracked.2. Currently as of this review, Nvidia has NOT released a proper Game Ready Driver for Hogwarts Legacy.3. Most recent patch notes on Steam (February 25th, 2023) are for the Day One Patch (10 Feb, 2023).4. Optimization is HORRID. Performance is all over the place, the game can be virtually unplayable for some despite their hardware being top of the line and great for people with much worse hardware. Tons of bugs, confusing menus, control issues, controller issues, PC binding issues, in-game bugs etc.,5. Horrible and confusing marketing/communication/support for all versions, especially PC. With multiple accounts and account links being required to redeem things. There are a lot of exclusive items/quests that are/or are going to be unavailable soon as of February 26th. (Including PS exclusive quest, twitch cosmetic drops, pre-order bonuses etc.,)8. Graphics/Art Style/Atmosphere/Music/Sound is absolutely top notch. Truly amazing.7. Gameplay is very hard to describe, some might love it, some might hate it. It’s a mishmash of mechanics from many genres with a Harry Potter theme slapped onto it. I personally think it’s great as for me it ticks all the boxes.LONG VERSIONI received this as a gift from a friend and meanwhile I like the game itself, let me walk you through the current state of what’s going on. From an objective point of view so you can make an informed decision about this product before buying it.The game has severe performance problems, anyone who says it runs fine on their PC without implementing additional workarounds is incredibly lucky. There is no universal workaround because of how it hugely varies depending on your system, programs, overclock settings, bios settings, Windows version, update version for windows. There are people with 4090s getting 50fps, people with 1080Ti's getting 60+ constant, people with RTX3070Tis cards getting 30 on low, while others with those same cards have the roles completely reversed. While others can’t even launch the game. RTX suite features are absolutely botched on PC (This includes DLSS, Ray Tracing, Scaling, DLAA etc.,). In summary it’s an incredibly poor PC release.Warner/Avalanche/Wizarding World/Portkey Games have delved into some very intentionally misleading practices or they are absolutely incompetent. There are a million different people managing this game on social media and the various platforms and currently the state of the game is absolutely horrible on PC despite the “Very Positive” rating on Steam.The community is completely split by hardcore Harry Potter fans who defend it with every tooth and nail and say that it’s a 10/10 game of the year; People who are trying to boycott it because of some political issues with JK Rowling on Twitter over things she said a long while ago;. Others who don’t understand how PC’s work are saying that “You should just upgrade your PC if it runs badly”; Meanwhile some are calling everything a “conspiracy theory” and disregarding factual evidence you can easily find online. The truth is the whole new DLSS 3.1 ♥♥♥♥ and Ray Tracing thing is purely a massive marketing stunt to sell the already problematic RTX 4000 series, the DDR5 platform for PC is completely unstable, all new GPUs have artificially inflated prices. And software companies are trying their best to secure a monopoly by locking their platforms similar to Apple with their Macs and iPhones (e.g. Windows 11 being pushed by Microsoft while having specific hardware requirements that ♥♥♥♥ on old PCs or ruin their performance. Nvidia requiring special PSUs to even use their new RTX4000 series cables etc.,). I won’t bore you with all those details, but you get the gist. Generally I wouldn’t recommend upgrading your PC with the newest gen hardware, but that’s a story for another time. Warner is using the whole RTX thing to sell their game to PC players, because RTX sells) and they make money out of Nvidia and Nvidia makes money out of them. It’s up to you if you want to call this a conspiracy theory or not, but it’s all easily verifiable information with the right questions typed into a google search."

I really feel like I'm a wizard at Hogwarts. The world is gorgeously crafted, the combat is so snappy and satisfying, and the attention to detail in the world (especially inside Hogwarts) is so impressive. I find myself trailing off the main story to do side content and explore so often because the world is packed with things to do. As a fan of the Witcher games, I appreciate the notes the devs have taken out of that book for this game to really bring it to life.

There's some optimisation issues but that's to be expected, not everything can run smoothly on day 1 but I'm sure patches will smooth the kinks there is.I only hope that this title serves as a milestone and an example of both how to make a PROPER game, something everyone in the entire gaming industry has forgotten (games nowdays are ruled by money and the shareholders which is why we end up with mediocre or below average products not worth a cent), and that the next titles, if there will be, improve on this foundation with more content.Or better yet: that they do content updates, that would be wonderful.Such as more spells, more creatures, more foes, etc...It's also the only game worth every cent ever since Elden Ring came out.

1056,MindFlow,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141020434/,3,,1,76.5,February,13,102,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a very solid AAA Open World title. It's also a pretty decent Harry Potter game, but it lacks in the RPG department. I'll get into all of that in more detail.The game is fast paced in combat and traversal (once you unlock the broom and maybe some upgrades), but likes to take it's time in other parts. Hogwarts alone has a seemingly infinite amount of puzzles, secrets and treasures, but the open world is also sprinkled with tons of minor side activities, that often don't rely on combat but rather a few brain cells and some patience. All in all the various aspects of the gameplay are all handled well and never feel boring or stale, as there is a constant switch. Once you start looking for specific side activities or have finished all quests, though, it may become the well known open world grind.Hogwarts Legacy provides all the ingredients that a modern RPG thinks it needs, but leaves out the real essentials. There is a small talent tree that can be almost completely unlocked in a single playthrough. The talents do not exist to create some kind of build or expertise, - they simply exist because they have to in a modern RPG. There's also gear which only has 2 stats, so that numbers go up. Its not fun or exiting, but developers think a modern RPG needs it. There are also upgrade to the gear so that the numbers can go up even more. Players will simply put on the next best thing they find, because there is literally zero thought put into the system.What Hogwarts Legacy does not have are meaningful choices or even consequences. No matter which dialogue options you chose, the game will always play the same. No matter which house you pick, it will only change the color of your school uniform and some lines spoken by NPCs. There are barely any quests with more than one way to solve them. Therefore it has no replay value at all, unless you want the ""hidden"" achievements for every house.It runs mostly well, but has the occasional stutter. Even though the game analyzes your hardware and puts on the approriate settings by default, it's not perfectly optimized. There are often mini loading screens when you open doors, which can be slightly annoying. If that's a problem for you, maybe wait a few patches.Huge parts of the game are riddles. They are mostly simple and require a keen eye rather than raw brainpower. If you can do arithmetics in the lower double digits, you're good enough for almost everything the games throws at you. Then there are some challenges that rely on reactions rather than wits or perception. They can be a bit tricky, but once you figure them out, they are also super easy. Combat is also rather easy even on the highest difficulty. The only real challenge that the game provides are battles with lots of enemies and even then the hardest opponent is the camera and the rather poor targeting system.Character creation is incredibly restrictive. There are a few preset faces but no sliders, even though they have been a staple of character creation for a decade and a half. There are a few pointless choices like having a voice that does not match the body or chosing the boys or girls dorm independent of your body. They are kind of odd, mostly pointless, but of course can be avoided to have an immersive experience.While Hogwarts looks great with lots of details, it feels kind of hollow. Other students will only talk to you, if they are involved in a quest. You can interact with some objects, but most are only decoration. That includes all benches, couches, seats and beds. The latter is probably the most jarring, as you cannot sleep in your dorm. But then again, nobody can. The dorm is always empty. Other students simply disappear at night. Combine this with the fact that the students in the common room will not talk to you and you have zero reason to ever visit your house other than dropping off a few tokens for a quest. The ""Hogwarts"" experience is completely missing.On top of that there is a ton of missed potential. NPCs will talk about things you've done as part of a quest, but you can never talk to them about it. There's for example a younger witch who loves playing gobstones, but has no friends to play with. The last students she could convince disliked the game so much that they hid her gobstones away and you are asked to retrieve them. But once you do, she will sit around in the courtyard and talk to herself about defeating any challengers, if only she could find any. Let me play a round of gobstones with her! Just a simple little game and a few lines of dialogue would go such a long way.Then there is a Ravenclaw student who gets bullied for being scared of Puffskein. He asks you to provide him with a trophy to proof that he has done something courageous. Once you do, he proclaims that his nickname will be gone once he shows the trophy to everyone in the common room. Wouldn't it be great if a Ravenclaw player could actually see that play out? The common room would actually feel alive. Oh, yes - and also put people in beds, please. Maybe a little chit-chat or banter with the roomies at night? Let me sleep in my bed at least after you made me pick a dorm! How hard can it be?Even worse: there is a ""wait"" functionality, where you sleep on the floor until the quest starts or day/night has passed. You can literally sleep on the dorm floor, but not in the bed one step in front of you.Then there is the diversity and representation issue. Obviously there are way too many foreigners around that should not be in the Scottish Highlands in the late 19th century: especially Acromantulas. Hagrid brought them to the Forbidden Forest and that will take place quite a few decades after Hogwarts Legacy.Jokes aside, the developers clearly wanted to play both sides. For the realism crowd, most NPCs are white. For the diversity crowd, most interactable NPCs - Hogwarts staff, shop keepers, quest givers - have a very high quota of representation. This goes so far that white professors are a minority in Hogwarts, which is breaking immersion.Of course there's also an elderly mixed-race lesbian couple and a trans-witch, which you will know the moment she opens her mouth. And while there is nothing wrong with having LGBT in a Harry Potter game - witches have always been seen as sexual deviants after all - there are still ways to do it wrong. While the lesbian couple is executed nicely, the trans-witch unfortunately is not. As witches and wizards don't have to rely on modern day surgery and hormone treatment but can use magic, their transformation will affect the whole body including vocal cords. A trans-witch will sound like any other witch. The fact that she does not is representative of modern trans folks, but immersion breaking by the rules of this magical world. Worst of all - the developers have managed to do it correctly in another part of the game: The game goes all in. They tried their hardest to include absolutely everything iconic about the Harry Potter universe. Most of it is executed well. Unfortunately it almost feels like they worked with a checklist. Everything is there, but they all need to stand on their own. The greater connection is lacking. At times it feels more like a Harry Potter skin for the generic Open World genre and less like a real Harry Potter game.It's a nice game. Good, but not perfect. The student life could have been more detailed and the house choice should have played a bigger role. Overall the relation to the class mates was severly lacking. So were consequences and role playing options. Recommended for a single playthrough, but currently not replayable."
1057,Crazyfaith,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazyfaith/,3,,1,5.2,February,19,"3,038",0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a recently released action role-playing game that has generated a lot of buzz within the gaming community. As a longtime Harry Potter fan, I was eagerly anticipating its release, and I must say, I was not disappointed.Set in the 1800s, the game offers a new and exciting adventure within the magical world of Harry Potter. Players take on the role of a new student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where they attend classes, learn spells, and go on various quests throughout the game's expansive world.The game's graphics are stunning, and the attention to detail is impressive. The environments are vast, and players can explore not only the school of Hogwarts but also the surrounding areas, including Hogsmeade Village and the Forbidden Forest. The storyline is engaging and immersive, allowing players to interact with iconic characters from the Harry Potter universe, such as Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape.One of the game's best features is the freedom it offers players to create their own unique character and personalize their experience at Hogwarts. With a wide range of customization options, players can choose their own path, attend classes and learn spells that suit their playstyle, and embark on various quests that affect the game's outcome.However, the game has received criticism for its handling of certain characters and themes. Some players have expressed concern about the game's lack of inclusivity and diversity, as well as its portrayal of sensitive topics such as race and representation. These issues have led to a debate about the game's overall message and its impact on the Harry Potter franchise.Overall, Hogwarts Legacy is an impressive game that offers a unique and immersive experience for fans of the Harry Potter universe. Despite some valid criticisms, the game is still a must-play for Harry Potter fans, offering an exciting new adventure in the wizarding world."

The game is also a bit unoptimised at the moment, the existence of Denuvo doesn't help.The only thing that made me continue playing longer that I should have was how beautiful the world is. Hogwarts Legacy is NOT a bad game, but I personally wouldn't recommend it when older games in this genre are better, not to mention that the game is clearly made for a very young audience or one who has very few games on their belt, I would say it is an excellent gift for your younger cousin or partner."

I care about the first two.Hogwarts Legacy is a modern take on recreating the feelings that any person (Potterhead or not) felt when reading/watching the Harry Potter series. Thankfully, it manages to do so in spades. However there are quite a few points that cripple my final opinion on the game.Let's start with the visual presentation. You will find yourself immersed in a living castle, riddled with people moving from class to class, practising their spells, reading, gossiping about the new student or commenting on the houses' characteristics. What truly stands out though, is that once you step outside the castle, the whole world opens up to you, allowing you to traverse it in its entirety with very little loading time in between, with the exception being entering a cave or a scenario that is relevant to the plot. The best thing? It all looks GOOD! The geography looks amazing, regardless of where you are looking from (walking, riding a broom or a creature). This is not relegated to the environments, with particle effects (mostly present when producing magic) that resemble the same art style shown in the movies, with amazing fidelity. --TEN THOUSAND POINTS TO AVALANCHE!--Where the graphics can be a bit disappointing however is in some face renditions, mostly when dealing with non-cinematic facial expressions, and your character's, which looks comical when compared to others. Another problem, and this one is far more serious, is with performance. When I first installed the game (on the 7th) the game ran amazingly at 1440p, 80 to 100fps even with RayTracing on up until I reached Hogwarts, where the stuttering became so severe that I was looking at single digits of FPS for tens of seconds, up to minutes, depending on the scene, with no particular influence of player input. It took several days of tweaking and patches to figure out those issues, and while it's still not perfect, it was at least playable enough for me to finish the game. --ONE KA-JILLION POINTS TAKEN FROM AVALANCHE!--Soundtrack is, put simply, incredible. It perfectly encapsulates the *magic* that the movies portrayed while not being overly dense. Using the same beats and chimes from the original saga, it instantly transports the player to THAT place, thus helping with the feeling that you are a wizard in the wizarding world. It also introduces new original songs which fit the overall theme, as well as reuses some old classical songs (an instrumental reimagining of Lacrymosa, a piano rendition of Chopin's Nocturne Op9 and others). Sounds in general are great as well, adding impact to the spells and making them ""punchy"", and voices are really well acted, though once again, the main character lacks some gravitas regarding some situations and is not very expressive overall. --ONE THOUSAND SEPTILLION POINTS TO AVALANCHE!--Story wise, the game is set in Hogwarts and its surroundings in the late 1800s, when names such as Voldemort were simply unheard of. Taking a page off a typical D&D session, the story sets your own character as a student who is starting school as a fifth year, with the unique quality of being able to both see and wield ancient magic. Due to how you are inserted in the story, it is rather easy (and safe) to create a conflict based on it without harming the rich lore behind the universe. You will also encounter several students who.... require your help and provide some sort of context regarding the socio-political situation within both school and its surroundings. Extra points to Avalanche for trying to address the controversy regarding Rowling's statements on gender identity by introducing certain characters, and instantly taken away given the time period and the overall socio-political background for the time. --ZERO POINTS TO AVALANCHE!--Gameplay is where the game falters, badly. When you are within Hogwarts, the amount of tasks you are given seem.... tolerable at first; looking for butterflies which follow your Lumos spell, following key-shaped fireflies to their corresponding locks, you'd think it's not THAT bad, just a few hours of traversing (and getting to know) the castle. The problem arrives when you get a sense of scale with the broom and begin to realize just how many Points of Interest you will find as you travel along the map. ""That cave looks interesting!"" you might say to yourself, and as you approach and kill off a few spiders and enter ... only to find a short corridor that leads to a chest with equipment 5 levels below you.The same thing occurs with like.... 90% of the POI. Merlin trials for example (feather icons) take only a few minutes each, and contribute expanding to your gear inventory, which is very limited. Problem is that there are 95(!) of them scattered throughout the whole map, as are 16 daedelian keys, 20 ancient magic hotspots, 83 floo powder locations (fast travel)... the list goes on and on. What happens in the end? Choice Overload. You start to gauge the benefits of completing them, and you notice how out of the say 50 caves you've explored, 5 had something interesting, or how little these POI contribute to your overall experience. That's what I will call from now on, Open World Syndrome. If you take away the Wizarding World Universe, you have a generic open world game created in the same era as Far Cry 3.--TEN BILLION KA-JILLION POINTS TAKEN FROM AVALANCHE!--Sadly, it doesn't stop there. There are several inconsistensies regarding gameplay, some of which are married to the story:-You can ""save"" and ""look after"" fantastic creatures from poachers, but you can poach creatures yourself as well. --TEN POINTS TAKEN FROM AVALANCHE AND SOLD TO THE POACHERS!!---You can learn the unforgivable spells (Imperio, Crucio and Avada Kedavra), but by that point, you've killed enough people to make Voldemort kindly ask you to chill out and have a milkshake. --FIVE HORRCRUXES TAKEN FROM AVALANCHE!---You can behave like a proper ASS, refusing to help people or asking for more money/keeping what they asked you to get for them, yet your decisions have absolutely NO influence over your morality or the story itself. --FIFTEEN MORALLY AMBIGUOUS POINTS FROM AVALANCHE!---Other than two particular characters (Ominis and Sebastian and maaybe Poppy), any other NPC that could have been a companion (you don't get any) has very little background story to be interesting enough and follow their quests. --THREE POINTS TAKEN FROM AVALANCHE!---Mounts other than the broom have absolutely no advantage other than being part of the universe and come waaaay too late in the story. --ONE SADDLE-MOUNTED POINT FROM AVALANCHE!---Using spells is a huge mess. Since you are limited to four spells per set (limitation that comes from console I suppose), you have to constantly change your spellset in order to keep combos. This would not be a problem if using those spells didn't involve holding the right trigger (using Kbm is much better though). If you don't do it, you will trigger other actions (such as casting Protego, jumping, rolling, or worse yet, Lumos in the middle of a fight). --FIVE HUNDRED MILLION  POINTS FROM AVALANCHE!!-- Yet this is somehow counteracted by how FUN the combat can be once you get the hang of it --TWO POINT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION  POINTS TO AVALANCHE!!--In the end, I felt the game was dragging for too long even before the 15 hour limit and only pushed forward because the story in the end gets interesting enough.So... what's my final verdict? I lost track of the points. All I know is that the final result is a negative number.If you are adamant about experiencing the Wizarding World and don't mind the Open World tropes, get Hogwarts Legacy. If you are like me though, go ahead and skip this one, or get it at a great discount."

Debatable.I enjoyed the game when I first started it, but you reach a point where you're 60 hours in and you finally realize that you're not having fun. If this sounds familiar, it's probably because you've been sucked into the endless gameplay loop of Assassin's Creed: Odyssey or Assassin's Creed: Valhalla. This game is the same. This is an Assassin's Creed game. The similarities aren't even subtle. Awful ""rarity"" based loot system that has ruined countless other games, map icon collect-a-thons for characters who don't matter. The game's one selling point was being a student at Hogwarts, which it fails to deliver on. You interact with no one. You talk to no one. Students you walk by don't even have names. You can only make friends with quest NPCs, and you don't even have actual choice in this game. It's another game that insists on having dialogue options, while making each one totally meaningless."

I imagine its an excellent game if you know nothing about it.  But for the last two weeks I have felt like Bastian from the never ending story.  I would lock myself away, forget any responsibilities and dive into Hogwarts legacy.  First of all, the game is massive.  allow it to overwhelm you and then just let it take you where it does.  There is enough direction that you could finish the story in 40 to 50 hours if its your first time playing, your not using a guide and trying to speed through.  But this game is more than just the story,  it feels like your at hogwarts!  all the mysteries to unlock, friends to make,  things that match up with the stories and the cinema so well.  this game has stunning visuals,  The combat is excellent in my opionion.  I feel like a wizard and its a lot of fun. no complaints at the moment, I am almost at 100% completion on my first wizard and I have started a second.  I feel like the only complaint I will have is when there is no more content.  feels like a couple hundred hours away tho.just make sure you have a half way decent computer.  i know for a fact it runs pretty good on a 1060 6gb (just make sure ray tracing and microsoft HD are turned off) and it runs amazing with a 2070 Super 16gb in  4k on a 65' 4k TV."

This world has a beautiful facade covering a swarm of boring mechanics. The magic was nice to look at and the Slytherin boys story was slightly compelling but the rest was just bland and repetitive. Your character is some milquetoast hero who is seemingly a natural master of magic while having the personality of a soggy piece of cardboard. You can make some slight changes to him or her at moments where the game gives you the options to either A. Be NiceorB. Be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥However the rest of the time you are literally a stick floating upright in a muddy river of bad storytelling.Maybe if they had spent less time with useless distractions like merlin trials and summoners court they could have possibly added quidditch? Or given us a real reason to explore the caves for something other than a useless wall hanging or a piece of clothing to sell at the nearest vendor for some gold?5/10 pretty sometimes, but mostly boring.

1096,Doc,https://steamcommunity.com/id/drnegerle/,3,,0,38.8,February,24,352,0,1,"So theres a lot to say about this game, ill try to make it as short as possible.First of, if you like the world of Harry Potter alot, just get it its a fun few hours and youll probably have a good time.Going more in depth tho, oh boy.Story:99% of the time i couldnt give a ♥♥♥♥ about any of the characters, the start is the first problem. After Proffesor Figs presumably long year friend dies, you just go on about your journey as if nothig happened, he even seems happy and cherrish while running around with you. His best friends died moments earlier, and there is not a single hint of sadness in his voice or acting. Thats just the start of many problems. The game takes a major backstab in what was established by games like Witcher 3 regarding decisions, you can select different dialog but it has no consequences you are feeling whatsoever, the ending aswell, you just get a different cutscene, its just, lazy. Normally i root for characters, have my preferences and try to be the good guy and help people and such, In this game, i just did whatever cause none of the characters could interest me in any ways, They are all very bland and shallow.Now to get a bit more technical:Combat, it is ... ok, theoretically there are ""many"" enemies and attacks / spell combos you can use, but in the end you either fight Spiders, Goblins, or Wizards, thats it. you tend to use the same spells over some time whatever tends to accomandate your playstyle, i will give it to them that the spells are well made, its fun using them and combining some, exploiting some enemies weaknesses to certain spells, but even the ""Boss"" fights are just super seized regular enemies, which doesnt make them stand out whatsoever.World: The World is nice, its not bad for sure, but outside of the places you know from books and films its just generic stuff, like very generic, a few villages a few caves some landscape that it, there is nothing remarkable, memorable about the map that stands out, big missed oppurtunity imo.Also diving couldve been such a huge and fun aspect of the game, discoering stuff in the lake and rivers, but no its just an animation an a loot item, such a lazy way to do it and a big missed oppurtunity.Technical:Voice:Voice acting is super boring, no one the voice actor seemed very well engaged, it might be due to the terribel audio which i will come to. The main characters voice is also really generic and boring, which might be due to the flexibility of gender and tone you can select for the MC, but it hurts the game more than it does it good. I never could connect with the MC in any meaningful way, and the voice played a big part in that.Audio: I haven't played a AAA game with such a bad audio design in a long time. I played on speakers and headphones and most problems appear on both systems. The volume mixing is awful, you have effect sounds and dialog that is super silent, then in a cut scene it blasts your ears out, Your spells are at moderate volume, one particular spell is super loud, there are so many inconsistencies between different actions, cutscenes, voices, effects its just a chore to listen to it. I fiddled a long time with the audio settings but no good middle ground could be found.Visuals:Not much to complain here, its nothing outstanding, especially for a title like this, but its ok. The lightning seems rather below standard but that might just be the look they wanted to go for, nothing exceptional, nothing too awful. Missed out on some huge scene opportunities tho, Like huge battles, Shots from the air that are impressive and stunning, i missed some really nice shots and there were a lot of chances for it. Room of Requirement:I dont know who thought this was a good idea. I dont want to play Sims, i want a good RPG, it may appeal to some people, but if that effort wouldve rather been put into other parts of the game they couldve accomplished a lot more. Yeah I just dont think it should exist in the way it is, Big time waste.Potions:Its a joke, a bad one at that. I wondered there was no DLC for faster brewing and plant growing, i dont want to sit around for 10mins waiting for plants to grow, or potions to finish. What in the actual?? Yeah you could start it and go back after doing some exploring or quests, but, no, just no. Not in a single player game for gods sake. You should buy and or pluck plants and brew potions instantly. Its the only way, made the game so annoying i cant even describe it.Exploration:Its just boring, i usually am a 100% dude, i love to roam a world and just do stuff, nothing quest related even, just go around and see the world, in this game its just a chore, i did it until i had the upgrades i wanted and then i couldnt be bothered to do it again. There are many ways to do it better but its just bad as it is.Quests:I can only really remember 1 minor side quests that wasnt one of the bigger ones that was memorable, again comparing to something like Witcher, its not even in the same universe, and with a world as rich as the HP one i think a lot more time and effort shoulve been put into it, it made the world seem dull and boringGames:The lack of any meaning full game like Quidditch (how is this not in the game????) or something even mentioned like gobstone is baffling to me.Conclusion:If you are not a huge fan of HP get it in a sale, If youre not into the HP franchise dont get it all, it wont give you much pleasure, I think they had an oppurtunity to make a remarkable game, and missed by a mile, maybe DLCs or updates will do something, but i doubt it"

There are a lot of fun easter eggs and references that fans of the franchise will appreciate.Unfortunately once the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia wore off for me I started to notice the game at its core for what it is, a rather generic (gameplay-wise) and uninspired open-world game filled with tedious side missions and fetch-quest content that is common-place in these sorts of games.The combat also suffers horribly from the really limited spell slots the game offers you, and I found myself having to frequently switch out spells to deal with certain situations because you just don't have enough space for all the important ones on your hotbars, and this constant breaking of gameplay flow really got on my nerves after a while.Its such a shame, because the developers have clearly spent a lot of time and effort making the game look and feel like the game all Harry Potter fans dreamed of as a child, but the gameplay falls very very flat, at least for me."

Adventuring  around Britain in the 1800's  environment and geographic locations are monochrome distinctive I cant even imagine authentically living there.For myself that's all I have to say for the game being highly disenchanted. I was stupefy thinking this game will awe me but it's not and now I have to Avada Kedavra it off my hard drive."

I saw the first movie, it wasn't bad. But haven't read any of the books.That being said, I am absolutely loving this game! The environment is so perfectly captured. The exploration is so much fun. I was a little concerned that the combat would get super repetitive, but so far each encounter mixes it up enough to be interesting. If you are not a HP fan, and wondering whether or not to play this game, I urge you to do it."

Though for those who may not be familiar with the lore may not find it as appealing due to all the issues I mentioned above. Still a lovely game.

1119,dasrehimblutagain,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199356669573/,3,,0,60.9,February,24,79,0,0,"It's not that I really would not recommend this game... The world including Hogwarts itself and small villages is beautiful. You can't help but walk around and explore it. The combat is decent and even allows to combine spells to achieve a (sometimes) meaningfull effect.But everything else is bland to say the least. The protagonist has no personality. The roleplaying is nonexistent. In dialogs the only options you have are usually a goody two-shoes response and a mean response. And whichever you choose - won't in any way affect the world around you.There is no meaningful conseqences of your decisions and actions. Although I'm by far not a fan of imposing morals on a player, this game is in dire need of a morality system to make it more meaningful. NPC are forgettable. There is absolutely no emotional bond to them. Time and again, I found myself wondering why teachers call these people my ""friends"". Seeng as even their personal quests never managed to give me a feeling of accomplishing something great or important together. And that there is no meaningful interaction with them between the quests. All quests are mostly divided into four types:1) go talk to someone 2) go acquire this thing and use it X times to proceed with another quest3) dungeons with intermittent puzzle/combat gameplay4) go find X amount of things hidden across the world and get usually nothing of any significance to the gameplay or to the story.The loot is abundant and even overflowing. But limited in variety. Clothing properties and design can be changed for almost any item, and things with better stats can be found approximately every 10 minutes. Thus, no piece of gear has that individual value that makes you want to hold onto it, upgrade it, and think twice before replacing it. The best thing that can be said about crafting is that it is present in the game.The world, although teeming with monster dens, enemy camps, and the ""Collect X anount of Y"" quests' objectives, feels empty. Open world enemy encounters are generic, add nothing to the story and quests, and yield the same meaningless loot upon completion. To sum up: the game is for you if you'd like to get lost in a magically beautiful world and just wander around, or if you are a die-hard fan of this universe. But do not expect it to stir you intellectually or emotionaly."

You can use avada kedavra and other prohibited spells in front of other students and teachers, nobody will react on that. Yea, so I'm killing everyone, so what?- the game becoming boring, because it's super repetitive.- open world, but there is not so much to do.- you need until 70+- hours to close ALL of the content in the game, including ALL of the collections (which is more than 1k items).To sum up, I can't recommend this game, especially not for such a price.For me it's not worth it, and I paid 55 euro, it's a lesson for me to have patience.If atmosphere is everything you need in a game, then feel free to take this one.I also thought that's I will like it very much, even if something will be bad, because I was waiting for so long to this game, but in the end I've played 20 hours and I don't feel motivated to open this game again, and that's why I don't recommend it."

The main story is a masterfully crafted narrative of our witch or wizard and their peculiar attunement for a mysterious branch of sorcery, known as ancient magic. We arrive at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry at the end of the 19th century as a latent fifth year, during a particularly hostile goblin rebellion instigated by one of the game's main antagonists; a devious goblin named Ranrok. During the game, we go to classes, make friends, complete tasks and learn and master many aspects of magic. We, along with the occasional help of our professors, friends and other companions, use these skills against the forementioned revolution and other wicked enemies. From the marvelous combat involving spells and weaponized botany, to the exhilarating flying upon a myriad of swift brooms or enthralling magical beasts, unto exploration of a large, diverse and vigorous map, laden with hidden secrets, demanding trials, valued treasures and dangerous encounters.  From the bottom of my heart, I truly recommend this game to anyone even slightly interested in open world fantasy RPG:s and especially to all Harry Potter book and movie fans. The portrayal of the world and story the fine people at Avalanche Software have created is truly magical."

As of now there are issues with textures showing up with solarized colors where the base texture will bleach white and be speckled with pink, green and blue pixels. This usually happens when close to being outside or outside where there are trees, bushes, etc. Which brings up the next issue. Dancing trees! Trees and bushes after a bit of time playing around 20 minutes or so will dance wildly shooting their textures across the sky, obstructing everything in view. This seems to happen in waves. Those will calm down and its the grasses cue and they do the same followed by the bushes then back to the trees. It's annoying at first but eventually requires a restart of the game because it also causes the frames to drop over time. Did I mention that birds also like to explode their textures when this is happening. I can usually play for about 20-30 minutes before these things start happening.Something that annoys me. You are allowed to customize the appearance of clothing items that you wear. If you change you clothing because lets say you find something else to wear that gives you more defense, offense, whatever (This happens all the time!) then you lose the appearance that you've chosen. You have to go back and waste time changing the appearance of every item of clothing every time you get something better or look stupid running around with a silly hat when you are supposed to be a master of the dark arts.Sometimes when running thru Hogwarts light will bleed thru walls and cracks from the outside.Stuttering issues. Seems to stutter more when in a cut scene than actual game play.As of now those are my only gripes. The controls are good. Except maybe flying but that might just take time to get used to or maybe the broom. There is plenty to do and lots of surprises. I'm playing on hard and even that feels a little easy. The attention to detail is beautiful. Facial animation could be better though.Most of these problems can be easily addressed and none are a reason to not get the game. The value of entertainment you'll get from playing and exploring will more than cover the cost. I am just over 40 and am enjoying the game along with a 20 year old son and my 7 year old loves it too."

1146,Cyz,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030466419/,2,,1,76.8,March,21,90,0,1,"This game is great. It nails the feel of Harry Potter and sits in the rarefied space as a great book, into entertaining movies, into a vibrant and engaging video game adaptation. Lots of hours went into making this a well polish, and fun game, and it shows. I knew this was going to be an enjoyable ride two seconds into the game, when you’re on your way to Hogwarts in a flying carriage you’re attacked by a dragon. I want to say first and foremost that this third person RPG is made for fans of Harry Potter, not necessarily hardcore gamers. This isn’t a bad thing, just don’t go into this game thinking it will be on a dark soul’s level when it comes to difficulty. I beat it on the hardest difficult with minimal reloading. This game is worth the money and it and will give you that magical feeling all the other mediums of Harry Potter give you. That is not to say it’s a perfect game.Strengths: Audio is crisp. Looks amazing. A massive emphasis on sound and graphics. Spells are fun, feel good, and you will use all of them throughout the game in battles and to solve puzzles (more on puzzles later). Main quest is engaging, side quests have flushed out characters that you can connect with. Atmosphere. Probably the highlight of the game. Hogwarts feels spot on. The houses are all there, and you get to choose which one to join. My understanding is, this has a huge impact on gameplay and quests, but I only stuck with Slytherin, so I can’t personally confirm. The professors (although slightly different names probably for copyright reasons. I know it’s set 100 years in the past but still) and classes are there too. Whether you’re running to potions class or learning a new spell in defense of the dark arts class. Talking with students or hanging out in the common room drinking from a goblet while petting a cat or running off to the forbidden forest to fight a troll, it all just feels authentic to the books and movies. Nosey ghosts are running around the castle, the library holds plenty of secrets, the dinning hall, the courtyards. Moving statues, talking paintings, there are bits of trivia everywhere, and you get experience for exploring too. You really feel it, and that is a massive accomplishment for the studio to pull off.  Revelio is a spell that highlights everything interactable in an area. What a simple and genius idea. I cast it constantly and its super helpful. The whole time I was thinking, why this the first game to utilize this mechanic? Maybe it’s not but I couldn’t think of one, and certainly none have done it as well as Hogwarts Legacy.  Broom flying, fast travel, and a well detailed map are also all included as great quality of life additions.There are animals you can capture and breed, potions to find and make, plants that attack for you, gear upgrades, and a massive world to explore. Mob index, castle, and hamlet history. Hidden treasures everywhere. Definitely no lack of things to do. A few things hold this game back from being on my Mt. Rushmore of video games. Weaknesses:The bugs. I had quest bugs, I had audio bugs, I had looting bugs. Steam thought the game was still running long after I had quit. I had my game crash multiple times while fast traveling. I had a bug that took a quest mob ten minutes to spawn, and I couldn’t leave the area, or I would fail the quest, a main storyline quest. On two separate occasions I had to download new drives for my video card because this game kept locking up my whole system. I will also loop in the startup time to go along with the defects. This game takes a long time to start up. I mean a long time. I have a decent machine (SSD and Gforce TI 1050 graphics card) and on multiple occasions this game took no less than ten minutes to compile all the shaders. I like to think I’m a patient person, but this was pushing it, even for me. I understand that the graphics are great, but still.The second was mob variety. Goblins, spiders, and dark wizards make up 90% of all the mobs in this game. Maybe a future DLC or expansion will blow this open, but as it stands, too many repeat mobs with the same moves. It’s even more of a shame because they have so much lore to pool from. This is Harry Potter we are talking about. Dementors, Basilisks, all kinds of mobs could have been included, but instead you get to fight another spider boss that does the same thing all the other spiders do.Not everyone will agree with this next one, but there are just too many puzzles in this game. I would have liked to see them condense the puzzle count, make them more difficult, and more engaging, and give better loot. They are not all bad, some of the treasure maps were fun, but most are too similar to each other to add much to the game play. I don’t know the total amount of puzzles you could end up doing in this game, but it’s in the hundreds if not thousands. 95% of them give you a reward you will forget about two seconds after you get it. Not my favorite game mechanic and I didn’t like the direction this game went with it. Did I mention there are way too many puzzles? I’m looking at you Merlin Trials.    In closing, the game has a good play time. 50-60h for the main story line if you know what you're doing in this genre of video game. Probably 100h if you want to be a completionist. I debated doing everything 100%, but after I finished the main story line, and side quests, I realized I don’t have a desire to go for it. I don’t regret a second of my playtime though, but probably won’t do a round two. Plenty of Potter Heads will though, and that’s another testament to the quality of this game. And make no mistake, this is a quality game. A great choice if you’re looking to get away from sweaty nerds yelling at you in multiplayer."
1147,IanOnATuesday,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ianisthecoolestpersontoeverexist/,5,,0,27.9,March,21,200,0,1,"When this game was announced, it was my childhood dream come true. An open world RPG set in the Harry Potter universe where I can create my own character and attend Hogwarts? Sign me up! Only this isn't an RPG, and you spend only about a quarter of the game actually going to classes and exploring Hogwarts. Instead, the developers thought it would be a really great idea to have you spend the majority of the game exploring the same copy & pasted dungeons and mines while fighting the same 4 enemies (goblins, dark wizards, spiders, and these ancient knight things) with the occasional troll thrown in to spice things up. How fun! The few quests in this game that are genuinely exciting and fun to play through... wait for it... have nothing to do with fighting enemies in boring locales. Going to classes, learning spells, taming magical beasts, and exploring the depths of Hogwarts are all things that you can do in this game, and it's a blast to do them! But the amount of quests dedicated to doing these things is minuscule. Maybe I could get past the tedious gameplay if the story was good, but it's not. The main plot is just completely uninteresting, and the villain is never a real threat. Most of the side characters, with the exception of Sebastian, all have stilted dialogue and disappointing questlines as well. By the end of the game, I was just trekking through, hoping to get to the end and maybe see some kind of satisfying wrap up, but I couldn't even get that. The geniuses at Avalanche decided to lock the final cutscene behind a level requirement that, for most people, will be about 9ish levels above their current one after the final boss. That means you have to grind boring sidequests and hunt for field guide pages for another 5ish hours before you even get to technically ""finish"" the game. It's no wonder that the achievement you get for this has been unlocked by only 13% of players. This is the opposite of what I wanted from a Harry Potter based game, and I'm utterly disappointed in the final product of something I have been wanting since I was a kid."

This has been hands down one of the best open world RPG games I have had the pleasure of playing! You are really missing out on a great video game experience if you don't give this game a try! You don't need to be a Harry Potter fan to understand what's happening - the game does a pretty good job giving you all the lore & getting you sucked into the story regardless. The combat has been the most fun, immersive, intense, & smoothest combat I've ever played - even if you suck you still feel like a powerful lil gamer throwing goblins around. YOU CAN FLY ON A BROOMSTICK?!?!? I have about 30 hours into the game & I've made little to no progress because there's SO MUCH to see & do & I'm not mad about it at all. In fact, I don't want this game to ever end! Each house gets a set of different quests - which is pretty cool! My BF & I started playing at the same time but we reached a point where we both started playing 2 different games/experiences. There's beautiful scenery no matter where you look! I wish character creation had a bit more freedom/options. You're stuck using a short list of presets, the hairstyles are kinda basic, not too many accessories (lots of nice clothing options tho!), & you can't change weight, height, specific nose/eye/facial structures. Just would like to be able to create more unique looking characters! Photomode is a NEED in a game as beautiful as this one! To add to the immersion - it would be cool to have animation to sit down places, poses for photomode (like cyberpunk has - their photomode is pretty OP), more accessories & you already know... Quidditch. If there are any DLC's in the future ... my money is already yours!!!!! I can't stop playing this game. Even when I'm not playing - I'm thinking about it non stop. It lives in my head rent free! Seriously, do yourself a favor & get this game. This game has temporarily cured my depression , lol. (not joking - im the happiest i've been in years right now). Thank you for making a game so full of magic & bringing a world we have all grown to love & find comfort in to life."

However, despite its exciting setting, the game is limited in its overall experience. One of the biggest issues with the game is the lack of interaction with NPCs. The NPCs in the game are reminiscent of those found in early 2000s games, and they do not respond to player interactions in meaningful ways. This leads to a disconnect between the player and the world of Hogwarts, making it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the experience.Another problem with the game is the limited interactions available to the player. The player is able to cast spells and steal items, but these actions do not have significant consequences and the NPCs ignore these actions. This lack of consequences and reactions from the NPCs takes away from the game's realism and immersion.You won't find a rich and dynamic environment to explore and interact with in this game. Instead, you'll find a world that feels static and unresponsive to your actions. If you're looking for an open world game with expansive gameplay options, I would definitely recommend skipping Hogwarts Legacy."

It's got some minor issues, but if you enjoy the Harry Potter world this will be a fun experience for you. Combat is decent but not amazing, the difficulty settings do not allow the game to be hard enough for an average gamer. The game keeps surprising me as I get thru the content(just keeps getting bigger). The story wont be winning any prizes but is a fair and average heroin trial type story. Mobility is good, the coder of the broom controls should never code anything flying again(who adds flying to a game without proper mouse movement controls?) The insane people who are harassing people for just playing the game, you need help(grow up)."

Hogwarts Legacy far exceeds the oh-so-low AAA bar by a mile by not just being a pretty stable game but a fun and kinda immersive one. For those of you deep in that Harry Potter lore, you won't be disappointed, and more importantly for those who don't know anything about the books or movies its still an enjoyable experience. Character creation and wand customization goes to an almost unreasonable amount of variety from your tone of voice to how floppy or rigid your wand is. Yes, you can set the size too...for all you who want to 12 plus inches of magic wood; now with all the wood jokes aside lets talk about combat. This game is an action RPG, one that rewards combos in combat almost as if taking a page out of Arkham along with counters for enemy attacks. Enemies sometimes shield themselves in a way specific spells are key to breaking through, so having variety in your applied spells is about as key as understanding how to combo and go all out on the enemy. The story...is decent. At the time of this review I had not completed it as I have had so much fun just checking out the sights of the massive open world. That said, the story isn't bad but as someone who knows the books some stuff feels kinda predictable yet fitting. You can make choices throughout the story and have different dialogues with npcs, but if there is one criticism I have for it is that it doesn't really have much weight or consequences to it. Its been fun exploring the castle and Forbidden forest, blasting through spiders and unleashing an unreasonable amount of fire on dark wizards. Definitely worth getting, if you are into action rpgs like this or are just a hardcore Potter fan that wants an immersive experience."

Characters remain an enigma throughout making it difficult to form any bonds and clearly identify you own personal stake in the story and core story elements are left incompletely explained.  Forget the keepers being hypocrites saying we have to hurry and still making me wait.- The story is on rails - you have 0 effect on what people do and just stand there in cut scenes as things happen the way the developers want regardless of the implications of your conversation choices OR learning dark magic.- Professor Weasly @ ~60% wizard field guide completion: ""You still have a ways to go.""   Professor Weasly @ 100% wizard field guide completion: ""You still have a ways to go.""- Every time I collect a Fwooper - ""Professor Fig will never believe this!""- Fast travel system every time I get too close - something dumb and repetitive like - ""You won't believe how inconvenient travel was before I invented floo powder.""  Like apparition or brooms haven't existed or you haven't ever told me that before.- More questions then answers after finishing the story- Can't even swim underwater - no gillyweed or charms to add that kind of ""depth"" to the game...part of the gear/skill system problem- Locking map objectives / puzzles to quests - like the depulso challenges or cabinet keys that float around - this is not conducive to the world being explored naturally.  I spent better part of an hour trying to figure out the depulso room entrance only to find out the entry button spawns after you get the quest.  Terrible!!!- Holds your hand hard...I mean super hard.  And in the wrong way...see my last point.- Can I not fight dragons?  Where is my dragon heartstring?  Where is my wandmaking or charming magic ability...where is making potions like that first time in potions class...where is anything that makes this game more interesting than both standing on the shoulders of Harry Potter and half decent combat you pulled from the Batman Arkham games?This lack of proper thematic mechanic design, lack of polish and lack of story leaves me feeling so empty after finishing this game.  Had the story pulled it's weight then most of these issues wouldn't of mattered as much but here I am.Reasons I can recommend:- Good graphics (not great - too much fog and LOD/lighting issues especially in far away terrains/textures -needs work in many places)- You can explore the castle/hogsmeade/world (if you are a HP fan just walking around is a treat)- Combat is engaging on a basic level- Easy to learn - good level design for beginnersTLDR:They needed to spend more on designers, writers and testers.  Emphasis on the first two.  The game is about 40-50% what it should have been.  In it's current state I call it: Hogwarts of Arkham: Breath of the Destiny...which is probably giving this game more credit than it deserves."
1157,antidotcb,https://steamcommunity.com/id/antidotcb/,2,,1,102.2,February,26,"2,468",0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a good game, although it may not be considered exceptional or groundbreaking. However, it delivers an intense beginning to the story, with enjoyable levels of fan-service that reference the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts movies. The game's overall atmosphere is positive, and it benefits from almost flawless technical implementation, a rare feat in today's gaming industry.One of the game's strengths is its strong combat mechanics, which start simple but become more complex and engaging as the game progresses. The graphical design and art style are also impressive, especially at extreme settings at 4K, although a decent PC is required to run the game this way.On the downside, the game suffers from repetitiveness and an overabundance of points of interest on the map, which can feel like mere placeholders after a while. The Merlin trials also feel lackluster, and the caves and camps become monotonous after the middle game. These factors contribute to the game feeling like a grind, which may not be appealing to non-diehard fans of the series. The sound and music also become repetitive, which can be a turn-off.The most significant technical problem is the difficulty in focusing on enemies or objects when there are many on the screen. The user interface could also be more user-friendly, with features like a ""Sell All"" button or the ability to buy multiple potions at once.Despite these flaws, there is potential for interesting story-based DLCs in other locations, which could make for an enjoyable gaming experience."

This review will be my experience of playing the game as someone who grew up with the films/books.𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝:The world is structured like most open worldpgs I've played, lots of sights (camps, caves, dungeons and more) to explore. The world never really felt empty this way and there was always something to go to. This game also has many easter eggs and experiences, I regularly discovered new things even when I had completed all quests.𝐀𝐭𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐩𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞:The atmosphere is great, there were many moments when I was just standing in hogsmeade and hogwarts and listening to all the people's stories or just wandering around hunting for new secrets. The developers did a great job with the effects/music and details, they really made the game feel alive.𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲:The story is OK, it just didn't really click for me. What kept me coming back to this game were the side missions/mysteries.I really liked that they gave you a storyline per person and there were even some storylines that I liked more than the main storyline.I liked that they rewarded you for completing side missions (they gave new spells as rewards).That made it that there was a reason to complete them.𝐀𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬:This game is perfect for people who like chasing achievements, the achievements are not too hard to get and are actually fun. There are about 603 collectibles to collect if you want to reach 100% and is easy to do in 60 hours of game time.𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧:This game is a great choice if you want hours of entertainment/new achievements to grind for.

Mentioning the game without mentioning the creator of it's IP is impossible due to her- dumb-ass-ery.I'm a trans person, I didn't participate in the boycott. Because, I realize, that in seeking allies, it's a bad idea to run around telling people what they can and can't do, and just be overall belligerent on the internet to the point where we annoy everyone else. We need all the allies we can get, and telling people that THEM enjoying their childhood media, no matter how mediocre those films and books are, that their enjoyment of those things is WRONG is not going to get them on our side. It'll push them further away.The itself game is great. JK Rowling maybe gets a dollar or two in royalties per copy, (and she has already made her money either way, with or without the boycott.) if you feel bad for buying the game because she's getting royalties from it, just donate like 5$ to an LGBT+ charity. Idk, I feel like it balances out.Also, you can literally choose your pronouns in the character creator, which shows the devs don't align themselves with Rowlings ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.To all the overzealous allies who are spoiling the game for others, or harassing strangers for playing a damn video game: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you don't represent all of us, and you especially don't represent me. A measured response is needed here. And you're not it.This game is well worth your money. The world is beautiful; I often find myself avoiding fast travelling all-together and *walking* through the world just taking it all in. Most of the characters are well written, I enjoy their individual stories, and have, so far, gone out of my way to experience every side quest I come across. The gameplay is responsive, and combat is simple, yet engaging, as each spell has a unique outcome depending on which enemies you use them on during a fight. The soundtrack is incredible, and conveys the feelings of any given situation at appropriate times. I know the year just started, but I fully believe this game deserves GOTY, or at least a nomination for it.  I hope those of you that are enjoying the game, continue to enjoy it. I'm going for 100%.

Loved the Dricken story.+ resource gathering. It's quick and you get plenty of stuff for potions just by going on your quests without teleporting.+ Combat is very nice, feels very natural. Troll fights and boss fights do need reflexes, although I have yet to fight a non-troll on Hard mode. I do not expect to be disappointed though.- Too grindy and repetitive- Buggy as for now. Laggy. Why give me the option to play with RTX when 40fps is going to be the norm in a top-shelf gaming PC in certain areas?- World too big for the amount of quests it has. I do not need to travel the whole map to enjoy the game, I'd rather have 1 Hogwarts and 1 Hogsmeade. Not.... 15 Hogsmeades.- Repetitive Hogwarts/student interactions.

The story is very engaging, the graphics are great and it's surprisingly stable for a new release. Admittedly, I'm not a big Harry Potter fans. Read the books once more than 10 years ago, seen the movies once or twice on video and I can see it rewarding 'real' fans of the Potterverse without punishing those of us who aren't."

All the details and exploration within Hogwarts are just as we imagined 20 years ago. As an avid RPG player, sometimes the game is not all about combat, but the liveliness of the exploration is the main factor in the game. This game nailed it in that part, even though the combat can be repetitive, but hope the exploration part just makes us forget about the particular combat aspect. Worth every penny for the deluxe edition, and btw bullying the player because they didn't get to the same political movement as you is a dumb move. You yourself are no other than the bully that did before you."

It's a really well made open-world RPG-ish action adventure. If you ilke Harry Potter this game delivers exactly what you think it will (and more). Sadly with raytracing it does stutter a lot (at least on a 3070). Without it it runs fine. Also the achievement design is quite grindy. There's also a problem with one of the 46 quests that prevents you from completing the game 100% without messing with save files (that is after the game is out for about 4 weeks).I had a great time playing the game, but if you want to get all achievements in the game it can be rather frustrating. Overall a great game and certainly worth getting if you are a Potter-head."

Despite this description, Hogwarts Legacy is not an RPG. You cannot make significant decisions in this game, you cannot be evil in this game, you can do little to effect the course of the gameplay. you have like two choices in dialogue for each encounter. This game also has horrible optimization issues, and barely runs at times. Additionally, there is little enemy variety, and you can cheese your way through most encounters. If you like fetch quests, get this game because there are a ton of them! Otherwise, I would steer clear or wait for it to go on sale. I was super excited for this one, and the final product left me sorely disappointed."
1189,doodlepigs,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973145012/,6,1,0,72.0,February,12,765,0,1,"First of all, I am giving a down vote for just two reason, Denuvo and the horrible performance and frame rate drop on PC. To be fair is it NOT TOTALLY unplayable but it definitely is a sub par experience, considering I have already reduced the video to mid-high AND it is still dropping frame rate to almost 10- 20 on many occasions. That is on my PC with 3080 Nvidia and AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core Processor 3.79 GHz and also 32 GB system memory!I suspect the need to include the lousy denuvo code definitely plays a part, since all games that have denuvo tend to have a bit of problem, as its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ code seems very difficult to include on the dev's own code without impacting performance in some way. On the other hand, the game is also likely not optimised to the PC hardware as well.As for the game itself, it is a very good game and thoroughly enjoyable. The characters is fleshed out, the quests are generally well designed even if some are repetitive and the world is buzzing. One thing though, do not expect your choice to have any significance .. or even to be given much choices in any way. treat it like a typical console game than a true blue PC RPG game and you won't experience some dissonance in terms of expectation and reality.I will change the rating to yes, if and when they patch the performance issue out AND remove denuvo."

Very immersive, detailed, and engaging gameplay.  After fully completing the game and unlocking everything, I wanted to keep going!  I hope there will be more DLC in the future.  Highly recommend.----- No Spoilers -----NPCs: One of the things I enjoyed most about playing through this game was the commentary from the NPCs.  The devs did a wonderful job giving them tons of dialogue and tailoring the lines to your progress in the story.  It created a truly immersive atmosphere and kept things fresh.  I also like all the background dialogue that can be overheard in the game, much of which is quite funny if you stop and listen.  The game feels very alive.Puzzles & Platforming: I thought the puzzles and platforming aspects were good with some being better than others.  I liked that not all areas could be solved right away, allowing me to return later when I had the appropriate tools to complete everything fully.  Combat:  I really enjoy the fighting aspect of this game!  In the beginning, I found combat challenging and it was evident that a controller was what it was designed around.  I eventually remapped some keys to make it a bit less frustrating and I became more comfortable performing sick combos.  The combat is a strong aspect in this game.Stories:  I thought the stories told were actually pretty good and better than some of the more recent Harry Potter films *cough Fantastic Beasts*.  I hope there will be more DLC in the future to expand on this narrative and timeline in the Harry Potter gaming universe.Customization: The Room of Requirement is awesome.  You have a ton of control over your spaces and I was blown away by how much you could do in there (it was really unexpected).  I also like that you can control your appearances while wearing the best gear. I highly recommend this game."

It's super fun and there's lots to explore!The game has a few bugs, but nothing overly awful. Usually reloading will fix the issue. Or an exit and re-open. It's annoying, but the developers will no doubt be fixing things in time!There's mostly a lot of silly annoying bugs. Like leaving hogsmeade and your character saying ""Hogsmeade here I come!"" No... we just left there, you silly twit!I should note, I only recommend this game if you are Ravenclaw, like me. Otherwise you should go elsewhere. We don't need you gaining house points for your lesser houses.But it's worth noting, house points don't seem to be a thing unfortunately. The game doesn't focus on the school a whole lot, there's no quidditch, there's very few classes and as said, no house points.But there's an upside to this. The game focuses on the Wizarding World. The universe around the school. You can explore the Forbidden Forest, or even go further a field. I won't say too much, you'll have to see for yourself!You'll be absolutely BLASTED with nostalgia, at every turn. And if you're anything like me. You'll love every minute of it.I would however warn fellow arachnophobes, that there is no option to turn the spiders off, and they can be pretty yikesy!Now, the finally point. The drama around this game. I didn't want to have to talk about this. But people make it damn near impossible to avoid. I am trans, it's an intrinsic part of who I am. There is representation in the game, and I have a friend, who has a friend, who is a story writer for the game. Apparently he's having issues with his kidneys. I suspect this game doing so well might save his life. Why am I talking about this mans kidneys? Because it's important to note, that even if you don't like JK Rowling, the success of this game impacts more than just her.I disagree with things she's said. I dislike things she encourages. I hate transphobia. But. This is a good game, made by good developers. And she's already rich. So please, if you don't want to buy the game yourself, that's totally okay. Just don't harass anyone who does. You do trans people no favours. You are not an ally to trans people if you do this.Because you just make us more enemies.There's also a trans character. Which some people say is ""virtue signalling"". I disagree. It's a great risk on the behalf of the developers to include a trans character. In a game that's mostly going to be played by JK Rowling supporters. The world needs more love.Now, I've left comments off. But not just for the obvious reason. I want to avoid any negativity I can. And prevent others from seeing angry commenters too.Just know, that regardless of who you are. I love you, I want you all to have a lovely day and I hope that you get to live a life without hate.P.s. You can pet cats. <3"

What surprised me here is the variety of clothing items throughout the game.- Great achievement's system in game AND on Steam. If you're also a person who gets hyped because of those, you'll enjoy it!- Great adaptation of the books to the game. Excellent references of characters, items, places and other things.- - - Main quest: I expected more from the story itself. For me, it was very easy to predict the path I would take after the third trial.- - Side quests: Some are often more fun/complex to do than the main quest itself. I didn't mind focusing on other stuff than the main quest itself lol - Controls during battle: The spell shortcuts are pretty bad, I had to reconfigure them to get better gameplay.- Enemies: Some are much easier than others even the ones who supposedly to be stronger, - I bought the deluxe version for early access, but I was disappointed with the additional content released, I don't think it was worth it. I hope that the same quests released exclusively for PS5 will also be included in the future.- URGENTLY needs better optimization.In general, I think it's worth to play it but keep in mind that, if you're used to this type of genre, you may need to adjust your expectations to the limitations. I'll be looking forward for the future updates and new addicional contents as well."

1212,Medium-Rare Lethargy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/catalepsis/,4,1,0,25.2,March,25,169,0,1,"The first few hours of this game felt so full of life, so inexplicably exciting; I really felt hooked. Unfortunately, the 'magic' only lasts for so long. The remainder of the game is persistently dull.   Every puzzle mechanic or setting that is briefly interesting seem to only have been used as a little feather to tickle our noses with, it's just disappointing to see the amount of obvious love that has gone into many parts of the world go to waste because this overblown officially licensed fan fiction tries to reach it's fingers into too many pies. I don't even want to really get into how uncanny it is that in spite of anything our character does in the story or side, the worst consequence you can really get is a bit of sass or a mild scolding.   Most folks probably don't expect anything mindblowing from this game, perhaps they just wanna explore the recesses of their nostalgia within the recesses of Hogwarts. This game DOES encourage exploration, and the castle truly IS beautifully made and presented. However, the way they encourage exploration is a far cry from being engaging in any sense of the word. Spamming REVELIO as I jaunt through the halls, it really takes away from much of the sense of amazement I reckon I would have if these areas were presented to us in a different context. Our introductions to the various classes of Hogwarts are an adequate example of that being done, of exploring the god forsaken castle through the inquisitive eyes of our youthful protagonist and their peers. It's a crying shame these classes are only one-offs and the rest of the game is so much more focused on other parts of the world it's a wonder that they felt the need to include the school at all.   Also ♥♥♥♥ the vapid ♥♥♥♥ JKR, donate to charity  if you're up to it."

Let the game take you on an adventure+ Rich story+ Graphic is perfect+ cut scenes are very good, also good job on voice actors+ you can replay the game as other house student and still feel like playing it for the first time+ the fantasy is unreal, you will feel in love with the vibes and everything+ the npcs are great, not too bot alike+ the spell casting is so fun, combos and everything+ very little bugs in the game, overall well polished+ fly around is very fun, you can explore so  much, the map size is actually goodthe experience of playing this game is actually out of this world, its like an escape of our real world.cons:- they are some quests that are a bit annoying to do like deliver things and all, like many games that we know (but also they are many many quests that actually take you in to a cool adventure)- the character customization is okay, I wish we can change the character more.- At night inside hogwarts is completely empty, I either wish for like more npc wandering around or at least prefect or professor.- NO QUIDDITCH ??

Fairly I can say I felt that magic for maybe the first 10 hours the first cutscene arguably had me drawn in I was ready to experience something I thought I have never felt before It was really laggy constant memory leak and It was barley borderline unplayable but I turned everything to medium some low just so I could play regardless of lag the second I made it to hogsmeade I was in awe it all felt alive and just as I expected it would feel like as in the movies well the troll breaks in and my pc ♥♥♥♥♥ itself the whole cutscene was unwatchable because of how laggy it eventually stopped as this game loves to have little 10 second lag events where my GPU is being worked at 100% then randomly stops But I could deal with it and I did I have almost 100% the game MAIN REVIEW : Sadly the honeymoon feeling went away I have seen the castle I explored hogsmeade and I got on a broom after that I started to notice the small things that the game placed infront of me that they hadnt placed anymore your first run through of all places feels good seeing everything the first time then when you come back its almost lifeless npc dont have anything to say other than like 4 scripted sentences the teachers of the school just stand in there room looking at the wall with no dialogue the Headmaster is no where ever to be seen you can never have a conversation with a student unless its one of the people from the group your put in the school with AND SAYING STUDENT IS BAD OF ME this game feels like there is no students at all other then inside the halls of the school In cutscenes in the class in the class at all ever in the ending there is always only 5 or 6 students you arent in this massive house with a bunch of students your in a dorm with like 6 people that you will see your whole entire playthrough Another big issue I have with this game is the lack of world interaction I found a snow man that would throw snowballs at me once that was preety cool other than that the most you can interact with in this world is shoot paintings with your wand  spin globes and drink tea and eat candy no talking with npcs no way to sit down and look apart of the enviroment there is no way to get cool screenshots and photos of this game because its always your weird ass npc standing in the middle of the room while everyone stands there saying the same thing that they literally always say when you come near them THE WORST the biggest thing for me out of all of this is how useless everything felt the demiguise moons? thats the worst story line for a collectible in a game that I have ever seen in my life like the story for alot of the characters and events that take place in this game are so just horrible like this writing is purely lvl 1 of story telling whoever wrote these storys needs to spend there talent points in story telling the DECEPTIVE way they told us we can be dark wizards in this game is a actual joke like I really cant believe they tried to spin this as a choose your path game when you literally have 2 choices in dialogue the whole game the good guy and the inconsiderate guy that has 0 effect your relationship or anything for that matter with anyone you can get 3 unforgivable curses so the extent of your ""DARK WIZARD"" gameplay was to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to people when they speak to me and be able to shoot green colored animations at people like its really upsetting to me how devoid of magic this game is essentially the rpg formula of a game that branded them selves with one of the most popular storys ever told to sell a rpg with the visualization of the harry potter universe I set out to 100% this game before it even released under the COPIUM that it was the harry potter experience I have always wanted I got that for 4 hours maybe and then it all left me I like the game and its probably great for people who have very minimal experience with rpgs but for me It was just another rpg in another world but this time it was based around one of the closet storys to home for me this game is a 6/10 it ran so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horribly It should get 5/10 but ill look over performance issues on this one sense I was able to atleast finish the game = buy it, its a great game until you decide that you want to complete everything alot of the hours this game points at saying you can get out of it are really just regular rpg mechanics created to keep you logged in playing as much as possible that give you no real lore no real understanding of the universe have no real tangible worth to the universe they reside in other than giving you more hours to spend in the harry potter, hogwarts legacy universe / I have alot more that I found a problem in this game but I dont really think it needs to be said other than gear and upgrade and even skill system seem almost useless If I wanted to I could have beat the game without ever upgrading gear or putting a trait on it probably would have made the game more hard and enjoyable if I didnt tbh but I LOVE the beast system and the room of requirement that is true magic that room and the beasts feel like harry potter to me and so I indulged in it could i have beaten the game without it? oh yeah But anywho thanks for making hogwarts into a explorable world that I can say I have enjoyed to explore - 6/10 I will change my recommended no to a yes once this game fixes the performance issues and once I have seen the rest of the dlcs I have a fair shallow feeling that the dlcs will be essential gameplay mechanics the game once had but were removed for the profit if I see dlcs with real meaningful magical experiences than I will glady switch my recommend to a yes"

From just how many little secrets and mysteries you come across in Hogwarts castle itself to Hogsmeade always feeling warm and welcoming along with the picturesque countryside you fly through on either broom or magical beast.Gameplay wise it plays well, with fast and responsive attacks and spells. Most of the skill for this will come in your ability to quickly swap between your different sets of spells. It does come with a learning curve, but nothing too harsh that can't be adapted to. Pair that with the use of magical tools and the potion crafting and gear upgrade system you'll be able to easily dominate most foes if you use all of the tools at your disposal.Now at the moment of writing this review I have yet to finish the main story, but it has so far been gripping enough that I enjoy it. Most of the characters you come across are also at worst, bearable. Though I've ended up putting most of my hours in to simply exploring, doing side quests and expanding my magical beast collection, not even into the winter season just yet.Finally we come to the music, which is simply enchanting. It remains familiar to the soundtrack from the Harry Potter movies I'm sure a lot of us grew up watching, but still has it's own distinct sound. Almost like it's more primal at times, with the occasional recognisable notes played throughout.I wold wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who has been eagerly awaiting a new Harry Potter game. Despite all the drama and such around the game itself, and my own misgivings towards J.K. Rowling, the devs behind this game deserve your money."

The difficulty is extremely low in ""normal"", the way you prepare potions and spells is so ""kindergarten"" difficulty that it feels it was designed for kids not for a whole range of people of different ages.It doesn´t matter what I choose, the game doesn´t change, and they all make feel the protagonist like a protagonist, but they spoon-fed it ""oh I never saw anyone fly like that"", ♥♥♥♥♥ it was you and me only, where is the rest of the class?Classes don´t matter, you can do whatever you want at any hour, there´s not curfew, there´s not much to buy from stores (which are open all day and night btw)If you like a game where you can be a Hogwarts student just to walk around and roam the castle.

Equipment is useless, no matter the type of equipment I have as long as I can dodge it should be fine.Also, the fact that you can unlock the spell upgrading at level 14?? but you supposed to be using them since level 5 and they give you a list of 13 points at once, it´s kinda dumb... at least that´s what happened to me, there is no progression where I was told it can be done otherwise.Empty game. Like a Barbie, beautiful outside, hollow on the inside."

At first glance, it is clear that the developers have paid great attention to detail and created an amazing world full of mysteries and extraordinary places. The graphics are stunning and captivating, and the music perfectly captures the atmosphere of the magical school of wizards.The game also offers an intriguing storyline in which the player becomes a student at Hogwarts and uncovers the secrets of the castle and its surrounding world. The gameplay is full of challenges and diverse tasks that provide many hours of fun."
1227,Sevotius,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevotius/,2,,1,70.7,February,21,732,0,1,"After having 100%-ed the game with all achievements in tow, I can say with confidence that Hogwarts Legacy is a  game. Not groundbreaking, not genre-defining, not revolutionary but certainly good. This is no Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2. However, I'm hoping this is just the beginning.1. Performance issues. For a game that doesn't look particularly outstanding, it can sure be taxing on your PC, especially the ray-tracing. Glad to see the devs dropping some quick patches though.2. The open world outside of Hogwarts is both large and unengaging. There's not a lot of interesting things to do and completing every Merlin Trial, popping every balloon, landing on every platform, finding every field guide etc. is such a chore. It doesn't help that the map actually doesn't show all of these locations forcing you to ""Revelio"" your way to it.3. Revelio. I hate it when games have only one good way of discovering points of interest and loot and you're forced to just mindlessly spam it all the time. Sure I could stop doing it and actually observe things for a change but with the hundreds of things to interact with, I simply don't have the time to actually *look* at the world. This to me is a failure of game design and an artificial method of bloating play time.4. Bad loot. Your gear, while visually appealing, only serves to add some stats. And since you can transmogrify everything, you have absolutely no attachment to anything you find. Also after a certain point, around midgame for me, there's nothing to spend your money on.5. Museum world. You can't interact with most NPCs, most items and most locations forcing you to just look but not touch.6. Combat camera. I've been fiddling with the camera for a while and it just doesn't feel right. Lock-on and targeting feels clunky overall.7. Side quests. There are so few side quests in this game. Some of the best moments in open world RPGs for me happen when you stumble unto something wholly unexpected yet gratifying. Unfortunately, that doesn't really happen in Hogwarts Legacy.8. School life. You barely interact with fellow students, your teachers or your classes. Attending Hogwarts feels less like going to school and more like Witcher Lite since you're spending most of your time fighting monsters in the wild.9. Half baked RPG mechanics. Rudimentary dialogue options and skill points does not an RPG make.10. Alohomora. What's the point in having a lockpicking game when the entire purpose of this spell is to literally unlock everything?1. Hogwarts. Even though you barely interact with it, Hogwarts itself is a feast for the eyes. Multi-storied and multi-dimensional with lots of hallways and stairs weaving in and out, it's a joy to simply explore this grand institution.2. Music. The music has all the charm and whimsy of the movies and is absolutely delightful.3. The Room of Requirement. While it's annoying listening to Deek for the hundredth time, the actual room and especially the vivarium is fantastic. I'd love a DLC that expands upon care of magical beasts.4. Intriguing main story. While the ending didn't quite hit all marks for me, I still enjoyed how the plot unfolded and the new lore it adds to the Wizarding World.5. Relationship quests. Natsai's was...fine. Poppy's was genuinely pretty fun. Sebastian's had some artificial character conflicts IMO but was by far the most engaging. I was actually more interested in it than the main story lol. Just one question: why is Ravenclaw the only House that doesn't have a relationship quest attached to it?6. Tight combat. Yes, the camera is funky but the actual combat is the tried and tested (and immensely fun) Arkham/Shadow of War model. Love it.7. Budding mod scene. There's already some great content there like expanded vendors and performance fixes. Seeing a lot of potential here.8. Puzzles. I always enjoy a good puzzle and Hogwarts seems like especially fertile ground for such things. Glad that the devs made a few interesting ones.9. Great cast of characters. I genuinely liked pretty much all the cast, with the exception of the villains, and I just wished for more interaction with all of them.10. Lots of detail. Whether it be suits of armor battling it out, a portrait giving you a wink or a ghost asking another for a dance, there are tons of little interactions to enjoy for the eagle-eyed.With all that out of the way, I'll repeat my notion that this game is indeed, objectively, pretty good. Really hoping there are DLCs/expansions/sequels in the pipeline since the MC is just a 5th year, there could potentially even be a trilogy some day. If the devs can fix those issues and double down on those strengths, I imagine there's a future masterpiece on the horizons.PS: Concerning the controversy that's been going on, yes, I'm sure JK Rowling is getting all them sweet sweet doubloons, no, she does not deserve to be supported, but hey, she's so astronomically rich anyway that the royalties from this game would be pennies for her. Also there's literally an awesome trans character in the game and I'm sure the idea of that would make JK Rowling froth at the mouth with rage. All in all, it ain't much but it's something."
1228,MoZeDK,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197965077110/,2,,1,86.8,February,19,267,0,1,"Well the game overall I like, and do recommend. I have finished the game and trying to find some differences in the second play, and haven't found that much difference yet so replay ability is a bit low at the momentI will try to keep this as much a possible spoiler freeThe story:I think it is a bit bland, and not really that good. To many story lines more or less from the book/movie, so if you like me, have read and watched them, you kinda able to figure out what is going to happen with big parts of the game.Some of the side quests are decent like Sebastian.A bit to much on rails where you can't effect it to much, for my taste.Some of the blandness ties in to the characters in it that is not that interesting, and for me differently feels a bit out of place as this is set 1890'sMost of them is not that memorable, though did as stated before find Sebastian a good story, poppy a bit to.I would have liked to see more impact from the player on the story and a new story and not borrowed as much from the already told onceThe world:This is pretty nicely crafted world with lots of places to see and explore, and here it does grep some of the magic I find.Hogwarts is nicely done a rather big the first time around, you can get lost if you like me took away most of the hud and tried to find around my self, this I found pretty awesome.Hogsmeade is also pretty nice, thought it thought it would be a bit bigger but that is okey.The small hamlets is also pretty nice, and lots of small dungeons, camps and other POI'sNice to have a broom to get around to see the spots, though a little bit of annoyance when flying on mounts like the hippogriff's I haven't found a way to ""auto"" fly like on the broom. It is a big place after all, and I really do like the creatures in the game.Gameplay/combat:I like that is pretty easy to get into but can be a bit harder to master, might want a harder difficulty.Stringing some of the combo's in succession  feels pretty good, also that you can use plants is nice and a bit funny at times.There are different mechanics that are really nice once you have master them or get more comfortable with them.The amount of different enemies you encounter, is a big to low/not varied  enough so you see to much the same thing at times.A little annoying  you can't reset your talent points, have to think before using them, this is primary for the first play through, but as I do not see much replay ability as of yet, hence why I think it is a bit annoying.The magic:Well at places it does capture the magic like with the world as a whole.Though there is a lot of inconsistency with the lore. e.g. you are sent at time early in the game in to the forbidden forest even though it is ""forbidden"", the use of the unforgivable curses etc. This might have worked better if you where an adult.They also loose me a bit with the classes, not that interesting, could have used a bit more work in my opinion.The magical beasts is pretty nice and gets some of the feeling of the world really good.Some of the magic is lost with the characters as mentioned, as they are a big boring and misplaces at times.NPC can also seem a bit to ""static"" not sure that is the correct word.Why do I recommend the game, well it has in my opinion a good openworld explorations for people that like the  J.K. Rowling Harry Potter world.It also have a decent combat/gameplay with lots of nuances to play your own style, that makes the game fun to try to master.So overall I like the game and recommend it, though I think it was a bit over hyped."

Good value for the money, and an appropriately finished game on release day. Sad to say: this should be the norm, but it isn't.Other than that: good graphics, nice but sometimes repetitive music design. Battles weren't too challenging, but entertaining. No feeling of ""grind"" or repetitiveness after 40 hours. Finishing the field guide might lead to frustration, let's see whether I will continue on that journey."

1243,Chinese Spy Balloon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/foammanzone2/,5,,1,72.9,February,15,99,0,1,"60 hours into the game, I can say for sure that it is worth $59.99. Content - 9/10 * Many side-quests located throughout the game world. * Story-Rich Main Quest Line and great motion capped cut-scenes comparable to the movies. (MAKE SURE TO HAVE CORRECT AUDIO PRESET OR MOUTH MOVEMENTS DURING SPEECH WILL BE MISALIGNED.) * Combat is fluid and creative, allowing for players to be creative with their spell combinations.* The game launched with 20+ Spells.* Missing Quidditch - There is a completely built out Quidditch pitch on Hogwarts grounds though, so I imagine the devs either delayed that part of the game or are planning on DLC.* Lore Rich - If you read any of the books, so many rich details within just Hogwarts alone that align with the films and books.* Character Customization - Detailed, but unable to edit face details like games like Skyrim would. Plenty of gear and fashion items that can be earned through challenges or completing activities in the game world. It took over twenty hours of looting and game-play to receive a duplicate item. * Challenges & Progression that align with extra un-lockables that can be used as cosmetic upgrades as you progress throughout the game. *Complex & Interesting Crafting & Hideout Mechanics that allow you to customize your own personal areas.* The game took inspiration from the Fantastic Beasts movies as-well, without spoiling in game features, that's all I will say. Map 10/10 - Hogwarts & Hogsmead are both immense with many places to explore. 60 hours in and I have not found all of the loot, books, or foo-flames within Hogwarts & Hogsmead.The World Map is Huge - Including Hogwarts & Hogsmead, currently as I know of, the world map has 14 regions for the player to explore. There are small and big details everywhere around the map. Unlike some other open world games that don't pack the empty spaces between activities, this game has filled them with puzzles and other activities. Movement & Combat - 8/10 Combat feels very fluid and natural, I play on Keyboard & Mouse and still enjoying casting spell combos and trying out different ones. I can't speak for controller players as I have not tried it, but I imagine it can't be bad. Character movement can be clunky at times, I suspect this is an issue with K&B, making your character seem flinchy or hard to control at sometimes, but is easy to master a couple hours in. Voice-Acting - 7/10 There are some moments where I think the devs had run out of voice-actors and just pitched down others voices to make more, as some voices of NPCs who may not be very important to the main story-line can sound robotic or electronically changed in someway. Otherwise, all of the main characters, and the players characters voice acting is great. There are characters that actually draw you deeper into the world and make you care about some of them or actually want to know more about their character. Music - 10/10 Normally in most games, the music slider always gets put to zero, but you will have a hard time doing that in this game with a great soundtrack reminiscent of Harry Potter &some songs from that series as-well.Performance - 9/10 SPECS -ASUS TUF X470AMD Ryzen 5 2600 OC'd @ 3.6 32GB RAMRTX 3050GRAPHICAL PRESET:All ULTRA - 55-60 FPS Avg. Ray Tracing seems to be bugged - or NVIDIA needs to drop a driver update on Feb 10th with the full release of the game,but with Ray Tracing enabled there are times where there are insane FPS stutters, but usually fix themselves in 2-3 seconds. Keep in mind, this could be my own bottleneck, or the game.I have noticed FPS drops in the game world are apparent during especially effect heavy areas in the game-world like the forbidden forest or some areas within Hogwarts. I have noticed while bench-marking performance, during these areas, the game does not pull enough memory away from what is available, in both VRAM and RAM.   This can be partly solved by increasing the process priority in task manager. Devs will have to do more work in optimization in this regard. All in all, we should all be happy about a completely playable, game-breaking bug free and complete-content filled game from a AAA studio with a stable release."

1248,ScarletStreak,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ScarletStreak/,4,,1,99.5,March,6,249,2,1,"Combat is surprisingly the best part. Played with a controller, combat on Hard difficulty is challenging but feels rewarding. There's the usual dodge, block and perfect block which is satisfying to pull off. Deflecting multiple casts and utilizing every combat spell is extremely fun. Spells are designed to be chained to exploit opponent's weaknesses. Dark arts spells are optional but powerful, they really spice things up and makes the protagonist an unbeatable machine. Potions and plants are a very welcome addition to combat. Stealth is also a nice touch which makes use of invisibility and a unique spell for takedown.The story revolves around an ancient magic which is tied to the protagonist. It is a decent story but made enjoyable by the cast. There are interesting quests in there but there's one which really stands out. You'll know which one I'm talking about, it's hilarious and I'm glad they added this. There are classes to attend as part of the main quests and assignments to complete which reward spells. Side arcs and quests are just as good as the main content. The boss fights though are not as spectacular.The protagonist and the main cast's performance is easily one of the highlights of the game. The female voice for the protagonist is very pleasant with some funny lines of dialogue. Some cutscenes are pre-rendered but feature great action.Gear customization is perfect. There are an insane amount of options to choose from combined with the Transmog system. Character creation is well done. The game really needs a photo mode.The Room of Requirement and its related activities are an absolute delight. It is superbly executed with incredible attention to detail and remarkable animations. Brewing potions, growing plants, taking care of magical beasts, designing the architecture are fun activities but they also provide benefits to the character. There are countless structures and decor to conjure, you can make the room look just as you wish. There is so much to do here that the Room of Requirement could be an entire game. Hogwarts is huge, full of puzzles and activities. The gameplay loop here is very enaging and makes you want to explore more. The outside of Hogwarts is just as huge with an insane amount of things to do, with beautiful landscapes and scenery. There are some puzzles called trials which are overdone and there are repetitive treasure vaults which are copy-pasted content. The trials and vaults can became a chore to complete if you want to finish all of them. The battle arenas are a fun distraction. Lots and lots of collectables are scattered throughout the world.Mountable creatures are a joy to ride, the broom stick is versatile enough to take shortcuts and land where you want. They make traversal fun.Soundtrack is superb, it has the vibe from the movies and is a delight to hear. The ambient music in the common rooms is also a nice touch.The four different houses to choose add some amount of re-playablity with each house having unique quests. Although the main story is linear, there are some decisions with consequences.Performance on PC is terrible to say the least. Despite shaders being compiled on the first boot and every boot having a pre-check for compiled shaders, there is stuttering at every turn inside Hogwarts. If you are someone with a high tolerance for stutter or cannot perceive it, then it's all good. But for the rest of us, it is painful and definitely the only thing bringing the entire experience down. The hotfixes and patches have not really helped much, with the frametime graph being a mess and full of hitches. I hope this takes the highest priority.Hogwarts Legacy is an amazing achievement by Avalanche Software and a must-play adventure."

The game makes you repeatedly do the same thing within a short time span and reuses content constantly. The most egregious is lock picking. To lock pick you need to spin 2 wheels around until you see movement on two other gears. The game makes you unlock EVERY SINGLE DAM DOOR that you don't have open at the start of the game. It does short cut where if you lock pick into a room you don't need to lock pick out again, but a lot of lock picked rooms then have a chest that requires lock picking or a second room that requires lock picking, and there is no variance in the lock picking game. It never gets harder or easier.The entire game is like that. Combat is incredibly trivial and tedious, with the same enemies and the same abilities. Sometimes however they also give the enemies excessive amounts of life, so you're just left clicking for 20mins while not taking damage because the AI has gotten stuck on something once again. Most spells are mechanically exactly the same as one another.It's all just a slog. Play if you're a Harry Potter fan or want to see the world, but don't expect much fun after the first 10hrs."

Its a pleasure to see the castle layout and feel exactly how Potter and his friends would of felt getting lost. Hogsmead is just as detailed and brought to life as the world of hidden secrets that you unfold are just detailed. The ONLY CRITICIZING I must say is, Why did they not make this co-op or bring a multiplayer aspect to this.

I was so hyped about the game after all these years - a Harry Potter game with modern graphics. I will point out the bad sides first. 1. The game is dashingly predictable. The story is boring (SPOILERS!!!), I am the ultra young hero that defeated and killed wizards with muuuch more experience than me. Sure. Booooring. 2. I start from 5th year and I miss all the fun from the beginning, all the spell learning, classes, etc. 3. Every single NPC besides the ones for the quests, feel like the training dummies I test my magic on. They do not feel living, they kinda just stay there, like cardboard characters. 4. This should must've been a MMORPG game, where we start from 1st year, learn, duel each other, form teams, eventually story unwinds that Hogwarts will be attacked eventually, we participate in different events where we learn newer and newer stuff, the years go by, we get better and better, whole game goes darker, more enemies spawn, attack us, lure us, etc. Eventually we get to a point where we have to defend Hogwarts and if we fail - then we have to retake it. All of us should've had our own paths, become herbalists, beast masters, potion maters, etc, fight with what we chose, explore the world, gather, learn. Have different character personalities - like being bad or arrogant, or good, or selfish, etc. 6. Game becomes repetitive fast, especially with all the cut scenes that you cannot cancel (like Merlin trials) - it gets annoying. 7. The whole world feels... small. Yes, there's lots to explore, but it gets the same after some time. Spiders, inferni, some water enemies and loalists. That's it. Few trolls and few wolves. 8. The game is badly optimized for PC, it works, but it requires a lot of hardware to be ran on maximum graphics where you do not get much better graphics, to be honest. 9. Conversations are dull, you cannot make proper conversation, it's very straightforward and there are ""choices"" that do not affect anything of the end game. 10. All the teachers are bad copy from the teachers of the HP saga, visually and character like. 11. If it was a 10$ game - it would be okay. But 50-70$ game - it's definitely not worth the money,Overall - meh. It's playable, it's just not what it could've been - a masterpiece. Now it's just another game we will forget in several months."

Not worth full $60 asking price, but if you can get it for $25 or below I think it's a fair deal.   I have yet to finish the game. I am about 20 hours in.  Fantastic visuals for the most part. This looks like a true next-gen game. The high production value really shines throughout the open world. Hogwarts itself looks AMAZING, one of the best interiors I've ever seen in a game, with beautiful lighting and perfect amounts of clutter and complexity. Combat is much better than most games in this style and there's a good repertoire of spells to draw from. Juggling enemies, making them fly away with depulso, flipping them around and slamming them to the ground - it feels GREAT. It easily s**ts on the combat of games like Witcher 3 or a typical Ubisoft open world game. The way the game uses vibration and how it ties into combat is likewise brilliant, doing something as simple as the basic spell cast by hitting the RT button gives you a snappy sound and visual feedback and just the right amount of vibration to make casting a spell feel good.  This all comes together to make a VERY satisfying combat experience. I really liked the fact the game goes through seasons which changes the look and feel of Hogwarts and the rest of the world. Winter at Hogsmeade gives off a fantastic atmosphere! Speaking of Hogsmeade, you can tell the developers put a lot of effort into it, similar to the effort they put into Hogwarts school. Walking around and listening to conversations that normal adult wizards are having about the state of the wizarding world, seeing students get tricked into eating a deceptively-named candy that makes steam shoot out of their nose and mouth, coming across a group of concerned wizards protesting about the goblin uprisings - they really nailed the atmosphere and believability here. The brief segments when you're in class are very cool, feels like classic HP vibes when Harry was attending class and learning spells in the first few books/movies, wish they happened more often though. Broom flying is visually stunning and controls are good; some of the best visuals I've EVER seen in a game have come from flying around the world during sunset or sunrise and witnessing the auburn glow of the sun bend and smother the verdant landscapes... it's seriously GORGEOUS! however, I was wishing for a bit more character-world reactivity when it came to flying, like having your character get knocked off his/her broom when bumping into an obstacle at high speeds, or having your character cover their face when you're flying through the branches of a treeThere are some decent side stories and characters, my favorites were the mentor/professor and Sebastian. For the most part the other professors and students are endearing as well. I was a little iffy at first on the stark racial and cultural diversity in this game, with tons of African, Middle Eastern and East-Asian people milling about Hogwarts and the surrounding land, which is strange considering the game takes place in early 20th-century England. However I got to a point eventually when I stopped caring and I ended up liking most of the non-white characters.  It's a modern AAA western game with a lot of influence from Ubisoft and EA. Because of this you get obnoxious and unfun mechanics like an unbearably ♥♥♥♥ looting/gear system with common-uncommon-rare-legendary gradings. This is a real shame because you can see some soul and ""magic"" in Hogwarts Legacy but it's often ruined by how generic the systems are. They even threw in the korok puzzles from BotW, which means if you want to have an inventory that isn't extremely annoying to manage you're forced to fly around and look for these trials. They fumbled the ""immersive school experience"" that they were trying to cultivate at the start of the game. I am about 20 or so hours in and I've only been to my common room 3 or 4 times total. There's no schedule you have to follow, you don't get reprimanded for being out of bed at night, you're allowed to come and go from campus and pick fights with random dark wizards you find in the woods, professors barely react if you cast an unforgivable curse right in front of their eyes. I was really hoping for something akin to Persona 5's handling of school, with perhaps a bit more freedom. But instead it's like you're barely even a student, just a young adventurer that likes to stop by Hogwarts occasionally. I wouldn't say the optimization is really bad, but it's not as good as it could be. I'm getting around 55-60 FPS at 4k DLSS quality and high preset with raytracing off on my laptop 3070ti. The collect-a-thon aspect is painfully boring. They have a small handful of very simple puzzles that they throw around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade and they repeat these braindead puzzles ad nauseam. I understand this is a game that takes place in the Wizarding world, collectibles have always been present in the Harry Potter games but they could've really done a better job at offering us more unique puzzles. The music is forgettable, which is a shame because the HP movie soundtrack is legendary. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of choices to make or a very in-depth alignment system, you can either choose to be a Harry Potter-like good guy, or a sarcastic prick... and that's about it. I sympathize with the devs on this one point although it's still a criticism of mine: there are too many spells to neatly fit into the active spells list, at least on my xbox gamepad, which means you can only have 16 active spells at a time. I get that controllers are limited by the amount of buttons they have, but they still made some really boneheaded decisions: like why the hell does the animal brush and animal food take up an active spell slot? Did they really have to make the spells that are only used in the room of requirement take up active spell slots? It ruins the momentum of exploration and combat when I'm having to constantly go in to the spell menu to replace spells in my active slots. Outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, the world is barren and boring. There are some small hamlets here and there that have very little to nothing going on, very reminiscent of the small villages you could find in Witcher 3. The NPCs in general are not very immersive or reactive to the kind of decisions you make. Some of them I believe have very basic schedules, i.e. during certain times in the day you can find them doing different things, at night they'll go to sleep. However there's no repercussion to casting spells on them, they don't say or do anything if you walk into their house and take stuff from them either. I mentioned in the pros section that I thought the atmosphere and believability of places like Hogsmeade were fantastic, and they are: but it's really frustrating that I can't interact with any of the villagers! Speaking of interactivity: I REALLY wished they fleshed out the amount of things in the environment that you can cast spells on! Casting depulso on a barrel and watching it hurtle into a wall and splinter into a thousand pieces is so satisfying, let us do that with all the other crap that's laying around!  This isn't a bad game by any means, but it is very generic. If you're a big HP fan perhaps it's worth full price but for the average gamer I would recommend waiting for some steep discounts before purchasing this."

I'm probably a bit biased from nostalgia, but the castle is beautiful and the surrounding world is interesting as well. --While there ARE certain things you can interact with in the overworld, I do wish that you could interact with more. Right now it's mostly just spectacle (which is valid and fun to look at, don't get me wrong), with intermittent little things like a globe you can spin or a cat you can levitate. **You CANNOT use magic on most things in the game.**-I enjoy the characters quite a bit, but I will admit that the facial animation can range from very good to very uncanny at times. That's neither here nor there in my opinion. It's not perfect, but it isn't heinous. -You can't get any sort of mount until pretty late game, and because of this I do wish the player walking and ""running"" speed wasn't so slow for the size of the world. You can get around alright, and thankfully the game's fast travel mechanic ""floo flames"" are there to help, but it can still get a bit tedious since the world is probably a lot bigger than you're thinking it is before you play the game. --Regarding the floo flames: this is a very minor gripe but there's a talking bust at EVERY flame station that has a loud, stupid one liner of some sort every time she sees you, whether in passing or teleporting. I just don't like her, lmao.-THE COMBAT SYSTEM!! I actually really, really enjoy it. It was MUCH faster paced than I thought it would or could be, so props for that. That said, you can die very quickly. Not a complaint, just a warning. -I wish there were more available spells. I'm a little over 10 hours in and at level 13 at the time of writing this, so there is A LOT more of the game left for me to experience and potentially complain about or praise, but for now, I'd give it a solid 8.5/10.***EDIT AND UPDATE!!!***I am now nearly level 19. and the Room of Requirement along with the ability to fly via broom have added at least a half point to my score, putting us at a 9/10. However! this game does not deserve a 9/10. Love it though I do, I would recommend this game to pretty much anyone and just as easily say no, it is definitely not going to be like the best or most well-done game you've ever played. Those games get 9s out of 10s. In any case, I have pretty much the same gripes as before, AND-I wish gear sold for more, and I wish ♥♥♥♥ wasn't so expensive compared to the amount of gear you can even get to sell and then how little it gets you. Curse you, Sky Scythe broom...--Seriously, gear from chests only, and the rarest garbs sell for sub 500 galleons and ONE HEALING POTION IS 100 galleons. To clarify, yes, I know you can make wiggenweld potions yourself, but what I'm trying to say is the cost margin between how much money you can get vs. how much you need is pretty annoying.---Especially!!! since as far as I know by level 19, there is NOTHING else you can sell, and there is no other way to get things you CAN sell aside from finding them in chests out in the world. Then when you do get something you can sell, it goes for like 60-90 galleons. Oh? What's that? The EXACT same robe you just sold is in a shop? selling for like 300 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ galleons? Awesome. -I wont lie, although I am loving this game, the quests are starting to seem a *bit repetitive*. You're not necessarily doing the same stuff over and over again (most of the time ...), but the majority of missions and quests them don't have much life to them. -The graphics are *okay*--Actually, scratch that, they're NOT okay. Sometimes? They're laughably bad. Nothing that effects gameplay, but I'm not going to lower my standards for this game. If anything, I'm expecting more. Let's just say I have better minecraft shaders. So, unless you have a pc that can run the game at high settings, you're gonna be wanting for more in terms of graphics quality. And the faces... most of them look like flesh robots, full disclosure. Again, it's NOT BAD, but it's not good either. --For such a huge franchise, the graphics alone deduct at least a point for me. This ♥♥♥♥ should be blowing my mind, but instead I'm looking at an uncanny robot that gained sentience when I talk to characters. A lot of the movement and the way characters interact with the world and the player's character is one big skyrim npc meme, but like over a decade late. And most npcs will not respond to you at all. ---It is very heart-warming and cool to be able to go around and explore environments I dreamed about as a kid. For the sake of just playing through the game and enjoying the map, the graphics aren't blasphemy. Like, it is only rarely that I see something so bad it messes with my focus. Yet, it is only slightly more common that I see something so GOOD I stop and say wow, this is awesome. If you can't run this game at high graphics settings, your wizarding world will still be lovable, but very silly looking at times.-Unfortunate update about the stupid one liners though: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the elf in the Room of Requirement. I am going to go completely feral if I hear ""DEEK THINKS YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ALL THE POTIONS YOUVE MADE"" one more time.--So, I've not just got floo flames lady saying the same 3 lines whenever she sees me. I've got like 5 other characters. If I get any more saying the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ every 10 idle seconds, I'm going to fast track the skill tree to Avada Kedavra and make my own light show out of them.--Most of the npc conversations you can overhear are quite nice though. I speak harshly because I have high standards. I want to strangle Deek the house elf. Spend 30 min in the room of requirement and you too will wish to commit murder. -On a positive note, I just went to beasts class and met a hippogriff. I hope she will be my best friend forever. -Lastly (for now) the voice actor for the groundskeeper? Amazing. Gladwin Moon is easily the most enjoyable voice in the game so far. tl:dr Many hours later, and I still love it. It has decreased in score to probably around 7.5-8/10. Not because it got worse or I like it any less, but because of some issues that I'm not really willing to let slide for a title like this. Cheers, -C"

You open thousands of chests you find money or items that you sell to get money again and you can't do anything with the money, pointless system. You break into houses where people are inside and rob them without consequences. No Quidditch in a Harry Potter based game, even though it's set years before, developers were apparently too lazy to apply that. You're not a fifth grader, you're a child prodigy who can come to class whenever you want for short private lessons to learn a spell in seconds. The side quests are lame, unemotional and uninteresting. You get your owl mail like an answering machine. The game is also way too easy, you have your own room to grow crops and then brew potions that you never use because you are already too strong. You're in a room of 10 enemies, each specific enemy only ever makes one programmed attack, always the same attack, wow! You cast more than 15 spells alone.

1286,| нsт | Victorino Mora,https://steamcommunity.com/id/blazebby/,3,,1,20.4,February,11,705,0,1,"Truly this is a MUST OWN and a competitor for Game of The Year. Without the need of going into depth I'll simply say this game is an easy 8/10.  Gameplay/Combat: Easily the biggest praise I have to give to any current game that's been released in the past 6 months. This game is enjoyable. Combat is fluent, spells are explosive and magical, and enemies actually offer a challenge. The gameplay consists of exploring the entirety of Hogwarts and locations around, shopping for pieces of armor, exploring dungeons, side quests for classmates and teachers, customizing you're own room, and flying across the map on your very own broomstick or Hippogriff. Every moment spent felt like I was truly doing something and being rewarded for it.Story: Without getting into any spoilers, the story is an original tale of a 5th year student who enrolls into Hogwarts and is the chosen one. The characters, scenery, and location all feel like they belong within another. Nothing ever felt out of place or forced. Characters are nicely written and voiced, each with their own stories. One thing I really loved about certain characters is each one would tell you a little bit of themselves and leave you wanting more. They never forced their entire story or agenda on you, it was always a desire to learn why this person hinted at said thing.Soundtrack: The music is great. It's got a tone of curiosity when exploring, the combat always sounds upbeat and explosive, the Harry Potter tune always plays when you discover something new. Really enjoyed listening to it and the music always plays at an appropriate time.Exploration: The game is huge, far bigger than I expected. You're allowed to explore the entire school with some rooms locked that add a great service for me returning to said location. The outside (HogsMeat) a little town, Forbidden Forest, and a few new locations. The game offers a fair amount of puzzles outside of the school, within the school, and dungeons that allow you to engage in combat all that feel rewarding with a set piece of armor or lore to unknown locations.That's all I've got to say positive, and now I'm going to Nitpick and critique a handful of things that I didn't enjoy from the game. SideQuests: While this isn't a terrible thing, there isn't much in terms of ""enjoyment"" that I got from them. Most are you're basic run of the mill ""Had to place, kill certain amount, go get item, talk to person"" I just wish they felt more satisfying to do or lead to something greater. Vendors: The vendors feel lacking, most of the time they are selling 5-6 items at hand, and buying clothing is extremely painful. Nothing is sorted, it's a big clunk of items. Also there's a weird bug or choice when buying clothing, when you choose to inspect item they decided to move the camera into your're characters eye socket for some reason as a view.Companions: You are not given any pets outside of a certain location. You are not allowed to explore with a friend outside of certain missions. I think this game would have really benefited with the choice to make friends and grow with people. Instead you are all on you're own with the exceptions of certain missions.Appearance: This isn't so much of a negative with choices given, it's a mechanical issue that bothers me. Say you dress specifically in you're school robes. Get a new piece of outfit, BOOM instantly you change into that outfit. So imagine running a dungeon, get some nice goggles, hat, cape, you're character now looks like a knock off Marvel character. It's nice that you are able to change pieces into any other clothing you already obtained, but doing it every single time is annoying. Lack of RP elements/Missing Content. This is a nitpick, and it just bothers me that so many RP elements are missing from this game. You can't sit down, you don't have a Moral standing, you aren't really required to attend class aside from missions, and you'd think the school would be a bit more strict with you heading into the forbidden forest. The point system doesn't even take effect into anything. There are no mini games, there is no Quidditch. Truly feels like a lot of content never made it and I hope it does eventually.Can't harass kids: Ye that's really it, I want to deathspell kids and ♥♥♥♥. Overall this is a great game and a MUST BUY. I highly recommend and if I have to give it numbers 7/10 Combat 8/10 Story."

AND also the for mentioned game breaking progression stopping bug. for a heavy story driven game where dialogue is constant, it may be a few small bugs, but very noticeable and needs fixing.FLIGHT- its bloody awful, so bad in fact, that Avalanche software didn't include Quidditch in the game since the flight controls are that complicated and that bad, who ever designed this should be banned from the game industry for life. they have no business in game design. its really THAT bad ! remember GTA5, yeah THAT BAD !PROGRESSION DESIGN- there's a point early on in the game before you unlock all the fast travel points where you run around doing a fair amount of exploring and side questing, and you pass a LOT of locked doors, but don't have the ability to unlock them till much later in the storey line, having to go back to areas to scout around and unlock doors in sections of, well everywhere you've already been, seems a bit counter productive, i think this spell should have been unlocked a LOT earlier in the storey progression. its a really bad over sight in the design.NO NG+- in this day and age, for a game to be created with different difficulties (EASY-HARD) without new game plus, i think is a BIG mistake. personally i like to start a game on the easy settings, enjoying the story and mastering the mechanics and when finished, use a NG+ option to re-play through on a harder setting, to progress to the hardest difficulty settings, so for a game to not include this is a bit of a downer for me.RESPEC- there is no way to respec your character and with limited talent points to spend its hard to explore spells, abilities and builds for how you want to play, once you've selected a talent there's no going back even if that particular talent doesn't work out for a build you might like to try, a massive over sight. this needs fixing soon.even though the game has some major peevs and a few over sights AND a few things that could have been added ( like a personal conjured training dummy for the room of requirement ) and Quidditch. until the game gets a few major fixes i CAN'T recommend buying this game at it current price, these things aside i still enjoyed the game, it has SOLID story with a balanced grind/reward ratio backed up with good graphics, it also includes puzzles that i thought the mechanics of a lot of them could have been explained in a class , since it is a school, but left to figure a lot of stuff out which feels a bit clunky, the combat is smooth and flowing with an engaging combo system. it also has some crafting (personal furniture and work benches) and a simple but good gear upgrade system. I hope to see this game grow into its potential. but firstly Avalanche Software and WB Games your your game needs a few fix's and your flight mechanic needs a mouse flight option or a complete re-design its just really REALLY that bad ! if i could make a suggestion, i think the mechanic you are looking for here is the flight mechanic from Marvel Avengers IornMan character, i think it would work really well here."

These two points were the most disappointing. However, it is the best recreation of the Wizarding World in a video game yet, with a good variety of puzzles, though in some cases there are too many of the same puzzle. The game also offers a good level of customization and a great combat system (which was my biggest concern before playing it). The game was released with some bugs, but they were not game-breaking for me. In conclusion, it is a fun game to play. If you're a Wizarding World fan, this game is a must-have. Otherwise, it would be better to think a bit before buying it."

I don't mind much about slow rendering or graphical bugs (the last never happened to me yet), but whenever a slow rendering happened, it didn't bothered me and was not game breaking. This story has been interesting so far. Not saying it's incredible or something, but they went towards something interesting that I wasn't expecting and they are doing a good job keeping it entertaining. I love the whole open world concept, the crafting system as well, even though it's rather simple. The battle system is rather nice too, even the stealth parts of it. Idk, it is a really cozy game, and I deeply love it. I hope y'all feel the same <3"

1298,Trevor Fox,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Trevor_Fox/,2,,1,95.0,February,27,822,0,1,"Sitting at 72 hours in this game--it has been fantastic. When I started, I was blown away by how much is in the game. I said it was my favorite open-world game next to Breath of the Wild (which still holds the torch). Does that still ring true? Yes, but with some caveats. There are some performance issues with this game, but I will be covering the gameplay aspect of the game here.So, how does it fare? Well, I was really worried at first because the story opens up with your character giving you the answer to every single puzzle without allowing you a moment to think for yourself. Then we're shown pointless dialogue trees, a disappointing sorting, and WAY too much HUD information. Every enemy has a healthbar and a level, and we have our health bar and magic meters, and look! Waypoint markers and a path marked on your mini-map! Objective markers hover obnoxiously over NPCs that you need to talk, too, and the worst offender of all, enemies scale with you throughout the game making upgrades effectively limited or worthless.So, this open-world is really just taking a page out of the more generic ones out there. Repeating tombs and secret areas that don't really unlock upgrades but just give you unidentified gear as a reward which might slightly up your stats. It's novel at first but wears thin when you realize that it's all the same and loses its appeal quite quickly.With all of this negative stuff in here, why am I giving it a positive review? Well, for a few reasons really! Because this game is actually REMARKABLY fun!First, this game is banking on the player being a Harry Potter fan. If you're in love with the wizarding world, then getting to run around Hogwarts and the environment is an absolute treat! I can't tell you how giddy it makes me to see the paintings moving, ghosts sword fighting and floating through the castle, Peeves up to his shenanigans, suits of armor moving out of the corner of your vision or interacting with each other. Oh my god, it is SUCH a treat. And the intricacy of Hogwarts itself is SO fun! It can be almost overwhelming at first, but things fit together in such an intricate and nice way, it feels like I really am exploring a magical castle with tons of secrets within its walls! Although I wish they could have made the Grand Staircase more faithful to the books and movies, everything else feels like its selected the best of both worlds. Certain aspects of the castle are more faithful to the movies while others pull a page or two from the books, and it's wonderful to seeSecond. Accessibility options. Normally, this is a source of contention for me because I usually see accessibility impede the vision of the creator and game rather than support it. But the options they have here (while there is room for improvement--where the hell is my one-stick broom control?) do give you a range of customization. And the first thing I did? I turned off the ENTIRE HUD. I kept things up long enough to learn how they work, but I was able to turn off:-The minimap-My healthbar-Enemy health bar/level-Wand SpellsI did that all while keeping the display for items that I pick up and EXP notifications. The problem I have with this game is the problem I have with other Action RPG games. They're not RPG games. They are on the surface level, but they're really more Action/Adventure games. RPGs have a very certain feel to them, and I'm not a fan of western RPGs with scaling enemies. It loses that sense of working hard to get stronger which is ESSENTIAL to an RPG experience. All of the combat has to lead to something and make you stronger. And enemies that scale with you take away from that experience.However, as an Action/Adventure title, this system is PERFECT. And you can achieve that feel by removing the levels and health from enemies. You'll get talents that unlock different effects for spells, learn more spells, get better combos, be able to mix and match combos as you want, and that sort of system works SO MUCH BETTER when you remove the arbitrary health values and levels that enemies have. It puts the focus on you, your wits, your spells, and your positioning rather than on whittling down a red bar until it disappears. I understand that this isn't for everyone, nor do these mechanics bother everyone, but scaling enemies is something I take issue with because of how repetitive it makes games feel, and I'm glad there was an option to turn these elements off.To go along with that, most games that give you those sort of options are unplayable without them. Sure, Witcher 3 might SAY that you can remove the minimap, but the core gameplay relies on it, so if you don't want to pull up your map every two seconds and ruin the flow, then you need to have it on. I would say that this game does a really good job at being the best of both worlds. You can disable these HUD elements, but still have the game be playable. Oh, don't have your mini-map and are lost? Not to worry! We have a pathfinder similar to Dead Space that you can activate and follow to your objective without too much clutter on the screen. It really is wonderful.Third. The combos. Oh my god, the combos. The game gives you a rundown very quickly of it's combat. Attack and shield. Attack and shield. Ohp. Super attack. But this is quickly added onto with spells that you learn in class. You start to learn various spells that you can put into your combos. Hit the enemy, levitate them, hit the enemy, pull them toward you, set them on fire, push them away, hit the enemy, thrown an object. Want to sneak up on that enemy? Do it. Wanna throw that guy off a cliff? Have fun! Oh, man. There's some guys below me but I don't really feel like fighting a lot of them. I'm pretty high up though. I'll just pull them to me and let them fall to their death. I have had SO much fun with the combat in this game. Elements of it remind me of Batman: Arkham Asylum. It's not exactly the same, but you have combos that you do while watching for dodge and counter symbols that flash around your character's head (rather than the enemy's). I willingly look for fights because of how much fun I have playing the game.Fourth. The stuff I wasn't expecting. The extra stuff can wear thin, but I was just expecting a game where I ran around a castle and shot some wizards now and then. The fact that I was provided more than that has been thrilling, and quite an enjoyable experience.And that's my review for the game. There's some faults with it, some things get old, and at the end of the day, the world and exploration is like a lot of other open-world games out there. But the gameplay, accessibility features, and the fact that I'm in the wizarding world have made the experience one that has put a smile on my face the whole way through."

She was not involved in the development of this game whatsoever and she earns money from the franchise as a whole anyway. If you have issues that big, then just shut your damn mouth and walk away from the fanbase. As for the game itself, it is absolutely amazing. The writing is brilliant, all the characters feel real (including your own very customisable character), and there is loads to do. There are about just over 30 hours of gameplay if you rush through the story, but there are hours more in the open world with varying quests with varying rewards as well as three main side quests that I would recommend completing before you finish the main story. Even after completing the story, you can still explore and complete many quests you may have missed. You can participate in battle arena challenges, wipe out bandit, troll, and spider dens, and delve into dungeons in search of whatever might be there. You can ride hippogriffs, grow plants, brew potions, practice spells, and grow your own vivarium of fantastic beasts.Easily one of the best games I have ever played and definitely worth the full price I paid for the deluxe edition pre-order."

1317,Frituurkoning,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FrituurKoning/,2,,1,56.6,February,15,287,0,1,"This game and most of the aspects of it can be summarised as:Voice acting 8/10Amount of voice lines 2/10This game has many small details just perfectly right, but is just lacking in certain areas.:- Hogwarts is just the world setting, you're not actually doing anything student-like, attending classes are just one-off introduction cutscenes for the teachers who after that have no importance other than giving you some quests to learn spells.- A lot of side quests are ""I need something from this place that is too dangerous for 5 adults, please go there by yourself 5th year student""- No morality system, me: ""avada kedavra"", teacher: ""hmm, please don't do that"", actual consequences: 0- There are 1 or 2 named students who are forgetable at best, but the others might as well have been nameless npc's- There's only 6 potions and none of them are real game changers- You get the room of requirement with a house-elf, this guy is always there, has 1 voice line, and he repeats that line every 15 seconds that your near him.- This game has some kinda puzzles/challenges called ""Merlin Trials"", there are 95 of these, however your character has 2 lines for when you find one, and 3 lines for when you complete at trial.- The same goes for other things as well, most noticeable: clothing and enemies. Everything has a lot of details, looks really great, however they then give you the exact same thing 10 times in a slightly different color, and they then list it all as separate entries in the collection menu, especially for clothing they are like ""this one has 2 thin stripes on the sleeves instead of one so it's a complete new item"". (This would have been fine if there were more options) :- Using the voice pitch slider in char creation: you are now a robot, (it's bad enough that it would have been better to have not included this slider)- Allowing us to build (blurry) mirrors in the room of requirements, but the room's walls being invisible in reflections- Random FPS drops, rtx 3080 dlss quality mode, ultra settings, average: 85 fps, walking through a simple hallway: 13 fps, walking the same hallway 2 days later: 70 fps (the game only actually crashed once after 38 hours of total playtime)- Consistent FPS drops: certain cutscenes give you a whole full 8 frames per second, no matter what you do.:- This is probably one of the best looking games I have ever played- Amazing world building <- this especially- Combat is fun (when you unlock more spells to do combinations with, too repetitive at start)- Exploration, there are many challenges and puzzles which is just great combined with how the world looks. There are many puzzles/challenges and collectibles, but I really wish these challenges would become more difficult than they are now.- Altho I want more items and better placing mechanics, the room of requirement is fun to furnish the way you want it with stuff that you buy, get as rewards, or find in chests.- Broom flying is fun- Has transmog feature, I enjoy the game enough to have put 40 hours into it, and will probably play it a lot more before I'm done with it anytime soon, but .And .Many RPG features are partially there, but just lacking in some way or form for what I expect for a 60 euro game.Suggestion for people already playing the game: turn off the minimap and enjoy the game's world."
1318,K!netic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/,2,,1,24.4,February,14,554,0,1,"It's easily the best potterverse game ever made. But it strangely gets less enjoyable the more you play, thanks to the repeated content, boring dialogue/main quest, useless loot/rewards, and everything else you've come to expect from a modern AAA open world game. Worth playing, there's something for everyone, but it's got no depth.First off, the formula here for both combat and learning spells is excellent. Four sets of four-slot spellbars that you can customize as desired, with plenty of extra spells to experiment with. Learning spells is mostly a non-linear series of sidequests, completed by ""attending class"" or ""seeing the prof after class"" for a mercifully brief skippable montage before you do the usual gesture minigame to learn the spell. When there's something to interact with in the world, your intuition on which spells (often plural) to use is probably correct. It feels cohesive, and every spell has uses.But the game is also unfortunately very much a product of its time. I'm not just referring to the whole trans nonsense, though that does rear its head in some cringey ways in the game itself -- but mostly in that so much of what you're doing feels like . It's not so bad as an Ubisoft game, but once you realize that every kind of puzzle is both braindead simple and repeated at least 15 times, the magic wears off fast. The whole allure of this world is mystery and discovery, and when you just slap the answer to a puzzle you repeated over a dozen times in the game on a chalkboard somewhere, it's just not a mystery anymore.This setting is popular because of a sense of endless possibility, mystery, and discovery. The game could benefit from giving more (and more interesting) opportunities for self-directed exploration, mysteries that aren't explained to you through some student-you-dont-care-about giving you a gimmie so that you know how the rest of them work. It ought to give you interesting problems (not puzzles) that you have to use and combine spells to figure out. And the rewards could be more than just collection book pages and useless levelled gear.It's maybe not fair for me to criticize like this, because I just want a fundamentally different product than the target audience of AAA open world games. But all of this to say, if you wanted something like an ""immersive sim"" in the potterverse, this isn't really it. It's worth trying, it's a lot closer than anything else; but it's not it."

I was wondering why cutscenes ran like crap on High on my beast of a machine. Now I know. ♥♥♥♥ Denuvo. I'm not into Harry Potter at all, and know very little about it. I saw a couple of the movies like 20 years ago and I read one of the books. Comes off like very English ""magical"" whimsy. I got it because hey, I'm not into Spider Man either and I 100% it on the PS4 because it was that fun. I  had heard about how beautiful this game was, and I'm not seeing it. My machine can handle it on High. Should be able to handle it on Ultra. But frankly, it doesnt look that good even on High, everyones got kind of a wax doll look to them.Its still a fun AAA. And it *is* a typical AAA so expect all the handholding. Ive been playing From Software games lately, so going back I was surprised how easy it is and how everythings perfectly laid out for you and leads you by the nose. But I think thats just games in general nowadays. Still, its cute and fun. Everything is named stuff like Grindleblat and Snorkenplort or weird terms that sound *very* English to a North American. Playing this I can totally see why people got so into the world. Man, if I was 10 years younger I probably would have been into it too when it came out. Its worth a look even if youre not into Harry Potter. If you're OK with Denuvo that is. I'm not. Makes me want to sing yo ho ho and a bottle of rum when publishers put that crap on their games. And I am way not down with piracy. But Im also not down with publishers hamstringing their games for legitimate customers."

1327,[EXDr] Xar,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DFFXOW/,2,,1,57.8,February,13,276,0,1,"After playing the game for over 50 hours, completing the story, and achievement hunting for the majority of the game, I can happily say this game has been brilliant. It is truly a breath of fresh air, considering the amount of s**t we have received over the last few years, to see a game like this is truly relieving and has restored some of my faith on what games development companies can still achieve. The launch was very smooth and I have not really encountered many bugs within the game. I really enjoy the gameplay, but there are a few things that do irritate me. I understand that unlocking the broom riding is the first thing we SHOULD do, but it is the best way to travel around the open world, I feel like once you have the broom riding unlocked, I never even touched the mounts, ESPECIALLY the ground mount for that one story mission. Once you are fully geared up at the end, and upgrade everything to the max it really makes the game WAY too easy. The combat became more boring due to how easy it is, and this is playing on the hardest difficulty. The lockpicking ends up become more of a tedious task than anything, though I understand it being there to add another difficulty element to the game, forcing you to collect for the turn in quest which is fine, as I was planning on collecting most things anyways. The room of requirement is amazing, I had a ton of fun customising my little areas and designing it to how I liked it, the game all in all has been absolutely amazing so far, and I am excited to start my new character and join a new house for another adventure. Oh for those who like to collect things, especially transmog clothes, there is an amazing robe if you do the I hope everyone else has as much fun as me, and gets to enjoy living out their childhood fantasy! <3"
1328,Spicy Giblets,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042497186/,2,,1,119.3,February,13,949,0,1,"It's impossible to discuss this game without first acknowledging the discourse that surrounds it. If you are unaware the game has been boycotted and almost rightfully so because of the bigoted statements from the original author of the Harry Potter books J K Rowling. Rowling has effectively permanently tarnished the reputation of the franchise and has destroyed what may have been a safe space for trans people to escape the harassment and prejudices they can face on a daily basis. This silly wizard world is now a hot bed for political discussion and is also a breeding ground for far right rhetoric and hate speech. So when this game was announced many people have taken a stand to not play or support it and I 100% stand by those that make this decision, however I also stand by the people who just want to play a silly wizard game and the devs are clearly aware of the discourse and have tried their best to make the game inclusive with the option to make trans characters and also the inclusion of a trans character that is handled very well. So in short J K Rowling is a bigot but she is one part of what makes this game what it is and I feel if you can separate the art from the artist you'll find one of the most wonderfully crafted open worlds you can play.*****PC exclusive issues******Performance isn't ideal to say the least. Another example of a console port ♥♥♥♥ out onto steam. Massive shame because the game is fantastic. Please be aware of this before making a purchase.**************************Now to actually talk about the game, it's incredible and not only an outstanding achievement for avalanche software but quite possibly one of the best open world games out there. ProsHogwarts is one of the most complex buildings I've ever seen in a game. Filled with secrets, lively npcs and fantastic level desgin, it truly feels alive and should be an example going forward on how you make a game world feel alive.The Harry Potter universe is so excellently captured and has clearly come from a dev who understands the lore and world. This maybe the best representation of an existing IP translated into a computer game, the immersion and attention to detail is unrivaled and this could sit next to games like witcher 3 and RDR 2 with the amount of detail this world has.Combat is surprisingly amazing. It was one aspect I wasn't sure on before I played it but it is so varied and fun to pull off combos and with a good range of spells you can get quite creativeThe story is really good, it's better to have an understanding of the lore but I found it to be very enjoyable with lots of really likeable characters Graphics are nice and landscapes look breathtaking The OST is rock solidThe game has so many systems and surprises and it spaces them out without overwhelming you, I won't dive into details because the less you know the better but this game is jammed with content without it being too repetitive Cons As mentioned PC performance is not good, hopefully some patches fix thatWhilst the game is stuffed with content I do wish we had more. More beasts, mounts, gear, customisation options. What we have is good, really good in fact but it could be better.There is no morality system or romance options, no romance is fine but the game makes it seem like certain choices could have a major impact on the story or the way npcs treat you, unfortunately it doesn't effect anything if you use some of the more questionable spells. Conclusion This is a fantastic game that can be enjoyed by fans and non-fans alike. It's one of those rare games that can help people who don't often play games get into the hobby. It also gave me the same feelings I had when I first started playing breath of the wild and Elden Ring. If you choose to play this despite the original source material coming from a bigot you'll be in for a fantastic treat."
1329,InuAres,https://steamcommunity.com/id/InuAres/,2,,1,19.0,February,12,529,0,1,"Wait for a sale. Not because the game's bad, but because the PC police have very short memories and by the time this goes on sale, they'll have a new thing to be mad about. The game has a few framerate drops in certain areas, but aside from that, the game seems fine enough. Hogwarts is big and mazelike and the game rewards you for exploring it. Don't look up guides for the puzzles, they're actually really easy once you pay closer attention. If you're having a tough time, you're missing the forest for the trees. think small. You don't usually have to go very far to solve a puzzle."
1330,Cleadus Jones,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bronzestar250/,2,,1,30.9,February,12,368,0,1,"Never been a ""Potter"" fan. This game is highly addicting, very interesting and outstandingly immersive. Fluid, smooth and fun. The attention to detail is extremely high in many aspects. The only thing that would make it more immersive is more function as far as sitting in chairs etc. Walking in to the dining hall and standing there while your classmates are sitting chatting and eating away was a bit awkward. Being able to sit in various locations and watch the world around you would be a huge plus.Other than that, it is rare to see an over hyped game live up to the hype. especially at launch. Hogwarts Legacy has lived up to that hype.  #BringOnTheDLC. Bravo."

1334,Giblix,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036646095/,3,,1,91.0,February,11,"1,100",0,1,"As someone who enjoyed the many books and several movies taking place in the Wizarding World I was looking forward to this game. At around 25 hours of play it is very enjoyable. However it comes with some caveats.The first one is that I am more of an action based gamer. Gameplay is very important to me and supersedes story. That said the spellcasting is very enjoyable and the combat sequences feel good. Just make sure to delve into the options menu to fine tune elements in order to get the most out of it. Especially if you're playing on harder difficulties. It also seems that harder difficulties make enemies fight more intelligently, more aggressively etc instead of just being more hp/more damage.Through the use of Talents and Traits on gear you can create some fun gameplay. On top of that it shows potential for even more later on in the game depending on how enemy types evolve. One of my setups aims to single target nukes and disarming opponents while another setup changes into more of a juggling combo playstyle.The big caveat from that perspective is the pacing in this game. It is a very chill and slow game where you get to do a lot of exploration and puzzle solving. Combat sequences are far spread out as a result, even if you purely push the story forward. This all takes place in an immersive world. Unfortunately the puzzles are super easy, insultingly so a lot of the times. Exploring of Hogwarts alone can take you a dozen or two hours. Especially since a metroidvania aspect is involved where you need to get spells in order to backtrack and access places you couldn't before. Something I personally enjoy. Once you step foot outside of Hogwarts a large valley, densely packed with content, awaits you for even more exploration.I'm not a fan of Open World games. Very much the opposite. In Hogwarts there are many collectibles, challenges, dungeons, caves, beast dens, bandit camps, forts and many more. In this game it feels quite a lot more organic and less of open worlditis filler junk.To appeal to fans of the Wizarding World there are a lot of things present in the game. Unfortunately no Quidditch, Gobstones, collecting wizarding cards... Instead you can do a lot in the Room of Requirement, catch animals ala Mysterious Magical Beasts etc. My issue with this is more that it means you will receive a lot of tutorial-esque content till deep into the game. While some of these elements themselves aren't super fleshed out and seem to be there more as fan service. Which is fine in regards to shops, but less so to actual game mechanics.Since story isn't the main reason I play games, I read books for a real proper story, it does seem that Hogwarts is delivering a typical wizarding story. Instead of delving into the SLytherin Heir or the Dumbledore Bloodline we're now going to explore the much mentioned Ancient Magic. It is told in a way that feels very familiar to already existing media regarding the Wizarding World making it a nice addition to expand the world building.It isn't a super pretty game in regards to the latest graphical quality out there. I can see how viewers find some of the colors washed out or blend. Yet when playing it all fits thematically and doesn't detract at all.I did experience stuttering and some performance issues. However that was when streaming the game at the same time. If I play it without anything else going on then my I9 9900, RTX2080 Super and 16gb DDr4 on an NVME drive runs really well at High Settings.As for the whole controversy...not even worth listing it as a footnote. Little brains, Little Problems."

This is easily Game of the Year material and looks/feels amazing.  Finally we've got a AAA game that properly encompasses the books/movies and lets you play your own character within this setting.Not only that, but this game is great for people who are brand new to Harry Potter/The Wizarding World as well.  While there are obviously references and things fans of the books/movies/etc will notice and love, this game is such a great standalone title in the universe.  Game almost feels akin to the Fable games in some ways.  There's a lot to explore, fun puzzles, engaging combat, and a lot to play with here. The only way this could be made better is if you could play with friends and go on adventures together.  Also Quidditch missing (for now?) sucks, but hopefully it gets added in a DLC.  Beyond that though, this is easily the best experience to date for Harry Potter fans."

I need to experience more of the game and gameplay itself (I'll update my review accordingly); But honestly I'd give this game a positive review if this were just a Hogwarts walk and explore simulator without anything to do. This game is a loveletter to every wizarding world fan and outside of that just damn fun. Worth every cent."
1344,Raspbear,https://steamcommunity.com/id/raspbear/,2,,1,20.6,February,11,"1,445",0,1,actually i expected the game to be a big flop but i'm so glad it lived up to the expectations. i've rarely seen such a beautiful game world with so much attention to detail. the game is definitely worth it. on sale even a must-have.i love that the developers dared to take the wizarding world much further than JKR ever could. adding a trans character to the story and giving the goblins much deeper stories and traits instead of sticking to the anti-semitic stereotypes JKR limited herself to is a good and important step in the right direction. it's a statement from the developers that they clearly distance themselves from JKR's views and separate the work from the author.

1350,Rubat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Robotboy655/,2,,1,76.8,February,11,643,0,1,"First of all, I'd like to extend a big f u c k you to Warner Bros. and the developers for including anti-consumer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this game, such as Twitch Drops, Accounts, Privacy Policy, Exclusive Content for PlayStation and Pre-Order bonuses. (Micro transactions are listed on Steam store page, but I could not find them in-game so far)With that out of the way, I still cannot imagine how the developers managed to convince whoever they had to, to allow this game to be made, and how this development studio I have never heard of before managed to make this game this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good.If you like the world of Harry Potter (and not necessarily its characters because they are all brand new here) and action adventure games, this is a must play (maybe not must buy for reasons above). Like don't even bother reading further.I think just the ability to explore Hogwarts and its surroundings alone is worth the price of admission for me. But then you realize just how much content is in this game. I was running around with a big grin on my face in the first 6 hours exploring this world.Lots of spells, you can craft potions, grow plants, fly SEAMLESSLY around the entire map on a broom or animals. Just so many things from the HP world are implemented here in such a logical way, you name it - the game has it.Exploration also has many different and fairly unique things to do. Puzzles, camps to clear, collectibles, all present.Combat is also decently fun. Visually and sound design is very good during combat., but you do have a LOT of buttons to press to be effective, especially during boss fights and on hard difficulty.That's really another thing - there are SO MANY keybinds in this game, it's kind of overwhelming.The game also pays a lot of attention to the lore and its details, which you can see from the very first cutscenes. The spells all feel authentic.Music is very good as well.The game is not without its issues, of course. Here are some that I encountered:* No Quidditch* Facial animations are quite bad at times, specifically eyes sometimes looking in different directions, and mount movements transitioning strangely.* For some reason the game really forces you to fast travel in early quests. That's a really strange decision given half of the game is exploring hogwarts* Targeting in this game is GOD AWFUL. Just utterly unusable in tight spaces with many enemies present. The system will target any other character except the one you are directly looking it. It is just might boggling how bad it is. Not only that, in order to change locked target, you have to use arrow keys, and they are the only 2 keybinds you cannot rebind. There's one fight in early game where you are fighting 4 shielded enemies at once in a small room and I really lost my mind trying to beat them on Hard difficult.* Some exploration related spells are locked quite far into the main story line, namely the lockpicking spell. This really hindered by ability to explore much given how many locked doors are everywhere.* Inventory space is quite limited, and for no good reason besides having to upgrade it. But once you realize the transmog system in this game is good, it becomes less of a problem.* Menu animations are very slow and therefore frustrating. I don't understand why so many studio make this simple mistake, it's like they just LOVE wasting theirs and the players time.* Can't look up down while on a broomGraphically the game looks fantastic, but also not without issues:* Raytracing support is lackluster. Reflections are extremely blurry. Toggling RT requires game restart.* It am not sure if its specifically RT, but I have experienced a lot of lighting pop in with it enabled.* Some cutscenes have strange color correction, where one scene is darker, then it is brighter, then darker again, etc.* Severe framerate drops in many areas when the game was installed on HDD, or with RT enabled.* Cannot disable Anti Aliasing at all, making the game quite blurry without DLSS + manual sharpening setting, latter of which doesn't seem to even save across restarts* Ambient Occlusion is quite bad in the sense that it creates ""halos"" around characters in places, and you can't disable it."

Love every second of this game."
1360,Ted,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198203292090/,4,,1,167.7,February,27,404,0,1,"Great game! There are a lot of reviews and nobody reads these so to the point as someone who was not a Harry Potter fan, I mostly bought this out of spite as I am sure many people did. Though I was looking for an RPG to sink some hours into and relax with a mindless grind and this game did that almost perfectly. These guys really did an amazing job of creating a beautiful and immersive world with some unique characters, though also some absurd woke diversity stuff that really doesn't fit the setting but it isn't enough to ruin the game. While the game looks stunning and the rendition of Hogwarts is really worth mentioning, there are performance issues as no doubt most people know by now. But if you have a decent CPU and GPU you should still have a great if occasionally stuttery experience. Overall this game far exceeded my expectations, it is the first game I ever bothered to complete to 100% and I can honestly say I enjoyed the vast majority of it. I am well and truly done at this point but I feel I really got my money worth and would recommend this game to anyone who likes this genre"

1366,Wiegraf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lennac/,3,1,0,18.1,March,12,273,0,1,"The world looks great and the early parts of the game give you the best experience in the world of Harry Potter that's been made so far. However, it gets so incredibly repetitive and boring. Quests start to feel like a tedious chore and the only motivation is to complete the story... but the story isn't all that engaging and the characters aren't all that interesting, so the initial enjoyment and excitement begins to quickly fade.I'm going to settle on not recommending the game, but it's very much in the ""meh"" territory."
1367,W1CKED ST1TCHES,https://steamcommunity.com/id/515034/,2,,1,50.1,February,20,152,1,1,"The Boycott is what inspired me to buy the game in the first place. I must say this is one of the best decisions of my life. Game is beautiful visually, aesthetically  graphically. Combat is alot of fun I was expecting it to be boring ngl, I was wrong. Character creation is p cool, exploring feels rewarding, dialog, facial animations, etc. all wonderfully done. Don't listen to the transformers. You'll miss out on a BEAUTIFUL masterpiece such as this."
1368,SolitaryAngel,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198083880494/,2,,1,117.6,February,14,858,0,1,"Am just getting going. Still playing around with the controls, not a fan of WASD so still looking for my comfort zone but that aside, My GTX1080 and I7 (32 RAM) is getting me 55-60 fps on average with just a drop to 34 at the sorting hat ceremony cutscene so I am happy with that at 1440p resolution. What happens in combat later may be an issue but combat in the intro didn't seem to be a problem. Character creator was fine, a little samey but fine and I am comfortable with the character I made. No real stuff yet, a few clothing items but I am walking around the castle itself and it is huge. If you love exploration then you will adore this game.Five hours in, done my first two classes in the school and already I find the npcs a delight. From eccentric teachers to the dour administrator Headmaster to the Charms professor who is almost dancing as he walks. Other students all have their own way of speaking, from flaky girls who just love plants to a slitherin boy who is charming and friendly to a girl posed with a problem involving strange paintings who pouts and sulks when you solve the puzzle before her. It all feels very relatable and genuine.I am enjoying myself and I have barely scratched the surface but finally, a AAA game that arrives complete, is playable, is huge fun. Who cares about all the nonsense of the snowflakes trying to eat one of their own who had nothing to do with making this game anyway. The game is good, that's all you need to be concerned about, keep political nonsense out of video games, it does not belong there."

I refuse to be told what i should or shouldn't do by someone that doesn't care about me, My family, friends or their health, enjoyment, and happiness at all.****Review Of Hogwarts Legacy Follows****Hogwarts Legacy is a game many have been waiting for, a chance to live the life of a Wizard or Witch In the Hogwarts school. This game captures that feeling at it's core and has provided me with HOURS and HOURS of fun all ready. Building relationships with fellow classmates and exploring the unbelievable world that is Hogwarts Legacy. I find myself laughing and brought to tears in the pure joy that this game installs in me. Why would i not allow myself this pleasure? Politics have no place in games and this game lets me escape into the magical mystifying World of Harry Potter. The game looks beautiful and is just stunning. Yes it's not as pretty as say Red Dead Redemption 2 but it is going for a more cinematic/movie/fantasy experience in it's look and feel. The quest and story are a joy to follow and drive you on looking for that next fix.It's not all a bed of roses though as performance issues have hurt some players but i am not one of them. I am running a i5 12600K 32GB DDR 5 and a GTX 1080 Ti so not the most powerful machine but i am locked at 60 FPS ( my refresh rate ) EVERYWHERE! I never drop below this FPS point and i only have like 4 of the 30 or so Graphics settings lower than Ultra and only one of those is lower than high at medium. I have in fact seen this game use OVER 16GB of ram so maybe the days of ""16GB of ram is more than enough for gaming"" is over. My User rating  9.5/10ProsIt Hogwarts!Game play is engaging and funVisually stunning engaging story and character creation AND development.Best game i have played in a very long time.Easily Game of the year qualityConsNot enough inv space ( lol ) Some people suffer from unplayable lag and frame rates.The drama surrounding this game is a MAJOR con.no quidditchPossible Memory leak?

1379,Gamewarden,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067088597/,2,,1,29.7,February,11,236,0,1,"7/10 A good game. The game has some performance issues.  Most being massive random frame drops here and there.  But I have experienced no Game breaking bugs, glitches, crashes, or freezes.  With how many major games release with countless bugs this is a welcome change.  However, like every game Hogwarts Legacy has it's flaws.PROS[Brings the Harry Potter Universe Alive]  As a fan of Harry Potter this game is amazing getting to go all over the school and outside of it.  There are so many places to explore and little activities to find. You can really see the detail that was put into making this world feel like it came straight out of the books/movies.  [Combat]Combat is Hogwarts Legacy is pretty fun to do.  You have a number of spells to use on your enemies and skills that make them even more effective.  However while combat is fun, it does get a little stale after hours of doing it and for another reason I will have in cons. CONS[School Life] If you are hoping to feel like a student at Hogwarts, I am sad to say this is not it.  You are a student sure, and you will have some classes, but you are going to spend most of your time running around doing pretty basic tasks and quests most of the time.  You don’t really interact to often with students besides the few followers in the game.  Really annoyed me that I could not sit down in the great hall with the other students.  [Enemies] Traveling outside of school you will encounter enemies.  This is another con for me because it feels like you will mostly fight dark wizards/poachers, goblins, and spiders.  There are a few other enemies to be sure, but they could have added much more variety in the enemies or at least made them more interesting.  The bad guys are your typical rough speaking, ""We are going to kill you because we are evil"" guys. Not much to them.  [Character won’t shut the hell up]  This is a personal annoyance for me.  But every time I go to Hogsmeade my character will say something along the line.  ""Seems all roads lead to Hogsmeade.  Is there anywhere as cozy as Hogsmeade?""  Yes, I get it, You like it here.  Stop telling me that every time I walk into the damn town.  Your character will also do this with caves and whatnot regardless of if you explored them or not.  Your character is going to repeat themselves a lot. [Bland animations]  Now a lot of the animations in cut scenes are great.  I am talking about the speaking to NPC's that you will see often.  The characters are pretty stiff and as soon as their dialog runs out their faces go to expressionless.  It is not to bad, but adding more expressions in face and body language would have made the interactions feel more alive.[Choices]  To me a true RPG is not about skill trees, outfits, or even being able to customize your character.  It is about making choices and the world changing and reacting to them.  Hogwarts Legacy does have choices, and you may even here others talking about them.  But it mostly comes down to.  Say something nice or mean.  There is not to much here without a morality system.  This could have also really made the unforgivable spells feel unforgivable.  I get they want to keep it player friendly, but it would have felt so much more impactful if you had to hide your abilities otherwise word would get around and people will react differently to you.CONCLUSIONOverall Hogwarts Legacy is a fun game to play especially if you love the Harry Potter universe like I do.  The game is defiantly an impressive feat and I do think it is worth buying to show other game companies that there are a lot of players who want games like this one."

1383,t0rn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/t0rnz/,No,,1,51.2,February,11,294,1,1,"Updated Short Review: When you fix the performance issues (with the DLSS patch and engine.ini fix) there is solid game. The combat is super fund and there is much to explore, even though it gets tedious after some time. The story is overall pretty underwhelming and unengaging, especially towards the end. It's a clever designed title, with some issues (performance, writing/story, mobile game level lock-outs), but none to glaring to spoil the game (except for performance, which can be fixed by modding). The world is well designed, but at a certain point into the game, there is really no point in exploring any further as you will only obtain cosmetics, you probably don't need or want.My last save has 41h playtime with the main story finished. There is still a couple of sidequests (which rewards you cosmetics) and a lot of collectible stuff as well remaining, but as I don't get anything from it, I don't see any point in doing them.TLDR: This is definitely a work of love, which captures the playful vibes of the movie material perfectly, but the game suffers from performance issues.Performance: Lots of framedrops with a 3070, 5600x, 32gb of RAM, DLSS quality, all on recommended (high) and 1080p (!) (no RT). Framedrops come and go, but seem to be related with loading. Generally framedrops happen during cutscenes or scene transitions, but they can occur in combat as well, usually at the start and finish of combat. Graphics: you can tell it's being held back by it being a cross-gen title, with not many stuff lying around, especially in larger areas. Small rooms are detail rich though.Audio: Soundtrack is really good, but there seems to be a problem with my audio-interface. I can hear some crackling from time to time, which is usually a sample rate issue, I've encountered with other UE4 games like Hunter:CotW. I have my interface sampling at 96kHz.Edit: I found the culprit: It's the steam overlay. Turning it off fixed my audio issues.Other than that: The game perfectly captures the world portrayed in the movies, going for a similar style. Story is kinda meh and all the friendship characters are really not memorable, but there is a lot to explore and the castle is very well designed. The open world does appear a bit empty, but the real stars are the castle and hogsmeade anyway (at least until now).It does feel a bit stale in terms of quest design and exploration, especially in dungeon levels. However, sidequests have a very modern design approach, as in: they are very short. There is lots of busy work, but it does not get annoying, as small tasks only take up a minute or so of your time, which makes exploring, at least until now, enjoyable.Verdict: Wait for performance to be fixed, other than that: great game, even though it is a little bit shallow.(I will change my review to positive when this happens)"
1384,pN,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pn1994/,3,2,0,70.6,March,15,23,0,1,"This game is not bad, but its not good either. Being one myself, I cannot recommend it to a true HP fan.I dont get the people who say it is a good game for Harry Potter fans. It is not at all that, on the contrary. I will explain further on. I will also list the good points on this game down below.Now my critique points on this game:- Brutally poor performance on PC:I get regular fps dips and funny freezes, narrowed the settings down, capped the FPS and still they exist. Everywhere I read of players having similar issues, regardless of their PC specs.- Bland, boring story without any depth:It does not fit into the HP universe. Underage wizard gets abused by four old ""keepers"" to endure pain and suffering to kill a goblin who wants to drill under Hogwarts. What the ...?- Repetitiveness: Quests and challenges (poacher camps, merlin trials etc. all require the same routine over and over)- No character depth or development:You are the good guy, whether you like it or not. No matter how red your eyes are, how slytherin you are, how much avada kedavra you spam. You cannot plunge into the dark arts at all apart from learning the 3 unforgivables (and using them of course).- Unrealistically high amount of different cultures in Hogwarts:Before people scream racism: Mixed cultures and colours in this degree are not fitting in the britain of the 1880s/1890s where this game is set, where people of different colours were not at all as prominent in britain as they are now. If the game was set in the 2010s, it would of course be more fitting.- Now lets explain why the game is bad for true Harry Potter fans (listed reasons):1.) In 7 books there was not a single mention of different villages, castles etc. being right around Hogwarts, except Hogsmeade.Hogwarts and the area of Hogwarts according to the books and movies consists of Hogwarts castle, the grounds (including the quidditch pitch and the gamekeepers hut, the forbidden forest, the black lake), Hogsmeade, and maybe the mountains around it. Yet the game consists of 70% small villages, castle ruins and even coastal areas which do not fit the lore at all.2.)  Poachers are killing animals in the forbidden forest. Of course, every headmaster that would fit the lore would have taken action and banished them from the grounds, and not let an underage wizard do the job.3.)  Every Hogwarts student according to the books and movies arrives by train (Starting in London, no stops inbetween!) every year. Sebastian Sallow, being from Feldcroft, comes by foot then?4.) Curfew. All students, except prefects, have a curfew. In one mission this is in place, but other than that, you can wander around at night fully visible with no worries. Not like in the books and movies at all.5.) The castle. It is beautifully made, and there are lots of spots that remind you of the movies, and a bit of the books. But the castle is just too damn small! I would have wished that they had cut 3/4 of the world and used that space to expand the castle size. Where are the seven floors? Where are the countless classrooms? Why is dumbledores office not on the same level as the room of requirement for example? Where is the caretakers office? Etc. etc. This wouldve been easily done had they just removed all the villages, castles and the never ending land around Hogwarts in the game.6.) Quidditch, where is it? Again, use the space you wasted on the boring villages and integrate Quidditch! The pitch is already there.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Onto the good stuff:- Beautiful graphics- Apart from being way too small, the castle is well made and looks stunning- Hogsmeade is done pretty well- Very fitting, dynamic music depending on where you are and what you are doing in the game, and what time of day it is- Little details (not being able to enter the girls rooms as a male, paintings that react to you, lots of different animals, cats, ghosts etc.)- Common rooms are a big plus, being just as in the books and/or movies, you can enter every dormatory and even the toilets with bathtubs!- The fighting system with the use of all the different spells is very fun to use and opens the possibility to experiment for quirky combos.- The use of the room of requirement as a kind of home base for the new 5th year student is a good move and could fit the lore.- The ability to grow different herbs and brew potions is very neat.- The ability to change your outfits, hair etc. is fun and should be even more developed (facial hair for example)- The possibility to merge your pottermore stats into the game is exactly what I had wished for!- The movie locations are very well depicted and recognizable, even the kitchens are there, even if they are not in the movies--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion:Well, these are my opinions on the game. The graphics are beautiful. Love the little details. But overall, and I dont get why people keep saying it is, it is not so much a game for true HP fans. There is of course the need for a compromise in such a game, to fit the movies more than the books maybe, and to make the story more worthwhile, but they could have used all the useless space around Hogwarts and made Hogwarts a big castle with all the stuff a true HP fan wanted, including Quidditch, late night strolls to find hidden chambers and corridors, etc. Being able to build relationships based on your answering would have been cool to. And the ability to grow your character into a dark, or a light wizard, depending on what you prefer. It is not a bad game, but I cant recommend it to a true HP fan."

The world is extremely immersive and worth spending time in; which is good because it is a slow burn at first. Overall, a memorable fantasy RPG experience!"
1387,Janspach,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Janspach/,2,,1,46.0,February,19,"1,628",0,1,Absolutely amazing time for the first 2/3rds of the game. Exploring in the beginning and doing the side quests felt really special. Im not a big harry potter fan but even I really loved exploring Hogwarts and its surroundings. The Room of Requirement was a really fun diversion. Combat is great against most enemies but fighting trolls was annoying because of their ridiculous health barsThe beginning of the game was great but by the end it started to drag on and the story felt rushed at the end. The whole coast portion could have been cut and the game would have felt better.8.2/10
1388,joxertm22,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061771585/,2,,1,65.9,February,11,186,1,1,"Not a perfect game.Clunky menus (thanks to retarded consoles), too much of grinding, some annoyances that luckily don't affect the overall game (no need to solve all merlin puzzles and one is bugged on my side), the main story unlocks good stuff instead of passing all that to side quests.And what's with CTRL instead of doubletap? Okay I kinda nitpick now because at least these dev know that M is map, I inventory and J journal unlike some amateurs that map IJKL to emulate console mushrooms. And yet TAB+3 for the broom is kinda retarded.Inventory tetris could have been a tadbit better, especially randomized loot (savescum possibility), but all in all I did not have a problem with trading and buying anything I wanted.The ping on detected bookpage should have been also visual for hearing impaired players.On the totally positive side the world and stories are awsome and full of interesting puzzles and secrets.Combat on PC against trashmobs is easy, but bosses are not easy which is a big plus.I don't know if choices during dialogs matter, but I have seen a few times NPCs mention what you solved - in sidequests! This is absolutely awsome, I generally love sidecontent and this game has plenty of it in different varieties.Finally there is a performance problem if you keep consoley crap enabled (motion blur, film grain, etc). This will probably be fixed in upcoming patches.So, should you buy this?Absolutely! While not a masterpiece, the game is so much fun, beats any aggresively advertised mainstream trash when it comes to having fun."

1397,Dr. Demontale,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043305587/,2,,1,77.4,February,11,147,0,1,"IntroI'm going to start by saying I had little expectations and very high hopes for this game. I've never really heard of Portkey Games and this is a BIG IP, with a huge Fanbase and a few haters (of course). In the case of advertising, the haters of J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter all together have done a really good job, of letting EVERYBODY know when this game comes out and made sure that you do NOT forget about the release. I want to thank them for this. I had a few hiccups in the very beginning, the hour of release (7pm, 7th Feb, 23, to be precice). The game was preloaded and just wouldn't unpack itself, even with me manually doing it. So, naturally, I was frustrated. But well, I quickly downloaded Monster Hunter World and killed about 1 1/2 hours before the problem was fixed either by steam, or Warner Brothers, which is a really good time, I must say. And then I started the game. Oh my, my childhood and my teenage years came back as quick as it gets. The character creator was a little underwhelming to be honest. Maybe because I just came from the absolute insane creator of Monster Hunter World, but I would've expected more, yet I am satisfied with it.The GameI must say... I did not expect the game to graphically look so beautiful. I am running it on a RTX 2070 Ti, and even on Medium options and performance mode it looks stunning, if you're not nitpicky. The animations of the characters are fine, sometimes a bit robotic, but I don't care about that one bit. Huge framedrops in cutscene until I changed to performance mode (don't ask me why, I don't know). Having played a good 30 hours right now, unlocked a few spells and must say, they could've done a better job with the UI. Somehow the changing between spell-presets feels really weird to me, but it does NOT take out the fun out of gameplay or combat at all!Let me tell you, and I am so happy to say this, I didn't expect them to go THIS hard on this game. Exploring the castle feels real, the friends you meet are authentic. The overall population is, of course, fantasized to be extremely diverse, which is a really nice detail. Combat feels fluid, you feel the impact of the spells you are casting and getting new, very specific spells is very exciting. The world is HUGE if you travel by flying. There is a lot to do, many cats to be petted, many things to collect and the best thing about it is: It doesn't force the collecting on you. It just happens. Like The Witcher 3, or Breath of the Wild, you are on your way to a quest, and then you see a cave. You explore the cave because it looks nice, you find another note in there, telling you to go to another place, and so on and so on, you get it. It feels natural and absolutely amazing. I wanna thank the team that made this possible. Does my enthusiasm mean it won't get stale? I mean, there is always room for improvement, sure. But I think it will be a few more weeks until I get tired of flinging people through the air by magic. I really hope this is going to evolve to a big serious of never ending, macigal adventure. Well done, 60 housepoints to PortkeyGames. 9,5/10 expelliarmus'ses's"

The hogwarts castle is linear and small. using unforgivable curses Even in front of teachers and students has no consequences. Entering the forbidden forest and centaurs pass by your side and don't attack you makes no sense, as they attack any wizard who enters there. And being that there's a mission they almost kill you. The game is empty and repetitive and lifeless. I had fun though. but I give this bad rating because I paid full price expecting a good story and a deep game that actually the story is boring. buy it when it gets cheaper because it's not worth the price. buy resident evil 4. this one is worth every penny."

1404,Piston Smashed™,https://steamcommunity.com/id/n0_h4xs_n33d3d/,9,,1,28.4,March,6,"7,257",0,1,"You receive a letter that says that you’ve been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as a fifth-year student. Starting Hogwarts as a fifth-year student is very unusual and while the use of magic outside of Hogwarts is prohibited outside of school you have been given special permission by the Ministry to hone your magic under the tutelage of Professor Fig. He will then escort you from London to the Hogwarts along with all your supplies in time for the start of term feast and Sorting Ceremony. Before the feasting and ceremony can begin, you have the chance to customise your character, name them, choose to be a witch or wizard and choose the games difficulty. You can if you wish, select one of the preset characters on offer or you can customise your characters looks using the customiser where you can choose from different Face Wear (Face Shape, Skin Colour and Glasses), Hair Styles and Colour, Complexion (Freckles, Moles and Scars and Markings), Eyes and Eyebrows and Voice. There are four game difficulties, Story, this is focused on the story with minimal gameplay challenge. Easy has a light gameplay challenge, Normal is your standard balanced challenge and Hard is where you’ll receive a demanding gameplay challenge. The game begins with both you and Professor Fig preparing to leave London in a flying carriage. A George Osric of the Ministry joins you both, with him and Professor Fig needing to talk about something however it would be better if they spoke enroute to Hogwarts rather than in the streets of London. After setting off Professor Fig and George talk about the Ranrok threat, while some at the Ministry think he’s not a threat others believe that he is a great threat. George had been in contact with Professor Fig’s wife before she died about Ranrok’s activities, and she was wondering if the Ministry knew anything. However, before he could reply he received a mysterious item that he cannot open was delivered by her Owl.  The mysterious item has a symbol which only you can see glowing and when you handle the item it opens revealing a key. Then suddenly the carriage is ripped in half throwing poor George to his death. The carriage is being attacked by a dragon, before it attacks again you both jump as you fall you grab the key which then transports you both to a mysterious cave, it’s from here that your adventure begins... As you make your way from the cave and explore your surroundings, you’ll start to go over some of the basics of the game. You’ll eventually find yourselves at Hogwarts, although you will now have a mystery starting to unravel. You and Professor Fig will work together in trying to solve the mystery but first you must deal with school and the Sorting Ceremony where you will find out which house you will become part of. You will play through a day and night cycle; in the daytime you can take various classes and at night you can do what you’d like, at least I did although I was told at one point to head back to the common room at night but that’s just boring. Taking classes will allow you to learn various things such as botany where you can grow your own plants to be used as ingredients for potion making or you can grow some plants which will help you in combat. Spellcasting, Flying and other lessons can all help you as you progress through the game. The teachers will set you extra assignments along with the main story quests, where you could learn a new spell or unlock something else. Gaining quests isn’t solely with the teachers, your fellow students can also give you quests to complete with various rewards for completing them. You can also complete Challenges such as Time Trials on your broom where you must beat a certain time to complete and earn rewards. You are given a Field Guide by Deputy Head Professor Weasley, anything you find will appear in this guide and there are a lot of things to find. Using Revelio will reveal what is hidden, allowing you to collect the field guides. In the field guides you can uncover some information about what you have discovered. Away from Hogwarts in the surrounding area you’ll find Hogsmeade, here you can buy items for potions and their ingredients, brooms, clothes etcetera. You can also sell any items here with any of the vendors, you can find traders also out in the small hamlets which are dotted around Hogwarts surroundings. You can find areas of interest on your map and once, you have visited an area and unlocked the Floo Flames Network so you can fast travel back and forth at any time you wish. To begin with you only have your legs to travel from one place to another, however, as you progress you will acquire a broom and later a flying mount which are great but not as fast as using the floo flames network. Combat consists of you using what you have learnt, you have a basic attack but that’s not going to do you much good on its own. You will learn offensive and defensive spells, but you will also have at your disposal potions and even creatures such as the Chinese Chomping Cabbage and the Mandrake. Performing combo’s using your magic and taking damage will accumulate Ancient Magic which can be used in combat and can be very helpful especially against the tougher enemies you come across. You can have four quick access spells slots to begin with but once you unlock Talents (Skills) you’ll be able to unlock another three tiers of four slots. In total you have twenty-three spells to unlock but you’ll only be able to select sixteen for the quick access slots. This will allow you to sort out your spells how you like as not all spells are for combat so you can have a couple tiers for combat, one for conjuring items and one for whatever. You can switch between each of the tiers as required depending on your current situation. You will earn one Talent Point for each time you level up your character. There are five categories in which you can spend your Talent Points on, these are Spells, Dark Arts, Core, Stealth and Room of Requirements. Out in the open world along with the Hamlets you will find some Merlin Trials, these are some simple puzzles to complete and in doing so they will increase the size of your gear inventory. You find gear in chests, and you can also buy gear from shops or traders. The gear you collect will add protection and bonuses to your defence and attacking abilities, although to use some of them you may need to be at a certain level before being able to equip the gear to your character. You gain levels through collection of experience points as you defeat enemies and complete quests. The gear also comes in various rarities, and some can be upgraded with abilities.Positives  + Fantastic graphics + Very enjoyable to play + Lots of quests, challenges and puzzles + Has achievements + Steam Deck verified Negatives  - No cards currently Explore Hogwarts, unlock its secrets, fly by moonlight, solve the mystery of ancient magic and put a stop to Ranrok’s plans all while you attend classes and learn spells as you become a wizard in the 18th century. 9/10"

1419,artfuldodgeram,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047557960/,8,,0,49.4,February,14,308,2,1,"Growing up, I was what one would consider a mild-to-moderate Harry Potter fan. I was around eight years old when the first movie came out, but I didn't read the books or see any movies in theaters aside from the first, second, and last until I was an adult. Despite the controversy around J.K. Rowling and the volatile nature of virtually everyone who feels the need to vehemently simp for a self-conceited billionaire, I purchased Hogwarts Legacy anyway since carving your own path as a wizard/witch seemed enticing. I'll throw this disclaimer out there: I am pro-trans and left-leaning.Simply put, Hogwarts Legacy is window dressing. The game lacks any natural substance and comes off as a storefront for later DLC releases, similar to other WB games. Once you take off the sepia-toned glasses of nostalgia, the game feels dated. The story is mediocre, laden with Obama-era liberal idealism befitting those between the ages of 18 to 22 during the early twenty-teens (coincidentally, the group of people most likely to have Potter-related tattoos). The gameplay is briefly fanciful yet repetitive (similar to Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor, although with less reason to pursue varying combat styles absent of unrelenting spell-slinging). None of the choices you make matter in any meaningful way. The player character feels less like an actual student at Hogwarts and more like an observant exchange student. The game is utterly lacking in dynamism. NPCs are wholly non-reactive, both in dialogue options and in general interactivity, the actions you commit and the choices you make have virtually no impact on the procession of the story, and despite a blatant misdirection of presenting this game as open-world with dynamic paths, the only thing open about the game is the map (although not too open since you can't travel to certain places before you've checked the arbitrary boxes the game has placed before you).That said, the writing is the worst part of the game. None of the characters are particularly memorable or engaging, aside from that blind fellow with a laughable name (honestly, who names a child Ominis?). The cast of characters is somehow more diverse than the Hogwarts faculty and student body from the books, which take place 100 years after the events of Hogwarts Legacy. There's no questioning why the goblins are rebelling, just that they are, and they must be stopped. Some of the characters feel like they're written based on politics, like the Merlin researcher who informs you that she is married to another woman for no reason other than standard liberal brownie points or the inexplicable and poorly named trans character, Sirona.Again, Obama-era liberal idealism is laden in every corner of this game, likely for a good reason, since Harry Potter stans tend to fall directly into that category. Combine that with J.K. Rowling's dance with the TERF community, and you appeal to both sides of the political spectrum. Like all who embody respectability politics, you're not alienating anyone. That's not to say those video game developers shouldn't walk on eggshells if they want to. Still, it certainly makes for a dull experience when they do.For all intents and purposes, the game is below average. That's not to say I haven't enjoyed parts of it. The flying mechanics are great, and the game is visually appealing in a Norman Rockwell-Set-In-The-Wizarding-World way. Your eye is drawn to what you're familiar with, like the moon-backed silhouette of Hogwarts or the use of popular character surnames.While I'll take the time to finish the game (mama didn't raise no quitter), I cannot recommend anyone buy it at full price. There's only a little value to be found beyond nostalgia. If you like that, fine. Go ahead and play it.If you're looking for something beyond the surface in Hogwarts Legacy, you'll be disappointed because there is very little."

Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are so well realized and feel so alive. You know what doesn't feel alive? The characters. They are so bland and one dimensional. The longer I played the game, the more I realized how little it offered. The side quests are all bland and unimagined, the ambient objectives are just copy and pasted across the world, and the combat boasts it's in depth mechanics, but shoots itself in the proverbial foot bone by shackling every spell to a specific class, making it redundant to switch up your bread and butter loadout. Also, the lack of any sort of repercussions to using curses is just so, so stupid. The unforgivable curses in this game are akin to doing a ""no-no"" at Weenie Hut Junior's. Sometimes, an NPC with no charisma might say something along the lines of ""I can't believe you've done this!"" but that's all that'll happen. This game could've been so good with a Fable style morality system, as well as a trouble mechanic like in Bully, but instead it just says ""DON'T YOU DARE DO X"" without there being any repercussions for your actions. This game is a Kardashian, on the surface, it's beautiful and interesting. In reality? It's hollow and fundamentally broken."

You can become the clown you're destined to be. Cons:- Optimization is really bad. Seriously, don't wear capes.- Overall graphics is kinda meh. All female faces look the same.- Severe level of gameplay and narrative dissonance. I didn't feel like Hogwarts Student, more like a witcher or Cpt. Shepard with a magic wand.- MC is Mary Sue, war criminal and psychopath, but people still like them.- No reputation or punishment system outside of certain quests.To sum up, it's probably the best Harry Potter game out there for now. Feels like there's been a lot of stuff cut from the final release, and lots of other stuff was put there just because it's trendy.If you're a fan, it's the game just for you.Otherwise it's another open world mediocre RPG.Nuff said."

The 2000s-era style of invisible walls everywhere and ""YOU ARE ABOUT TO FAIL THE QUEST, RETURN NOW"" in a supposed open-world game is jarring and off-putting. The lifeless NPCs, lack of any real choices and meaningless side quests with zero depth makes this so-called RPG quite the shallow experience.But hey, a guy on Facebook said that ""fighting bad guys and changing your outfit"" is the definition of role-playing.

This game like many other new releases is unpolished and filled with bugs. BUT the biggest bug is the save game issue. What I mean by this is the game will arbitrarily chose to delete your save game. As you can see I have played this game for a hot minute but have lost every single save game and I have tried this four separate times with each house. For this game it is infuriating to reach bugs and have my save that I poured time into to just go poof cause the game decides we are not gonna continue that or even let you finish the game. I would suggest waiting until this bug is polished out of the game and to be honest the game would still be pretty mid. Its fun at first but its very repetitive and has no reply value.
1436,Raptorman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Raptorman_37/,2,,1,64.4,March,12,114,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a fantastic game, where you are in the wizarding world but 100 years before the events of Harry Potter. You create your student character, who starts as a 5th year, and travel to Hogwarts with Professor Fig. It does not take long for the story and action to start as you try to learn about the secrets of ancient magic that only your character seems to be able to see and interact with. You develop by learning new spells, exploring the open world and completing quests and side quests. For anyone that is a fan of the wizarding world and wanting to experience being a student at Hogwarts, this is a must have game.The combat system is something you do get fluent with, and you will be well advised to use some of your talent points to unlock more slots for spells to be accessed to during combat. There are a lot of spell combinations that can lead to high damage, or even instantly killing enemies, and some unique combinations that work when specific enemies are about to use particular attacks.  A very enjoyable experience so far."

This game captures that feeling perfectly! I really enjoyed the exploration of the world and the magic combat without mana costs. The world is intricately crafted; the developers definitely love the franchise. Nonetheless, there are the standard open-world activities, but with very good variety in level design. There are ""not just stupid"" collection tasks, and you also have to use magic spells wisely outside of combat.The rooster of Characters are solid and the main plot drive in safe waters. But the classmates quest were very suprising and full of ""Wow""-Moments.What impressed me the most was the fact that you can cultivate your own magical plants, brew magical power drinks, and domesticate magical beasts, as well as craft your own items and gear as needed. This game doesn't have to hide behind big RPGs like Skyrim.For the first 20h i would have called this game a MASTERPIECE, but after the exploration and fascination drops a bit this game ist still STUNNING. even for muggel-players."

Required a lot of messing around in the settings to find a playable setup, and even after all that still get huge frame pacing issues at times. RT is straight up unusable, often looks worse with it on than off, huge visual glitching issues with it. Also audio mixing is terrible, no master volume control, and the sliders present seem to hardly do anything, with many elements (such as the basic cast, and certain character dialogue) not responding to them and playing at full volume regardless. If these things get patched this game will potentially be my game of the year"

And maybe i can change my review to a thumbs up sometime in the future but the actual technical state of the game is just unbearable. As you can see i have about 7h ""playtime"" from which are about 4h just trying to get the game to work. I managed to play the first hour of the game, got to sleep and then came back the next day to play some more and bäm, nothing, literally nothing works anymore. The game doesnt even start and at this point i´m just sick of trying to fix it. Browsing through the web it seems there are a lot of unlucky guys just like myself just trying to get this game working ... Also the fact that the Developers doesnt seem to be working on the problem adds to the frustration - at least there is no announcement that theyre working on a solution.Buying this game is a bit like Kinder Surprise, you really dont know what you will get and the possibility the game randomly shuts down and stops working all of a sudden is defenitely there. So keep that in mind fellow potterheads. I give up now, after trying literally EVERYTHING i´m just exhausted and sad.Update: After a lot of fiddling around some of my other games began to show the same problems as Hogwarts Legacy, so i decided to reset my whole system (was time for that anyway) and now i can finally play the game. I´m having tons of fun so far, but i have to say the performance ist just really bad. With a couple of additional lines ind the engine.ini and the great FPS fix mod from Nexus Mods i managed to get a stable framerate. Begs the question why the modding scene once more needs to fix a unfinished product and make doing this seem so easy. In terms of gameplay i really love what Portkey games did there, but the technical state still keeps me from recommending the game at the moment. It was just too much hassle to get this AAA product to run and you shouldnt have to jump through hoops to play a game which you paid 60 bucks for."

Sometimes I found I could not pull away- Ample side activities to fill in your free time as you explore- Attention to detail is astonishing. Everything we saw in the movies is there. Moving pictures, statues, ghosts, you name it.- Random things sometimes happen as you explore, even if they become old after seeing it more than five times.- We can pet chain-smoker cats!- You can keep pets (beasts) and brush them, feed them.- Gear customization caters to the player's personal preference and does not force you to look like a clown that just left the circus as you wear the strongest gear you could find. You can choose the look of any outfit you found so far on any gear.- Large open world to explore- Combat isn't like Dark Souls. Controls are easy to learn, combat isn't overdone, which serves to make you feel powerful.- Some side-quests are actually quite enjoyable and captivating-------------------------- The developers say that you can choose to be a good or evil wizard. Thing is, with no morality system in place, this is simply a lie. NPCs couldn't care less about you blasting combat spells around them, or picking the lock to their house, steal the stuff of a family sitting by the table, or whichever choice you make at the end. None of these matter. Not even the options you pick in dialogues. The story is as it is.- The attention to detail is indeed astonishing but it is clear they focused too much on this and not on other aspects of gameplay, like allowing our character to live in the world they are put in. You cannot even sit down in a chair, sleep in your bed, eat with the other students in the Great Hall, no curfew. No interaction at all. You simply exist in the game but don't live.- There are a lot of side activities indeed and the map is full of them. But there are the same 6 or so types you can do like 50 times. Good luck completing them.- Ending is a let down. Without spoilers... It doesnt matter what you do, what you choose, what you say... Nothing matters. The ending is meh. Not at all fulfilling. No consequence, no difference. It almost seems like it is incomplete.-------------------------All in all, I did enjoy playing it. But the lack of morality system, the lack of consequences or changes to the plot or flavor of the game depending on your choices was ruining it. Still, I give it a thumbs up because it gave me a good time. I just wish they would have spent less time on the castle and more on developing gameplay."
1466,Domi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Melunek/,2,,1,44.2,February,28,181,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is decent game. Like thousand other people I was really hyped about this game and when the day finally came, I didn't think twice before buying the Deluxe edition. But looking back ... I think this was a mistake, paying 10€ for playing 3 days earlier than people who got default game. But, I can say that, despite having few flaws and cons, you will enjoy this game if you are fan of Harry Potter universe.Graphic is really awesome, story is really enjoyable and gameplay, especially with puzzles is great. Also the ""feel"" of this game is amazing.Now, what flaws and cons am I talking about?For  example, the  as this is promoted, is really empty and pretty much unoccupied. Sure, there are few villages, but with only up to 10 people, including one trader,few chest and thats it. Other than that, there are only repetetive challenges, caves, beast spots and enemy camps. The only locations you will propably enjoy and remember, are, obviously Hogwarts castle and Hogsmead. Also, In some videos, it was pointed, that your dialogue choice will have impact on the story. You can be mean, the NPC will react differently, but after dialogue, you are still their friend and hero at the end. is not so forbidden after all. You can loiter around as much as you like, even with other NPCs and nobody will care.And  are, once again not so unforgivable after all. You can cast them in front of other NPCs, but they will only say things like :  and so on ... And at the end of the story, you are hero and nobody mentions that you are using Unforgivable CursesNow. Wandering around castle at night.You can teach yourself  so you can stealth around people as part of one quest where you have to avoid prefects, because, well its night and you should be sleeping. So you do that and quest ends.Do you thing you have to avoid prefects from now on? Nope, that was one time thing. ( There is maybe one other quest like this. ) You can walk, run around castle as you like, while other students are sleeping and prefects ... well they are nowhere to be found. This may sound like silly issue, but since developers obviously spend their time to implement this mechanic into the game and then they decided to use it for quests only is weird. But, at the end of the day, this game is really great and you will have fun."

Its really really bad especially from the main character and that for me atleast is the worst part of the game by far and drags the game down by alot.Combat is fun in the start but gets boring towards the end and i would say the story is decent i guess but nothing special.I do have to say that if i didn't spend 70 euros on this game im not sure if i would have finished it.Game gets a bit boring in the end and felt a bit like a chore to finish it and the voice acting is definitely a big part of that. It just doesn't pull me into the story at all.Would probably give it a 6.5 and would advice it to buy on sale honestly

1469,WheezySquash8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065938243/,2,,1,38.3,February,27,69,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy was one of the most fun gaming experiences I've had in the last year. It provided an immersive world that is a dream for any Harry Potter Fan. The game excelled more than it failed in many retrospects. I beat the campaign and have 38 Hours in the game. Here is my perspective.Successes of the game:1. Immersion. Any building is possible to enter, loading screens are minimal, and everything flows extremely well in the world. I felt like I was in the Harry Potter Universe the whole time playing this.2. The magic system. The way you fight with magic in this game, and interact with the world while using it is amusing and exciting at the  same time. The combat with magic had me on the edge of my seat throughout fighting the various monsters of the world, and the puzzles I had to use my magic on provided entertainment. 3. Flying. This game did an amazing job with flying mounts and flying on your broom. I enjoyed flying around Hogwarts and seeing the size of the world in this game (it is huge)4. Character development. The story of this game does an amazing job making you develop relationships with the characters you see that play a big role in the excitement of the game. Personally my favorite characters I became fond of playing this game were Sebastian Sallow and Natsai Onai. 5. Lore. This game's' biggest strength without a doubt is lore. You see so many creatures described in JK Rowling's films, you see paintings on the walls described exactly like in the Harry Potter books, and you overall can tell the makers of this game took a lot of time to describe the Harry Potter Universe properly.Failures of the game (although the game is far more of a success than failure):1. Empty, but beautiful world. The world in this game is huge (which is another pro) but it is extremely empty outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. Some areas had me wishing the developers spent more time adding details. The Forbidden Forest especially could have been WAY better. The world still maintains beauty but is very empty.2. Slow narration. The start of the game is extremely slow, and it takes a while to get off your feet. Some parts had me thinking that characters were just providing filler in their narration. Some narration was also very boring and had me trying to skim over it as soon as I could.3. Repetitive monsters/beasts. This game has a very enjoyable combat system and I also really enjoyed the aspect of taming beasts, but a lot of the monsters and beasts you interacted with were repetitive. You mostly only fight wolves, knights (pensieves), goblins, poachers, spiders, trolls, ashwinders, dugbogs, thieves, or inferiuses (zombies). For beasts you have like 6 you can capture and put in a habitat and nothing further. 4. Side quests versus the main story. I wanted to start the game doing a lot of side quests but had to do the story because if I didn't I would not have all of the mechanics of the game unlocked (especially lockpicking. You don't get it until later in the main story when you should get it early on). The game pressures you to focus purely on the main story and getting it complete rather than doing any side quests which I think is a negative in a game trying to be free and open world. 5. A game that missed out on a lot of potential in certain aspects. You pick a house when you begin the game, but the house you pick barely affects the plot of the game. I would have liked to have seen houses play a bigger role in the game. You also cannot do much in your house area. Throughout the game, they claim you can customize your character's gear in a unique fashion (including your wand), but the appearance of gear is extremely repetitive. Your wand customization is minimal, although it does exist which is nice. Overall, this game excelled in so many aspects of detail. It's biggest strength in my opinion is immersion and lore. This is the perfect game for a Harry Potter fan. Some points had me wish it went further with care for detail (especially when it comes to repetition of characters, clothes, etc), but it is an extremely great game. I would give it an 8.5/10."

It has some features characteristic of RPG games, such as leveling up, talents, gear, and dialogues, but it doesn't make it a role-playing game. Name an AAA title that doesn't have at least some of these nowadays.  does not feature the defining thing which makes a game  - choices and consequences. You can run around breaking into restricted places and casting forbidden spells, and no one will raise an eyebrow. Sure, you will make choices in dialogues, but your decisions don't matter. The main story will keep you strictly on the rails, and most of the side quests are just about going somewhere, doing something, and coming back. Dialogues here are for pure immersion, which is lovely, but don't expect anything beyond that. There definitely was a potential for role play, given the nature of the story and the setting itself, but it was never realized for some reason.As for the story itself, it's... okay. It's undoubtedly epic and exciting to follow most of the time. However, there're specific segments when it feels frankly dragged for the sake of dragging. I mean, a dozen of main story quests could've easily been optional. Characters are primarily one-dimensional but still well-written and voiced. If you have a kink for accents as I do, then you would probably find satisfying how diverse the voiceover cast is, which makes every character, even barely presented ones, feel unique. In terms of progression,  is an example for many open-world games out there. Unlocking various side activities, additional spells, and locations is tied to your story and side quest progression, which I found very convenient since the game doesn't overwhelm you with everything it has to offer at once but instead unlocks it step by step. It makes the game more balanced in terms of pace. However, there's one questionable decision, which made my first dozen hours in the game a bit frustrating. You must reach a certain point in the story to unlock talents required to customize your build and grant additional effects to your spells, potions, etc. This mechanic is fundamental for a game like this. However, it's, for some reason, locked behind 5-10 hours of gameplay, depending on difficulty and how distracted you will be by some side activities. Of course, you can speedrun the story until a particular moment to gain access to your talents and then play and explore comfortably. Still, if you're playing for the first time, you're most likely unaware of how long it will take you to unlock the actual leveling up, and without talents, your combat and exploration options are pretty limited. Craft, another crucial gameplay element, is hidden even further behind multiple side quests. This decision is justified from the story perspective but still seems questionable gameplaywise. Speaking of combat. Overall I found it fun and engaging, not to mention each encounter looks spectacular due to the variety of spells and other ways to fight your enemies. The game allows you to wield all the most well-known conjures from books and movies, even unforgivable ones, which you can use in combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. However, I found battles rather exhausting than fun until halfway through the main story due to a limited arsenal. Only after I unlocked most of the spells and upgraded them did the combat finally shine. Regarding exploration and the open world,  is fantastic, especially if you're a Harry Potter fan like I used to be years ago. The devs nailed it with good attention to the details while recreating the magical world we used to know only through books and movies, especially in Hogwarts castle. I guarantee you will spend hours exploring only the school itself, not to mention Hogsmead and dozens of small hamlets, caves, and tombs. Some locations are breathtaking, which makes the lack of photo mode a considerable downside. However, after a certain point, when you'll explore enough and the sense of discovery becomes dull, you will most likely see that it's nothing more than an average AAA open world with question marks and bandit camps, with challenges and puzzles more suitable for an MMO rather than a single-player game. Still, there were enough moments throughout the game, no spoilers, which were done so well in terms of atmosphere and immersion that it ultimately outweighed all the secondariness of the surrounding activities. From the technical side,  is far from perfect. I experienced constant fps drops and stuttering here and there while my rig was more than decent to run the game with the settings I used. Facial animations are weird outside of pre-rendered cutscenes, and most of the dialogues are just talking heads with occasional gesticulation. However, overall,  looks beautiful, primarily because of design, attention to detail, and visual style rather than graphics quality.In my book,  is a great game. I admire how devs recreated the wizarding world and used every advantage of the setting beloved by millions to create a massive interactive experience, which, despite being rough around the edges, is good enough to stand in line with the genre's best."

One of the best open world games I've played since TW3 and RDR2 and honestly, one of the best games I've played in recent time. As a BIG HP fan, this was everything that I wanted for proper full fledged open world RPG HP game. Fully immersive, attention to detail is incredible, gripping story, lovable characters etc.. Avalanche absolutely hit the nail with everything in the wizarding world and went above and beyond! Missing Quidditch and not being able to freely visit Azkaban was a HUGE missed opportunity thought and I wasn't happy about that but hopefully in the future we'd be able to experience those in a sequel or DLC.Performance wise it was great, the BIGGEST issue I had was the constant FPS dips when visiting certain areas such as Hogsmede or certain areas in the castle. No crashes or anything else on my end aside from those FPS dips which definitely need tweaking. After finishing the game I honestly feel sad the adventure is over. It makes me want a sequel even more and I'm certain the amount of money the game has made already is already swaying WB to get Avalanche prepped up for a sequel and I'm absolutely down for it and in full support!"

They're bland, boring and pointless. Over 50 of themMerlin trials. Boring extremely simple puzzles just to increase your gear capacity. A whole 95 of them.Dungeons are just there only for side quests, no point in exploring them beforehand. There's only a few anyway.Camps are there so you can kill a few enemies and not die of boredom while roaming. And for collectibles.Collection is just a chore with no real reward unless you enjoy decorations.Money is purely for buying spellcrafts/seeds at first, after that there is no use for money. All gear sold by merchants is useless, all materials can be obtained in the room of requirement for free of charge.

The whole concept of becoming a witch/wizard, exploring not only hogwarts (which is HUGE), but a whole map of various places, is nostalgia central for fans who grew up with Harry Potter, and so beautifully interesting for those that haven’t. I’ve read the bad reviews on this game and they’re honestly complaining about the smallest things! Sure, there’s a few bugs. They can be fixed with update releases from creators. Sure, the voices aren’t what was expected - but I’ve definitely heard worse and it absolutely does not ruin the allure of Hogwarts Legacy. The visuals are STUNNING. The game is HUGE and SO versatile; it’s an open world RPG with great combat, a variety of items to collect (no, it’s not repetitive - each item has their own way of appearing and some you have to actually go and search for with little or no hints), there’s treasure maps, flying on brooms and mounts, pet collecting, potion making, base building (to an extent), secrets to discover without being told where they are, there’s honestly SO much to do! The story line is intriguing and I’m so glad they didn’t just make another Harry Potter game! If you’re a fan of fantasy RPGs that’s enough for you to try this game out for yourself, hats off to the creators."

I've heard nothing but rave reviews, but on the whole, the combat just doesn't work for me. Telegraphs overlap, leading to impossible situations, Enemies teleport across the battlefield for no discernible reason. Many times I can't solve a puzzle because spells don't work the way I imagine that they would work, but rather there's a static solution that I need to do. The character won't jump up 2 feet if it's not the solution to the puzzle, but they can jump 15 feet to climb a wall if it is the solution. Stealth is useless about 50% of the time, which would be great if I could just respec out of that talent tree, but I can't respec talents without starting over."

1488,GOMENASORRY,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198188335363/,2,1,1,41.3,February,24,177,0,1,"edit: holy sh*t this review is waaay too long. I won't be writing any reviews as long as this anymore.~TLDR; 7.5/10 game, amazing graphics, stunning world, beautiful details, passable story for the most part until the end where it falls a little flat. Not many choices to be made in dialogue and the combat is the best part of the game imo.~Game of the Year? Not really, kind of far from it actually. A damn good game for Harry Potter enthusiasts and the adventuring sort alike? A must play for sure.I'm in an odd category when it comes to the Harry Potter franchise. I've never once shown any interest in Harry Potter in the past despite my love for anything remotely high-fantasy (magic, dungeons and dragons, knights, orcs and whatever). As someone who's been looking for a breathtaking open world to get immersed into and lose myself in a world full of magic and mystery, this game almost hits that spot.Unfortunately, this game is one of those games that gives you the illusion of choice. A lot of the dialogue gets routed back to a set script and there's only about 3-4 choices I can think off the top of my head that actually matter to some extent. The rest is there for your character to say what is essentially the same thing differently (at least for the vast majority of the main quests. Some of the side quests might actually have some impact with different dialogue but I wouldn't hold my breath).Easily the best part of the game in my opinion is the combat. When you start learning more and more spells, you slowly come to the realisation that in a 1v1 scenario with any normal enemy, you will NEVER lose. You can infinitely juggle an enemy to oblivion and different spells interact wonderfully with each other. Need to throw your Incendio at the enemy you're juggling but they're flown too far? Just throw an Accio their way and they're suddenly in range for a full force of fire. Want to lift someone in the air, slow their momentum to a halt then slam their face into the ground? Leviosa, Arresto Momentum and Descendo will do the trick.The fun in combat doesn't end there, however. There are actually multiple ways of killing specific enemies that aren't just hitting it until it's dead. When a Dugbog's about to lash it's tongue out at you, you can actually cast Leviosa on it’s tongue and leave it hanging or cast the severing spell Diffindo to cut it, dealing significant damage. You can also cut a few enemy’s charging spells short by either disarming them with Expelliarmus or a quick Depulso and the spells will blow up in their faces, killing them instantly. Trolls have an overhead attack that can be parried OR you can block/dodge it and Flipendo the club back to its face, giving you ample opportunity to deal massive damage. The normal combat is fun and engaging by itself but the gameplay is elevated by experimenting and playing around with different spells for different enemies. You’re rewarded for your time and knowledge mid-combat with satisfying kills and interesting ways to manipulate the battlefield. I got the game 85% for the combat and it most definitely delivered.Of course, the game has its glaring flaws. The story is honestly quite lackluster for the latter part. As I was enjoying the world for the first few hours, experimenting with new spells and taking in sights I’d never seen before, the story was a nice vehicle to get me to my next destination/spell. Again, as someone with zero knowledge on Harry Potter and its universe, I was immersing myself quite handily for the first half of the game, learning things I’d never even heard or seen of before. Once you start to learn more about the world and familiarise yourself with the setting, however, the lack of choice in dialogue starts to wear itself thin. I was also excited to live a life as any student would in Hogwarts but your unique circumstances in the setting makes you feel less like a student and more of a vigilante who seeks out crime and punishes evil doers (and maybe attends school every now and then). It’s fun, exciting and certainly cinematic but you only really feel like a student for the first part of the game, where your worries are little and the stakes aren’t so in your face. You only visit each class maybe once or twice, learn a new spell then never do anything there for the rest of the game aside from gathering Field Guide pages (collectables). Despite all this, I’d still give this game a 7.5-8/10. It’s got a lot of charm in its world building and the tiny details honestly make up a lot of the overall score here. It’s rare to see a game polish their open world, decorations and small details to such an extent and it helped my immersion a lot for a good majority of the game. Seeing each different house get their own common room that you can explore (with a character in that same house, mind you) and have their own sidequests is such a treat. Hell, you can visit Azkaban for a short time if you pick the right house.At the time of writing this review, I’m level 34 and completed 67% of the challenges which I plan to turn into 100%. We’ll see if my rating of the game changes by then.~SPOILER: There is an additional scene for the main story that I see as a mini-epilogue. However, I learnt that you can only access this scene at level 34, which is ironically enough the level I was at when I defeated the final boss (I did a lot of exploring and sidequesting beforehand). So, the momentum from the final boss into this additional scene wasn’t lost and I was somewhat satisfied. However, I can imagine this scene falling a little flat if you aren’t level 34 by the time you get there and you have to grind out levels just to see a cutscene that didn’t really deliver an awful lot on its own. Not entirely sure why it’s level locked but it is what it is."

Though the environment and graphics are good, it is just ""lifeless"", it should be renamed to *""Sebastian's Legacy""* instead, as it was the only questline that made me play this game till the very end.For example (and with minimal spoilers) - Your character and ""someone"" else is running out of a place that is collapsing. They find something and instead of rushing, they just stand there. Looking dead in the face and hands clasped, they start talking about life instead of running!And the performance, OH MY GOD this is a stutter simulator (RTX 3060ti + R5 3600). I believe developers/testers just run stuff on flagships and don't even bother testing it even on recommended hardware.It might be good for the fanboys who adore Harry Potter, but not for everyone else like me. It is just too early to hail this as a GOTY and I would really love to see a better game than this one to sit on the 2023 GOTY throne, not out of hatred for this game, but the throne deserves something better and much more polished than this.6/10 - Not worth the price.If this is the GOTY, gaming is dead.

The game is not perfect but its a very good game.Combat is quite enjoyable, at lease on the hard difficulty there is some challenge and also the unique spell interactions with each other and also enemy type makes the combat very fun and more strategic.From a story point of view the writing is good and got me invested in the story but there were a lot of instance where it could have been better.As for performance, I had instances where there was staggering and also sometimes characters, mainly professor Fig, gets pixilated and stays that way even after restart which was quite odd.The world is beautiful, not Elden Ring beautiful but its close. However, Hogwards castle is nearly perfect, when exploring you feel how much work was put into its recreation and is very very close to the books and movies.To conclude, I really like the game and it surely is the best Harry potter related Game in existence (although in the recent years there wasn't any completion)  and its also a very solid RPG, would recommend.Edit: Review submitted after 100% completion with all Steam Achievements"

However, this game does suffer from open world syndrome, apart from the castle and villages the landscape isn't that enticing, mostly just hills and trees, the usual open world stuff, it all looks really good, just not exciting.Great, the spells all sound how you would expect them to sound and the explosions sound nice and heavy. The voice acting is pretty good here as well, especially with some of the goblins, there are however some repetitive voice lines that your character will repeat many times throughout your playthrough that get old quickly.The story is alright, It's pretty standard but engaging enough to keep you going, the game really shines through on some of the character side stories, specifically Sebastian and Poppy. I hope in the future we get more questlines like these two, they really display the creativity of the Hogwarts universe, interesting relics, spells, creatures, and relations.The gameplay here is solid, but is let down by some interesting systems. First off, the combat feels great, combing spells is fun and there is lots of room for mixing and matching, unfortunately the number of enemies is limited and the number of unique bosses even more so. The levelling in this game is okay at lower levels, but gets weird towards the end, you ONLY get exp through challenges, so after killing 100 spiders you will never get exp from killing a spider ever again, this means it's time to go collect some scrolls and do other open world stuff if you want to level up. If you want level 40 gear, then you need to max your collections. I'm not sure how I feel about this, I like the idea, but perhaps it could be tuned in the future.The open world activities are mostly pretty good, but it does feel like they ran out of time or ideas and just stared slapping merlin trials all over the place, I think you only needed 40 to finish the collection challenges, but there are a total of 95 in the world. Every time you finish a trial, you need to watch an 11-second cutscene, doing all 95 would equate to around 17 minutes of cutscene time, I will never know how this made it through testing, and to rub it in, the trials get old, and repetitive, after the first 10-15.   *pretty good story*Unique combat that is fun to master*Great audio*beautiful world*Some top tier sidequests*Default controller broom controls are awful*Weird levelling system*Too many merlin trials*Small enemy and boss variety Overall, I think the game is worth your money if you like open world games or the Harry Potter series. If you're not in that boat, then I would wait for a discount. Hogwarts and the villages look fantastic, the open world looks good but is pretty standard. The story is interesting enough to keep you engaged, levelling is broken towards the endgame   The game is worth your time, not bad, not amazing"

When you were growing up you dreamed of a game that could fufill so many of ideas of what a wizarding world game could be and this game does that and more. The story is probably the best thing in wizarding world since the og books. Combat is fun and engaging. The characters are amazing. I wish there was more side quests to engage with them more. DLC yes please.  Does it have it flaws sure but I cant say 100% that isnt cause my computer is a little older at this point but it never crashed which is great just a few graphic errors a couple of times nothing a reload of a same couldnt fix.  Overall its  recommend buying at full price game!
1513,MetaHusky,https://steamcommunity.com/id/metahusky/,2,,1,60.0,February,20,513,0,1,"it is in fact yet another open world game filled with side quests and many things to collect, but the exploration, mixed with surprisingly engaging combat and interesting quests makes it stand out from many others such as your typical ubisoft affair. it is refreshing to see a game that is finished with no microtransactions, that clearly had developers who cared and execs that arent pushy for a mess of a release.the performance could have been better (mostly around stuttering issues), and the game does suffer from ""too much dialogue"" syndrome, but it is overall a great game that you should experience"
1514,Phoenix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/foreverphoenix/,2,,1,58.6,February,21,304,0,1,"You may think this is a game about going to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry while enjoying some open world RPG extracurricular activities on the side.You would be wrong.This is a game about a fifteen-year-old sociopath. Though they have only just begun their first year at Hogwarts, they have, within their first week, mastered a sufficient number of spells to be undefeatable in combat.When they are not wiping the floor with battle-hardened dark wizards, Protagonist is routinely breaking and entering into private homes, stealing everything that is not nailed down. Why does no one react to being robbed blind in broad daylight you may wonder?I mean, what exactly do you expect people to do?Would you speak up if a murderous lunatic showed up in your place, a lunatic who, I should remind you, spends their time off burning poachers alive and smashing goblins into hard objects? A lunatic who has access to an ancient magic with which they can literally disintegrate you with the flick of a wrist?No, you stay quiet. You may laugh nervously. You comment on how Alohomora really is a neat little spell, and you pray that the insane person leaves your house as quickly as possible. You try to pretend that a shiver is not running down your spine as they beam at you happily after rifling through your underwear. You see, Protagonist is a high-functioning sociopath, perfectly capable of keeping up appearances in society. They really liked your grandmother’s old robes and they’re totally making off with them, but they’ll wish you a good day as they leave your house.Rumours spread in the Valley of a terrifying new evil with a cheerful voice and an unhealthy obsession with wild animals …///What I’m trying to say here is that the ludonarrative dissonance is real.The game also performs absolutely atrociously. Since early access the constant stutter has improved marginally, but it’s still extremely noticeable and disruptive. With my 3080 I had expected to be able to turn on RTX (while playing at 1440p), but that essentially makes the game unplayable. Further patches are necessary and I am wondering why no NVIDIA driver update for the game has dropped yet.Wait, is the “recommended” rating a mistake?It is not, actually. I adore this game! Like many others, I grew up with Harry Potter – reading the books, then watching the movies, and even though JKR has spectacularly ruined her own reputation, I still feel a great deal of nostalgia for this world.And Hogwarts Legacy delivers. It is the colours that are just right, it is the broom-flying, the nods and references, the sheer detail in Hogwarts castle. The story is nothing ground-breaking, but pretty decent. The side quests are not hugely boring. I actually like that the “puzzles” can be done in two minutes, it gives the game a nice flow. Combat is definitely fun. Hogwarts Legacy is hella cozy and I’m loving it.There are some gripes I still have with the game – the low amount of gear slots, the lack of interaction with the school, certain quests that are really dark in tone which none of the characters seem to acknowledge – but this is mostly nitpicking.Overall, Hogwarts Legacy is really good, actually. Who would have thought?"

The graphics are beyond anything i could have hoped for and goes a long way to really immersing you into this wizarding world. For me growing up with both the Harry Potter films and books, this game has brought a lot of my childhood dreams alive. I only hope they continue to work on this game, bringing out more content in the form of DLC and or a multiplayer mode to summarise my experience with this game i only need one word OUTSTANDING! i would 100% Recommend this game."
1523,Abjurae,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Abjurae/,2,,1,97.2,February,20,271,0,1,"Very detailed world design that makes the setting come alive, combat is much more fun than the generic systems might leave on first impression because the way spells combo off each other and the enemy and environmental design give the player many opportunities to use their kit in unique ways. Some of these aren't the most innovative (color matching spell types with different colored enemy shields) but others are more interesting (destroying a platform enemies are standing on so that they fall to their deaths, then repairing it to cross yourself, disarming an enemy while they charge a spell so that it backfires, transforming an enemy into an explosive barrel and then throwing it at another).The attention to detail keeps the core gameplay pretty fresh all the way through the main story, though it can get a little stale if you decide to go for 100% completion."
1524,eternal,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ph000nk/,2,,1,54.0,February,20,275,0,1,"Great gameplay, graphics and soundtrack. 8/10 Worth to buy.Apart from the PC performance issues on launch, good optimisation.It's super fun to makeup your own combos and jiggle your enemies in the air, push them off the cliffs or into voids, throw explosive barrels or even turn enemies into explosive barrel and then throw them into their friends.Traversing open world  feels smooth and fun on the broom, hippogrif, graphorn or even on foot. The world is beautiful and feels alive.The ""companion"" relationship quests are nice, sad you are not able to play with them all the time as they bring uniqueness which some of the quests lack. Being able to catch your own beasts and nurture them is very unique and brings a lot of fun to the gameplay.The gear system is uninspired but it gets the job done. You get your defence, offence stats and some minor boosts to your spells and defences.Story wise, I didn't yawn but I wasn't amazed either. It works, it takes you through the world and has interesting plot twists even if predictable sometimes. Side quests were fine, you have couple go to point A and comeback to point B. They are couple minutes long so it doesn't get boring. Others like mentioned are more in depth and bring joy as the ""companions"" are quite fun to listen to and watch their reactions. All together Hogwarts Legacy brings a surprise to 2023. After finishing the first Harry Potter games decades ago Hogwarts Legacy was able to bring back the joy, nostalgia and that feel of being lost in a wizard world almost perfectly."

The fact that the characters that everyone knows and loves are not in this game make it so much better. There's nothing to distract the player from themselves, you are the most important character in the this world.Gameplay: Fun and Intense - when you start out, just learned a few spells, don't quite have the controls down yet, its a nice challenge to play. The game becomes much more fulfilling to play when you start mastering combos, You feel powerful and its a very satisfying feeling.There are tons of secrets and farming style aspects to sink your teeth into, Stability: Great! Great average fps. I have some frame drops in heavily populated areas but they mostly smooth out. RTX on, mostly High/Ultra settings 5120x1440I had to remap my bindings to fit with how I have my mouse buttons set up for other games. I broke wingardium leviosa.

1558,Cheesy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ecrofria/,2,,1,56.1,February,18,631,0,1,"It's clear that Avalanche have put a lot of time and effort into making Hogwarts Castle very faithful to the source material. Exploring Hogwarts was an awesome experience, spamming Revelio every 5 seconds, the game encourages the player to explore Hogwarts, unlocking “You wouldn’t believe how inconvenient travel was before I invented Floo Powder!” (pls be quiet) allowing for the use of fast travelling, it just doesn't get old and I still keep bumping into corridors that eluded me, still finding new things. Besides the castle, the open world is absolutely stunnning. The world is pretty big, a lot of puzzles to be solved, caves to be explored, enemies to be culled and people to be helped. Each village you run into is never the same, somehow different each time, it never felt like a repeat of the previous village.I played on Normal difficulty to just test the waters, I must say the game isn't difficult, rather relatively Easy even after switching to Hard thinking that it would pose more of a challenge. I found myself always full on Potions and Plants, the combat is satisfying, finding and choosing spells that synergises with each other well allowing you to min max your combo's. Parrying and Dodging attacks are very easy to perform, as the game give you an indicator on whether to parry or dodge. There isn't much else to build your character, unless upgrading and putting traits on all your gear, nothing too ground breaking.The story is alright nothing too extravagant, you learn that your character can see traces of ancient magic which leads you on a path to pursue this calling, however there's a faction of goblins and their leader who are after the same thing, the knowledge of great magic that's only rumored to exist, very few people in the past knew of its existence and could wield it. The game presents sense of urgency while also intentionally slowing you down, but you can argue it is doing so for you to slowly master this magic and uncover the whole truth.Side-Quests, you have the usual fetch quests most of the time, which is carried by the setting of the world that made doing them interesting. I never felt annoyed doing a side quest that was simply ""deliver"" or ""find and bring"" as it had led me to discover new places each time, and again was carried by the setting of the world.Some Side-Quests are more convoluted and eventually lead you to what could be described as collectible chains. The game slowly introduces collectibles and series of puzzles for you to complete through side quests and it kind of feels natural. Though it sucked when a few collectibles were locked behind spells that you get through the main quests such as 'Alohomora'.Flying is pretty fun, screw fast travelling, though it feels slow for how big the map is (Yes I know you can upgrade your broom to go faster). Game places very few restrictions on where you can and can't fly, practically the whole world is traversable on a mount.Room of Requirement, very easily customisable, design the room however you want, and by exploring you can find more decor. One of the coolest things in the Room of Requirements is to be able to groom, feed and breed the many different beasts in the game.Beast catching, I found the best way to make money was to poach, sorry not sorry. I did keep a few beast in my Room of Requirements but all those Puffskeins, thanks for funding all the upgrades I ever needed. There are many types of beasts to catch and bring to the RoR out there in the world, some are easy to catch and some are harder.3 Game slots even though there's 4 houses? lolVoice pitch, yea dunno why it's a feature, just leave on default if you don't want your character to sound like an echoey robot.I recommend this if you like open world and action RPG games, a lot of things to find enjoyment in the game. This game isn't just for Harry Potter fans, but for everyone, this game is pretty much a HP Fan's wet dream, the game's not perfect, but still a good game nonetheless."

I have been anticipating this game for a number of years, ever since watching a leaked video of it, and being a massive fan of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, gives me a hard-on for playing it, as I'm sure any other fan gets one as well. There's only a few things that are missing imho, I.E.: becoming an animagus, a great number of spells that I have read about in Pottermore Lore, and Quidditch, but I'm sure those things will be added in the future with the inclusion of DLCs, at least that is my hope. I look forward to playing this more and more, since I will continue to have fun with it. Thank you Avalanche, and WB for all your hard work, and continued hard work."
1566,Incredibly average,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198162410567/,2,,1,49.9,February,17,144,0,1,"It's pretty good! I've seen a bit of most things this game offers and I can already tell it's well worth playing this title. It leans pretty heavily into both being ""experience"" and a little less on ""gameplay"", but does both at least decently well. This game must have also been a dream come true for technical artists. Magic means lots of pretty shaders. I can't judge the accuracy of the universe much because even though I did read some of the books, I'm not big into the franchise.The world is this very whimsical place where everyone is either really courteous or not - and in case the latter that usually hints at there being slightly more depth to them. It's a common trope in both the books and films, so I guess that translates well. The personalities are also accompanied by recognizable motifs to further enhance that feeling of being in this quirky yet mostly lovable wonderland. It does cut into more mature themes enough to cause tension.Graphically speaking the game looks good. It didn't blow me away however. The facial animations are good, but a little robotic at times. The animation blending often causes some really weird looking results as well. The environmental design is where Hogwarts Legacy really shines. The amount of detail found in the world are great - with little useless animations for various misc objects. I'd describe it as very ambitious but not groundbreaking in any way. Sound design is great. Implementation of spatial sounds seems good (even though audio is not often my main concern). The music is appropriate.Gameplay wise the game has some issues but does make a real attempt at being something noteworthy. It just doesn't quite reach in my opinion. The flow of the gameplay is fairly simple: you chain together spells according to the opponent's current weakness, while deflecting or avoiding incoming fire. The color coding is excellent (finally!) and the game does clearly visually convey what the challenge is. Parry options are clearly highlighted, and thus fix my number one concern with the Soulslikes; a tremendous amount of visual ambiguity that can only be combated with excessive experience. Unfortunately the game doesn't always flow perfectly and struggles with the camera at times. Actively aiming circumvents the need to auto-lock, but is extremely cumbersome to use. Auto-lock comes with your usual issues like different objects obscuring one another. The auto-lock is also very visually unclear, showing only a small white outline. This is unfortunate as the rest of the game does such a good job at communicating its intent. Swapping between spells also feels like it could have been done better. Of course being able to use 4 spells at a time is completely reasonable; any more and the game would become very difficult, or at least carpal tunnel inducing to play for KBM. I think swapping between the sets could have been streamlined a bit more however; perhaps with a circular wheel rather than another button. I'd save on three potential button presses.Combat itself also suffers being a little to static in my opinion. All fights I have encountered so far are a matter of ""repeat the same thing until you win"". Now there is quite a bit to unpack: the idea is to chain spells according to their inherent combos (casting the same spell), stun recovery and range - with some additional gimmicks later as I've heard. But once you get the routine down it kind of just repeats itself.My main gripe with the gameplay is the camera: there is absolutely no reason this game is third person from a design perspective. The only justification would be to show all the fancy animations. There is no cover mechanic involved and it adds nothing to the already boring stealth sections either. Unfortunately the result is Hogwarts legacy suffering the common problems associated with this camera: it often obscures your view by intersecting with geometry and makes things harder to read because your own character is constantly in the way. This hurts the game too, because I have already gotten hit several times because I couldn't see the parry indicator as it was obscured by terrain.Overall I can pretty confidently recommend Hogwart's Legacy - even though it did not wow me. It's certainly not on par with Elden Ring for example, but then again the target audiences are probably quite different anyway."

I will update my review later as I see fit, based on how I feel the more I play this game.🎮 --------------------------------Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world RPG. Similar to other games of the genre, you do things to gain exp and level up, which unlocks which areas you can go to, or which gear you can equip, etc.You've got the main story missions, as well as side quests, treasure puzzles, collectable items, and more. You can also ride your broom and have a pet of sorts. You can craft potions and learn recipes, and you can explore and find points of interest. There are collections that you fill out, like a fantasy version of a Pokedex, including receiving rewards, usually cosmetics that you can apply to your gear.Character creation is pretty nifty. It's not as customizable as some other games, but still enough that you can make your character look like you.🎵 --------------------------------The game sounds beautiful. The music is well-orchestrated, sound effects are well-designed, and the is fully voiced. Speaking of which, the voice acting is top notch for most characters (only a couple here and there that seemed a little bit off).⚔️ --------------------------------There are several difficulty levels you can choose from. I went with Normal, which feels well-balanced to me. If you want more of a challenge, you can really crank it up, and if you want to focus on story and exploration, you can definitely lower it quite a lot.📖 --------------------------------So far, the story feels like a standard fantasy story - main character is intercepted by an evil entity for a mysterious reason, and now is working to become stronger and face that foe later in order to save the world. It's nothing special, but it's not terrible, either. It's been adapted for the Harry Potter universe, of course, but it's still pleasant.🖥️ --------------------------------Honestly, once the game-ready drivers dropped in, the game has become buttery smooth. I am running the game on ultra and FSR 2 turned to Quality, and my framerate is 100-144 fps on average. No stuttering of any sort. Very few areas with framerate drops, which will most likely improve with future updates.My main specs as a reference are:- AMD 5600X- Sapphire Pulse 6800 XT- 32 GB 3600 Mhz RAM🏞️ --------------------------------This game is beautiful. It's not hyper-realistic, but it's more than realistic enough that it feels immersive. You can see the texture of the materials, and the skin blemishes. And the animations feel realistic as well. They're not janky or awkward. The studio did a fantastic job working on making the world look and feel alive.🪲 --------------------------------This game just recently came out, so there are a few minor bugs here and there, and maybe a rare crash when it compiles the shaders at the start. There will be plenty of updates and patches to take care of any bugs and issues."

1569,Yaoyao ♥,https://steamcommunity.com/id/babyoling/,5,,0,75.9,February,17,27,0,1,"It's marketed as an open-world RPG but it's really not. Exploration is highly repetitive and the combat/gear/progression systems are not well-designed. There's also not much room for personalisation, no morality system and none of the dialogue choices actually matter, so as a result you can't really relate much with the main character throughout. In a nutshell, it delivers the basics of what is expected of a game set in the HP universe, but there's a lot of wasted potential as an open world RPG. If there's going to be a sequel to this, I hope it can be developed by a studio who's more experienced in designing RPGs."
1570,bananas,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097391566/,2,,1,35.7,February,17,256,0,1,"There are things this game is, and there are things this game is not.This game is not a proper RPG, it doesn't feature interesting dialogue choices, a branching storyline, or different endings based in your decisions throught the game. The ""RPG mechanics"" such as character stats, upgrading/enchanting gear, crafting, trading, exploring, etc are very VERY basic and uninteresting. Combat is ok, it is better than what I thought It would be (tbh, when I first saw the trailers I thought the combat was going to be trash) but it is  very easy even in the highest difficulty. This game is clearly meant for casual players, it is constantly handholding you, telling you where to go next and displaying markers for everything. So if you expect a challenging game or a fleshed out RPG experience you will get kinda disappointed.What this game is, is a Harry Potter simulator/fantasy, and it is very good at being just that. You play as a ""chosen one"" type character, a Hogwarts student that has innate powers no one else has, and who's quest is to save the world against the impending forces of evil, of course. Never seen that one before.What this game really excels at is in its world design and art direction. Hogwarts and Hogsmead are really well done, with tons of very neat details and references to the source material. You really feel as if you are there, exploring in the HP universe. Sadly, this level of detail and nuance doesn't really exist outside the two aforementioned areas. The rest of the world is awfully generic and boring. The ""dungeons"" (apart from the ones you go for the main questline) are just empty caves with a chest, and the enemy roster is pretty lacking.The open world is one of those ""collection checklist"" type of worlds, with a lot of collectibles and repeating puzzles.If this game was not set up in the HP universe I would probably not recommend it. However, as it is, it is the ultimate Harry Potter fantasy game. It brings to life the magic of the HP world in a way no other game does, and for that, I recommend it. In truth, there are a lot of fun things to distract yourself with, like exploring Hogwarts Castle and discovering its secrets, capturing and collecting beasts, decorating your room, or just flying around with your broom.It is a fun game and it does really well what is supposed to do, which is bringing to life the HP world. No quidditch thou.I would give it a 8/10."

I'm in the 30th hour so far, and 29% complete, and I think I did everything pretty darn fast.- Very forgiving if you just follow the story, you can literally press random combos and not know the first thing about it and you can still succeed.- The game can be a little dull and tedious in the beginning.- Lots of stuff to remember and learn, if you're not keen on 100+ different combos to learn, this can be quite daunting and exhausting.- The menu system can be utterly confusing, it's pretty obvious it was made for a controller and not foremost a keyboard, this can be super frustrating, it took me hours into the game realizing I need to press ""G"" to use the healing potions, and it took me even longer to understand the value of upgrading clothes with the loom.- If you're suffering from a bit of misophonia like me, then the repetitive music can be annoying in the long run.- The dialogue CAN be a little bit of a long stretch for impatient people, you know that friend you have that goes ON and ON about the LEAST interesting things in life, well - there's a lot of those here, and just like real life there's no SKIP button for that. If your keyboard comes with a """" function, then USE IT! You're gonna find yourself in a hectic spider battle randomly switching spell menues while franticly pressing 1,2,3 and 4, Q, R and mouse clicking aka bullet-hell, so during the heat of the battle, you will no doubt encounter your windows menu helping your enemies to defeat you. Other than that, this is the game your friends will be talking about the next 14 days, and then it's gonna be legendary. You need a ton of patience, good memory, lots and lots of energy, finger muscles and you def. need to stop talking about this game to your friends if you want to keep them."

But i will not forgive not having quidditch in this game they did great broom handling mechanics yet couldn't be bothered to implement quidditch, that's a big nono, plus for £60 it's taken me 28 hours to 98% the game, but  i can't give a negative review because the positives outdo the negatives, and the bugs a pretty non-existent, overall maybe it's nostalgia i don't know."

This game has numerous things to do right out of the gate. The amount of hours I have spent in the Room of Requirements alone is unbelievable. There is so much customization not only for your character but for your very own Room of Requirement.The only downsides I have ran into this far is the lack of dialogue in various conversations with the NPCs. There is very limited lines that appear, I would also like for a way to pause cut scenes. Especially the longer ones since being a father I have to randomly step away and would likely miss an important conversational topic.Other than those two things this game is hands down a game changer in the world of the RPGs and I would give this game a solid 9.5/10."

Ruined castles, magical forests with weird alien creatures, fun  and engaging characters (with whom you'll actually start to care about), and there is even a dragon.  But where this game really shines is the music. I personally feel that Hogwarts music and ambience is of a cinematic quality that I haven't  heard in a game in a long time. It should be highly praised for it. When flying a hippogriff, you can actually feel you character taking part in a flight montage. Its *Chefs kiss* perfect.Overall, if you go into this game expecting some hard core gaming, you're going to be disappointed. But if you go in just to have a good time with some Harry Potter spells, engaging characters, and a fun main story, you're absolutely going to love it."

You come to a place and just steal everything. I don't mind the many Bugbogs, but you can't even talk to people. Thought it to be a RPG. The World is ostentatious, detailed and beautiful, thoughEdit after playthrough:Pros:- very good story- good gameplay- the extremely detailed World- Poppy :-)Contras:- NPCs less responsive than rocks (As you can sometimes destroy rocks that's actually no exaggeration)- No school activities apart from a bit of flying and that summoning game. Lessons are mostly cutscenes. No feasts or other things happening at Hogwarts. Even the O.W.L. exams are just a cutscene.- no ""sell all"" button... really? do your homework devs!- game is way to easy, was totally overpowered after half of the game"

As a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise, I was really excited to play this game and I was not disappointed. It really captures the magical and immersive world of Hogwarts, and it's so much fun to explore.The graphics and sound effects are absolutely stunning, and they really add to the overall experience. I loved the attention to detail and the way that the game stays true to the books and movies while also introducing new and exciting elements.One of my favorite things about the game is the gameplay itself. I loved being able to attend classes and learn spells, and the quests were really challenging and fun to complete. The combat is also really engaging and adds an extra layer of excitement to the game.I want to give a huge shoutout to the developers for creating such an incredible game. It's clear that they put a lot of love and care into every aspect of the game, and it really shows. I think anyone who is a fan of Harry Potter or just loves adventure games in general will absolutely love this game.In summary, if you're looking for an amazing and immersive gaming experience, then you definitely need to check out Hogwarts Legacy. It's an incredible game that is sure to provide you with hours of fun and excitement."
1632,PureFallen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Laquedem/,2,,1,58.7,February,14,77,0,1,"Review contains slight spoiler in favor of giving you advice in case you decide to play it.The amount of bugs are surprisingly low for a Triple A game released this days (kinda like how it should be..).The few bugs that you can stumble into are usually reverted quickly by loading one of the Autosaves that happen everytime you enter a new room, area, or all few minutes.Battlesystem is better than many had expected. There is strategy adjustments you can do for every enemy(type), yet after a certain time you may end up looking yourself to search for a generic combo for them all.Lots of Lore Accuracy and Insiders for those who watched the movies *and* did read this books. This is the closest of proper execution the franchise has seen so far.Sadly, the game does many mistakes of the recent generation of Open World Games.Rather than risking to have an empty Open World, the world is filled with a shietton of repetitive tasks with Checklists, which may end up becoming a grind at a certain point and will cover the broad majority of your roughly 50 hours playtime.Enemies scale with you that defeats the purpose of the Levelsystem if not for your Skilltree. However, there are more Skills to choose than Points obtainable and no way to re-assign them, so once you unlock the ""Talents"", you may already want to plan your 35! Skillpoints ahead in time. Whenever you going to use Dark Magic or not in your playthrough may be a decision you already do there.The equipment you find also scales with you, so when you explore to much in the Earlygame, you may run out of gear to find and use in the Endgame. Always wearing the best items to find and then using the ""Change Appearance"" Option (which is rather hidden in the Gear Menu) is recommended, as well as of rushing Side Quests and Main Quests as soon as possible.Overall: If you like the Franchise or the recent trend of Open World Games, it might be giving a shot. If you already did not like how for example AC: Valhalla handled their Open World, it is probably best to be avoided."

Ever since my childhood after reading the magic chronicle I have been waiting for a game to put my hopes and dreams into reality. Seeing the intro to the game alone turned me back into a child, my nostalgia was hitting peaks wandering around the castle. The developers took the words off the pages and made a mystical and magical universe for us to wander and explore. A mixture of exceptional graphics and animations used to make a fantastic looking world for people of all ages to get lost in. From petting animals and feeding them to gaining materials and exploring the dangerous roads and caverns across the world. The game offers a little for everyone no matter the age. The attention to detail in the game is extraordinary, the castle is a 100% representation of the way we remember it from the pages. Filled with little trinkets from the movies for us all to find and enjoy. From the darkest dungeons of the Slytherin house to the moon lit common room of Ravenclaw the player can get lost chasing all the collectables, get ready for the dings they never end. But the game isn’t all fun there are some challenges with puzzle rooms and difficult bosses that will teach you how to use all your tools effectively to let you progress through the amazing story line. The game is filled with amazing side quests to keep you busy and levelling to get you ready for those long hard story line quests. This game is very easy to lose track of time in you find yourself not doing much just flying around the world either enjoying the scenery or just chasing a Fwooper or two or maybe even searching and breaking into the many different places to find the many and many collectables . There is no real way to play this game just do as you please, the open world is amazing and with little to no issue from day one release.  You can choose who you want to be either the good guy or the masterful dark wizard, the world is your oyster. Plus what other game lets you flip a cow and reward you for it. Gameplay wise the game runs smoothly with little to no issues depending on your system of course. The game can be a little demanding with all the amazing graphics. Definitely recommend playing this game with a controller as the targeting system and change of spells is much easier on the controller. The fights are really smooth and fun as every spell makes you feel like you’re the most powerful person in the world, even though that is not the case at all. You get to make the choice if you want to use the DARK magic or not, it’s all down to the witch or wizard. My only wish is that you should be punished for using the THREE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES but rant over.  Just hope you don’t have a fear of spiders cause they are everywhere from wandering the lands to caves and caverns filled with hairy eight legged pests. Overall the game is well worth the money, you will get hours and hours of enjoyment and a little frustration. Enjoy the wonderful world of the WIZZARDS and the many many cats that roam the world and castle."

A lot of effort has been put into this, the setting and world design especially. In a lot of ways it really is a great game. I sincerely hope they continue to improve and add more things to the game in the future. That said, there's a  on PC with Hogwarts Legacy. I'm using an RTX 3060 TI: meaning for the lower tier graphic card it is especially noticeable. - Task manager interestingly shows 0% GPU usage when the game is running. If I go back to the desktop, the GPU usage goes up. Task manager isn't a good place to look for your real usage however.- So using MSI Afterburner, I could see that my gpu stayed around 40-50% usage in all areas of the game. This is a major issue. Your gpu usage should generally be around 90% for the smoothest game experience (this is common in all other games), yet the port Avalanche Software has made is poor. The game is virtually bug-free and quite fantastic, but this is a huge issue. I cannot smoothly run the game on the graphics I want without issues.I want to wholeheartedly recommend the game. But I simply can't ignore it. If anyone has a lesser graphics card than I do, you will have major problems running the game smoothly."

Para un Gamer, te queda corto y notas que no tiene mucha profundidad y realmente es bastante sencillo y simple, lo que te deja con un sinsabor y ganas de que hubiera sido mejor porque tiene mucho potencial.PROS:- El Combate a mi parecer es bastante bueno, da oportunidades y combos.- Ambientacion es increible, te sientes hasta cierto punto en la pelicula. (si no fueran por los NPC tan simples, seria 10/10).- Buen Soundtrack.- Tan Basico que es bueno para No-Gamers y nuevo publico que le gusta harrypotter.CONTRAS:- NPcs muy pobres y no puedes interactuar con 99% de ellos, y aparecen y desaparecen en las noches.- Movimiento y saltos del personaje bastante raros y paredes invisibles por todos lados, lo que hace que no se sienta como un Mundo Abierto.

I was thinking i would learn more.-I feel like Puzzles should scale with game difficulty or something. Blasting through the puzzles but combat on hard was a great challenge i enjoyed every time i bested an enemy i couldn't defeat.-Was thinking there would be more Enemies. A lot feel copy and pasted with minor things between types.-Was very disappointed to see the copy paste bosses in the ""trials"" as there are so many monsters in the HP universe they could have brought into the game.-More dungeons and secrets are really needed.Overall the gameplay and world are a 8-9/10 story is a 3/10 maybe lessIf this game took some pointers and went for souls like elden ring type game then this would be something to play for years to come. bosses and mobs should really vary and make you guess on whats nextright now the replayability is really low."

I kept getting distracted just staring at paintings and looking at the architecture of the castle and Hogsmeade. It has a lot of potential and I hope they expand the game and make it a huge thing with expansions and stuff. They should definitely invest more on puzzles/secrets since the combat can be quite simple (yet satisfying and responsive).Exploring and finding stuff is what kept me moving around. Revelio is kind of OP for that purpose but still fun nonetheless. The Castle is MASSIVE and it's pretty much easy to get lost or just walk in circles without noticing. The music is also something to be noted. The sense of adventure and the first time you fly your broom are really magical. The essence of the Harry Potter universe is totally in the game. All that being said, the enemy variety is kinda meh. It kinda gave me the same feeling I had when I played Immortals Fenyx Rising. Exploring and discovering puzzles was fun. Combat was there to change the pacing a bit but the exploration and finding pieces of lore was where the fun was at.Anyways, Great game for the fans out there. Hopefully we get to see some Azkaban expansion where you have to catch fugitives or whatever. Go after fantastic beasts or even have like big conflicts between the houses. Who knows. Possibilities are there."

1664,Alfie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/alfie/,2,,1,36.0,February,14,349,0,1,"If you're a Harry Potter fan, this is a must play. From the music to the combat, it makes for an incredibly immersive experience where you feel like you're living in that magical world. If you're not a Harry Potter fan, it's a mixed bag of a game. Visuals/music aside, it's an average AAA RPG with a fun  combat system and a decent enough story to keep things interesting (although it's slow going at the start). This game is very clearly a console port which is fine, but it sometimes makes the menus feel clunky to navigate with keyboard/mouse. If you enjoy using a controller, this game is ideal (I suspect this is an excellent fit for the steamdeck once we get some performance patches).The world is large and very atmospheric. It's full of character & charm with areas you can instantly recognise from the films. It is however plagued with generic repeatable exploration tasks, similar generic caves/""bandit"" camps and generic fetch quests. They're fun initially, but the monotony sets in quite quickly - it could have done with a bit more variety. My only real negative gripe with the game is that your decisions do not matter, which makes for little to no replayability. There's no point in being an ""anti-hero"" as the dialogue and overall story/outcomes make you ""the hero"" no matter what you do. The real crux of the problem for me is that the player character's spoken dialogue and general attitude/behaviour throughout the game are entirely at odds with any ""anti hero"" choice presented in side quests etc. The developers clearly wanted the game to be played a certain way; the rest is just smoke & mirrors which is a little disappointing.So overall, pick it up when it's discounted if you're a non-harry potter fan. It's certainly worth a play."

Wow, imagine that in 2023. Buying a complete game at launch? Heretical. But, this is the real deal. The story is great, the gameplay is phenomenal, the side quests are brilliant, and guess what? You actually earn costumes and skins by playing the game and completing challenges. In 2023, micro-transactions are everywhere. However, you can earn everything in the game simply by playing the game. I cannot believe we've come so far in the gaming scene where the concept of earning things by playing the game and not through micro-transactions is groundbreaking. Hogwarts Legacy is such a breath of fresh air in that regard. I'd recommend it on that fact alone."

Nobody cares that you're a student wondering during the night; nobody really cares if you casting spells at students or teachers; and nobody cares if you break into locked rooms/buildings. Breaking into restricted areas was acted as such a big deal within quests.

1698,turbodimon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/turbodimon/,2,1,0,53.6,February,13,304,0,1,"Очень посредственная игра в открытом мире в оболочке гарри поттера. Если вы фанат, то наверно будете в восторге, а если вселенная не импонирует или вы к ней равнодушны, то можно проходить мимо этой игры. 9/10 тут никаких нет, игра на 6-7/10. 1. Совершенно типовой открытый мир, как и в другой AAA параше, выходившей за последние пару лет. Задания уровня ""сходи вот сюда, убей 10 пауков, вернись обратно"". Единственное отличие в том, что на карте нет миллиона вопросов, доп.задания открываются, когда ты находишься вблизи NPC, который его выдает (вблизи это пару километров). 2. Идиотская система получения заклинаний. Казалось бы, ты ученик хогвартса, наверно было бы прикольно осваивать заклинания, ходя на соответствующие занятия. Ну, оно так и есть, только проблема в том, что для освоения этих заклинаний тебе нужно выполнить дебильное задание из 1 пункта, а потом прийти на занятие, посмотреть кат.сцену, и выучить это заклинание. Господи, как же меня это достало под конец.3. Этот пункт вытекает из второго. ДОП.ЗАДАНИЯ НЕ ЯВЛЯЮТСЯ ДОП.ЗАДАНИЯМИ. В начале игры тебе ясно дают понять, что основные задания помечаются желтым маркером, а дополнительные - серым. Но, по мере прохождения, оказывается, что это не так. Под конец игры я уже четко сформировал себе набор скиллов, которые мне по нраву, и больше мне уже ничего и не нужно было. Но почему-то я перестал получать задания. Сначала подумал, что дело наверно в механике игры, когда новые задания ты получаешь через почту (об этом позже). Но оказалось, что доп.занятие не являются дополнительными! Вновь продолжить прогресс по сюжету я смог только после того как выполнил сраное задание на получение флиппендо (который мне вообще не всрался) и после того как выполнил задание на размножение каких-то зверей, похожих на маленьких драконов, уже даже забыл как они называются, чето на Ф. Почему игра заставляет  меня выполнять дополнительные, неинтересные для меня, задания, при этом ясно дав понять в начале, что они дополнительные?4. Совершенно идиотская система снаряжения. Цвета снаряжения в этой игре не имеют никакой значимости, тут нет смысла и интереса искать какую-то крутую легендарную вещь. В этой игре ты тупо апгрейдишь циферки, при чем под конец я уже вообще перестал менять снаряжение, потому что эти циферки на уровне погрешности. Уже в начале игры ты находишь легендарную вещь, у которой скажем, нападение 10. Чуть позже в следующем подземелье ты находишь зеленую вещь, у которой нападение 12, меняешь на нее. На этом построена вся система снаряжения и так происходят апгрейды на протяжении всей игры. Много профита от +2 к нападению? Нет. Спасибо хоть, что трансмог завезли, но, к сожалению, трансмог не привязали к слоту, а к конкретному предмету. То есть, когда ты надеваешь новую вещь, трансмог сбрасывается и тебе приходится настраивать его заново.5. Летание на метле. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, ну как можно было запороть такой важный элемент игры? А заключается косяк в том, что разработчики зачем-то налепили на локациях ТОННУ зон, в которых запрещен полет. При чем, это не объяснено никак лором, а скорее какими-то техническими причинами. Как же меня это задолбало под конец. В одном месте ты успешно пролетаешь через гору, а в следующем месте пролететь над горой ты не можешь, потому что БЕСПОЛЕТНАЯ ЗОНА. С какого фига она там бесполетная? Это не хогсмид, это просто гора, через которую я хочу срезать путь, но нет, так решили разработчики, и тебе приходится облетать эту гору другим путем, при чем это не всегда просто сделать, так как КАЖДЫЙ РАЗ когда ты садишься на метлу, с радара пропадает GPS навигация до цели. Казалось бы не критично, ты же на метле, просто лети к маркеру, но это невозможно как раз таки из-за бесполетных зон. Под конец игры были моменты, когда мне приходилось слезать с метлы и бежать пешком, потому что так хотя бы тебя за руку ведут путем, который можно пройти, а на метле этот путь порой бывает крайне трудно найти из-за бесполетных зон и из-за того, что с радара пропадает путь до цели, а открывать каждый раз карту, чтобы увидеть каким путем все таки можно пролететь, очень затруднительно из-за долгих анимаций неспешно открывающейся книги.6. Боссы/мини-боссы. Это кошмар и позорище. Через пару десятков игры и с обычными-то врагами уже наскучивает разбираться, так как к этому времени у тебя же сформирован набор скиллов, и каждый раз ты выполняешь одни и те же действия. Но боссы это какой-то новый уровень идиотизма. Вонючие тролли, например. Что они из себя представляют? Это враг, у которого есть всего 4 атаки (от двух можно только уклониться, остальные две можно парировать), у которого в десяток раз больше хп, чем у рядового врага, и против которого твои способности не наносят ни черта урона. С какой целью делать такого босса? Видимо, чтобы искусственно удлинить игровой процесс, другого объяснения нет. Я испытывал боль от каждой схватки с троллями: угрозы они не представляют никакой, это не секиро, уклоняться и парировать тут не составляет никакого труда, но твоему времени угрозу они представляют достаточно серьезную. Бой с троллем занимает минут 5-10, без преувеличений, все эти минуты состоят из монотонных действий, когда ты уклоняешься и парируешь, и между этим кастуешь на него весь набор своих скиллов, потом долбишь его дефолтным заклинанием и ждешь кулдауна скиллов, и так пока хп не упадет до 0. Тоже самое касается остальных боссов/мини-боссов, они тут называются ""Печально известные враги"". Название в принципе оправдано, печально известны они совершенно идиотским гейм-дизайном. Нет, чтобы называть врага боссом, недостаточно сделать ему миллион хп.7. Элемент веселого фермера. Спасибо этой игре, она вернула меня в 2010 год. Чуваки завезли в игру про гарри поттера механики из веселого фермера: тебе надо варить траву и зелья, чесать и кормить животных, чтобы с них упали ресурсы, необходимые для прокачки снаряжения (бесполезная прокачка, которая мало на что влияет), и самый прикол в том, что время на варку и кулдаун на следующее выпадение какого-нибудь пера из животного идет В РЕАЛТАЙМЕ. В игре есть механика пропуска времени, когда твой протагонист просто ложится спать на пол, тем самым меняя цикл день-ночь или ночь-день. Так вот, механика пропуска времени не работает на элементы веселого фермера. Если зелье варится 15 минут, то ты ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ будешь ждать реальные 15 минут своего времени. Господи, спасибо за cheat engine, который позволяет ускорить игру в 5000 раз и пропустить это недоразумение.8. Отсутствие рпг механик. В этой игре нет ничего от рпг, кроме создания персонажа в начале. Но это не твой протагонист, это заранее собранный за тебя персонаж, отыгрыша в игре никакого. По-моему разрабы до выхода игры говорили, что можно отыграть темного мага и вообще выборы на что-то влияют - так вот, нет, отыгрывать тут никого нельзя и выборы ни на что влияет, более того - выборов тут нет. Что из себя представляют выборы в 100% случаев в этой игре: ты убил 10 кабанов, пришел обратно к NPC, он задает вопрос ""ну что, дашь мне эти шкуры?"", на что у тебя есть два варианта ответа: ""Да, конечно, держи"" или ""Да, держи, но ты мне должен заплатить"". Ну это уже просто смешно, насколько жалкая эта ""система выборов"". Не знаю, может разрабы действительно считают, что выбирая второй вариант ты типа отыгрываешь злого персонажа, но нет, это не так. Касательно злого персонажа, в конце игры тебе типа дают сделать ""злой"" выбор, но, во-первых, он ВООБЩЕ НИ НА ЧТО НЕ ВЛИЯЕТ, и во-вторых, смотрится это совершенно неуместно, потому что на протяжении всей игры твой персонаж ВСЕГДА за все хорошее и против всего плохого, этот выбор в конце просто-напросто смотрится по-идиотски. Дописал бы еще пару пунктов, но к сожалению достиг лимита символов на обзор"
1699,Naraldeth,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003886614/,2,,1,17.2,February,12,418,0,1,"The game is not amazing by any stretch of the imagination. It's very basic in it's execution of combat, mission variety, enemy variety etc. The talents are absolutely useless. As far as an RPG goes it's not very intuitive either, you can either play goody-two shoes wizard, or slightly less goody-two shoes wizard. There aren't multiple endings, choices don't mean anything, house selection doesn't mean anything, you don't get dark spells until right at the very end of the game and even then you can only use said spells on pre-selected enemy varieties and can't go round 'blasting' every wizard you see like all the media outlets were hyping you up to believe. Flying controls are kinda crap too.The graphics are phenomenal and the world building is where the game really shines. Hogwarts has been meticulously crafted into a sprawling labyrinth  The combat for the first 10 hours is fun, after that you pretty much fall into 'simon says' style combat - Enemy puts up a purple shield, hit them with a purple spell, puts up a yellow shield, hit them with a yellow spell. It's all very basic.It's still worth the play and there's lots to do, even if the 'lots to do' is mostly running around finding obnoxious amounts of collectables that don't really reward the players time. If your an RPG fan, you've seen it all before and the game will introduce nothing new to you, you may enjoy it as a time sink in a wizard power fantasy.If you're a HP fan you'll also probably be obsessed.Looking at the game objectively through a lens it's a 7 or an 8/10 at the absolute best, but i've no doubt that many will be rating it a 10 purely on the namesake."

If you are a potterhead/gamer since the childhood looking to live your life as a student in the Wizarding World and the castle of Hogwarts, then this is the game for you!PROS:- Story/Narrative is well thought out.- Graphics are insane/new gen high effort.- The amount of details in the castle, let alone the world outside the castle, is insane.- Combat is actually good when you put effort in the combos.- Enemy variety is not bad.- Exploration/side stuff doesn't feel like a hassle.- Immersion/atmosphere is amazing.- Customization is great.- A lot of content overall.CONS:- Optimization/Early access fps drops in certain areas around the castle.- Dialogue felt emotionless.- Lacked mini boss variety in the side content.- Cutscene camera work felt repetitive.- The music becomes not in theme sometimes.- Crashed once.- Sometimes your choices really does not matter (maybe changes dialogue but nothing else).I strongly recommend the game whether you watched Harry Potter or not.

1728,Guac,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Guac4Lif3/,2,,1,13.1,February,12,54,0,1,"I don't usually write genuine reviews, but this game I actually feel pretty strongly about. I'm not going to touch on the controversy regarding it either. This game has a lot of problems. Its story is horrid. It has the qualities of most Harry Potter stories - plot holes, needless wish-fulfillment fantasy, flimsy world building. But, despite this, Harry Potter succeeds because it has charming and lovable characters. This game doesn't have that. Everybody praises the main character for flimsy reasons. Here's an example: At one point in the story, we attend our first day of Beast's Class. One of the side characters, a girl who is obsessed with animal, continually praises us for being so good with animals - even though we've only brushed them and fed them. Then, when a Slytherin laughs at her, and we very blandly say ""that's not funny"", she shows us a secret which she's never shown anybody else! Which is strange, not just because we're a bland, uninteresting self-insert of a main character, but because we barely know each other at all. I've probably had two interactions with her outside of this, and all of a sudden she's showing me something she's never shown anybody else before! That's ludicrous! And the entire story is written like this! Even the teacher praises us for being so good. Is it because everybody else around us is so wildly incompetent that we come out on top? To the player's knowledge, we have little training outside of Hogwarts, besides a few tips given to us by the professor to ""catch us up to speed"", since we're transferring in as a 5th year (which also isn't given any explanation). You could say our massive aptitude to all of this is due to our secret ability to see ancient magic, but I just don't buy that - because besides our power, that doesn't make us likable. We're a bland protagonist with no character traits other than being nice. That's not all though. It's an ""open world"" game, but I have interest to explore the world. Because, see, most open world games have a plot driven by the world itself. That's what makes their worlds so intriguing, because we need to explore and become more powerful to progress. Games like Breath of The Wild, and Elden Ring, where the player needs to progress through the world, overcome trials, and sometimes just vere off to do something completely unrelated to the main storyline, that's what makes open world games so enticing. That you can get lost in it, and just become absolutely captured by the beauty of the world and what it has to offer. The world drives the game forward, and the plot is built around that fact. Not this game, though. This game is structured a lot more similarly to games like Spiderman PS4. That game was fantastic. The movement was amazing, the characters were decently fun, and the story was enough to keep you playing. In this game, the world is arguably more interesting than Spiderman PS4, but I have no reason  to want to explore it. You just play main storyline quests and have no reason to play the boring side quests or explore the boring world. I will say this though. The world is absolutely gorgeous. I don't say that lightly. It is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. The combat is excellent as well. It's one thing which kept me playing the game. It's really well polished, incredibly fun, and it's very intuitive. The stealth sections as well! One of the first quests in the game is a mission where you sneak into the restricted section of the library with Sebastian (the best character). The level is a joy to play, it was really fun. The world really needs to be appreciated, but another criticism I have of the game is that you unlock things far too slowly. I wasn't able to fly around on a broom till I was about 20% of the way through the quests. Until then, I was forced to use the horrid fast travel system in the game. The fast travel system is absolutely awful. There are too many fast travel points for one, it makes exploring completely pointless. For two, the quests often require you to go back and forth from multiple locations, so you're forced to go through loading screen after loading screen for boring fetch quests. And it's such a shame because the broom flying is one of the best parts of the game. Once I unlocked it, I seldom used the fast travel system at all, because flying is just so much better. Despite all this, I recommend this game, because despite the fact that I find the game pretty bad in a lot of aspects, there is polish and beauty to this game. If the game were awful, I would've stopped playing it, and I wouldn't have reviewed it. I'd honestly give it a 7/10, maybe a 6. But one thing is for sure, it's not worth $60. Wait for a sale. $40 or less? Buy it. I recommend it. But at full price? There are so many better games out there."
1729,ArtMagus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtMagus/,2,,1,81.7,February,12,141,0,1,"Despite all the controversy surrounding this game, I can’t express how much I LOVE it. It is a masterpiece of love and dedication to the wizarding world. As an artist, I understand how Art must be judged separately from the artist. Rowling has some terrible ideas that are objectively harming people. That being said, this game was made by an enormous team of people that have nothing to do with that, and who put genuine love into this creation. I know it has its flaws and some elements that drive controversy but I hope people can set that aside and know that you are not a bad person for playing this game. You are not a bad person for loving the wizarding world despite what some people say. Stories are a reflection of ourselves and humanity has plenty of flaws that will show plainly in the stories we make. Hopefully, those stories can teach us to be better people in the face of those flaws but that isn’t always the case. This game has many positive and inclusive stories that shine above any of its less-than-sterling shortcomings. So with that rant out of the way, this game is SO MUCH FUN. I haven't had this much fun with a game in a long long time. Not only that, I can't think of enough words to say just how boundlessly beautiful it is. This is the Hogwarts that all of us who grew up with the wizarding world in our hearts dreamt of for so many years. There is only one thing I want. Only one thing I NEED. They need to make this Hogwarts into a multiplayer virtual reality experience!!!!!! I’m Deadly serious. I want to walk down these halls and genuinely feel like I'm there.

From what I have seen of the main quest and side quests so far, it's exciting, well written and keeps you engaged. The characters feel alive and even random NPCs got interesting banter when you pass them. Despite the game being set in the 1890s, there are some familiar faces and names around, so keep an eye open. Even though I am rather early on in my gameplay, this game certainly meets a lot of expectations. Edit:"

1757,Frith Ra,https://steamcommunity.com/id/frithra/,2,,1,45.9,February,12,275,0,1,"First off, I know that for some this game's mere existence is divisive. But I chose not to let the beliefs and actions of the author of the source material overshadow what Avalanche Software set out to do. This is a project clearly made by fans for fans. It demonstrates passion, creativity, and innovation. All while not employing predatory monetization practices that plague the industry of late. This is the kind of game that needs to be encouraged, not shunned.Hogwarts Legacy is an absolutely sprawling RPG with so much to do. I'd honestly compare the scale of it to something like Skyrim. While the Hogwarts castle itself has plenty to explore and discover it goes so much further than that once you get out into the larger world around the school itself. It paces itself in a way where you gradually unlock more aspects of the game as you progress through the story so as not to overwhelm the player with everything at once. It rewards exploration and experimentation. Even when you find things you can't interact with or complete just yet you know that later on you'll have a reason to go back and see what rewards are waiting for you.There's also so much customization in this game. While the character creation is perhaps a bit limited by the lack of facial sliders you still get some decent options to be roughly the kind of witch or wizard (or even a blend of both) you want to be. Throughout the game you find and unlock various clothing styles and very early on get the ability to change the appearance to any other style you've previously collected. No looking like you walked through a wizarding thrift store just to have the best stats. You even get to choose the style of your wand and find different styles of wands for it. You get to find different kinds of brooms to ride. Then later when you unlock the Room of Requirement you get to customize that space freely with all kinds of decorations that you find as you explore the world.I could likely go on and on about everything I've discovered in the game but even with my 30 hours in at the time of writing I feel as though I've only just scratched the surface. While all of the side content and exploration is of course optional, the benefits to completing as much as you can make the whole experience that much more enjoyable. Managing to 100% complete this game will be a feat unto itself so you can expect dozens if not hundreds of hours to go into a single play-through. To put it simply, this is one of the best open-world RPGs I've played in quite some time. Hogwarts Legacy shows proper respect to what the books established whilst also putting its own twists on the wizarding world at large as it tells its own story. It is simultaneously a love letter to fans and a standalone experience people who have no experience with Harry Potter could possibly find themselves getting invested in.Avalanche Software has created something truly special with this game. If you are on the fence, please don't let others make you feel as though you cannot give it a try. This game is a very different interpretation and makes every possible effort to have something for everyone. The work the developers have put into this should be acknowledged for their own merits and I believe that this will open even more opportunities for them to make fantastic games. Maybe if we're lucky they'll even add on some more DLC to Hogwarts Legacy and improve or add in the things they didn't have time for prior to release."
1758,R1B3R,https://steamcommunity.com/id/R1B3R/,2,,1,107.5,February,12,95,0,1,"It is everything I, as a Harry Potter fan since I was a kid, could've ever hoped for.The amount of details, the love they have given to this game, full of life and wonderful, it's just incredible. If you're not a Harry Potter fan you can enjoy this game, if you've watched the movies, you'll find many familiar details and you'll enjoy it even more, and if you've actually read the books, you'll find 100x more details.And if you've done all of that dozens of times, as I have, it'll take you two hours to go from one room to another because you'll be looking for the smallest of details that you may miss.I'm just thankful to be able to explore this game. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do ❤️*UPDATE*After almost 100 hours of playtime, with my Ravenclaw run at 100% completion, and another 50 hours or so of watching Hogwarts Legacy content, I can safely recommend this game for all the Wizarding World fans out there. If you're not a fan and you want to know how good is Hogwarts Legacy as a videogame, there are a bunch of things you might want to be aware of before buying:- It's not a game made for tryhard gamers. The game, even at Hard difficulty, is not challenging at all. They didn't want it to be and that's fine, it's a game that you can enjoy, gameplay and combat are satisfying, but again, not challenging. This is not Elden Ring.- The main story is not the best. It's probably not the story's fault, it could actually be great, if it weren't for the NPCs. This gotta be something they work on because NPCs look dead, they only have two different expressions, it's like they can't show emotions at all. It's crazy to think that the different beasts that they've added have more life that NPCs.Besides the NPCs problem, I don't think they've given the real feeling of being a Hogwarts student. I've felt more like a Hogwarts tourist, because most of the time you'll be outside of school grounds. More classes could have helped, a points system for the house tournament (this should be mandatory for the love of god), and definitely more missions inside the castle.- Open world is absolutely stunning, everything about the design, environment and music is superb, award worthy for sure. But it's repetitive with the puzzles like Merlin Trials or Ancient Magic Hotspots. It's just doing the same thing over and over only to give you more hours to play. Some of them like the balloons or astronomy tables are the perfect amount, but I don't know what were they thinking with Merlin Trials.- Performance: I don't think there's much to say about this, I don't understand how it runs better on a ps5 than on some elite pcs with a 3080 and all that. In my case, with a 3060TI, i5-12400 and 16GB RAM, it's been difficult to play in ultra. Dropping from 60 fps to 20 or worse, the stuttering is constant... Once I completed my first run (I wanted to enjoy the game first) I went from ultra to low and installed a mod to boost performance. This last step made a huge difference and now I barely get fps drops, but they should fix it, not force most people to end up using mods. Remove Denuvo now that it doesn't serve any purpose. And this game has to run on the Nintendo Switch, I can't wait to see the Hogwars Legacy 2D version!"

It's so refreshing to see a new game release that isn't buggy to hell, or still in early access. Across my current 34 hours I have only come across 2 bugs and both haven't been major and have given me a good laugh so I see that as a positive. The only negative aspects worth a mention is that the voice audio could use some work, the pitch setting on the voice makes your character sound like a cheap voice changer, and some of the lip syncing is a little poorly animated. As well as that the game could be better optimised, however that will come with updates.Overall, the game has been a staggeringly positive experience and I can't wait to play more"

The game offers players the opportunity to immerse themselves in the magical world and experience life as a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With its richly detailed environments, engaging story, and the ability to cast spells and explore the iconic wizarding school and its surroundings, Hogwarts Legacy is a great game for fans of the Harry Potter franchise and action role-playing games alike. The game also features a wide variety of customization options, allowing players to create their own unique wizard or witch and explore the vast world at their own pace.

The game blends exploration with puzzles, combat and slight horror very well, although for some sci-fi, fast paced oriented players I could see this game not be their thing.The game has a trans bar tender, a lesbian researcher and a literal shop where you can change every facet of your appearance if  you messed up in character creation, also doubling as a trans fantasy.

The combat mechanic is not ground breaking but it is pretty solid.Thr atmosphere in the game is superb makes you truly feel like your in hogwarts and being a witch or wizard.The graphics are beautiful.

At first I thought it was actually magical books, but was just a bugged floating book from an NPC that used to sit on the bench  that just vanished without a trace after I turned around and walked a few meters away from it. Quite funny actually, but no other major game breaking issues. For those other early birds such as myself, if any of you are experiencing FPS drops, try settings textures to LOW. It seems to resolve the issue and to be honest I don't see much of any visual difference from the Texture Settings... Could also be a bug."

1789,Kellamity,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kellais/,2,,1,90.8,February,11,203,0,1,"I am in love with this game but so many won't be.I am trying to achieve everything but so many will get bored early.I am playing in semi-stable 60fps but most will play with barely 20fps.Lore is amazing and pulls so much from what's already established but at the same time, the main story is not that captivating.Many characters are lovable, well constructed, and amazingly voiced, others are just shallow and uninteresting, all of them animated with a stick up their bum - but feminine running animation is gorgeous and light.Does this make Hogwarts Legacy a bad game? In my opinion not at all - but the target audience is not what one would expect.Harry Potter books are specific - they are mostly slow-paced, heavily descriptive stories full of wonders and a lot of time to proceed with the story. Up until the last chapters we are exploring the world of Wizardry with a great deal of affection and curiosity.Avalanche Software took great inspiration from this and is revealing their creation rather slowly and unlike any other modern action game. At first, we got some action, then almost none but this is used to create enough space to wander - and there is plenty of space to wander. The first time they allowed me to run around Hogwarts undisturbed I just walked to discover what was hidden in the castle. It's a rather peculiar choice regarding hard-core gamers but the ideal solution for Potterheads, younger audiences, and casuals. You will get immersed only if you are willing to accept a slow tempo of progression.This is a very pretty game but not graphically and I will elaborate a little about that. I tried low settings, medium settings, ultra settings, and even raytracing but to be honest that doesn't matter. This game is not pretty by current graphic standards set by game-benchmarks. It is stunning and gorgeous because of its environmental storytelling and details. Oh, so many details! I don't mind occasional stutters and drops to 20 fps when I can just stop for a second and admire armors humming, galaxies swirling around under the roof, or owls flying between buildings. Hogwarts Legacy has an ambiance unlike any other game and a carefully crafted world full of so many details, easter eggs, references, and small events you will want to stand around and to nothing to admire them. You don't need 60 fps, raytracing, or ultra in 4k settings for that - they are working just as well on low in Full HD.I love/hate Avalanche that they made me progress the main story so far to unlock so many big game mechanisms but at the same time I didn't get overwhelmed by them too early, I got to adjust and use everything available for me at each point. I can't remember the last game that encouraged me so smartly about using everything I am learning and at the same time showed me what I still have to learn. I was constantly but gently getting pushed forward by curiosity and anticipation. Each time I progressed I was heavily rewarded all around the map! it is such a great way to make you WANT to go back there and explore!As I mentioned this game will match mostly specific audiences - so many people will drop it because of a slow pace, lack of understanding of source material, and annoyance caused by unstable performance. Everyone else will love it so deeply and will get lost in Hogwarts during magical beasts' caring, potions brewing, or flying around just to admire the view. I love that it turned that way because sometimes you just need a slow-paced, comforting game for an awful evening at home. This game wraps you in a warm blanket of magic experience, lets you wander like a kid, and with a gentle hand pushes you to keep exploring."

Hogwarts Legacy features a very enjoyable and well put together combat system, a great story, wonderful characters and of course the timeless world of Harry Potter to explore to your hearts content!Be it Hogwarts, the all-wizarding town of Hogsmede or even the grounds beyond, there's so much to explore and it is worth every second. The character creator is great, the companions you befriend along the way are truly brilliant and well fleshed out in their personal storylines, as well as the game not being afraid to get quite dark when it wants to. It also handles its representation very well if I say so myself, you might not even notice it when it crops up.All in all, Hogwarts Legacy is a game well worth your time and your money. I'd highly recommend buying it, to experience the game and support the devs in their future endeavours!"

The only thing you need to pay attention to is your rig. While the game looks pretty good, compared to some other, older games, I don't think that the requirements are justified. If you want to know more about the game, here we go:- the gameplay is pretty much that of Arkham Knight but instead of leaping to an enemy and kicking him in the face by pressing X/Y, you just wave your wand by pressing R2. Batmans special moves (X+Y for example) are now R2+Y/X/B/A. Pulling off combos makes your ancient magic meta fill up which you can then use to almost one-shot most opponents. Make sure you enable off-camera targeting though. - the devs tried to avoid any pronouns in the game - which, among other things, lead to pretty mixed results in the dub division. Some monologues could've been ripped straight from the books/ movies (quality wise) but whenever a NPC talks to you, it feels like they treat you like an infant. The way some people in the writing department phrased things, makes me feel that my character isn't taken seriously by anyone.Furthermore there is some big overacting going on here. First drama class cranked up to 11, that's what it feels like.- be aware that there still some issues with the stability of the game! Try to make use of the manual save function in this case. - The world is big and there are like 4-5 different ways to reveal secrets around the map. You can either collect scrolls by using I-forgot-which-spell (elemental sight for those who play Genshin Impact) or use your spells like fire to light up something that will then reward you with a scroll or a chest. Much of lore to be discovered, probably less than half actually read. It is fun but nothing ground breaking.- for those of you interested in the LGBTQ aspect of the game: there is literally no restriction in how you can customize your character. You can even pitch your voice and give yourself transition marks. But you can't make some people happy, can you? It's just impossible.The trans teacher however feels like they've already finished a male teacher and gave him a wig. If you ever turn in your homework last second, that's what he feels like. Should you buy? Besides the great immersion, this game offers nothing really new or ground breaking. But it is above average, so it is worth more than ""on sale"". And since the world isn't small, you'll get a lot of hours from it. So yeah, 60 bucks is a fair price."

1829,Loki,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Izsy92/,2,,1,88.3,February,11,164,0,1,"I had some issues knowing how to start this one, so I suppose just jumping straight to it, eh?The game: It is vast, with tons of exploration options, discoveries, puzzles, minigames and tons more to do. I have clocked 43 hours (as of when the Review was written [Updated at 52 hours and finished the story]). I still have not finished the game, because I keep getting sidetracked. I continue to find interesting little places to explore, or a puzzle to solve, and I forget what I was doing, why I was doing it and how I ended up where I would be at that moment.SO enviroment is well done - although I do miss the occasional conversation to over-hear as you walk past a group of people, and not just a random comment. Non the less, the game is still beautiful and well done - but still a little lacking.Character Creation: A lot of options. Face, hair, scars, eyes, eyebrows. So many options! And not to start on the hairstyles! My god! Created a second character, and I spent about an hour just trying out hairstyles and colors. However, I do miss the options to alter nose, jawline, chin, lips, eyes and ears like in other games. Most modern games gives the option to customize smaller pieces of the face, and not use a pre-set. However, it is alright - but lacking in options.Graphics: Beautiful! (Unpopular opinion: Games don't have to look realistic to be beautiful. But it has to be well done)Other in game functions: Well, usually I would have a romance category, but I don't think that is something you will find in this game. Wand: I thought it was a standard twig I would have to wave around to make sparks. Boy was I wrong. Once you get to pick up the wand, you can customize it. Wood type, what it looks like, core, length, etc. Doesn't stop there though - because I thought I had to be stuck with whatever twig I chose as my companion, right? Hah! Then the handles came into my life and I now how an unknown amount of handles for my wand I can cycle through at will.Clothes: Although you have a uniform once you get to hogwarts, you can still alter the look of your robes and wear anything you like. Although I don't fully understand why they chose to do this when the school literally have school uniforms, I digress. Bit more creativity, and no complaints about that. (Tip: Get all the keys and house tokens - you will not regret it).Exploring: Well, as I stated first, the game is vast. The world is big and have a lot to offer for the easily distracted human. I am one of those. I have lost count of how often I have been on my way to Hogsmeade, and gone off course because I found something interesting that led me to something else that was interesting. Soon enough, Hogsmeade has been forgotten and I have gotten stuck in a two hour exploration adventure fighting trolls and goblins... Where was I going with this again? Oh, right... So, I though ""If I have to walk to explore, i will tear my hair out"". But no - you do get a broom - and a hippogriff. And you can fly them at will at the school ground and around the world, with few exceptions (Blasted Hogsmeade....).Room of requirement: I fear this room. I really, really do. Because I am afraid I will be stuck in it for HOURS decorating... And I have...So, now that I have touched what I felt was most important, I want to touch a few things that I found frustrating. The game is choppy. It drops frames wildly. Which is a nuance. No matter what I did to play around with the settings, it still happened. Even when Steam and the game was the only thing I was running. So the performance could be better. A lot better. Please fix this!Although the game does offer a lot, there are things that is lacking. Character creation is one. Player choice that matters is another, consequences for learning forbidden magic is not a thing (but it should be - I should not be able to cast it in front of Professor Fig and he be fine with it. Quite frankly, he should be outraged about me using crucio...) and more ending options would be good. This ads re-play value, and right now, it only ads value in the fact that you can get achievements specific to each house, a small quest for each house - but little else. Which means, you want to achievement hunt for the 45 current ones, you only have to play up to a certain point and that is it. With more endings and with one or two hidden endings would make people play it even more.I was slightly disappointed to find that quidditch was not a thing this time around.The next thing I really wish was NOT a thing in the industry is this entire ""exclusive"". It infuriates people, and PC players are often the ones ending up with the short end of the deal. Like this time. Player store in Hogsmeade to sell stuff you find for a higher price? Like, WHY?! The amount of times I had to LITERALLY hunt for valuable clothes to sell is stupid. Please fix this. And the Felix Felicis potion? Why is this made exclusive? And I am not even going to go into the extra dungeon console got, because that infuriated me.Hopefully the stall and the potion will be made available for PC players as well - though I suspect not. However, I hope the devs do make a DLC with more spells, more potions and new places. Along with an update that could possibly make it more of a risk to learn the three unforgivable curses and give us the option to be good, neutral, evil or chaotic evil. Because playing as a Slytherin I should be able to feel like there is not a single grain of goodness in me. As a Ravenclaw, i should be able to feel like I am the ""nerd"" of the school. You get what I am getting at.Still, all in all - although the game is a little lacking, I still find it amazing. There is much potential that was wasted, and I do hope the devs do possibly re-visit that at some point. (The author said hopefully knowing it would never happen)Also, just a small disclaimer: I do NOT support the author and creator of the Harry Potter universe or their opinions. However, I still believe this game is amazing and I will say that if you want to try, do it! It is well worth the time and money!"

Lots of exploration, fun combat, puzzles at every corner and a seemingly infinite chunk of the wizarding world.My favorite part so far was finding the bridge on the way to the gamekeeper's (soon to be Hagrid's) shack and using my memories from the films to navigate the terrain. Everything is gorgeous and it feels like you are really there.The only issue with the game is the performance. I could not get a consistent 60+FPS with Ultra settings @4K on capable hardware (RTX4080, 13th gen Core i7, 32GB DDR5), so I had to use the more agressive upscaling option to keep the frame dips above 60fps."

1859,TappLuck,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TappLuckHere/,2,,1,29.3,February,11,349,2,1,"Will not lie, there are some pretty generic aspects of this game.The game mostly relies on it being an HP game which should be considered before purchase. If you're not a Harry Potter fan it's somewhat likely that you will not enjoy this game as the open world, albeit large and full, can be a big chore at times and combat, although fun, can get repetitive.The character creation screen allows for a lot of customization but it also is simple at the same time.The combat is fun when you have a plan of how you want to go about it, but as mentioned above, it can be a bit repetitive.Hogwarts is a big place. I mean really big. Which is why it has many fast travel points as they can really cut some of the travelling if you find it tedious. I personally enjoyed walking around the school as I always wanted a full HP RPG.The characters are relatable for the most part and I found myself feeling bad for them more often than not as the companions specifically have engaging stories and intriguing goals with sometimes questionable methods of meeting said goals.The spell learning process immediately returned me to my childhood as you need to trace a figure to learn a spell, much like old PC Harry Potter games.Speaking of spells, the game has a specific system in combat in which only certain colored spells can break certain shields the enemies might have. For example, Confringo which has a red color on its symbol can only break red shields, and Levioso, which has a yellow color on its symbol can only break yellow shields. There are methods of bypassing these shields entirely, which are ancient magic and unforgivable curses.There's no penalty of using unforgivable curses. No one even comments on it in game but for role-playing sake I only used those when I'm with a specific companion or alone.The voice acting is amazing, you can really feel the anguish of characters when they need to be that way.The facial animations of certain characters are fantastic.The way you learn spells aside from the tracing method specified early on is by attending certain classes and completing special assignments given to you by your teachers.The castle and the world in general have so many secrets to discover as well. It took me a good long time to finish some side quests and the story itself but I imagine 100%'ing it will take a bit more."

Was pretty upset for a long time about this fictional world being tainted by obvious things; those books were a great comfort to me growing up, even in some hard times. So, I was torn. After a hard night that involved literally crying on discord, I decided to separate the art from the artist (a phrase I've heard in the world of extreme metal, where your Spotify listens may be sending some pennies to racist murderers etc) and honestly I'm really glad I did.At the end of the day, it's just clearly a good game, with a lot of work and love put into it. + Great, fast, mobile, flow-y combat+ Very good character customization, aside from the voice's pitch shifter ending up sounding robotic in some lines+ One of those games where you can insert your avatar or OC into an established fictional world. Downright cathartic for your inner child.+ Story is great so far, arguably more interesting than the actual HP movies+ Lots of modern graphics options, ultrawide support etc+ Tons of accessibility features+ Performance is greatHonestly, no negatives with the game so far.If any part of you or your inner child wants to give this a try and have fun with this, I urge you to separate or compartmentalize your feelings about that monster of an author.

The missions and combat really make you feel like a wizard and like you're plopped right in the middle of the Wizarding World.  I am having such a blast just chaining combos of spells and getting a hit of dopamine when I finish it off with that perfectly timed blast.The story is intriguing and well fleshed out.  I don't want to say more to avoid needing spoilers, but it feels right at home within the current Hogwarts Lore and is a welcome addition.Open world elements are there but definitely reigned in, you can tell that the devs played this game and know at what point a certain mechanic stops being fun, and at that point you get a new game mechanic or mystery to solve and the cycle starts anew.It's a really good game and I'm happy to see the development team see success.

For any Harry Potter fan this will blow you away. Any RPG/Story driven gaming fan will love this as well. The game checks all the boxes for me. Beautiful, great story, challenging and everything in between. I've seen people complaining about ""20-30hrs"" of game play which is absurd. If you play the game how its intended to be played there is easily 70+hrs of enjoyment out of it. If you're on the fence hop on down and just get the game. Highly recommend and hopefully the success they've seen brings us future DLC's and even a future MMO or something similar! Way to go Avalanche!!!!!!"

1899,Jmee,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jmiee/,2,,1,130.9,February,11,246,0,1,"I'm stunned... It's better than I expected. I encountered only 2 trivial graphical bugs such as NPC pathing (not important), but everything else has been amazing so far.Combat seems fun, intuitive, reactionary while not being overly complex, yet not too simple and you still feel good once you master it.Incredible graphics (flowing coat/robe/scarf fabric, finally a game delivering), realistic human NPC (and the character creation, I love making a custom character in a game that still allows for voiced story narrative, it's so immersive.) The environment detail is amazing, I've probably wasted too much time simply marveling at things. Hogwarts itself is so huge I had to drag myself out of it (unfinished exploring) to get a change of scenery outside (and the outdoor map is also pretty huge.)Later on, I got to the flying (damn!) and open world exploration and puzzles (some of which are very innovative and do some new things, unique mechanics with their spells. Kudos to whoever thought those up, I love seeing new stuff, as a jaded ol gamer who's mostly seen it all.I'm pleased with my purchase, and I'm not a real Potter fan. I only watched the movies out of boredom and curiosity. I actually disliked the whole polite uniformed British kids aspect of Harry Potter (I didn't grow up with it), I'm mostly more of a D&D/general fantasy fan. Yet (and this is for the people who like me thought maybe they wouldn't like it if they're ambivalent about HP) this game is still enjoyable. It gives me Skyrim feels, it scratches that itch (as well as dips into many other genres. The Room of Requirement gives me all the decorating/builder vibes I enjoy, the Beast vivarium touches that Pokemon gotta-catch-em-all feel (and, little did I know, you can also keep building and decorating outdoors in your pocket-dimension vivarium biomes!)My friend has been playing it with kb/m while I'm playing it with my controller, and both handle well. The movement is still quick and fluid, it's clearly not a crappy port or something, there's no clunky consolitis (by comparison, the wide-turning horrifically-slow clunky movement in GTAV. Rockstar take note and do better for GTA6, because if they can't outdo this, I'mma laugh). The UI and menus are equally quick and still easy to navigate.I'm extremely impressed. And from an unheard of studio, too (plus so many people were trying to claim it would flop because they had no other decent games under their belt to speak of).And side bonus of pissing off people who think they have any right to dictate to me what I do or buy. I am vindicated that not only is the game moderately good, it's friggin' phenomenally good. GOTY, bet on it.My hardware is ~5 years old so not cutting edge, and I am still able to play on High settings (I did have to sacrifice and turn off all the raytracing. Gorgeous reflections, but was hitting the FPS too much.) The game is playable while still looking great if you don't have an ancient potato. Don't be a buffoon with your settings and then blame the game. It could use a little optimization, but to me that would be icing on the cake, I'm having a great time right now as is.My only disappointment so far is that the puzzles have been too easy (I love some of the mechanics and effects, moving floors, floating platforms, etc.) I realize it's also an IP popular with kids so I'm not asking for insanely tough puzzles, but ""a little more"" would've been nice.The open world treasure caves are severely lackluster, dip in and grab a chest with no difficulty, and always the same layout. I remember people complanining about Elden Ring's ""samey"" dungeons -- those fools had no idea how good they had it, those were big with depth and often unique layouts (and actual danger. Everytime I go in one, my wizard is like ""This could be dangerous..."" And I'm thinking YES PLEASE WHERE?)Hogwarts does everything else exceedingly well, except for those open-world-map caves that barely seem worth the time visiting."

I've been having a great experience and find the game to be very fun. The visuals are beautiful, the map is huge, and I love the character customization. One unique aspect I really appreciate is that each person that has a voice line actually speaks instead of only having the subtitle (like some other games). The game right now on PC is definitely having some FPS issues and some bugs here and there, but that's honestly to be expected for a brand new game of this size. On PC it does lag terribly at times to the point its not playable and it would be nice if the developers paid attention to this issue rather than ignore it. This game is definitely more fun if you're able to get immersed and into the role of a wizard/witch! If you love fantasy or Harry Potter for that matter, this game is definitely for you!"
1926,Kaungsan99,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198262646527/,2,,1,101.7,February,11,84,0,1,"As someone who don't know anything about Harry Potter , this game really made me want to watch all the movies. Let's get some negatives out of the way... First , stuttering and framerate drops during the early access days , characters could be written a bit better ( then again , I haven't finished the story so I will see if it got better ) and the first few hours before you getting a mount. But as soon as the game opens up more , the game just get better. Combat is solid. Really simple and easy to understand. But as soon as the different enemy types start grouping up on you , that ""easy"" combat becomes a great resource management mini game. Switching up different spells on the fly for different enemies , using plants and potions that you grew yourself to gain an edge in a battle while countering the spells is really satisfying. It can get chaotic but as soon as you gain control of the fight , it becomes a dance. Great customization for your character as well. Great fashion designs , beautiful environment and places to explore. Also... you can pat cats and have magical animals as pets. Pre-ordering this for 70$ was a wise move for me."

1928,SpookyWolf,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047112462/,2,,1,30.9,February,11,263,0,1,"Nearing the 30 hour mark I thought it might be time for a review. I honestly don't know where to start, this game has been a dream ever since I was in Kindergarten/Middle School, back when HP was in its prime. So excitedly, I have been waiting a long time for this. -Graphics are phenomenal, the details put into every room, hallway, hamlet, even just walking along a path its just gorgeous and thought out. Almost like a movie except you're the main character. Albeit I have a pretty decent computer, the stuttering can get pretty annoying and less enjoyable, especially when you're in the middle of a large fight and have to time all your dodges and spells. It gets hectic, but I assume this will be addressed with a future update in the near future. I haven't really noticed many glitches, aside from the occasional random NPC vibrating in the ground (which was honestly hilarious) but I've only seen it once. -Combat. It's an easy to learn hard to master type of combat I feel like. Yes it's not the widest variety of spells but mastering the combos is really satisfying and impactful to your fights. And the feats that pop up before your fights help you explore spells you would otherwise not use in combat. I have only unlocked one unforgiving curse (Crucio) and so far it hasn't impacted the flow of combat at all, but I think the other 2 might make things easier depending how powerful they are. -Lastly; Story. I'm in love with it, it's interesting albiet dark in some parts. Which really adds to the severity of what's going on in the world. Side quests are no different, all of them have a story to them and not just a ""go fetch this, go kill this"" type of quests. Your character has a lot of dialogue and just, life to them, and the responses you can select are just as great. You can be kind, witty, or downright mean in some of the dialogue. Which is a nice character building for your imagination. This game is a 10/10 in my book, and I still have a ways to go! I will probably update my review when I finish the game. Thanks for reading. :)"
1929,FailureToReport,https://steamcommunity.com/id/failuretoreport/,2,,1,30.5,February,11,210,0,1,"Yes, absolutely yes. The only things I am a little let down by:Main character voice is screwed, there's a slider to adjust pitch but adjusting it just adds an echo effect to it, so just leave it alone. Your wand choice is permanent which can be a little of a bummer if you get hours in and want a different look. No quidditch makes big sad, but I can get why, flying in the game is REALLY not great because it's not mouse steering, you use WASD for directional and have to use Space and Control for altitude. It would be a nightmare to play quidditch with these controls.Spell bar feels way too small. You can only memorize 4 spells at a time on a spell bar, and it never feels like it's enough, I think 5 or 6 would have been a better number. As you progress the story and unlock talent system you can ""learn"" 3 more spell bar slots, but then you have to mouse scroll wheel through them all which feels clumsy. Other than that, the world looks beautiful, the story has been interesting. I do wish there was more sense of belonging to your assigned house, and I've heard there's no real ""Good / Evil"" play impact which is kind of a bummer. I was hoping the Dark Arts bundle was a sign that you could be real bad. Also on the topic of houses, I wish there were more ""companions"" you got to know and adventure with in your house so it didn't feel SOOOOOOO much like a single player adventure. Coop would have been amazing also...."

""Not so open world"" feels alife with a lot of interactable and animated magical objects.  The combat sytem is quite original and feels really fluid - various combos and different ways to defend yourself. However, combat is not mind-blowing and it feels somewhat outdated - spells are fiddly to control as you accumulate more and more of those. BUT ... you can ride a Hippogriff - dope and sold!"

Game of the year.But in all seriousness, the game has some stuttering issues so you may need to fiddle with your settings a bit to fine tune things, at least until a performance patch. I have an Intel i7-11800H & an RTX 3060. Running the game on High settings has minimal stuttering, but is at least playable thus far (I have not had  combat yet, so this could change). Clothing tends to freak out at times too. Make sure your graphics card is up to date as well.The House Sorting (  ) and Wand Selection (  ) are a bit lack luster.  Overall, both felt more like token additions than anything well thought out or meaningful, at least to me.That being said, game play thus far has been enjoyable and I really like running around looking for all the secrets. Dialogue is fun and decently written. Graphics, while run on high (not ultra due to stuttering) are beautiful. The music is absolutely on point. My favorite piece of music is a classical guitar or lute played by a painting you just walk past!! Absolutely fantastic!!Character creation is, in all fairness, a bit limited.

There's a lot to do- A lot visual customization to be done throughout the game. It feels really good and refreshing to change your looks especially with the transmog system- Combat feels really good. I'm playing on hard and it feels nice.The not so great items:- Terrible UI. It was designed for console. Map, HUD icons and elements are way TOO BIG and intrusive. Can't edit that.- Performance isn't great in some places. Frames are dipping a lot but if you wait, they stabilize.- Bad implementation of RTX. Tbh, it doesn't even compare with RTX implementation done in other games. The good news:- The not so great items above can be fixed pretty quickly and should within the first month.Overall:If you're a fan, this is amazing. The world feels alive. The school is fantastic and characters are fun and well designed."

Meaning you can equip the best equipment you have, then press the corresponding button in the menu on top of the piece (F on pc) to open the transmog menu and you can choose to make that gear piece look different. So you don't look goofy af- when doing side quests for people you can choose to keep whatever you retrieved for them to be a duck or even ask for a reward (or you can just give it back for free but who doesn't want to be compensated?)- The combat feels really smooth and once you master it (which is really easy), you can take on enemies several levels above you"
1949,Jdyn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jdyn_/,2,,1,60.1,February,11,286,0,1,"This is a great game. I understand all the controversy and I myself am non-binary/genderfluid and I obviously do not want to support JK rowling, but I've been a harry potter fan since I was like 5, for far longer than I've known shes a piece of ♥♥♥♥. This game is actually quite inclusive too, I was able to make a character that fits me perfectly. Now past all that onto the actual game. This game is basically if you took any other modern massive open world game like TW3 or RDR2 or skyrim and made it harry potter themed. Id personally say the world is probably a little lackluster compared to TW3 or RDR2 but this games world blows stuff like modern AC games out of the water. The story isn't amazing but it is engaging enough to keep me opening the game. The combat isn't necessarily where the game shines but it is definitely one of the most unique styles of combat I've seen in a game especially recently. Its a bit like mass effect or the old dragon age games just ranged only and much more polished. The place where this game really shines is how much depth all the systems and world manage to have while still being lore friendly, magical, fitting to a T rated game. Will this be my 2023 GOTY? probably not, but this game will probably be in my top 5 for this year. Overall Id give it a 7-8/10. Id say if you prefer to play more mature games and/or aren't a harry potter fan this game will probably sit closer to a 6-7/10 for you personally. If you have no issue playing games intended for everyone and are a harry potter fan this game will probably sit closer to an 8/10.Overall verdict: Hogwarts Legacy is a great modern open world RPG with an engaging enough story, pretty deep systems, unique combat, and manages to be pretty inclusive to the LGBT and POC despite it being shrouded in controversy. 8/10Should you buy this game? If you are a harry potter fan or love contemporary open world RPGs Id say its probably going to be worth full price. If you are not a harry potter fan and you think often times open world games are empty or boring Id say its still worth a pickup if you're an RPG fan just probably at a lower sale price."

I have always been a massive fan of the entire HP universe that J.K. has managed to create. I remember back in the days when I started playing Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone on my good old PS1 console. That game back then felt magical and I was extremely happy with what it was. Down the line I also played the rest of the games, all the way up to Half-Blood Prince.The overall experience in those games though, was lacking in a lot of regards and this is where Hogwarts Legacy comes in and fixes the shortcomings of the previous games!Consider this review biased since I have always been a massive fan of the books and the movies and at the moment I'm writing this review I have to say that the devs have definitely managed to exceed my every expectation!Here's a dissection of my experience so far:I could write all day about this game's positives but it would take ages to include everything. In any case, while the pros definitely outweigh the cons here are some things that need a bit of work:I tried my best to come up with more negatives but it's really tough for me to find any. As I said, I'm a huge fan of the HP universe so do take everything with a grain of salt.Hogwarts legacy is a great game. Avalanche has great passion for the universe and it shows through the game. The exploration, combat, personalization and so forth really make this game shine. Be prepared to get immersed in this amazing and magical open-world and uncover all the mysteries it provides. It is well-worth purchasing and I'm sure it really won't disappoint!I would like to end this review by thanking both Avalanche as well as Warner Brothers for making this game possible. I have always been waiting for a decent HP game and they finally made my dreams come true!To all my fellow witches and wizards, I hope you enjoy this masterpiece as well as I do! Until then:"

1963,RedfordGames,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072722663/,2,,1,44.0,February,11,235,0,1,"(Edited 02/17/2022)I loved this game. This was an enjoyable experience from start to finish. I have not 100% the game but, got the final cut-scene it was a decent grind but, it really was a fun experience.Pros:I enjoyed the story overall. The characters were really flushed out and felt real to the world you play in. The story quests leads to an epic confrontation with the big bad and a climatic finish to the story. I felt compelled to do all my class assignments and experience a lot of the side quests since they were all so interesting and unique.The combat was a unique highlight as all the spells felt unique and help you string together some interesting combos for max damage. It is easy to learn but, difficult to master. The forbidden spells, if you choose to learn them, are some of the must OP spells in the game. They are the most rewarding to learn and use. However, even if you don't learn them the amount of useful combat and non combat spells you learn can give you a unique edge and all situations. Not to mention your characters plot armor spells that only they know are super powerful and basically a one shot for anyone you come across. All in all it is just a ton of fun to wreck some scrubs with all the spells you have at your disposal.The open world and vast and unique. I was surprised that the game was so large and every area felt it has a story to share and was absolutely marvelous to look at. Even as someone that did not pay much attention to the books can appreciate the magic that goes into making everything you look at feel unique and alive.For playing this game three days early, I was shocked on how well this game ran. I didn't have a single major crash or game breaking bug to report.The immersion for the most part was top notch and I could really feel my self being absorbed into the Harry Potter universe. I watched the movies and read some of the books so I can say that this world gets a thumbs up on overall presentation of the lore and magic you experience.The challenge system is very detailed and super helpful for you maximize the fun you can have. As the game actively rewards you for participating in any game mechanic you find your self doing. While giving you additional ways to test yourself in fun and meaningful ways. The rewards you receive are great as well. This can be in the form of cosmetics, xp or enhancements to your abilities.Cons:(Edited): Some of the performance issues have now been addressed and major and minor NPCs that disappeared for me are no longer gone.There are other minor issues that have to deal with immersion that are small but enough to notice. The developers seemed to be very conscious of being diverse and inclusive but, it did not seem very historically accurate for the time game is set in. Like, why in the 1800s were the students and faculty so diverse and inclusive but, fast forward a 100 years to the books/ movies and the diversity is gone. To me that has ramifications I don't think the writers thought about. Also, all Ugandan wizards and witchs don't use wands and the spells are just as powerful. Why does no one adopt this line of magic casting if it is so good? They say its because it just feels more dramatic with a wand but, being able to use magic without a wand would make things way easier and more effective. Another issue I could not figure out for the life of me was the implication of a potential Trans bar keep. Though this did not make since as the 1800s were not known for transitioning people back in those times. This led me to believe its just an unfortunate woman with a males voice. (Edit: This immersion issue is easily fixed by switching languages before her scenes. The other dubs for this game give this character a female voice actress and she sounds much better this way) Also, people would not be very open about gay relationships as the 1800s were not very accommodating to those kind of people back in the day. I understand the developers want to make a game that feels like the world we live in today but, it does not feel immersive for the time frame, that is all. The story has some issues with your choices not mattering to much. I was disappointed to realize that an evil play-through was determined by only one dialogue choice. Not to mention it just changes the end cut-scene in minor way. Yet you still act like a hero and are treated like a hero in the end. So none of the relationship quests, side quests, learning of the forbidden spells really matter in the grand scheme. (Edit: picking your house only changes the color of explosion at the end and the exclusive quest that you get for the house is shared with every other house just with a slightly different coat of paint.)The combat felt clunky at times towards the later game as you can have four different magic slots with different spells in each. However you get four of these spell wheels and you have to pick the best magic slots you need for the situation. So you are switching out spell slots in the heat of combat while actively dodging, breaking shields, and keeping juggling going. If you are on an easier difficulty this may not matter as much but, the combat becomes pretty brain dead at that point. Which can be fine for some but, I feel it is clunkier are higher difficulties. I am will have to accept skill issues on my part but, still there is a lot manage for even a casual such as my self towards the later game.In any open world game I do not like invisible barriers preventing me from exploring further. I much prefer the infinite scenery loops that other open world games have done. Also, some of the villages start feeling kind of the same after you visit the third random village on the map. Only a few of them I really understood why people would want to live there. The rest were different but, not different enough.Conclusion:Overall, this game is very fun. Beyond some technical issues, minor immersion problems and a flawed but fun combat system. This is a must recommend. You can spend hours enjoying the open world and seeing the secrets this game holds."

But let me explain:Very cool graphics, the design, the buildings, the various styles; Hogwarts is amazing, the amount of detail is mind blowing.Mechanics are mostly bad. Just to say the least, why don't I have a slot for all my spells? Why do I have to keep out some, but then I'll need what I left out because of a quest, a puzzle or something like that, forcing me to swap spell slots continuously! Why? Give me more spell bars, or give me a way to hotkey them however I want.Something I dislike so much is the lack of a moral mechanic. You don't have repercussions when doing bad things like stealing, violating someone house, refusing to return/retrieve stuff keeping them for yourself, using ""unforgivable"" curses..Story is very lacking. Who are we? Where are we from? You are locked in selecting, sometimes, between 2, sometimes 3 choices during some of the quests but that doesn't change much if anything at all. Your character just feels shallow and you don't really have a choice in the story. Also many side quests are just the same, same thing with puzzles, caves.. Everything is a rinse and repeat.It's cool that you can customize the look of your gear, very good actually! But, again, everything feel mostly the same, you don't really have a great choice, if not for some of the more unique items.. But it's just not enought. I almost unlocked every item but I keep wearing the same things because there's not enought diversity or because some item I might wear it's just modeled wrong and it cripples out somewhere (like on the torso) in a very annoying way.Also mounts! Very cool, right!? But.. Why giving me a beautiful hippogryph when there's no real benefit in it? I can just mount on my broom which is faster and more agile. Sure mounting beasts is cooler! But when you are out there doing the same old side quest/puzzle/cave you get bored very soon. And why in the world I cannot look up or down while flying!? What is this atrocity!!??One last thing that I find very annoying is that this game has very evidently been made with consoles in mind. Everything suggests it, from the fact that you are locked to 4 active spells at a time while unable to hotkey them as you like, to the fact that there's content (not much, tbh) locked unless you are connecting from console. Kinda ""meh""..Overall I think this game could be much, MUCH more. Not that they didn't have examples of great mechanics (see Red Dead Redemption) to add to the game (morality *COFF*..).Almost everything feels bland and unfinished or rushed.I honestly don't feel like recommending this game at full price."
1967,Tzeer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tz_eer/,2,2,1,40.5,February,11,417,0,1,"Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.Here's why:Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.Have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911."

Never saw the movies or read the books) This game has lots of fan service which doesn't affect me.The game is a collectathon looking for pages. I got to level 15 before I unlocked the skill tree from the story( which you can't respec).Combat is very easy since you just have to focus in the red or yellow circles. Your spells auto target and there is no animation for healing. So balancing attacking, dodging/parrying, and healing isn't a thing in this game. Boss battles are the most interesting part of combat.As a sucker for collectathons, open worlds and a Gothic/ Victorian architecture I could recommend it as a high mid tier game. Could possibly get better later on but I haven't beat the game yet."

One of the best Single player RPG games since RDR2. This is HUGE and can easily make you spend tons of time doing things you wouldnt even think you could do.

My expectations for this game were very nicely surpassed with some minor grievances being here and there as well the overall performance of this game being terrible on PC(Lots of dips even on an RTX 3070) but overall solid game of a type that hasn't been seen in a very long time.This game is amazing and the Devs should be proud of what they've done with a beloved franchise. The game's got decent puzzles and a massive world enjoyable for people new to the franchise and especially for old fan. Go in with an Open mind and you will likely enjoy this, if not then maybe it wasn't meant to be. 9/10 Easy."

1988,Merlin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/merlinw/,2,,1,76.2,February,11,94,0,1,"Wizarding World is a universe that I've loved since I was a kid. When I look into the game from this perspective, the map & the content are quite detailed and the plots & the context are directly parallel to the Wizarding World as J. K. Rowling allegories and narrates and also there are detailed explanations on many subjects within. The graphics of the game is really great and impressive and it proves that real effort has been made in terms of physics, effects, particles, animations, photorealism. On the other hand; There are a few shortcomings in gameplay; for example, interactions with other characters and objects are quite weak, main character continues to appear and talk as if nothing had happened after the events that affected him/her physically/mentally, the plot ""I think"" is weak; I don't think it has a story that makes people curious and draws in. In overall, I would definitely recommend the game to Wizarding World fans and I recommend general to check the gameplay/review and decide but I think this game is great and lot's of fun."

Most NPC's don't even know your there, they will not even give you a ""hey back off"" if you attack them, which kinda makes the game not feel truly free/real like Skyrim. I would love to go around ""Avada Kedavraing"" or attacking people that are not ""enemies"" but cannot as the attacks just go right through.A big flaw is that there are a lot of areas that are just empty and boring, an example of this is the ""Three Broomsticks"".I bought a ""Butter Beer"" In the main story cut seen, I assumed I could visit it like a tavern anytime I wanted. But when I came back to the Three Broomsticks I can't actually buy anything or interact with anyone, its just an empty room with people sitting on chairs and the owner wiping tables.All I want is to buy some ""Butter Beer"" and just sit down and relax :( other than these flaws ""which i'm hoping will be solved with mods"", its a very good game, having a lot of FUN I would say 8/10"

The opening alone had me floored (Thestrals handled perfectly) I am about 20 hours at time of writing level 18 but I have spent SOOO much time just wandering exploring. I love everything ive encountered. How you learn new spells, the combat and combos. Special shout out to the Talent System for actually offering interesting upgrades not just X does 5% more damage. We have genuine upgrades. Fire spells that also create a ring around you, improvements to stealth, extended combo windows. Utilizing the environment and things like plants feels so fun. How enemies interact like hanging a giant toad monster from his tongue with levitation to turn him into a pinata essentially. I will revisit this when I complete the game but, I cannot understate how much I enjoy this. OH AND THE ROOM OF REQUIREMENT. Its so much more than I expected I had to have spent at least an hour and a half just customizing mine."

I already started having tears in my eyes when I heard the music at the intro. This game is a must for every Harry Potter fan or for people who love magic. The graphic is absolutely wonderful, the interactions are magnificent. So many small little details, even the side quests are fun. Everyday there is a new discovery I cry about - today (10.02) I cried bc I saw a Diricawl. Now onto some important stuff~Raytracing made the game laggy for me. When Raytracing was on, I had 17FPs. Without Raytracing and Quality on high I have 60FPS. Other than that there are small lags when the world is loading but nothing big.My specs:Intel i7-7700K 4.2 GHz16 GB RAMGeForce GTX 1080 TiA little thing that's not so great is, that you can't drink Butterbeer at the three broomsticks.

The game is beautiful; from the delightfully twisting and staircase winding castle, to the expansive grounds, the ethereal Forbidden Forest, the rolling expanse of the open world, and the charming and colorful Hogsmeade, the game LOOKS spectacular, and I often find myself just panning the camera up, down, and around to take it all in.2. There is so much to do; from classes to crafting and everything in-between, there is a wonderful assortment of things to do and you can do them largely in whatever order you like once you've unlocked the task. I've spent hours making potions, traipsing through the countryside gathering ingredients, chatting with random people along the way with this or that quest to do, and I don't think a single one has been a 'Bring me X number of Y' thus far.3. Combat is engaging; there are rarely 1v1 fights and thus some measure of defense is required for nearly every battle, whether it's a spell or a simple dodge roll. For those of us who aren't particularly swift or attentive, there's a dreadfully convenient visual marker for when you're about to be hit, allowing you to get out of the way or throw up a shield like a professional. The game rewards you for making use of spells from time to time, meaning there's actually a reason to do more than spam the DPS button.4. Nostalgia everywhere; if you're anything like me, seeing familiar surnames and imagining you're conversing with the ancestors of characters you know and love (or love to hate) is a burst of sheer enjoyment. New and familiar flora and fauna abound, you'll get a laugh out of the first time you encounter the beloved mandrake, and possibly make a high-pitched sound of love when you get your hands on the ever-adorable Puffskeins.5. Character creation is better than expected; a special mention belongs to whoever oversaw the hairstyles, being able to make black characters with hairstyles in the right textures with attractive hairlines is a rare treat in any game and the fact that Hogwarts Legacy nailed this with an actual ABUNDANCE of afro hair styles is just icing on what was already a delicious cake.Cons:1. There are so many places to sit, a variety of chairs you can customize and decorate, but you cannot actually SIT. This is a terrible oversight in my opinion, I would desperately love to be able to sit at my desk or table, or by the river, or outside a Hosgmeade shop.2. Clothes cannot be re-colored. This isn't unique to this game, it's just a bit of a shame that in a game with so many clothing options, your favorite outfit can't be changed to your favorite color.3. The game will end. Seriously, this is my biggest Hogwarts Legacy fear, that the game will eventually end and there is nothing on the horizon to fill the Hogwarts-sized hole in my imagination that will be left behind.tldr; I love this game, all my homies are playing this game and you should too. JK Rowling was not involved in the creation of this game, but the entire world was born of her imagination and all of the things that make the game great are a direct result of the countless hours she spent, as a struggling single mother, penning the children's series that her fans know and love. Nothing anyone says can change the fact that she is present in every nook and cranny of this project, or the fact that her name will forever be remembered alongside the Wizarding World. Stay salty!"

I had high expectations for this and only small things disappointed me more than large. The castle exploration is so so much fun, let alone exploring Hogsmeade and everywhere else the map has to offer. The challenges and collections keep you super involved while you're doing side quests as well as the main story. The combat is incredibly fun, with a bunch of different spells to use and upgrades for them that make them more interesting. 8/10 recommend this to any Harry Potter fan, or someone who likes a fun, immersive RPG! I only wish there was more quality of life in the NPC's, as well as minigames to do, Quidditch, more beasts, more customisation options as well as more rpg elements involved, like rewarding you more in dungeons rather than opening a loot box to get something you most likely have already, at a lower level. Even 'companions' didnt feel like companions, the only time they traveled with you was for their storyline, which doesn't really make them companions.Now that I've finished the game, I gotta say that I feel like the story is around a 7 out of 10. It started off strong, but it honestly kind of fell off, felt rushed, and a lot of canon lore being thrown into it just because. There's some major fps problems with the game too, even on high end, the best money can get you PC's, definitely needs some polishing. Bit disappointing, but still a fun experience."

Discovering a movie landmark or easter egg just puts a huge smile on my face. This game is all that fans wanted for years and they finally got it.Amazing and massive open world game in wizarding world as a student attending Hogwarts.The world is full of little quirks and magical goings on be it enchanted hedge trimmers or musical instruments setting a cosy happy vibe wherever they are.Music is amazing.Combat is smooth and realy enjoyable.Visuals and environment are crazy detailed and biggest selling point of this game.Story is not fantastic but its still very good.Yes, I like it!"

Trailers have for a long time showed off a game that is not delivered on release day. But Hogwarts Legacy is everything it wanted to be. Truly be a Hogwarts student, go to class, learn new spells, complete assignments. Of course it wouldn't be Hogwarts without secrets, so there are many to find across not only Hogwarts grounds but the surrounding area.Content is spread out in a way that you can truly dive into each element before the next one is introduced. Potion making, Plant growing, Item Identification and more await. I know Beast Caretaking is there somewhere but impressively I haven't reached it yet and I've played a good amount of the game.The story is interesting and exciting. I want to learn more about what's going on in the main story and find more of the side content as it's fun and very lore building. Everything building you up as this student of Hogwarts whose learning new magic.I recommend this game with no hesitation. There are a few stuttering issues, but as I play it slowly goes away."

2039,[EXD] Frix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FrixDK/,2,,1,44.1,February,11,247,0,1,"I don't want to give a negative review but i'm certainly not praising the game either.If you are a Harry Potter fan the game is worth it. If not, i can't really say i'd recommend it.From here on out the review contains spoilers so.The lack of options in conversation is extremely disappointing, while there was no honor system i wish that you would have had a much greater impact on the game. The only noticible difference i saw was that there were multiple ways of approaching JackDaws Rest. I got the owl tower.The room of requirement is just a time consuming mess and honestly it just becomes an endless supply of potions and upgrades. There is no legendary gear for you to go and aquire like in skyrim with some seriously unique items.All the treasure dungeons are super lame where you just enter and there is one chest.Dialogue is straight up reused. When you finally decide to let your fellow classmates know what happened in the prologue it is the exact same voice line word for word.The world doesn't really seem as lived in and  reactive as i would have expected. Thinking of games like Red Dead Redemption 2.Another point where this game fails compared to Red Dead Redemption is how unrewarding learning new spells feel. The only time i felt like i had earned something was when i learned the unforgivable curses by completing that quest line.Other spells and charms are just tossed in your face on a day to day basis and given to you with basically no effort. The tasks that you were given are so generic and there is so... so much filler content. I think my biggest pet peeve is the spawning of brooms and mounts. That they just well... rather magically appear instead of coming to you. Again coming back to Red Dead Redemption 2 where you call your horse and it actually comes running to you from over the horizon.Inferi can't be killed with Avada Kadavra until you set them on fire.... would expect the killing curse to actually kill anything that isn't a main story boss.All the main bosses in the game are easier to beat and the trials. Than some open world encounters. Large amount of enemies are more troublesome than bosses due to lack of crowd control options. There are soo... soo many different types of enemies that are taken down in different ways it is really difficult to master. On top of that, they are hard to distinguish visually."

And I must say, it does not disappoint. This RPG is a testament to the creative potential of the wizarding world, offering a rich and immersive experience that transports players to the magical realm of Hogwarts.The attention to detail in the world-building is nothing short of astonishing. From the grand castle and its various classrooms, to the bustling Hogsmeade village and Forbidden Forest, the game captures the essence of the Harry Potter universe with aplomb. And the character customization options are simply spellbinding, allowing players to craft their own unique experience and become the wizard or witch they've always dreamed of, thus making it truly your legacy.What truly surprised me was the fun and fast-paced combat system. The game offers a variety of spells and abilities, each with their own unique animations and sound effects. The fluidity and excitement of the combat is truly a sight to behold, and is sure to leave even the most jaded gamers spellbound.All in all, Hogwarts Legacy is a game that is not only a must-play for fans of the Harry Potter franchise, but also for gamers looking for an intelligent and captivating RPG experience. It's a game that will leave you enchanted, bewitched, and begging for more. So grab your wand, put on your cloak, and get ready for the adventure of a lifetime at the most magical school of all- Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
2054,Jaevwyn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaevwyn/,2,,1,52.1,February,11,340,0,1,"Lets get the sticking points out of the way. Yes the game has a trans character. Yes your character is referred to at all times with they/them pronouns. GET OVER IT.Now the game itself! absolutely loving my time spent thus far, the castle is full of little secrets and hidden things to find, i think theres a convincing amount of life in the NPC's to allow yourself to immerse into the game and lots to find outside of the castle too. I recently got access to being able to capture Magical Beasts, and also learned that there are ""Shiny"" (differently coloured) beasts, so my story and side quests are on hold whilst i play hogwarts themed pokemon for the next 10 hours. The games performance is far from perfect, even on my respectable system, but doing the quick DLS fix (look it up in the forums) has helped a ton with that. The camera is very vertically restrictive when flying which can be a bit tedious in places, but flying as a whole is very satisfying... gorgeous views! The combat is very fun, the way to combo spells to keep enemies airborne is a good time, the downside is that a lot of enemies kinda just stand around whilst you do this... I am playing on hard and only use health pots during bosses and am not struggling at all, it is satisfying still at least.The puzzles and objects that can be interacted with are a nice break from everything else going on around you, I have found a few times now that sometimes I do not have the right spell for the job, encouraging me to revisit areas keeping each comb through an area feeling very fresh.I have tried a few of the mini games, such as setting times on the broom or summoners court, and enjoy the gimmicks in those, hoping to see more of them! I very much enjoy the Harry Potter franchise, regardless or the political issues surrounding it, but feel as if this game can definitely be enjoyed by people new to the franchise too.The biggest downside of this game is the damn steam forums, its a toxic cesspool. Avoid at all costs."

2056,Twee Sesamzaadje,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016994587/,2,,1,53.1,February,11,119,0,1,"This is one of the few games where a long introduction to the mechanics isn't annoying at all.Even tho it's a totally different game, the overall feel takes me back to the old Fable 1 days.So far, the world feels alive, with lots of small animations and rewarding exploration/visuals. At heart, it is still your typical modern open world game, but it's done right.Good voice acting and movie like cut scenes. Overall it is better than I expected. It does not feel rushed and authentic enough to the IP (I admit the IP does boosts the games fun ratio a lot here). But as with all open world games, some XP farming mini quests e.g. pressing 'revelio' at a specific place, get a bit tedious over time. The battle system feels solid and as long as you time your doges and blocks right, there is lots of freedom about how to use your other spells/potions/plants. I think hard mode is pretty forgiving and should be treated as the default difficulty for most players. Going for the other modes for a more chill experience.Puzzles in quests are fine, a bit BoTW style, but the internal dialogue is bit too hand-holding for my tastes. Sometimes, in quests when I'm just looking at the nice scenery for a few seconds, I get this voice-over solving the puzzle already. Many puzzles in the open-world could have been far more interesting, but I think they went for the ""fun for all ages"" approach here. It would be nice to see what the mod community can do here over time.Mouse and keyboard controls are good, for a console optimized game, with the exception of broom-flight. Why did they choose helicopter controls with dedicated hoover up and down buttons when you could immersively fly up and down with your mouse :((There is already a mod solving this)I have experienced a few small bugs and glitches and one bigger where I had to restart the game and a bugged quest. But non too bad as the auto-save is on point, but I hope they will release a patch soon to fix fps drops after using the revelio spell in the castle. Outside of the castle it's fine.The internal dialogue bugs a lot, saying irrelevant things to places already visited. Saying things like ""I wonder who lives here"" when you pass a house where you know the person inside. Deek can relate to dialogue bugs as well.The loot system is a bit weird, you can find super legendary items on the street and common items behind two locked doors in a locked chest. Only really rewarding appearance unlocks.I would have liked to see a bit more student life, making classes a bigger thing, to differentiate from other open-world games. The player character is above it all and feels more like a visitor, but with all the privileges in the school they wished for.Lastly, Lets hope they improve the gear management, you spend a LOT of time deleting obsolete items this really is a hassle, as you get a lots of gear. It would be nice if we could toggle appearance per gear slot instead of per gear item, or even save different appearance-sets."

In my 25 years of gaming there has been only one other game that has gotten me so emotional I had to put the controller down and compose my self for a moment. Being able to finally explore Hogwarts is a dream come true for a child of the 90s and early 2000s. I never expected this incredible level of exploration and detail.

A magical place that would call upon you to a fill void that no one else could fill. Finally, a visit from a particular yet mysterious owl and a letter of acceptance from the school of Hogwarts of witchcraft and Wizardly, your time has come to fulfill your role as a student. But more importantly, you will come to find that you are no average student. More layers are hidden under your name and what lies within your blood. Go and discover what path awaits you.I have played for 10 hours now and although I have not completed merely 20 percent of the main mission, I am already impressed with the story and game play. I will not ruin anything for the readers but let them know that these developers team spent well over the required hours to make this game special. -So far the game play has been super smooth and only once or twice has there been lag on the cut scenes and once or twice on bots roaming around vanishing or getting stuck in the wall. -The story is bloody brilliant keeping me engaged from the start. Choices don't seem to matter as much in the game. The only difference will be who you go with or the response. I think there is one or two heavy choices you will have to make at some point. -Plenty of choices when it comes to creating your character and other features such as House and Wand in the beginning. Throughout the game I've found that you can keep your stats from the items and apparel you found but can change the appearance from previous items that were discovered and discarded or sold. -Detail in the game is wonderfully overwhelming and I know I will be spending hours just looking at the art and architecture. There is always something going on around you and plenty of conversations to overhear or eavesdrop.-Voice acting is phenomenal and so unique to each character you come in contact with. Purely engaging and I'm never bored with any conversations I interact with. -Astronomical amount of missions/side missions and quests that keeps you busy and it takes me 5 minuets just to get to the end of the hall because i'm so intrigue with what could be around a statue or painting. However, recently found out that each house has different side missions and characters and that not all houses have the same amount of side mission content.-Music is mesmerizing and it has truly brought back an nostalgic feeling from the movies. They have also nailed sound effects.-The map so far is ginormous and I haven't even seen everything within the four hours I've played. The graphics are great and are showing no signs of glitches at the moment. Flying on the broom is pretty rad and the movements for that is also fun and easy to do. -Inventory and logistics are fun to use and easy to navigate. I've had no issues going through it.I write this review even though it may be too early for some to write. I am very impressed with the originality to create an authentic peace of art when so much of it has been done already. It takes a true passionate team and the hard work with the blood, sweat, and tears to make a game as well as this. Whether I do end up finding some flaws in future it will be well worth the time and money to wait for it to be fixed. I don't mind being patient with it because I am already happy with the result and appreciate what was made here.Don't think twice. Think...Double the Trouble if you are on the fence of whether this game could be right for you. Grab your broom and your wand and let your imagination fly you into a world that we love so dear. Cast yourself into a role that only you can muster and decide whether you can finish a magical adventure of a lifetime. 10/10 -Luke"

Have been streaming the first 72 Hours of gameplay for Early Access until now and honestly was not expecting it to be as good as it is. With how games are these days being hyped up over social media can lead to over expectations, This one was a home run in the gaming community.Coming from playing the old PS1-PS2 Movie Titles to this is breathtaking and not only that but a breath of fresh air. It's not only coming from an origin standpoint but they took it a step further and included the Wizarding World lore from the books even more than the movies. I honestly will not understand how anyone can NOT enjoy how magical/amazing this game is ""unless you just hate imagination and harry potter -_-"" if so you're missing out on a phenomenal experience. Apart from the occasional stability issue that will most likely get patched out and a few normal bugs here and there that you can help fix by updating your DLSS (Games runs on the 2.3 version 😳😳), I have been able to constantly stream it on a 2060 Super with a Ryzen 5 with no problem, and it's beyond beautiful with Reshade as well.

2066,Floyd Collins,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rlex/,2,,1,55.9,February,12,"1,155",0,1,"Turns out you can release completely working game from the start. Surprise, ain't it, CDPR? This game is amazing and i enjoyed (almost) every minute of it. I'm not even a huge fan of HP, i enjoyed books back in the day, i loved movies, but i hasn't dug deep into lore and all that stuff. Also, i will try to not spoil it, so won't go into details where it can get spoilery.I'd start with bad parts because everyone loves criticism.1) Facial animations in many scenes can be better.2) Voice pitch sounds awful. Better leave it on middle to not sound like a robot.3) RTX can be better too. Enable RTX shadows and disable everything else.4) World can surely use more random phrases and dialogues to make it feel more alive. While there is some nice dialogues you can listen to, they get repetitive pretty quick.5) While fighting is fun, encounters themselves are pretty repetitive and quickly become boring. Enemy variety can be better.6) Menus can use less animations. It looks great for first 5 minutes, then it's just waste of time.7) Can be more actual, you know, school stuff. You only get to enjoy one time in every class, then it's just short cutscenes. Not that i'm fan of persona time-management game, but...8) Stealth sequences are pretty meh. It's useful, but it's done pretty bad. Also, while not exactly an issue, some arachnophobic people like me will agree with Sebastian - the only good spider is a dead (or better, extinct) spider. Sadly, you can't turn them off, so prepare to face your fears.Now, for good parts.1) World is beautiful. It's surely one of the best open-world games i played. Amazing scenery, nor books nor movies said what's it's like just outside of Hogwarts (except Forbidden Forest and Hogsmeade parts). Apparently there is whole world waiting for you! It's great to learn more about it. It will be both sad and happy stories.2) Every collectible you find tells you a little story, a little bit of lore, it's not some boring ""collect 100 items"" stuff (looking at you, Ubisoft). It doesn't feel like a slog.3) Absolutely amazing side stories with your pals. For example, one of characters is from Uganda and it was great to learn about her story and customs. Every character is _very_ different and tells _very_ different story. They are extremely diverse, from love-all-living-things part to pretty grim, ""lost everything"" desperate person. I daresay their side quests were better than main story. Every time i received owl about side quests i instantly headed to that side quest.4) ""Your own house"" part. Beautifully integrated into both game and lore. Building, pets, crafting, etc etc etc.5) And pets, yeah, it's whole different story.6) Transmog from the start. You hear that, cyberpunk and witcher? Your character can look good while wearing trash clothes!7) Very nice, greatly done puzzles. They're not too hard, not too easy, just a perfect balance inbetween.8) Exploration is great. If you think some good stuff will be there, it will be there. It's on same tier as zelda: breath of the wild. Can't recall last time i got so excited just by exploring random places.9) Skill tree won't force you to pick up some specific skills, just pick whatever you use. Fancy using some specific spells in your fights? Go for it, game won't limit you to some specific meta builds, because _anything_ is useful.10) Main story is pretty good, too. I wouldn't call it amazing, but it definitely kept me interested till the end."

Hufflepuff. Ravenclaw. Slytherin. Long ago, the four houses studied together in (mostly) harmony. Then everything changed when the dark wizards attacked. Only a powerful wizard, master of ancient magic, could stop them. But when the world needed one most, they vanished. Hundreds of years have passed, and the Keepers discovered the player, a new 5th year at Hogwarts. And although their magical skills are great, they have a lot to learn before they're ready to save anyone. But I believe the player can save the wizarding world.*Hedwig's Theme plays in the distance*I was one of the people who played the movie adaptation games in the early 2000s. Chamber of Secrets on PS2 was the first open world game I ever played and I absolutely adored it; with my enjoyment of it being the candle I held all other open world games to, until RDR2 came along. I've waited over 20 years for a new Wizarding World game to overtake CoS, and honestly didn't think it would ever happen. I was wrong.This game can be called a Harry Potter spin-off, however I admit that the story and world of Hogwarts Legacy are so convincing and intriguing that you will legitimately forget Harry Potter ever existed while playing. The entire experience felt not only genuine in every way to the Wizarding World, but it stood entirely on it's own as a masterpiece. Being a Wizarding World fan, like me, without a doubt adds to your enjoyment of the game. However, even someone completely turned off to the books/movies can fully appreciate this remarkable, densely packed, made-with-love experience.You can call me the Professor Binns of Hogwarts Legacy reviews.I could write a 20 page essay on my entire thoughts on this game, the good and the bad, and would still have more to say. I could make an Angry Joe review look like a YouTube Short in comparison. However, unfortunately, there's a character limit on Steam reviews, making it impossible to bore you to tears like many students experience in history class at Hogwarts (WHICH YOU CAN ATTEND BTW). My final remarks are that this game is without a doubt worth every penny of the full price, and I hope dearly that this is not the last we will see of Avalanche delving into the Wizarding World. Avalanche have proven themselves as a more than competent, driven, hard-working collection of highly talented industry professionals who are not afraid to put all of their love into creating the best experience possible; even when that experience is far more than most studios would consider adequate."

The gameplay loop is extremely repetitive and predictable, the sidequests are just copy pastes of the same boring go here get this loop. Lack luster amount of spells. All in all unless you're really a fan of harry potter this game isn't worth buying unless hugely discounted"
2069,Wladaas,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wladaas/,3,,1,44.7,February,11,442,0,1,"I wouldnt recommend this game  if you are not die-hard harry potter fan and just wanna play wizard man game, wait for discount.Now lets talk about game:- Open world design is the same design as ubisoft games, collect ♥♥♥♥ / destroy camps. Also it doesnt really feel like you are exploring the world, the things are on the minimap and map itself, you are just going from point to other point.- Story is interesting but it ramps up late, beginning of the game is kinda slow, tons of dialogue.- Combat is fun, you can have 4 bars unlocked with talents, and each bar can hold 4 spells you can also swap bars in combat, which makes total 16 spells. Each spell has its own use, i think its more than enough for this game.- It has some performance issues, not too big though i was expecting it anyways. TLDR: Buy it if you are die-hard harry potter fan, wait for discount if you just wanna play wizard man game."

The game is absolutely worth it! The world is full and unbelievably rich as all WB open world games typically are. You actually feel like you are there and a student at Hogwarts. The game even allows you to pursue the dark arts if you choose. I love it! It's funny. All of the controversy surrounding this game and Rowling is ""Somewhat"" justified given her chosen discourse on platforms like twitter, however; The game is more than inclusive. There is just about every possible way of life and race in the game. From heterosexual to transgender and gay, the game is inclusive an welcoming to all kinds. It's clear to me that Rowling and WB are not on the same page here, and that is a good thing."
2071,WHITEFOX★,https://steamcommunity.com/id/whitefoxdarling/,2,,1,123.5,February,20,98,0,1,"Good game. The first 30 hours were very magical and nostalgic. However, the magic and wonder of Hogwarts wore off for me around halfway through the completion of the Merlin Trials. Those were more tedious than challenging. I am also stuck with 33/34 Bell Tower Revelio pages due to a bug, which is a bit of a downer when you're at end game and on that completionist vibe.The world is fun to explore and the attention to detail is exceptional. However it did feel a little empty in the three furthermost regions of the map.I didn't end up using the ground mounts as they felt clunky and annoying compared to the broom -Although the final ground mount you acquire IS very fun! The empty regions I mentioned above do actually make a good place to roam/bulldoze for a while on that mount because of the huge open spaces.I don't think I will create a character from a different house straight away. It will probably be in the future when I want that nostalgic feeling again."

2074,Lunarscribe,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017968111/,11,,0,102.5,February,17,219,2,1,"Now at 100+ hours. There are still a few positives to this game. Unfortunately the cons are still glaring enough for me to not to recommend purchase...allow me to elaborate.Pros:1. A seemingly vast world to explore - When it was teased that you would be able to fly to anyplace you could see...I admit I was skeptical. However it seems my skepticism for the most part was unfounded, and delightfully so! It is true if you can see it you can fly there for the most part. Of course there are boundaries that are in place to keep players inside the rendered world. That is simply a limitation of gaming we must at present accept. 2. A fully realized and expansive Hogwarts Castle - I commend the developers, art team, and coding team for the painstaking time it must have took to create Hogwarts within the confines of today's technology! Points for all houses! The numerous little nooks and crannies of Wizarding Lore kept me busy searching for hours! Well Done!3. Meaningful choices - this becomes a touchy subject as there were times I was glad that the options seemed to favor a more cooperative approach toward others even if the choice sounded cold and apathetic. As a Ravenclaw, I felt obligated sometimes to inform some that their choices didn't take all options into account, but wanted to do so with an understanding tact. Though I must admit, were I playing a sinister Slytherin this would have infuriated me to no end. To not be allowed to be as devious and diabolical as possible; would leave me feeling that my choices truly were not my own. That instead of interacting with the world as was promised, I was yet again simply watching another Harry Potter film.4. In regards to Required space - Again I must congratulate the teams on their diligence and hard work! The Room of Requirement feels alive and acquiescent to most of my needs. Sometimes though it felt a little too acquiescent. Once one gathers the spellcrafts for the refining table, the hopping pots, and the cutting tables one begins to wonder why one would need leave the Room of Requirement. Not to mention once the Vivariums are unlocked. A meticulous and resourceful Witch or Wizard would find nearly all they need inside the Room of requirement. Save for a few ingredients, however as the Room is supposed to provide anything the student ""requires"" I must defer to J.K. Rowling and give this a Pro designation as the room does exactly as advertised! The only other thing I could nitpick the Room of Requirement for would be the lack of space to decorate, and seeing as how I wanted to spend more time in the Room I consider this to be indicative of a net positive!Cons:1. My how time flies - I was elated to see the Jack-o-lanterns floating inside the great hall! I could almost smell the pumpkin pasties and the butterbeer! I wanted so much to simply spend time sitting in the Great Hall having a good nosh and a chin wag with my fellow Ravenclaws...however there was one niggling little quest I wanted to clear out before I could feel accomplished enough to have some down time. Once finished I was returned to my room only to wake and find that snow had covered the ground and the pumpkins were gone. Replaced by garland, lights, and holly.  Overachieving sometimes does not mean overall enjoyment! I place this at the top as close as I can to the Pros as it was more my fault than anything else, though I do wish the game would have warned you that the season was about to change and hence allowed you to stay a little while longer.2. A friend in need... - Though I enjoyed the friendship quests immensely I felt left with a sense of eh at the end. I shall not spoil endings for others but suffice it to say the climax and the conclusion of most felt rushed and half baked. Points from all houses for causing me to care for someone; only to be summarily forgotten by those that called me a Friend for Life.3. Diminishing a return - Again I won't spoil an ending for anyone but suffice it to say taking the spotlight off a great achievement in gaming is a no no. To not reward the player for a hard fought win, but making them feel as though they wished they never embarked upon a journey is the antithesis of good game design. However the worst thing a designer can do would be to have other non-player characters never again mention the sacrifice or heroism of the character and only laud the obligatory NPC that followed along.4. Pockets full of potions...and other such things - Inventory management was half my game play. I was actually punished for not clearing out my inventory! I had recently learned Alohamora and was happily unlocking all things bound when I came upon a door. I unlocked it and inside was a large chest that I knew would give legendary gear. I opened it immediately knowing that whatever it was it would be a boon to help me in my coming quests...Only to be told I had no room for more gear. I quickly deleted a green hat I had been holding onto to sell once I had returned to a vendor; alas once the space was cleared the chest was already opened and did not reset as lower tier chests do. The gear that lay in wait inside had simply vanished with no option to get it back. That began my obsessive compulsive need to always open my Field Guide and delete anything of lesser or lower value. This is not how I wan't to be spending my time at Hogwarts. I'm a witch not someone's house elf taking stock of inventory!5. In Lew of flight - I have changed this con because another more important Con should be addressed. The lack of player agency! You will see I was concerned with my Ravenclaw using the Unforgivable curses...However now that I am on to a Slytherin play-through I have found it doesn't matter a wand waver's wit if you throw Avada Kadavra around as if you're a drunk chucking beads in the French Quarter on Mardis Gras! Go wild Hufflepuffs! Your sweet charming reputations won't be harmed one bit! 6. The procurement pension of a Pack-rat - I wasn't sure whether I was playing Hogwarts or Pokemon. With all the collecting in this game I feel that was the only mechanic that was completely fleshed out. Collect pages, collect spellcrafts, collect upgrades, collect ingredients, collect moonstone, collect pets, collect my sanity at the next Revelio cast it needs a break. This truly was a game only meant to give the player information about set pieces found in the world, combat and quests seemed to be an afterthought.7. You're a gambler Harry! - Because the chests give rewards based on a random loot table you may find a level three upgrade right out of the gate, or you may not find a useful upgrade until you are nearly finished with the game. This directly inhibits the players style. I found plenty of cursing upgrades but my Ravenclaw detests the Dark Arts! Not that she didn't learn the curses. Sun Tzu and all...but she would never use them! Thus these upgrades are not only worthless to my character but tempts me to change my style of play because I don't know when I will get better upgrades. If the devs simply placed appropriate gear in appropriate places or made upgrades something the player creates this would have been an easy Pro.7. A tale as old as...never mind its done move along - Again I will not spoil for others...My complaint is that with something as large as the main quests seems to want to take on; the climax and ending do not even equate to the subject matter. There is plenty of build up then in the blink of an eye it is over and dealt with. The Main story line was rushed it was hastily thrown together and the player can feel it. There is no sense of gravitas. There is no sense of impending doom, or threat around every corner. There is no more substance to them than go here and wham-o! Ok, now that that's done; back to class everyone! It was sad and completely forgettable! Were I Rowling I would disown this bit of storytelling would that someone could call it that."

Every time I try to put myself to play this, it just doesn't keep me interactive enough to play long time or without yawning before I press play button. Cutscenes are nice, but the lack of good gameplay, and the unnecessary gear system that doesn't fit into the game, are the worst things that can pull a great game from S tier to medium. Such as we saw DEVs commentary about Suicide Squad game by Rocksteady. (Which fell like rock to bottom of lake, and fans, from both DC-Comics and overall players, has taken this with big disappointment.)   But back to Hogwarts Legacy... I haven't even played this more than 20 hours and already game spoils all the spells you can learn in both, spell list and perks tree. Why??? These could have been put into side quests or found from dangerous dungeons or something more fun than boring RPG tasks, -""Go kill 2 frogs while you drink this potion and I will teach you something kiddo... Oh, did you finish the quest, which didn't help anyone? GOOD, now you can freeze people, no need to thank me, have fun kiddo"", WHAT IS THIS LOGIC?! From AAA titled game I expected something smart, fun, disgusting, awesome, ANYTHING that keeps me entertained the whole time and cannot wait to go play again... but sadly non of the new big game development teams doesn't give me these feelings. Why do you publish these half solid piece of chocolate bars? No one likes the loose part. Keep games together or they end up like this.PS. ""Do you live a good life, or do you hide the truth from yourself to live false life"" -philosophy of meaning of life. I myself am living a false life with Cyberpunk just because I want to believe for the better. But not with Hogwarts Legacy. If you want make pretty games, make them into point and click games and stop wasting time to make AIs to fight against you etc."

Yeah? So, to my fellow progressives, let's not turn into them and their censorious ways. J.K. Rowling, of course, is an ignorant bigot, who denies basic sociological and scientific academic consensus. But If you're mature enough, you should be capable of separating the art from the artist. Don't feel guilty about buying this based solely on the royalty collector. You'll be supporting the devs, the majority of whom are trans allies. This is a great game."

Majority of other things is going through similarly looking scenery, fighting the same types of enemies over and over. As for fighting itself, it's nothing too special. Difficulty-wise, Hard wasn't a challenge. The game will just throw you damage sponges in bigger numbers, hoping you can't evade them all. PC optimization, honestly, sucks. If you must buy it, do it on a console, it probably runs better over there without having to install plugins or mess with quality settings to reach somewhat stable FPS count.I do not recommend this game at the current price.

2086,Xestoch,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MonsterHideout/,2,,1,67.0,February,25,450,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a pretty fantastic game if you are a harry potter fan or otherwise great too if you are just into magic and whimsy, comes without saying really.The open world is gorgeous and have occasional fun little events and tidbits to keep your wandering around the place entertaining, from honking flowers to animated dragon bushes and students bickering or being up to something in the more NPC populated areas etc, generally bringing life into the world.However like any open world game, said world is also crammed full with collectibles which on their own isn't the worst, they're there to keep you entertained, but there's not many variations of them so after for example the 5th same merlin 'puzzle', one might find the magic having worn off pretty fast.That said i wish NPC's reacted more to things you do, you can cast forbidden curses all you want around them and they wont really care or you can wander around at night in the castle without getting so much as in any trouble at all, which is unfortunate. None of the friends you get through out the story care if you learn the forbidden spells, save for just the two present in the spell learning sidequest and even then that is barely.The story is a bit jank at times too, there is what feels like a lot of 'jumps' where you go from learning a spell at class to suddenly being tossed into a big bad dungeon in search for more ancient magic when there could had been more fluff inbetween and the ending i got had no significant impact on the game whatsoever, it just became business as usual etc.I found the combat to be pretty enjoyable, simple, but it worked for me. You got your goon flicking basic magic projectiles as their default attack and over the course of your time at Hogwarts you learn more spells that you can weave into combos, like exploding your target, turning them into a barrel or cast the equivalent of g u n(a.k.a avada kadavra), enemies also put shields onto themselves which you have to break with the corresponding spell of that type, red beats red etc. The only big downside i found is that combat get way too easy especially once you hit the higher levels, which in turn have the fights be over way too soon and there is no new game+(as of writing this) so there is no way to bump up the health and levels of the enemies you are fighting once you hit that max.Despite some of the jank, i personally i recommend the game, but i have a more heavy lean into the whole magic and fantasy theme so if you are not into that, you might not have as great a time."

Rarely had any issues playing with DLSS and max settings, same goes with max settings with RT. However RT does a lot of eye candy and playing the game without it is a better experience for me but RT in video scenes are very nice.Gameplay wise, spell casting and spell combos are very amazing. A lot of combinations and a lot of versatility for what you want to do. Enemies are not a slouch either. Hardest difficulty provides a lot of challenges and enemies does spell combos same as you. Dodging and blocking almost feels like Elden Ring. However repetitive quests are such a drag, especially if you want to 100% everything.The main story, side quest stories and NPC stories are very well done. Nostalgic with a ton of maturity. It shows you how dangerous and dark the wizarding world is while showing you how fun it is being a student in Hogwarts. Story pace is fine and rarely any plot holes present.In conclusion, if you grew up a HP fan, you'll love the game. If you love open world, Elden ring like gameplay, you'll love the game. However it's single player only. Would love to have a feature like Elden Ring where you have the option to play with friend. A minor nitpick for a great game. Early Game of the Year contender for sure."

I'm right now waiting for the shaders to load, but I'll be able to post this review before it's finished.On an average, it takes the game 3-4 minutes to open. There are no loading screens in the game itself unless you teleport, but opening the map/inventory/etc. takes a long time. Movement is very clumsy and annoying. Even though it's called Hogwarts Legacy, there's not much to do inside Hogwarts, most of the gameplay takes place outside. The characters are a little bit strange, the story has questionable elements and I don't think it's well thought-out. Basically, don't play this game for the story. I loved the fighting mechanics, the spells are fun and engaging. However, because of the lag it's hard to do anything. I can't even hope to ever finish an arena because of the stuttering. I regret playing this game, trying to ignore the issues because now I can't refund it anymore. You will run out of time for the refund before you begin the true gameplay. Therefore, even though it's a fun game, I can't recommend it."

WAIT TO BUY THIS GAME AFTER IT HAS BEEN PATCHED TO A SATISFACTORY STATE! I'm sure it will be worth the money after a few patches, but as it stands now, even the day one patch hasn't helped it much.Major review outlets led me to believe this game had only minor bugs, however most reviewers only received PS5 codes. If they had received PC codes, I'm sure most of these issues would have been pointed out.This game is extremely buggy. In my short time of playing this game (and aside from all the doors having constant loading screens that take you out of the immersion): I've crashed 3 times, experienced random frame drops down to the 20's, and can't even stream the game on discord to show my friends how awesome this game looks. I attribute some of the performance issues to the fact that Nvidia has not released drivers for this game YET. From what I've seen online, the release version most of us downloaded at launch includes the day one patch, but this hasn't seem to help much.Initially, I thought it was my PC that was causing these issues, but quick looks at reddit and YouTube show that it isn't just me. On a 3070 and Ryzen 9 3900x, these issues just shouldn't be happening. Turning down the graphics settings or enabling Nvidia DLSS have done nothing to mitigate the technical performance issues that have plagued my experience.I'm sure that this game will become far more optimized in just a few short months, but I think its important for people to know that, while the game is playable, it doesn't exactly run as I feel it should. Buy this game in a couple of weeks, or even after a couple of months, but hold off on it until then, as even cyberpunk didn't run this horribly on my pc at launch."

I built this computer two years ago and have kept it in good condition. Elden Ring looks like a far more demanding game and I can run it fine, but I can't take 2 steps in Hogwarts (literally inside the in-game school) before the game starts stuttering. Some people can play games that way, but I simply can't. I have tried lowering the settings to the game's ""recommended"" settings and still have issues. And this is before the infamous Hogsmeade area where people are reporting notorious issues with stuttering etc. The game looks really fun, and I would gladly support it otherwise.

End game gear is easy to acquire, rare components for crafting are easy to acquire, and once you do, you can forever more produce these like a wizard sweat shop.Dark magic is very op, makes the game even easier, and enemies can't use the 3 unforgivable curses against you, which kinda blows, making the game even easier.All in all, very fun experience, but a limited experience."

Fine.I've only played 12 hours but I'm enjoying the game quite a bit. I have a GeForce 1070 card and the game looks great and I'm sure it'll only look better on higher-end systems. I like running around the open world and I haven't experienced any game or immersion-breaking bugs except a weird voice bug for an ugly ancillary character.

The game time is well measured with over 60h and does not feel too long, yet you miss after completion of the story clearly a few meaningful occupations (However, the developer will not milk the cow completely empty immediately. Surely there will be 2-3 more games from the franchise to expand the lore). A clear buy recommendation from me for fans of Harry Potter and action adventures."

Hands down best Harry Potter combat system ever created. I wish there were more customization options for your characters, and I wish that the wand core, length, wood, etc actually affected the appearance or feel of the wand (Like maybe a hidden passive for certain core types would have been quite unique). Love how all outfits obtained are saved as cosmetic appearances you can use even after selling said gear.

The good things: Great music, great voice acting, great replica of Hogwarts and Hogsmead.The bad: everything else. They advertised immersive world. The world is static and hollow. You can't interact with anything or anyone, except for quest givers, vendors and uninspired and boring ""puzzles"" and loot chests (which are mostly giving you junk). They advertised friendships. The friendship in the game is going from quest marker to quest marker while you listen to the current NPC talking to you. But only in those quests where they need help, everywhere else you are on your own. Do you remember that warm and fuzzy feeling when you were watching the movies and Harry was just hanging out with his friends, eating, talking, having fun? You're not going to get that feeling from this game.They advertised attending classes. Well, you are forced to attend a cutscene of a class a couple of times if you want to have a side quest finished. And you can attend tutorials that are happening during a class a couple of times as main quests. They advertised THE DARK ARTS, and how it's going to have consequences to use them. Not only you learn those spells very late in the game, you can't even use them in most boss fights in the story missions, you can't cast them randomly on anyone or anything, and most of all, nobody gives a flying F if you are using it.The gameplay is typical Ubisoft style ""get busy with grinding the same thing over and over again"". And you better do that, you have to grind the boring rinse and repeat bandit camps, ""puzzles"", ""trials"" and revelio button mash page collections, because if you don't hit lvl34 (and no, you don't hit that level by playing the main story), you are locked from getting the true ending. They literally not allow you to finish the game without grinding. And you can't even enjoy a ""clean"" world, because the bandit/spider/troll camps just respawn all the enemies back once you leave. And they even broke lore and immersion by forcing you to grind to get ""stronger"" versions of Alohomora to open more doors. And on top of that they added a F-ing ""lockpick"" minigame because simply casting a spell to open doors are not enough, they have to make it extra tedious to artificially inflate play time But the worst advertisement is ""ultimately decide the fate of the wizarding world"". You don't decide that, you don't decide anything. Yes, you get some choices but they have little to no effect. The difference between the good and evil ending is a slightly different cutscene, and then the game moves on like nothing happened, so even that has absolutely no meaning. Anyone saying that this is the Harry Potter game that they always wanted are either in complete denial or simply fanatical fans or just never played a good game in their lives."
2147,ONEGREATFIRE,https://steamcommunity.com/id/onegreatfire/,4,,1,46.3,February,17,51,0,1,"I'm not a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I never read the books, but I've seen the movies, and I enjoy them. Well, this game has blown me away. I get goosebumps every time I play this game, the story, visuals, combat, everything works fantastically. I have been bored with gaming over the past few years and have been installing a game in my library, play it for and hour then quit and uninstall. I thought I was done with gaming until now. I've played 23 hours as of writing and have yet to find anything I don't like about this game. Portkey Games knocked it out of the park on this title. This game truly feels like a final and complete game at launch, unlike most games these days that ship in an unfinished state, this game has minimal issues and in my experience thus far have yet to run into any game breaking bug, the game did hard crash once but that was near the end of a 12 hour play session. I feel like if a day one release title plays solidly for 12 hours straight and the biggest issue I had was the game hard crashed at 6:30 am, that is acceptable. I am in love with this title and recommend it everyone I know. If you are on the fence about committing to a game, or feel like you have fallen out of love with games, give this one a try. I can't speak highly enough about how engrossed I become with the story, the visuals, character interactions. Hogwarts Legacy, IMO, is the GOLD STANDARD for games in 2023 and beyond. I chose to purchase on steam vs console because my PC is a last gen enthusiast machine. I'm using a Ryzen 5900x on a Corsair 360mm AIO w/six Noctua NF-F12 industrialPPC fans in push pull config, EVGA RTX 3090 FTW Ultra Hybrid 240mm AIO w/four Phanteks T30 Fans running in a push pull config, CL17 4000 DDR4, EVGA DARK X570 MOBO, and x2 WD SN850x m.2 nvme ssd in Raid 0. All that being said, running this title on ULTRA settings with RT OFF at 2560x1440, I see 1% lows around ~75 fps with average frames ~100. When I change settings to HIGH, ~120 1% lows and average around ~185 fps. The dips only occur when transitioning from indoors to outside and vice versa. If I didn't have such a powerful PC I would have bought this title on console, but the visual differences are night and day on pc compared to console. If you have a mid to high end PC, buy this title on Steam, if you are rocking older hardware, and have an Xbox Series X or PS5 then buy it on console. If you are on the fence about this game, don't be, it is a masterpiece. I have yet to find someone playing this game who doesn't like it, everyone raves about this game and for good reason. If you have any questions or comments about this review, drop a comment, I am willing and happy to discuss anything with you folks. Hogwarts Legacy 10/10 Would Recommend!!!!

I couldnt get used to the characters and i usually don't make negative reviews but this game is sooo overrated. Combat is repetitive, foes are repetitive, puzzles are repetitive and u cant feel the action. I played at hardest difficulty but still it's so casual. There could be different bosses in main story at least. You fight versions of same bosses over and over. It's a disappointment for me."
2157,Pontypine | ティファ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pontypine/,2,,1,65.3,March,17,256,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy takes you deep into the magical world of Harry Potter with the stunning recreation of the school of witchcraft and wizardry 10/10 for that. Some negative about the world building and everything in it, it's a collector's dream. That's not for everyone for sure, there is a lot of repetition and the map is quite big with not as much variety as there should be. I enjoyed the collecting myself, as I really like collecting things, but it's definitely something that you need to be aware of.There is a great amount of customizing when creating your own witch or wizard, with good range of skin colors and cosmetics and even a way to change the pitch of the voice options. Changing the pitch does make the voice sound a little bit robotic in my opinion, but it isn't too bad, and is a nice addition. You also have your own ""homebase"" that you can decorate and customize with a lot of options. The combat is nice and smooth, but can be easily exploitable, especially after you receive the unforgivable curses. There is a way to heal spam and the AI of the enemies is not that smart which makes the combat sometimes really, really easy. Sadly the named foes and quest bosses lack in uniqueness with no real variety in their combat abilities or behavior either. The story progression feels surprisingly smooth and portrays the growth of the main character very well where you get to hone your talents and improve. The progress of time is very well portrayed with the changing seasons and the day and night cycle. The main story itself is quite interesting, but has an underwhelming finale that leaves you wondering how your choices affected the other characters around you. There is also some inconsistencies that are minor annoyances, like if you use an unforgivable curse in public, no one bats an eye. Your friends do mention that they do not like you using them if you are fighting with them, but otherwise there is no real repercussions for them, which makes them less unforgivable.A great variety of side characters in the game that are very well built and are quite likable and unique from each other. The writing of the friendship quests is interesting and shows the growth of the main character's friends as well as how it affects the main character themselves. Is this game worth it then? Yes, absolutely. It's a fantastic game, filled with content and is definitely the best game made of the franchise up to date, in my opinion. There is certain political issues regarding the game, but you can enjoy the game and still not support those ideals.As an ending note, I want to add that be you a man, a woman or anything in-between or outside of, you are loved. You are appreciated by me and many others and I hope that you get to live your life the way you want to live it. ❤️"

Even If you're someone who's not into Harry Potter Franchise but love Magic and Fantasy Genre, you'll absolutely love this. As for Potterheads, this is a heaven where you get to finally experience what it's like to be a witch/wizard in your coveted yet fictional world.

Есть мнение, что игра для фанатов ГП, и отчасти оно верное, но лишь отчасти, так как сама игра опирается на мир, который описан в книгах и фильмах. Визуал у игры потрясающий. На столько, что 16гб ОЗУ иногда будет мало, но оно того стоит.А больше и придумать ничего не могу, действительно хорошая игра, даже несмотря на то, что за последние годы было буквально 2 игры с хорошим открытым миром (за последние 5 лет точно). Геймплей приятный, персонажем управлять одно удовольствие, разве что боевка немного (полностью) основана на циферках, а точнее урон наносимый и урон получаемый. За исключением некоторых моментов, за 50+ часов регулярных боев душно было только вначале, когда мозг пытался принять факт, что щит на врагах висит постоянно, на на моём персонаже лишь секунду, и вообще Протего - это скорее механика парирования, чем защитное заклинание, но игровая условность, хаваем без выбора.Сам открытый мир чуток разочаровал. Конечно полной симуляции я и не ждал, но в местной общяге ночью НПС просто исчезают, все кровати пусты. Однако, как декорации все выглядит почти убедительно (есть персонажи, для которых можно выполнить квест, после которого они реагируют на ГГ, когда он проходит мимо них, а сама их реакция зависит от выбора в конце квеста (можно отыграть мразоту, но тут нет системы репутации, так что это будет просто фраза и не более)). А ещё тут можно использовать Авада Кедавру, прикольная штука, жаль, что запрещена.Кстати, я проходил игру за Пуффендуй (лучший факультет, сори факт)."
2167,Monstarcookie,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045716473/,2,,1,102.2,March,1,811,1,1,"This game cured my depression! No, not really, but it did make me forget to be depressed while I played it. I thoroughly enjoyed the game. I liked that the focus was more on exploration and puzzles than combat. That said, the combat was so good! Fast paced, dodging, shooting, throwing people off cliffs, shielding, comboing spells that completely obliterated enemies. I felt so powerful! The story was interesting and I quite liked the friends I made along the way. I am looking forward to the continuation of Trina Doofleborgs story (naturally in the best house, Hufflepuff). The game also managed to be the most inclusive game I've ever seen, done in a way that feels natural. There were women, men, transpeople, children, teens, adults and elders, black, asian, indian, middle eastern, white people, gingers, brunettes, blondes, skinny people, a tiny bit chubbier people, straight characters and gay characters, disabled characters, freckled characters, and so man different lovely accents! And I never questioned why the people were there. After all, wizards can go anywhere in the world! We also found out more about magic in different parts of the world and I personally got very intrigued by the african wizards and witches (as Natty became one of my favorite characters).The game isn't perfect tho. Most of my issues came down to stuttering and lag. Once I installed the mod Ascendio it got better, but it was still not perfectly smooth. I also found that the economical system was a bit useless. After buying all recipes and seeds, there was nothing else to spend money on. I don't know what Trinas background is, but she came into Hogwarts with nothing but the clothes on her back and ended the year with a fortune of 45k wizard money. I played the game on Normal and it was a bit too easy for my liking. I never used my consumables (except by mistake) and I think I only died a handful of times, which most often came down to the stuttering problem. All this said, I do recommend the game, but only with the Ascendio mod. The game would have been unbearable without it."
2168,Tefached,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tefached/,2,,1,79.2,February,26,164,0,1,"A really confused game. Objectively, I'd give it a 7/10. If you are a diehard wizarding world/HP fan, this could easily become an 8/10 or even a 9/10 if we're gonna be REALLY generous. I'm gonna try gathering my fairly scattered thoughts into something cohesive here.STORY: The main story is aggressively OK. A fairly interesting premise that for some reason doesn't feel like it's happening to you. Things were set in motion years ago, which you observe, then you do some intermediate tasks before something culminates in a big final event. The antagonists are also absent for 80% of the time and it all ends up feeling really underwhelming. I did not get attached to a single character in the game except for one.The side, or ""companion"" (and I use that term VERY loosely) stories are a bit better simply because you get to actually live them, and see events unfold in real time. I'll talk briefly about them in spoilers so be careful about what you hover over.GRAPHICS: The game looks fantastic. There are no two ways about it. I have not found a single scene or asset in the game that made me go ""well that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blows what the ♥♥♥♥"". On PC the performance is all over the place. The game will chug hard quite often, but that's been talked about to death already, so just know that it's not good.STYLE: Probably the biggest selling point for the product. The castle of Hogwarts is realized immaculately. There are so many little details to see, but that's its biggest weakness. The interesting things you can only look at. The interactive things, stuff you have agency over, is all checklist stuff. The first time you  or , it feels magical (haha), as if you'd solved some neat little mistery of the castle. The charm quickly fades and you're left with a tedious checklist of things to go through. The next time you see an , your reaction isn't going to be ""oh goodie! I wonder what's in store for me"", it's gonna be ""aw one of these again huh."" which is a shame. This goes double hard for the open world. The sheer quantity and mind numbing stupidity of the  is insane.COMBAT AND DIFFICULTY: My favorite part of the game. You get a nice quantity of spells to play with and the enemies are very reactive to them. You can yeet them around, set them on fire, freeze, slice, explode, you name it. I love how the combat both plays and looks, with tons of incantations being called out, particle effects flying about, it just feels like a wizard duel. I played the game on hard for 99% of the time, only switching to normal once to test how it is. And again, like with most things in the game, difficulty for the most part is done really well in some aspects, but completely botched in others. For example, on hard, Stupefy will no longer break shields. This means that you have to engage the enemies more proactively to overcome challenging fights. But then on the other hand, enemy health is increased by like five-fold? I tested it by . On normal, it was a one-shot kill. On hard, same exact everything, it only took a quarter of his HP. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION: This is the first area that I feel mostly negatively about. The itemization is really poor. It's like the only thoughts that nudged the devs on were some nebulous ideas about item level and gear quality? And that's it? I love the fact that tier III gear traits are REALLY powerful. When a trait says it  improves something, then it absolutely significantly improves it. Then there's the talents, which are also kinda... whatever? They're impactful, like gear traits, which is nice, but there are no real character builds to speak of. You just kind of improve spells and still play exactly the same as everyone else. My biggest gripe is the non-choice talents like unlocking the other spell wheels? Why would anyone play without those unlocked? Why is that gated behind a talent point? That's not a choice, that's an illusion of one. Sure, maybe for a challenge run, I guess? Even with all of them unlocked you're gonna have to switch out spells for the  and occasionally for a utility spell or something. Also, and this is absolutely bewildering, the two other mounts that you get besides the broom are USELESS. Straight up. There's no point unless you're roleplaying. They control worse, they're slower, they're bigger so you can't always summon them in some spaces... just... what?SUMMARY: I feel like I've rambled on long enough. I have a lot of thoughts and opinions swimming in my head about this game but I'll put it this way: I wish the open world was shrunk to maybe 40% of its current size, and instead we got more unique content and a better main story. I wish there was an actual system where you had to balance schoolwork and adventuring, having a curfew, maintaining relationships, etc. All in all, and I mean this in the nicest way possible, this game feels like a fantastic proof of concept. If there's ever a sequel, I hope they make the main important parts much more special, forgoing the standard cookie cutter open world which could easily have been left out. Is it worth the €60? If you're not super into the Harry Potter world, I'd say ""barely"". Get this is you really like the look of it or if you're a diehard WW fan."
2169,Humble Beings,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HERECATCH/,2,,1,56.7,February,24,133,0,1,"Wonderful and Magical would be the words I use to describe Hogwarts Legacy!Kicking off 2023 with a bang stronger than BOMBARDA mixed with DEPULSO, Hogwarts Legacy enchanted me with its amazing take on the HP universe set hundreds of years before the setting that we are used to with the movies.This game oozes attention to detail and you can tell that the devs prioritized on ensuring that Hogwarts castle and its surrounding areas remain as faithful as they could to the original source material.  The all too familiar iconic locations such as the Great Hall and the Forbidden Forest are  beautifully captured and made real for players to explore and just soak in the atmosphere of actually being in these areas.I personally was enchanted from start to finish on just how great it feels to explore and go through all the different areas of Hogwarts Castle that I've seen in the movies and also some that weren't really explored in them such as the different houses common rooms as well as the dungeons below.Combat-wise there is a certain learning curve to it as you can only map 4 spells at a time in the beginning, but the game does not punish you aggressively should you make a mistake or get overwhelmed by the different types of enemies while also eventually unlocking more spell grids which you can interchange accordingly.On top of that, you have upgrades that make your curses/spells pierce through the different colored shields as well as chain an insta-kill spell to take everyone out in one go. Not only that, you can summon plants like man eating cabbages and even drink potions that can reduce spell cooldowns and even make you invulnerable. So initially there is a bit of a struggle admittedly, but once you've gotten used to it and have access to the different gameplay elements, I can safely say that the game is quite easy to tackle even on harder difficulties.Exploring the area beyond Hogwarts has the following:- Completing challenges with different types of puzzles- Exploring tombs for loot (more on this later on the negative side) - Popping Balloons- Clearing baddie camps- Unlocking fast travelIts more or less akin to an Assassin Creed game, whereby collecting and clearing the map doesnt really add that much value to the narrative or the overall experience other than achievement hunting. Personally it never felt like a chore for me simply on the fact that they were relatively easy and not painstakingly annoying to do. Assassins Creed would have you climbing tall areas to ""sync"" the map whereas here Hogwarts Legacy you can just fly-by on your broom near the Floo Network and it'll unlock itself!The Room serves as a hub of sorts where you can decorate it while also craft potions and grow your plants.Besides that, it serves as a resource gathering area where after saving the beasts of the HP world such as Unicorns and Thestrals you can place em in the room and just build your own mini zoo essentially. It looks great, I love this mechanic! However, more or this on the negatives later. Overall gameplay wise it has a great approach on tackling a modern day Wizarding World RPG!But alas, nothing truly is ever perfect and that is the same here with Hogwarts Legacy. The story although started extremely strong and interesting, sadly is forgettable. For me, this can be contributed to one particular problem which is a lack of investment in the characters. The main villain(s) as well as the NPC that ties in with you for the entire journey honestly did not get enough screen time or moments to have me caring. I found myself gravitating more to the sidequests as their problems and plights are more personal and has me actually taking an active role in helping them.Voice acting is good for the most part, however your character specifically for me is the biggest offender in this category! More often than not, he/she sounds VERY disinterested in ANYTHING that happens. In the final mission where things just get extremely crazy and wild your character just fails to deliver the emotion and feeling that the situation and line entailed. The lack of interactive environments/moments in Hogwarts Legacy is a real big miss for me personally, as I would just love to be able to sit in the Courtyard and soak in that magical vibe that the game does really well. The Room of Requirement has you putting down chairs and sofas and tables yet you cant even sit on them or even call up the side characters like Poppy Sweeting to admire your animal collection!I wish there was a deeper relationship management system as well, whereby you can actually call up the side characters and have them build relations with each other and explore the world together. Because, at times it really does feel lonely at Hogwarts due to the fact that you cant interact with anyone or anything.The loot system is weird! So the economy in this game is driven by clothes! loot is essentially what you wear and every single trader will find that scarf or coat that you find in caves and dungeons super valuable. Now this isnt a problem, its just weird for me that you unlock this ancient cave or unchartered area filled with Inferi or Spiders and the supposed treasure within is a HOUSE SCARF! its weird if you think about it.There is a choice based dialogue system, but it seems like it doesn't change the world much other than deciding the fate of a certain side character. Simply speaking, its not as deep as Dragon Age or Divinity Original Sin 2PHOTO MODE WHERE! YOUR GAME LOOKS GOOD!So overall for me, Hogwarts Legacy is a step in the right direction! it lays down a good foundation on what a Wizarding World RPG should be. What it does really well is in its world and setting! I hope that in the 2nd installement (if any) there should be a greater emphasis on characters as well as a deeper sense of camaraderie, maybe have certain character events like in Soul Hackers 2 where at times you can hit the bar and build the characters well. Its an easy 8/10 for me, but if I was approaching this game blind and not be a fan of the Wizarding World, its probably a 7/10. Get it on sale for best value!"

From start to finish,  I've been very invested and didn't even realize how attached I've become to my own character and the rest of the main characters. The entire wizarding world had me in awe. Of course, my favorite place to be was in Hogsmeade. Getting lost within the pockets of the open world and exploring as much of the maps I can crawl or fly into. Everything was so beautiful: The castle, the detail in the architecture, the vastness of the forest/land, the beasts you can interact with (also my favorite part; having pets), the world's transition from day to night (most of which I was spending too much time screen-shotting these breath taking virtual views lol), the musical score for every area inside and out, and the main story was phenomenal. I enjoyed how some of the side quests tied in with the main story to help better understand the plot. If you're into the lore, reading all the notes and field guides was pretty fascinating.Game play was overall pretty straight-forward and satisfying.Spell cool downs usually didn't seem to take too long as you're able to cast other spells and use potions or items to help during attacks. The ancient magic was pretty epic with animations. It was a little bit of an adjustment for me as some spots in the game had my brain working so hard I forget what to do from how fast paced it can be especially in the midst of battle.Of course the only downside which is not so much a bother to me, was noticing some lag or errors while playing. Sometimes I would have to restart the game due to certain objectives not being able to be completed because of a glitch.I hoped for better customization when it came to character build but I forget that this isn't the sims and the skill tree is meant to be simplified.TLDR;This game was amazing and brought a tear or two to my eyes. The nostalgia was real and it put me in a happy place, somewhere no one can reach me :) 9/10"

2179,Hiclaks ❤,https://steamcommunity.com/id/123fuknowme/,2,,1,17.9,February,20,12,0,1,"I was over 20 hours into Hogwarts Legacy before it revealed that, on top of being an expansive RPG with skill trees, wizard combat, crafting, environmental puzzles, and loads of sidequests, it's also a quaint home decorating game with a splash of zoo management. This is a much larger game than I think anyone was anticipating and as I've completed the main quest and dozens of sidequests over 50 hours, I'm still surprised by how good each individual element is.It certainly suffers from a meandering start and distracting technical issues, but once I was set free to explore the entirety of Hogwarts and miles of countryside surrounding it, I enjoyed Hogwarts Legacy in the same ways I did The Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2: moseying across a convincingly rendered world at my own pace, letting myself disappear into a character I'm increasingly invested in.Like those open-world classics I just mentioned, Hogwarts Legacy is a game you've probably played before, but also a rarity: a big-budget RPG attempting to bottle up all of the prestige, splendor, and expectations of a massive media property into a seamless sandbox. For the most part, it nails it. This is Harry Potter's Arkham Asylum moment—a game telling its own story in an established world, unshackled by the restrictive deadlines and creative boundaries of a movie tie-in, created by a studio that was itself once relegated to obligatory marketing products like Toy Story 3: The Video Game.Hogwarts Legacy had a firm grasp on my brain throughout my playthrough. I'd catch myself thinking about zapping dark wizards with blasts of Confringo when I should be preparing dinner or pondering what scarf goes best with my new favorite coat, which plant I should grow to brew invisibility potions quicker, and whether or not the game will ever stop hitching when I move between Hogwarts' many towers (it won't). I'm also, unfortunately, thinking about JK Rowling.The single most impressive aspect of Hogwarts Legacy is Hogwarts itself. Developers love to describe their games as ""living, breathing worlds"" but it's hard to think of a better way to characterize the titular castle.You can't walk 10 feet without a part of Hogwarts castle coming alive: books reorganize themselves on shelves, suits of armor salute passersby, hedges trim themselves to perfection, ghosts float around telling jokes, textbooks flutter above passing students, and paintings animate or conversate as if the MOMA switched to the .gif standard. My favorite hallway of Hogwarts is this unassuming corridor near a courtyard where two golden suits of armor slyly antagonize each other with a kick each time I pass by. One time the right armor, after it'd presumably had it up to here with lefty's shenanigans, donned its mace and beat the everloving crap out of the other guy.That grandeur isn't always a blessing, though. Avalanche's dogmatic pursuit of a realistic Hogwarts has made the place an honest-to-god maze. Central Hall alone spokes off in six or seven directions, each spiraling up toward classrooms or down into dungeons. I've never climbed more videogame stairs in my life—I'm winded just thinking about it. I usually like to disable navigational markers in open world games and learn the map myself, but since I don't have three years to spare, I constantly hit the button that conjures a golden trail to my destination.The beginning hours of Hogwarts Legacy immersed me pleasantly in the life of a student: attending classes, making fast friends, and getting up to some harmless teen mischief like sneaking into the library after hours. I loved that learning new spells was organically weaved into these personable cutscenes and looked forward to every return trip to Potions or Defense of the Dark Arts. It's in these moments that I felt the most at home at Hogwarts, but as I progressed, the game became less about being a student. I sorely missed seeing ""go to class"" appear on my quest log after I'd mastered all the basic spells.It's around the halfway through the school year that the gaps in Hogwarts' fantasy become more noticeable. For as reactive the world can be to your presence, it's not especially interactive—you can grab an apple from a bowl or sip tea in the common room, but you can't sit in chairs, have dinner in the Great Hall, or make small talk with students. Eventually I felt more like a visitor in a museum of puzzles, which is fun to pick apart in its own way but less gratifying than, for instance, chopping wood or swapping stories in Red Dead Redemption 2's camp. As the stakes of Hogwarts Legacy's story get higher, it becomes disinterested in cozy, comforting school life. Developing in the background of my wizard's first days of class is a mysterious ancient magic that apparently only I can wield and a goblin rebellion that eventually becomes impossible to ignore. More quests started dragging me out into the highlands, where everything wants to kill me, even when I really just wanted to hang with my buds. By the latter half of the story, student hijinks are replaced by grim wizarding warfare—the same bestie who snuck into the library with me in the first act of the story is eventually raiding mines and slaying goblins, spiders, and poachers with me by the dozens."

2188,Ned Flanders,https://steamcommunity.com/id/harkozavr/,2,,1,61.8,February,20,128,0,1,"Hogwarts legacy is the game which I was waiting for a quite long time. I enjoyed all Harry Potter (HP) films, have read all HP books, and played all previous HP computer games. So I was really waiting for Hogwarts Legacy. Before the release nobody knew how exactly the game will look like, I as many fans was afraid, that Howards legacy will be a bad project. After I finished the game I have seen all pros and cons of the Hogwarts Legacy.Hogwarts legacy’s main plot is empty with a bunch of unnecessary knowledge and information. From the main story it was interesting to see keepers memories, to watch for goblins relationships with wizards. The beginning of the story is interesting, and an ending with climax has much epic. But in the middle of the story I had feeling that scenario had gaps and all quests are made to make the story longer. The main story may be done in 6 hours, but it was elongated to 18 hours.Also the main evil - does not inspire horror. Looking at this goblin, I didn’t have the feeling that I should be afraid of him, and therefore the whole game passed without anticipation of some terrible battle.From all side quests we have only 3 full stories from representatives of three different faculties, which were quite ok. Other side quests have small stories, and few of them were really interesting, and only some of them were funny.Dialogs looks not so interesting, all main information you get from the first two sentences, and all other part of the dialogue is unnecessary, I was not interested to listen all dialogues, and a had big wish to skip most of them. Dialogs are interesting in cutscenes and all other are mediocre.We have few main mechanics: regular battle, stealth, flying on broomstick and on animals, solving puzzles.Battles are made good, it was interesting for me to play fishing episodes. Stealth leaves a lot of questions, on the one hand it’s good that we have such option, but on the other hand, we only have a couple of missions where this is a mandatory mechanic.Solving puzzles was interesting in the beginning, but later this puzzles are repeating and there is a sense of closure.Hogwarts legacy is one of those games, which are done OK. I just once got stuck in textures and had only one crash for 50 hours of gameplay.Hogwarts legacy is making . To pass a quest you need to learn spell, to learn a spell you need to do a “side quest”, to finish a side quest you need to make a plant or a potion, to make one of this things to need to buy a recipe. And to buy a recipe you need to have money, and you are not getting a money as a reward from missions, so you need to go in open world and looks for gold. And this spell which you learned will be used only once during the quest…While in Stray this mechanic was looking ok, here it is inappropriate and annoying.Level is another thing which drove me crazy. To level up you need to pass missions, which are marked in challenge list. By completing all main quests you have level 25, but to see the final cutscene you need to have level 34, where is maximum level is 40. I’ve got level 34 and my challenge list is marked as completed on 75%.Although at first I have a pleasant feeling that the world opens differently, I do not fly according to the plot, but calmly travel around the world. But this feeling disappeared very quickly when I did all the time the same tasks just to level up and to see the last cutscene.The Hogwarts world is the thing that makes you play further, the world is detailed, does not look empty and very beautiful.All your answers and actions have no sense on main plot. I was using all the time unforgivable spells and left orders to myself by spoiling relationships with other characters. But nothing happens.Gamers, who love the HP world and enjoy such games as Skyrim or Witcher would enjoy the Hogwarts legacy. The game is very simple and mediocre, there is no feeling of any innovation in the gameplay. I liked the game only because of the world. And most gamers will enjoy it just because of the world, because the World made very well. Those who are not familiar with this HP universe or didn’t enjoy it - will not get any pleasure at all. Hogwarts legacy - is not the game which you need to play because of good plot, or because of good RPG. Yes cutscenes are done great and the fighting is good. The game is interesting to play for the first 5 hours, but later, you immerse yourself in monotonous tasks that you just need to complete and this is how the whole game goes.I can’t recommend this game to everybody, I would even say - I am definitely not recommending this game to everybody! This is a good project only for those who is waiting for their letter from Hogwarts."

The story is predictable and well childish, but as it's HP universe it's likely directed towards them so i'll give it a pass. 2. Please change the killing curse story it just makes no sense, the usage of curse would make sense if the guy on the receiving end was bad or the one responsible but no, it just feels forced. I get that if you have a hammer everything looks like a nail but this does not make sense. Make it the one who cursed the character and all will be good.3. The Trans issue, the trans character is forced, and as above indicates it is for children why do we add social / political issues of the real world into games, this I will never understand it just breaks immersion. By god if you are trans I hope you get the help you need whatever that is but this is just grandstanding and is not suitable in games. Looked at stats about 5% of US people above 13 identify as trans, sure have the character be whatever they want to be or believe to be but don't ruin the story because of your political ideology.4. I have issues with the sound, when it's stereo all music played by character i.e. the paintings in the castle crackles. If I switch the sound to mono it works well, but it's weird playing games in mono sound nowerdays.The good:The world building, they have nailed the world, I got lost in it and I loved it. Please PLEASE make more events for the castle classes quidditch etc, you have nailed the most important part of the world now fill it. I will willingly pay for DLC that fills it. This if used as a template you could make more games on this even spanning years at Hogwards and I would be a happy man."

2193,Wolfszähnchen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolfszaehnchen/,2,,1,107.6,February,16,131,0,1,"The first thing that makes the game really good is the atmosphere. Hogwarts and the surrounding area is designed with incredible attention to detail, and the clothes also go very well with the time and style. All the houses look like you would imagine a ""witch house"", so the ambience of the game is really extremely well done.The combat system is also really fun, it's fast and dynamic and at the same time you actually get a feeling like you know it from the films - I think it's very well done.The story is solid, not a total reinvention of the wheel, but it's not predictable right from the start and builds up a good arc of suspense. There are also a few more extensive side stories, of which there could have been more. The game is also full of puzzles and riddles, which is really cool at first, but also has a downside because, with very few exceptions, these are so easy that anyone with three active brain cells can do them without a headache, it's a pity that you too the spells available in the game could have designed so much more and more extensive puzzles that it is a little wasted potential at the point. What could have been designed a little better in this respect is that there is always one and the same animation at the end of a type of activity, but since you do it dozens of times, it would have been nice if it was no longer displayed after the fifth time or so would become.However, there are also a few negative sides to the game.The healing potion in the game is not called healing potion or a Latin modification of healing (remedium), recovery (recuperatio) but the ""mega power potion"" which to be honest also disturbs the immersion considerably because it just doesn't fit into the universe at all and when a respectably dressed older gentleman stands in front of you and gives you a mega power potion, that's beyond odd.I also don't know what happened to the audio recording of the character, but it sometimes sounds pretty hollow, like he's in a cave or something, and especially when he's talking to another character, it often seems like they're both Characters are not in the same room even if they are directly in front of each other.Then sayings are repeated too often, it's quite nice and funny what kind of sentences are said when you enter a small village or Hogsmeade, for example, but after the 10th time it's not anymore and after the 50th time it starts to get on your nerves, there would be a Limiting how often continuous sentences are repeated was really nice.All in all a good game and fun to play."

Doesn't feel grindy or tedious, and it makes you actually want to seek out these things in the open.I completed the main story at 80 hours because I was enjoying just living in it; Tending to my plants, caring for my beasts, talking to people, interacting with everything in the environment, and just zooming around on my 600g broomstick.I think the combat is very fun and enjoyable. And a lot of the puzzles were challenging but fun.The story is engaging and the music is phenomenal!The main (actual) critics of the game I've seen are the stuttering and the depth of the story/characters.Personally, I tuned everything down to Medium settings and have had no performance issues, and the game still looked great.And I believe the depth of the story was designed in such a way so that it is enough to guide you through a narrative, but whilst also letting you inject your own story and personality into it. Allow you to make the story yours. So I appreciated that.If you like open world RPGs, this is a pretty good pick up.If you are a HP fan, then this is a must have.

Change the length or wood material doesn't seem to do anything - Shamefully no co-op (which if fair for a single player game)- No quidditch- Catching several creatures is cool, but it does feel a bit underwhelming, especially with the last quest (would love to have 1 massive creature like a thunderbird. Would be cooler to fly on than a hippogrif/thestral)- Flying on mounts doesn't feel that special compared to a broom- Is there even a point system in play for you to get point for your house?- Story choices don't matter that much.

Combat can get a bit repetitive. also if you dont like spiders youre in for a bad time. but theres enough spell variety to keep it interesting. i wish they didnt limit you to 4 spells a hotbar on the PC version as it adds an annoying element to combat that does not need to exist for PC users.Suprisingly theres very few of the telltale signs that the game was unfinished on release. something thats very common these days with big releases. perhaps the brevity of lessons and the lack of quiddich. these probably got cut as deadlines loomed but in general the games still very fulfilling.

2217,Rodingen,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198089552687/,2,,1,59.9,February,13,284,0,1,"It is rare to see a game these days which seems complete at release. I looked forward to this game, but was wary of getting my hopes high; we all know how easy it is to be disappointed in games these days. So I was very happy that this game actually delivers.The world is as magical as you would want it to be; the experience of Hogwarts itself hits that book/movie itch which you remember, and just exploring the castle and finding the locations from the books and movies, sometimes with little small nods to HP events, is just what I wanted to see. But just as important, this game has its own story and characters, although you certainly recognize some family names.The soundtrack manages to be similar enough to the movies that it brings you into the world, although I think it's mainly the Hogwarts and Hogsmeade music that really make any impact. I enjoy the combat system, where you use different types of spells to hit combo bonuses and juggle many several opponents at once. While I am far from an expert, I do however think I will be trying out a higher difficulty level for the rest of my playthrough since I find myself exploring higher level areas too early and feeling like I shouldn't be able to. Once you get the hang of the spellcasting and upgrade some spells it does sometimes get a bit too easy.The various puzzles are entertaining at first, although they do get repetitive after a while. Luckily you can skip most of the challenges if you don't enjoy that part.The big thing I can see with this game, which I am already not looking forward to, is that I can't really see that much replayability. I was thinking that I would do one ""good"" and one ""evil/less good"" playthrough, but the only real difference I see so far is if I learn the three curses or not. Throughout the game you are often provided with dialogue options which are either ""I'm a nice guy"" or ""I am selfish and mean"", but there doesn't really seem to be any significant difference to what you choose to do. You are sometimes given the choice of doing something you are not supposed to, but there doesn't seem to be any lasting impact regardless of your choice.If, for example, I choose to help a student steal some supplies during class, it would have been interesting to see more impact than just getting scolded by the teacher. Maybe implement detentions? You can come across students getting punished, so why not you? It would make for some more immersive gameplay. Similarly, some quests have you sneaking around in the school at nighttime. You are reminded of the importance of avoiding detection while being out past curfew and while exploring forbidden parts of the school during the quest, but outside of quests you can walk around wherever you like without consequences. I would have liked it if you really had to sneak around school at nighttime, avoiding teachers, ghosts and prefects; something which would also have made it more exciting to find and collect some of the things you need to find around the school.So, I do recommend this game a lot. However, after finishing it, I do not think that I will be playing it again anytime soon if there aren't any major DLC or changes to it. But maybe that is okay; remember when games just came out, were played and enjoyed once, and then you just left it at that?Also: I know that the magical world has a strange sense of morality sometimes, but Deek, I do not think ""rescue"" means what you think it means."
2218,Slayy,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198822921733/,2,,1,50.2,February,13,46,0,1,"TL,DR: This game has everything, it's so good, cop it.Hogwarts Legacy is a game I've been sitting at the edge of my seat to get for the past few weeks, and am glad to say I have not been disappointed. The game features so many familiar aspects from the Hogwarts world, the castle, the magic, going to class, it's all so familiar and welcoming. But it continues into new territory not explored by the books or by the movies, through new characters, and unexplored landmarks of the wizarding world that have never been touched upon till now, mixing both the old with the new in an exciting new version of the Hogwarts universe.First and most enjoyable to me, the combat. The combat in the trailers looked diverse and incredibly fun and satisfying to use, and to my satisfaction, this is exactly the case within the game. You are able to string together combos, unlock powerful spells and then upgrade those powerful spells later through your connection to ancient magic, on top of using potions and plants to assist you in your rivalries. Pair that with the fact that you have ancient magic that is completely new and refreshing, making your character feel incredibly powerful and unique, you have an amazing combat system that never fails to impress with the countless combinations of spells you can encounter.Next, the open world. Another amazing part of Hogwarts Legacy that has not failed to deliver. The world around you is full of life, including the students that roam the halls and gossip about their daily lives, to the abstract and hilarious interactions you see between ghosts, and the countless enchantments on paintings, statues and armour around the school. You never feel bored or left without something to think about or be interested in, because Hogwarts is just so active. Once you head outside the castle walls, you see Hogwarts, and man, it's just like the books and the movies... HUGE! When outside and viewing Hogwarts from a distance the school is just as big and as beautiful as ever, which was a very important part to enjoying the game for me. Moving outside of school grounds there are many familiar locations including Hogsmead and the forbidden forest. The forbidden forest gives off the same scary and evil vibe from the movies and books, as well as Hogsmead giving the same vibe of comfort and happiness as well. To make the game even better, there are loads of places you explore that are entirely new areas to discover for the first time only within Hogwarts Legacy, just increasing the beauty of the Hogwarts universe.Lastly, the music and dialogue in this game are well done. The dialogue is rather straightforward and nothing to write home about. It isn't amazing, it isn't bad, it's just good. The music however has been cleverly done, as you hear the main important sounds from the movie's music, however in different notes and rhythm's, helping us be familiar with the sounds, however still different as the game is set in a completely different time.Overall, this game has been amazing so far while I have played it, and there are so many different aspects to explore and experience. All the experiences that you would want to have at Hogwarts, from flying on a broom right outside Hogwarts and taking in the amazing views, to demolishing foes in duelling battles, and sneaking around the restricted section of the library, Hogwarts Legacy has everything the movies and books had to offer, and more, and so with that being said I think it's pretty clear where I stand. Get this game, it's a must."

I was pleasantly surprised with the polish of the game, losing myself in the world of Harry Potter like never before.  I took time off work to play this game on release, and that says a lot in my case. I ordered the deluxe edition to stick it to the whiners and haters, best seventy bucks I've spent in a long while.

Stay away from the community at all costs. 90% of them are on two violent opposite sides of the political spectrum and they will both do whatever it takes to ruin this game and it's community. Play it how it was intended, as a single-player experience, do NOT go on the forums, you've been warned.As for the game, it's a great RPG! While it currently has some weird issues, like lack of skin tones for the main character, and sometimes odd frame dips that show the game might possibly have a memory leak, it's nowhere near as buggy as mostly any new AAA game in the last year. The characters are all very enjoyable, the combat is amazing, and the art design is absolutely insane. As for the graphics, they're very good, but don't be expecting the best looking game ever, it's made on UE4 which makes this very understandable considering the age of the engine.Overall 9/10 so far, aside from the issues I've listed, I really have no issue with how this game turned out. I'm very surprised this managed to be good despite the overwhelming amount of political extremists on both sides working against it, and shame on JKR for making the IP like this. It's definitely well worth the price."

There are some performance stutters on pc, but nothing that has been so horrible as to make me want to stop playing. Combat is fun and interesting with various combos you can do with the variety of spells at your disposal.Exploration is a treat.  My heart warmed as i stumbled across things such as Hagrids hut.  I found myself in awe at the different hidden locations in the castle and beyond.NPC's were better than expected.  I can actually remember their names, and even have a couple of favorites unlike recent games i have played.Whether you are interested in the Harry Potter universe or not, I would recommend you to give this game a shot."

They were one of the first book series that got me into reading and I've been a huge fan of them and the world of Harry Potter since. This game absolutely does the novels justice. Hogwarts and the surrounding areas are beautiful and alive. Being able to go around the school see, and experience all the things I read about as a kid makes me incredibly happy. I'm not very far in the story but what I have played has been immensely enjoyable. Bravo to the devs and studio who brought one of my favorite childhood fantasy worlds to life. P.S.  If you are struggling with frame drops in the game try turning off v-sync in game, exiting the game, and turning on v-sync in NVIDIA control panel. Then load back into the game and give it a minute to load everything. This was suggested by u/Happy_Hues on Reddit and it pretty much fixed the frame drop issue for me."

Not a single crash, no FPS issues, no game breaking bugs, no minor bugs so far either.Playing with ""Ultra"" settings on the following:Win 11 ProGPU:  RTX 4090RAM:  32 GB DDR5 6000 MHzCPU: i9-12900K (yeah, I know...)Installed on a NVME Gen 4 x 4 All of the manufactured controversy around this game is a bit of a distraction, but as someone that isn't a fan of the HP books and that only marginally liked the movies, I'm more excited about having a quality RPG to play.  One professional reviewer trashed the game, but partway through his review he revealed his true intentions - trashing Rowling, someone I don't know enough about to care about.  She had no input into the game and other than getting her residuals, has no other involvement with it - so I could care less about her political views in relation to this game.  Now, enough of that...+  Game runs great, but from what I've seen mid-range systems seem to have the most issues+  No major bugs, crashes, or stuttering+  Whether or not you are an HP fan, the game draws you into the world+  The open world gameplay is nothing like Ubisoft's tired formula thankfully-  Seems to be some odd audio issues with my character's voice, an odd vibrato or echo+-  There are a LOT of unexplained things; usually doesn't bother me, but some things you may need to look up+-  Sometimes the voices don't seem to sync with the animation+-  Some voices (one in particular) don't match the character+-  The game doesn't really open up until more than 10 hours in, longer if you do side-questsIf you like RPGs that feature a magic casting in an open world fantasy setting, you're probably not going to get anything better than this in 2023.  Hopefully, they'll add expansions that are of the same quality that expand the story and world even more.I will say that even if this had a demo, two hours is nowhere near enough to determine if you'll like this or not.  The beginning of the game, before the world and all of your skills open up, is just that long.  So, if you want to try it, be aware of that fact."

The game exploits well known mechanics like floo flames, which are very similar to towers in Assassin's Creed; points of interest of different kind, but the main difference from other games, here they've managed to reach exceptional quality. In each location, would it be the main castle, the forest, or any hamlet village outside, I could feel the vibes of Harry Potter movies and book series. The details of environment are absolutely charming and the characters in your quest conversations look real and alive. Some emotions of sensation might be hard to express in words, so I recommend to try out Hogwarts Legacy and see it for yourself."

Avalanche games hit it out of the park in their first attempt.As for the performance, I have heard reports of issues that people were having, But I didn't have many issues outside some minor stuttering in hogsmeade and flying.I am playing on 1440p High with DLSS set to quality and textures on ultra. I have a 5700x and a 3060 and am playing on an SSD with 16 gb ram. So I am not the the common case here. Just because I don't have issues, Doesn't mean there are no issues. SO I would still say maybe find a benchmark for whatever hardware you own just to check the performance on it.And that's it for the written review. I am yet to finish the story and thus a full review will come later.And to any people who rhyme with AJ Bowlings are receiving some of the money from what I paid, May they choke on it."

Hogwarts Legacy has completely exceeded my expectations and then some! The graphics are mind-blowing, and I felt like I was actually living in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Every detail was so meticulously crafted, from the iconic castle to the intricate spell casting system.The gameplay is a perfect balance of action, exploration, and puzzle-solving, with each element complementing the others to create an unforgettable gaming experience. The story is gripping, with well-developed characters and a main storyline that will have you on the edge of your seat. And the character customization? Let me tell you, I've never felt so invested in my own avatar before. Choosing my Hogwarts house, wand, and personal story added a whole new level of immersion to the game.And let's not forget the side quests and activities! They added so much depth and replay value, I'm still discovering new things every time I play. I can't even imagine how much time I've spent in this world already, and I'm still not ready to leave.Now, I know there's been some controversy surrounding the game, but I'm here to tell you that it's completely unfounded. This game is a masterpiece, a true celebration of the Harry Potter universe and all its magic. If you're a fan of the franchise or just love action-adventure RPGs, you owe it to yourself to experience this game. It's an absolute must-play for anyone who's ever dreamed of attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.In conclusion, I can't praise this game enough! I'm so grateful to have been a part of this journey, and I can't wait to see what other adventures await in the wizarding world. Thank you, Hogwarts Legacy, for the memories and the magic!"

The game also has a lot of thigns to find, in and around hogwards So it's fun to explore around.However there are many collection quests type of things wich that are a bit overused and not as rewarding as the effort you put in to complete them.First you have the Mirrors (Paintings) that you reveal a location with a spell and you need to find to locationto find a bug and lead that bug back to the Mirror to complete it for a little xp.Then you have small statues you need to find for one of the professors to unlock the spell to unlock doors,You have 3 versions of that spell version 1 you get when you first do the quest but to unlock doors that require version 2 or 3 you need to have the upgaded spell it's worth doing it for. but it's really hard to find those statues. Then you have the merlin trail quests that are simple puzzles you complete for 80 XP, And they are all over the world. And a few more that I won't name but most of them play similarly. I believe there are atleast 2 more of those types of quests.The biggest problem I have with them is the rewards, they are at this point not worth the effort,but overall the game is all good fun, and you will get a lot of enjoyment in the combat and flying around.I do recommend this game for all those that are harry potter fans, there is a lot too see and to do. And it's well worth it. For me the game ran without any problems I am running the game on a 3090 all settings maxed out.After finishing the game.It's a good game with fun combat, but as an RPG is fails it's a liniar story with no real choices. that inpact the game as a whole,"

2327,Benji,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MajorBonger/,2,,1,59.4,February,11,288,0,1,"Multi-combat was a fun experience where at the end of a fight I felt like a badass. Though it makes your fingers twist and turn doing some criss-cross-apple-sauce maneuvers on your keyboard, it made me feel like I was casting a spell with my hand. Combat is really straightforward and it teaches you early on, though there were moments where dodging and blocking incoming spells were happening so fast I found myself just dodging most of the time in the multi-combat situations till there were just a few enemies left. They are a large amount of variety when it comes to things you can fight, and best of all they all have unique ways of handling the fight. Weaknesses play a huge role in any fight you get yourself into, and exploiting your opponents weak points is such a fun thing to pull off in rapid succession.Playing through the story I really enjoyed myself and found the story captivating and wanting more. The characters in the story had an alright build up to them, though some can be forgettable shortly after meeting them. For myself there was a moment in the story where pure joy took hold of me so much that I felt like a kid again, giving me one of the best moments of my gaming history.The map is large and filled with so much life when wandering around in any part of the map. From the little things you do via story, side missions or even just exploration. The environments in the area were well done, everywhere I went I felt like it was a screenshot.Throughout the whole playtime you are faced with many types of puzzles, none that are excessively hard in fact quite easy. Though the variety of the puzzles was enjoyable.In this game there is so much to read that I found myself wanting to find more. For me this was the first time I really enjoyed reading lore pages and it made me want to search for more in between exploring and missions.Fantastic!!! The music track was wonderful and made the experience so much more! The sounds design for the spells, environment, creatures and atmosphere was just spectacular.In the 3 day early access playtime I had encountered 3 “bug/glitches” though some might not be harmful rather than funny. Falling through the map and dying (Once)Enemies spasming all over the place after being defeated as if they were team rocket blasting off again. (Harmless and goofy)During a story mission a character whom I was meant to follow was walking backwards and got stuck on a rock forcing me to reload a save to fix. (Once)Something that I found a bit annoying though not harmful was the constant repetitive talking when on a mount.Again some of the characters do feel forgotten or ignored.In one side quest I had chosen a “bad” option that upset them and later on that same character had thanked me for helping them.Hogwarts Legacy is fantastic experience in my eyes, once engrossed into the lore of the game it truly becomes magical! I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys this universe and to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy game!I would give this a 8.5 out of 10 At the time of this review!"
2328,Scythe08,https://steamcommunity.com/id/scythe08/,4,,0,33.4,March,3,142,0,1,"Its an extremely shallow game. Its obvious they cut out alot of parts to not have a delay upon release. Very limited enemy types, the worst loot system that I have ever experienced, and the most boring, repetitious puzzles that I have ever seen. Seriously, move block here, activate lever there, rinse and repeat.The vast majority of the 'open world' is lifeless. You cant interact with the majority of the NPCs. You're force fed a storyline that you cant influence. You're a student trying to stop the forces of evil, yet you walk around killing goblins and dark wizards without a second though of the morality of the situation and have a higher body count than they could ever dream of. In the begining they captured the magical feel of the harry potter universe. But it quickly becomes stale when you realize there are basically 5 enemy types and they all act the same with the same spam attacks.The majority of the content is collectibles. Find 10-20-30-50 of these and get.........nothing of any value.The loot is random. Go through a dungeon and the last chest with a worthless item that is worst than any you have. find a chest in a bush outside somewhere randomly and find an amazing high tier item. It makes zero sense. There is no point in finding the treasure chests as their is only garbage in them.I goit 30 hours out of the game and was interested for about 15 hours of it. The last bit, I got to my second trial and after the 3rd mob and fighting the camera as well as the boss, I uninstalled. This just isnt fun anymore and I have no interest. Wait for a holiday sale."

Hogsmeade is equally pretty. It's a double edge sword because you're expecting to see all these things you know from the franchise, and sometimes they're there and you love it, but more often it's missing and makes the game feel a little more empty.Then everything beyond the areas we know is either bland countryside or a cave/tomb where you see the same assets and enemies constantly reused (spiders, goblins or evil wizards) and engage with the same open-world filler content/puzzles over and over 😴The main quest was only just barely interesting enough to follow along (a bit like the fantastic beasts movies lol), and I didn't really like any characters in the game except Sebastian and Ominis.There's also a lot of key HP elements missing and I think a sequel could improve on the formula."

This game is generally playable as there are settings for degree of difficulty. I play in Normal Mode most of the time, but when necessary I have gone to Easy and even Story Mode. One component I do find very difficult is flying -- because of the DOWN controls, which can be done with the CNTL Key or the ""B"" Key. Every other game I've played has simply controlled elevation changes by the camera angle (look up, you fly up; look down, you fly down). The CNTL and B key mechanic is *very* awkward for me.Graphics and animations in HL are superb. These make the world a place you want to hang out in. Cut scenes integrate almost seamlessly, and this makes the game's story lines much more enjoyable. Gathering resources, Beast collecting and tending, and Crafting are integral to the game. As an inveterate crafter, I suppose the process could be a bit more involved, but I think HL generally hits it close to the mark for all players.My PC is a Lenovo laptop, with 11th Gen i7 running at 2.30 GHz; 64 GB RAM. Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050. In default mode, the game plays very nicely, with rare instances where the image can be a little jerky.Overall, I'm quite pleased with HL and I imagine I'll be playing it for a long time to come."

I will admit I love the game and enjoy the story so far, but there is a reason why this review is negative. I will not post any spoilers in this review, as I want to focus on one main thing. I want to focus on the performance, as with most of these negative reviews. This game is not optimized and suffers from issues like stuttering, pop-ins, and frame rate issues. This brings me to this. Companies do not care about the consumer as they know people will buy the game anyway. It's almost like common practice now to throw terrible ports or poorly optimized games at PC players. They throw these games out there like a fresh pile of sh*t, then clean them up later (Like Cyberpunk 2077). I'd like to know why they had to push back the original release date because they obviously didn't use that time to optimize this hot garbage. The game isn't entirely unplayable for me, but I do have some terrible stuttering once and a while. But that is just for me; many players have the same, if not worse, issues than I do. It seems like the ""day one patch"" hasn't done anything to address any of the problems either (if it was even our day one patch as it was only 300mb for me). I will leave this review negative until they fix the performance issues. Also, another point/conjecture is that the game runs fine in the beginning, almost like they just optimized that part so that you hit your 2-hour playtime and can't refund the game after you realize how terrible the game runs later. Very scummy, if true, but I digress; if you can't wait for the game to get optimized and want to play now, go ahead. As I said, I like the game; but I am sick of PC players getting sh*t on.Also, if you want to know, here are my PC specs (at least what I think is relevant):CPU: Intel i5-12600kGPU: ASUS TUF RTX 3080 Ti OC EditionRam: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (2 X 16GB) DDR4 3600I use/run the game on a 1440p 144hz monitor. I kept the games resolution at 2560x1440 but capped this game at 75 fps to reduce stuttering when frames drop. (I sometimes dip into the 60s or lower). Still get pretty bad stutter here and there.Settings I toyed with to get a better frame rate:Running the game on a mixture of high and ultra settings.DLSS: BalancedRay tracing is all off - I'd suggest you turn that sh*t off if you are having issues as it was what killed my frames.V-sync: Off in-game but turned on with Nvidia control panel.Low latency: on+boost"
2350,Nephritic Hypnotist,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053231945/,3,,0,19.6,March,7,181,0,1,I wanted to love this game as an avid Harry Potter fan.  Unfortunately this game had some major flaws.  First of all the game did not feel like you were attending school but rather were playing some sort of open world game while doing a Hogwarts cosplay.  Second the puzzles were lackluster and boring only to give you a new piece of clothing or furniture.  Third the graphics at the best level were barely better than Skyrim while requiring a better computer than my one year old gaming machine leaving many cut scenes as nightmare fuel.  Also the game felt far to linear with to few choices that you could make.  It greatly saddens me that this game did not live up to my hopes.
2351,Maria<3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198193439169/,2,,1,60.2,March,5,73,0,1,"As a fan of the magical world of Harry Potter this game is an absolute must buy.  There is a lot to discover and do. And a tremendous amount of lore and world building.As an RPG alone though, the game is enjoyable, there is a whole lot to do. But there's a whole lot of the same to do. For example, there's a inventory increasing mechanic baked in a short little puzzle. Known as a Merlin trial. There's like a 100 of them across the map, but there are only a handful of different kinds. So it gets old quick.It feels like the world is full of things, and in a sense it is. But it's mostly the same type of things. And this is fine, the open world and the hidden combat mechanics keep things interesting enough as far as combat is concerned.A lot of things feel tacked on, as if there was just a box being ticked. Gear progression for example. You'll end up doing many of the aforementioned Merlin trials, because your inventory is very limited and you'll get buried in gear. Most of which you'll sell, because the aesthetics of the items are then unlocked and saved (I do like that particular part) other then that, the gear progression is very meh.Another thing that feels tacked on is the talent system, I found myself not really caring for the talent upgrades. There are a few useful ones. But I would have loved to see a more robust talent system, possibly with new spells.There are a great many things missing from the game too. The obvious one is Quidditch. But simple things like the ability to sit at your house's table and eat, emotes, photomodes, actual secrets that don't reveal with Revellio, but require you to immerse yourself in the world. For example, the one-eyed witch, you get told about it, at which point it unlocks. Same with Herodiana (depulso lady) they unlock once an NPC tells you about it. There are very few secrets you just get to discover on your own. Near the Hufflepuff common room for example are the kitchens, if you walk by that particular portrait an interact symbol is visible, telling you to tickle the pear. There's almost no secrets you really discover on your own. And those that you do are obvious and very much the same. The arrhythmic door puzzles for example.You start as a fifth year, and you need to ""catch up"" and catch up fast. You however only learn a very select amount of spells, and spend almost no time in class. Outside of missions and side missions the only people you can talk to repeatedly are shopkeepers. Not the students, not the teachers (though the teachers get two stages of dialogue outside the missions, and then they never speak again) the minigames are also basically a one shot. If you beat the opponents, you can't beat them again. The flying is repeatable, but you'll end up competing against your own time. Early on, you get to choose to help a first year with her Gobstones (a game in the series) and you are presented with a choice, keep the stones or give them. If you keep them, nothing happens, she still plays gobstones in the courtyard and her dialogue changes, if you give them back, the same thing happens. But at no point can you join. There aren't any minigames you can repeat. There are a LOT of collectables, all cosmetic unlocks within your Room of Requirement. Which you can go nuts at, it's pretty good as far as housing goes. And a decent surprise.But the RPG mechanics are very barebones. Too barebones if you ask me.It's clear that the world itself received a LOT of love, and an incredible amount of attention to detail. It's incredible. It is obvious to me that that is where the team spent most the development time. And it shows, the world is absolutely gorgeous. I just wish there was a bit more game.I still recommend the game, I absolutely adore it, despite me sounding rather negative. If they get to add more classes, overhaul the way you interact with NPCs add more repeatable things. Wizard Chess for example, even more duels after the ""crossed wands"" duel club is over. Anything to make the world feel more alive. And not just going around unlocking doors to get collectables because you finished everything else. Then Legacy 2 would be one of the best games. As things stand. It's a good game, good for a single playthrough, and 3 short ones to see the one unique quest and common rooms."

2356,Mythrandyr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mythrandyr/,2,,0,40.1,February,18,293,1,1,"I rarely write a review for a game but this one just simply asks for it.Running the game on a Ryzen 7 3700x, RX6800XT with 16GB of RAM, I appear to be one of the lucky few who haven't had a single issue related to performance. With medium to ultra-settings, ray tracing off I rarely drop below 90 FPS, and since it's not a shooter game this really doesn't bother me.Graphics are great, effects are nice. Most sound effects and NPC voice acting are good. The world is pretty.Yet I'm fairly certain only diehard Harry Potter fans will see the 'master' in this piece of software. And those people will not be objective nor honest enough to tell you that they mainly think that way because the game remains true to the source material. Either that, or they don’t have any experience with RPG games since before Skyrim. Sadly, I’m not that big of a harry potter fan, so a lot of the lore and story isn’t ‘finally in a game’ for me.Story is simple, it all revolves around you being the Chosen/Special/Foretold/Destined 'one'. Kind of lame, but the main character has got to feel like a main character so let's remind said main character they are the main character every other dialogue, or rather, every other sentence during most dialogues. Speaking of dialogues, after my first ten hours in the game I pretty much felt like the only thing Hogwarts had been teaching me is that every conversations consists out of about 10 sentences during which you get 2 to 3 'choices', which usually are either a confident 'Yes Sebastian I would enjoy not listening to the teacher and doing some stupid thing with you' or a doubtful  'I'm not so sure if we should Sebastian'. The latter usually unlocks a third choice in the conversation where you can either change your mind and still choose 'yes, let's go mess around' or doubling down on thinking it might not be the best of idea's.Doing Jack Harlow's quest was the point it went downhill for me, which is a quest quite early in the game. during this quest, every chest you find is unlooted and the braindead main character you are repeats about a million times that Jack wasn't very thorough in his search, even though his body is found exactly where the item he was looking for should've been. Jack is (or was?) either a man of sheer will and focus for not bothering with all the other trash in that cave and simply heading straight for what he even came for, or our main character forgets Jack has been dead for at least a hundred years, meaning those unlooted chests might have been emptied and filled a few times before we even set foot in that cave.I understand we are RPG players and want to loot every sparkly item or chest Revellio shows you, but half of the bags and chests give you an item which is worse than what you've been wearing  since a few quests before, or less gold than what the lowest quality items (green gear, sells for 60 gold each, everywhere, anywhere, to anyone) get you when you sell them.Then add the starting 20(!!) gear inventory limit (of which 6 are used by the 6 gear items you've got equipped) meaning that after about every 1/2 quests you'd be wise to head to a merchant to sell all the items you're not using, otherwise you'll be destroying (thus getting no gold) gear during missions/looting just to be able to pick up the new ones you find, which are usually still worse than what you're already wearing.Clearing Poacher/Goblin/Ashwinder/Dark Wizard camps is a waste of time unless the quest your doing is requiring it. Second reason it could be worthwhile is if you're trying to complete a challenge in which you have to defeat x amount of Poachers/Goblins/etc. What do you get out of these challenges? Cosmetic items you can use to make the meh-gear you're wearing look a little less 'meh', or a different kind of 'meh'.Having gear other than your school robe makes you look like a main character out of an anime, since every other student will still be wearing the robes with no hat or glasses, nor a scarf. You look like you've come straight out of an asylum during the cutscenes in Hogwarts wearing a Celtic cape and Porcelain mask with a top hat. Speaking of classes, these take about 3 minutes each and are basically just tutorials either teaching you a new spell or foreboding the new spell you will learn NEXT class. When you explore the world you will quickly find caves, tombs and other POI’s that are shown on the map, which you will not be able to enter even though you have the required spell since they are related to a quest. Sounds fair enough, until you notice this is the case for basically every cave near the school, thus meaning you will have to go further out into the wild far before you have all the skills, spells and gear you need to really be able to explore. The ‘open’ in open world game is rather closed to me.Other than a few random lines of dialogue a NPC will spit out when near them no one reacts to your presence or even your actions at all. Aiming at a student, casting Confringo straight through them? Their body will spasm a bit like you ran up against them, they rarely say anything about it and just keep on walking or talking on. Getting them to really react to you requires you to either be on an active quest relating to them, or having completed a quest relating to them.There’s a certain woman in a certain hamlet which tells you about her missing brother and 2 goblin camps. Clearing the camps and telling her will make her thank you during the cutscene and unlocks a line of dialogue outside of the cutscene in which she thanks you again for what you’ve done. Once you completed the quest related to her brother too she will first cry during the cutscene, exiting the cutscene back into the world will trigger her to either start crying again (you just were already???) or thank you again for clearing the camps. Had I already said our main character is brain dead? Wait until you go to that hamlet for the 3rd’/4th time to complete those quests and talk/trade with her and hearing our main character say the same thing every time he/she enters said hamlet. Much the same as with the chests in Jack Harlow’s quest as I said earlier. If it were a different line of dialogue each time, or a few different lines of dialogue shuffled around, this would’ve been way better. But please don’t act like you are seeing this hamlet for the very first time, saying ‘ah, that’s a cozy enough looking place’ when you fly in for the 4th time? My granddad had dementia and not even he would ask me how soccer practice was going the 4th time I entered the room, all 4 times. He would sometimes even remember what I told him the last time I saw him. That’s a lot more than our teenage main character seems to remember at all.I think I’ve rambled on enough now to give you an idea of the Triple A RPG game your looking at.if stupid and perhaps little things like these don’t bother you, great. I hope you  feel the same after ten, twenty or like me, 26 hours. I’d give the game a neutral review if it was possible, but since I can only choose Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down, I’m gonna have to go with Thumbs Down."
2357,HWS_Wolf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfpyre/,2,,1,111.6,February,18,295,0,1,The game is hands down EPIC. The story is engaging pretty much every step of the way. They kind of missed the mark on only one thing in my opinion. It would be much better if you could at least link with a friend or 3 and play Co-Op or if they made the game like a RPG/Survival game where you and a group could build your own hamlet and survive while attending Hogwarts because I fear after playing through the game a couple of times it will loose that epicness unless they put out some awesome DLCs.

2368,Cyridius,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cyridius/,2,,1,55.6,February,11,149,0,1,"Spoiler free Early Access review.I never liked the books. I did grow up and age with the movies and I enjoyed them all. So you can say I'm someone familiar with the lore of the world, gets a lot of the subtle references and world building, and understands pretty much all the terminology that the characters will use. Hogwarts Legacy is a good game. It's good in that it's faithful to the world that it comes from, but more importantly it's good from the standpoint of game design. It's extremely well done, thought-through, and feature dense. I am at level 20 (out of 40) and in some senses I feel like I'm still in the tutorial stage of the game, with a number of features still being locked. This is a double edged sword; On the one hand, this sense of continuous progression is something most RPGs deliver and players have come to expect, but I also feel like it's distracting me from the core gameplay. Every few levels there is a huge new feature I need to stop and take a look at and then decide if I want to derail my questing to go learn. I'm never sure what the use-case for a particular feature is going to be, because often it's not all that well telegraphed by the game. The Viviary is one of them, and I would have held off on doing other content first had I been aware that this was around the corner. This kind of progression system feels like it got the worst of both flexibility and railroading, but still somehow managed to come out with a satisfying overall loop. Your mileage may vary.It's not the end of the world by any means; Hogwarts Legacy is a very flexible game when it comes to a player's progression path. But that flexibility also results in confusion and it's something players who are going in blind are going to have to figure out on the fly like I did.I will also note three other weaknesses with the game; The motion capture on character faces is wildly inconsistent. In some cases it is extraordinarily life like. In others, it's comical. Unfortunately, for your character it's going to be comical. You will immediately notice this from the first scene of the game and you will not be able to unnotice it, because your character is the entire focal point of this entire rodeo. The second weakness is something that wont effect people on a good PC that much, but will be brutal for people on mid-low end specs. I run an RTX3080, a very good SSD etc etc. I still hit very brief loading times on doors. I mean so brief that by the time I register it's happening, it's usually done. Ultra graphics. On slower computers that is going to wreck your immersion, extend your travel time around Hogwarts and result in you just leaning on fast travel mechanics instead of immersing yourself in the extremely well-crafted setting.The third problem is that the character creation in this game is confusing and lacklustre. It took me a good few minutes to figure out what its layout was (maybe I'm dumb), but that aside, the hair options are very poor, and the skin tone is weighted too dark - particularly for a game set in Britain. People are pasty as hell over here. I don't mean this in a political sense (those people can go cry), but I know I also design my characters to be on the paler side, and I just didn't have that option at all. This is easily fixable, but if it ever is it will require a new save as there is no changing of fundamental characteristics of appearance in this game. This to me is a missing feature and should be fixed.Pre-Early Access, people did complain about backgrond NPCs. I'm sure if you're the kind of person who cares about that kind of stuff, it's still bad. I didn't notice it even a little bit, because the game does not incentivise you to sit around and look at NPCs, it encourages you to be constantly on the move. There is never not something to do.I didn't include it in the other three problems, but to me the Early Access package is egregiously predatory in terms of the exclusive content it offers. It really is very bad. It is qualitatively worse than industry standard for a single player game and will just encourage piracy. Actual game content should never be locked behind pre-orders in a game like this - once you're thinking about even going beyond cosmetics, you have to take a step back. But they already have my money so it's not like they'll care.The stealth mechanics in this game are one and done. No point in doing them unless you're forced to, which you are in a handful of quests. Otherwise you can just blast your way through everything, and you are going to want to because the combat is by far the highlight of this game. It's brilliant. The combos, the feel, the pace - it is perfect. There are some technical issues - for example, Troll attacks are clearly bugged and cause them to teleport on top of you on their second swing, making them unavoidable if you do a teleportation-dodge on the first attack. But generally speaking in 99% of the combat I've experienced, it is seamless, impactful, extremely entertaining and there is not a fight that I wont pick just to experience the thrill of combat. The game is worth purchasing for it alone.Thankfully, Hogwarts Legacy has a lot more going for it than combat. The story is compelling, and I want to find out more about the background of what's going on, and what's going to happen next. The side quests link up with the main story well in terms of colouring in the edges of what's happening. The writing is good, the voice acting is above-average (if we account for the bug with voice pitches that urgently must be fixed), the characterisation is decent, and the quests are fun. What I will say is that it misses meaningful choice and consequence. The story and your character morality is definitely railroaded (at least where it's important), at least up to the point I have played. However, this is the case for 95% of today's RPGs, so I can't knock it too much for that, but it's nonetheless something all RPGs should have and this doesn't. In that sense, Hogwarts Legacy is a bad RPG - but it's a top tier Action RPG, that is beyond dispute.Aside of the amazing combat and quality story telling, this game is jampacked with a whole load of features I did not expect but was pleasantly surprised about, features that you can sink considerable time into. I can definitely see the Room of Requirement being a big thing for the more creative players amongst us. The transmog system is perfect. Resource gathering is multifaceted, links with the lore of what's going on in a way that makes sense, and has plenty of side features that you will not want to miss.Hogwarts Legacy gets a deserved 9/10. There's very little you could do to improve this project within reason. It's a great tribute to the fans of the franchise, and more importantly it's a very solid game."

Zudem sind alle Dialoge vertont und die deutschen Sprecher sind keineswegs unbekannt. Die verschiedenen Zauber, die man nach und nach lernt, sind alle auf ihre Weise nützlich und vor allem die Kämpfe, die man mit seinem Zauberstab und etwas Körpereinsatz bestreitet, wirken sehr dynamisch und spaßig. Die Sammlerin in mir freut sich besonders über die vielen Klamotten, die man finden und kaufen kann. Nebenbei kann man sich dann auch noch um den eigenen Garten kümmern, Tränke brauen, Tierwesen aufziehen und auf seinem Besen oder Tierwesen durch die Welt fliegen. Ich habe unglaublich viel Spaß und kann dieses Spiel auch denen empfehlen, die wie ich keine Harry Potter Fans sind. Wer noch unsicher ist, kann gerne in mein Video reinschauen:"

Far from it.The game lets you explore a lot early on and got TONS of references to locations, creatures and whatever stuff from the Harry Potter movies, Fantastical Beasts movies and original books.The combat is fun, not too difficult, but also not a cakewalk.Exploration is honestly the best aspect, with aesthetically designed locations, hidden caves and secrets, charming music and the aforementioned references scattered all over.I have a serious problem following the main story, as I just get sidetracked with running around and checking every nook and cranny.There have been some minor bugs. DLSS caused everything to stutter, although my PC wasn't even stressed, a minor graphical bug (the autosave icon turned into a white square until I restarted the game), there have been some minor stutters even after turning off DLSS, but that was fixed as well after updating my Nvidia Drivers.But now that it works perfectly fine I have next to no gripes with the game, ton of fun!"
2376,SpaceAce,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198123495659/,52,5,0,25.3,February,11,195,3,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is exactly what you expect it to be, its utterly mediocre, derivative and unimpressive in its delivery of complete and utter genericness. It has the same energy as the hundredth Assassin's Creed game while being the first game in its series. It is formulaic, constantly referential to Harry Potter canon for seemingly no reason than to make the audience scream like baboons at the thing that's familiar. The game looks like ♥♥♥♥, and runs like ass, so its a pretty fitting combo. At best you could say its at least somewhat grand in scope but its only as grand as revisiting the same locations over, and over again can really be. Character customization is pointless and at times simply odd. As a Slytherin character there are very few moments that feel particularly Slytherin besides just a general idea of ""you are ambitious but only sometimes."" Instead, I feel like a discount Gryffindor, with the male voice attempting their best impression of Daniel Radcliffe. There are a myriad of outfits and cosmetic options in the game but all of them feel out of place. Every single student is dressed nearly identically but you can walk in looking like a Scottish Monster Hunter and its so bizarre I don't even understand the reason for it beyond just having options that don't really mean anything. Exploring rewards nothing but generic God of War style looter shooter gear that you slot the bigger number in. And with how slow and monotonous opening the menus are, it quickly becomes a chore you won't want to even bother with. I was originally intending to do a breakdown of which individual components are bad about the game, that was until I realized... Everything was pretty terrible in some way. Menus are clunky, numerous and filled with needless animations that bloat the time you spend navigating important menus such as quests and challenges, all super immersion breaking, but placed within an idea of a magical book your character is handed. Why not just make it a real book that doesn't take you out of the experience? The map is awful to navigate, it seems like it would benefit from a top down view, but instead you get an awkward side angle that gives you no real depth or perspective on what you're zooming in on. Combat is dull, its just a color match game of purple shield means use purple spell, red shield means use red spell, orange circle means block, red circle means dodge. Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ God of War with such a small selection of spells, most of which are useless and the majority of which are unlocked through tedious side content that has no meaning, impact or interest. Drink 3 potions to unlock X spell. You get the idea. Where is the promised deep spell combo customization? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spamming is more effective for most enemies since they die fairly quickly with 0 challenge. The only difficulty coming from how annoyingly binded the dodge key is initially to actually avoid red circle attacks. Its very pretty I'll give it that, but it has the depth of a puddle. Flying is fine, but that's all you can say, its barebones, stiff and feels straight of a modern MMO than a singleplayer RPG The narrative is horrifically terrible. With a predictable, uninteresting story surrounding characters with 0 compelling traits or motives. Which is kind of disappointing when you consider how interesting the opening of the game was, only for it to be immediately explained via obvious contextual clues the characters spend 10 hours contemplating when you've already figured it out based on the obvious. I hope you enjoy almost every enemy having the exact same 3 voice actors, no personality, and just a complete lack of any motivation to actually fight anyone besides being told to fight X amount of people for a challenge in the dumb magic book. There is nothing to discover or earn besides more ♥♥♥♥ pointless loot that will be replaced within an hour anyway. The puzzles are similarly serviceable but uninteresting, boiling down to just pressing the right spell on the right widget. Is Hogwarts Legacy transphobic? I don't care. Its just a bad game. Pretending like you're owning the libs by buying it ain't that impressive chief, considering you're funding libs by doing it. And for the other camp, JK Rowling is already wealthier than Harry Potter at the start of the series, forwarding her transphobic agenda isn't hinging on the sales of Hogwash LegassFundamentally, I think the question is whether Hogwarts Legacy is a bad game, and my simple response is, Hogwarts Legacy is a game completely bathed in mediocre corporate product. It has nary a sliver of artistic vision, and presents a world I understand many people love in the most derivative, pandering and generic fashion that I find it to be the greatest weapon against Dementors with how devoid of soul it is.Edit: After fully completing the main story, I have absolutely no revisions to add except that the story is even worse than I had imagined. I held pointless hope that it would at least try and have some nuance in its storytelling but I got exactly what I knew in the recesses of my mind I would. A narrative so devoid of significance, consequence, or even basic thematic qualities that punctuate any good story, that I genuinely feel anger at the conclusion for being so completely watered down into nothingness. Like moist cotton candy, unappetizing from beginning to vanishing conclusion."

It is just the pure Harry Potter video game we all wanted. When launched, I played for 14 hours non-stop and didn't even do the main quest storyline, I was just out there exploring the world and the world has incredible details like they thought every small detail, I couldn't believe it. Even if you are not a HP fan, you can still be amazed by this game. There are many references to the movies, but the main design comes from the books and let me say this: It couldn't be done better.The Hogwarts we have seen in the movies is nothing compared to Hogwarts Legacy's Hogwarts. Of course, the main outline, and design of the castle comes from the movies but the interior... I mean...they did something beyond what I could have imagined. Ghosts, Peeves, armors that whistle while you pass them and knock his fellow, sculptures that wave at you if you wave at them, decorations, interactive knickknacks...The combat is so smooth, so artistic. The wand movements are designed incredibly realistic. Spell slots are easy to use but it takes a little to get used to. You can do almost endless combinations with spells it is totally up to you... or... you know... you can just cast . There are potions and plants that will help you in battle. You don't necessarily need to use them but they add a layer to the fights. The dodging mechanic is amazing, you could either dodge with  or roll, ancient magic, and sometimes you have to dodge according to your enemy's mechanic sometimes 1 is enough but sometimes a well-timed 3 dodge is required.The story is well-written but could've been a little longer. It's nothing groundbreaking I must admit, but it's enjoyable. I really enjoyed the characters and their stories as well. Sebastian's story is my favourite.Ultimately, it's my favourite game of all time."

Почав би з її найбільшого мінусу - технічного стану. Через це спочатку хотілося навіть оформити рефанд. Дуже дістає рандомне падіння частоти кадрів і статери. Хоча і граю з лептопа, але далеко не з найслабшого. При чому зміна внутрішніх налаштувань майже не впливає ні на що. Короче будьте готові копирсатися у обоговореннях гри в пошуках милиць для підвищення продуктивності. Але хороша новина - вони не складні і наспровді допомагають (хоча я так до кінця і не вирішив свої, та хоч досяг іграбельного рівня).Що до самої гри, то це десь 4 із 5. Купляючи я очікував на атракціон в декораціях Гаррі Поттера за заклікуванням ворогів. Але геймплей здивував у доброму розумінні. Може і не найглибша бойова система, але досить цікава.

I am interested in this game as a fan of Harry Potter, and of fantasy rpg games. That being said, I will only discuss game-related content and/or issues in this review.Graphics & Sound: 9.5/10Sadly, I am playing this game with a graphics card that falls short of minimum requirements. However, I'm of the NES/SNES generation, so a game's graphics have never been the sole reason for me to play a game. Even on low settings, I still find this game to be extraordinarily beautiful, and the world feels like a real place, and very lived-in. The music is enchanting, and several times during my play-throughs I found myself standing around just listening to the music. The only thing I didn't like, is the player character's voice. It sounds odd, like as if the studio didn't record the dialogue in a proper setting. I've heard the same thing while watching other streamers' game plays, and possibly only irks me as I've not heard anyone else mention this.Gameplay: 9/10While the game's mechanics and controls are easy to learn and easy to master, there were a few glitches/bugs that I experienced, though none were game-breaking. Certain side quests would get glitched, and a quick reload from a previous save quickly fixed the issue. I'm sure with a few updates things would probably run smoother, but the glitches that I encountered in no way deterred me from continuing with gameplay.Storyline: 10/10The main storyline is definitely engaging. I found myself dying to get to the next part, whether it was the main storyline or a side quest. You get a pretty good sense of the characters, their personalities, and even the world.Overall, I'd say this is one of the funnest games I've played in a long time, and has certainly left its mark. I think this game will go down as one of the greatest fantasy rpg games of all time. I've completed this game 100%, and I am very glad I bought it. I cannot wait to build a new computer so that I may play the game with the visual impact the developer's intended. I also want to give kudos to the developers, and add that I had almost forgotten how fun fantasy rpg games could be, but this game certainly reminded me why I love fantasy."

The main story line was not dry and was exciting throughout (my personal favorite quests were with Sebastian and Poppy).The Hogwarts location itself blew my mind with how how many rooms and hidden items were scattered around (that I have found so far). The combat in the game was interesting to me. From one side, I enjoyed the combos while fighting endless goblins and poachers and keeping them airborne for days on end. The use of all the spells and Basic Cast made the combat more exciting and creative, from my perspective. The Room of Requirement was one of my personal favorites, allowing so many opportunities for customization.Cons:At times I still experience stuttering, nothing too extreme to where it's game breaking but is still a persistent issue.During combat, using Protego would not register sometimes, along with dodging by using the Ctrl button.The ending to the main quest with Ranrok was a let down. I feel personally there could've been so much more that could have been done besides what is already implemented in the game. The FINAL ending when you take your O.W.Ls is downright pathetic. It seems that it was very rushed towards the end and there was no significant attention to detail that was present in other scenes of the game. Overall, while I very much enjoyed this game, it has a few bugs that are still present throughout the game, and from what I have seen that the dev team is continuously looking into fixing all bugs that are reported. I hope that in the future, more content is added to expand to the Hogwarts Universe. P.S. Deek thinks you should be proud of the potions you've brewed."

Outside of the combat there's a lot to do: raising fantastic beasts, mini-games, flying, potion making. All of which feel very refined.Sound:9.5The original soundtrack is tremendous, it hits all the right emotional and high adventure beats. The characters are generally very well voice acted.Story:8The story is serviceable, the characters are fun and interesting but I would have liked to have seen more of them.Replay Value:8.5Solid length game, not too long not too short. A good amount of content to bite into, I would definitely come back if they added more content later down the line.Verdict:8.9Great, but just shy of masterful. It needs a little more nips and tucks to get to be among the Red Dead Redemption 2's, but if this game is like the Mass Effect 2 to the Mass Effect series or the Arkham City to the Arkham series then this has potential to be a really incredible series as it progresses."

2402,Fanciful Imp,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fanciful_imp/,5,1,0,40.4,February,19,121,0,1,"+ Beautiful looking game+ Combat can be fun for a bit- Empty game- Boring quests- Repetitive open-world design- No real challenge- Tediously bad puzzles- No replay valueA beautiful game with absolutely zero substance. It's almost like the developers took every thing that makes an open world game bad and compiled it into one single game. Well, congratulations to them because that is exactly what they achieved with Hogwarts Legacy. Hogwarts is EMPTY. Imagine making a game ""Hogwarts"" Legacy and the majority of the playtime is OUTSIDE of Hogwarts. That wouldn't be such a big deal if the developers actually made you do stuff in it, but guess what? It's EMPTY. There is no incentive to be in Hogwarts whatsoever other than collecting Ubisoft-eseque collectibles or interacting with main characters to progress the story. And boy, oh boy, did they put every piss-poor type of collectible that is present in open world games all into this one. There are no engaging mini-games in Hogwarts, no fun activities, no interesting lessons, no house cups to compete in... absolutely nothing to do in such a otherwise highly detailed castle. It's beyond underwhelming and confusing as to why I'm even roleplaying as a student, and the House you go with serves no purpose other than ""Hey look, I'm Gryiffindor... Yay?"" You don't even learn spells during classes in Hogwarts; instead you have to perform mobile game quality quests to earn new spells (kill x 5 times in this way). It's not like the spells are fun to use anyway considering the majority of them achieve the same results.As for the open world exploration? EMPTY. It's a collectible fest. What were they thinking? The side quests are garbage fetch quests, there are bunch of pointless, boring and tedious activities plaguing the map. Don't get me started on the below average quality puzzles, which would be fine if there weren't too many of them, all of which are there to simply waste your time and pad out game time. It's incredibly unfortunate because the world design is phenomenal and one the best I've seen. But nothing other than shopkeepers can be interacted with. This whole game is just ""see but don't touch"".The combat is fun for a while but eventually, its gets old real quick. It was never challenging to begin with and you just get more and more powerful the more you progress your stats. New spells won't be enough to keep you interested. I couldn't care less about the story or any of the characters I have interacted with. They're all agreeable, one dimensional characters, and the main character, YOU, is the best wizard/witch in the whole universe. There are no consequence to anything you do, even if you choose an ""evil"" dialogue option or use forbidden spells.I feel like their design philosophy for this game was ""Let's put everything so that players can't complain that there is nothing."" What I mean by that, is that they did way too much than necessary to the point it started to affect the game's quality: Too many upgrades from too many sources, too much of the same spells, too much of the same quests, too many chests behind too many locked rooms (which, unsurprisingly, also needs too many upgrades to unlock). It seems like they did too much of all the terrible open world design combination to compensate for game's emptiness.This game has NO replay value and frankly, I don't even feel like continuing playing anymore. You can plough through the main quests and probably have a good times, but as for completionists like myself, this game is a nightmare to explore. I don't recommend the game at full price, wait for a sale."

2419,PhoenixCyanFire,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PhoenixCyanFire/,No,,1,185.3,February,13,398,0,1,"This is a good game, but the reason I am giving it a negative review is because of the fact that as of right now, the game is very poorly optimised for PC. Regardless of hardware. The game has a lot of bugs, and it doesn't feel very fleshed out and finished in some areas. I am sure future patch updates will fix these issues, but I cannot currently recommend the game on PC in its current state. You are better off buying this game for console in its current state.- Infinite loading screens during the room of requirement- Ungodly amounts of stuttering- Outdated DLSS Files- Horrible Optimisation- Not all cutscenes are skip-able- Consistent FPS Drops- Visual glitches - Ridiculously long loading screens (Practically unplayable on HDD unless you are willing to wait upwards of 10+ minutes)- Infinite Loading Screen glitch occasionally happens during some quests, for me, It happened when I tried to take Sebastian to Hogsmede- Censorship can be annoying for some players- PS5 Exclusive content isn't available on PC without modding it in, which is likely against ToS- Really annoying Audio bugs causing the Player character to have a very Robotic mechanical like voice- Characters popping in and out of the world, and sometimes falling through the ground^ IF some of these issues can be resolved, my review might change to positive. But again, in the game's current state ON PC, I do not recommend buying this.- I will be very clear, I am leaving JK Rowling out of this review because I separate art from artists, I do not support JK Rowling at all, but I still wanted to play the game. But my hatred for JK Rowling has zero impact on my review, this is a non-biased review.Edit: As of the most recent update most of these issues have been fixed. There are still a few issues, however MOST of them have been fixed, so I can recommend this game now."

There was tears for the first minutes while opening the game, loading in all of that. I havent felt like that in years, and havent felt that much happiness over a game. And Hogwarts.. they made me feel that way.This game was worth it to wait for, after delay after delay and now that it has been released it feels so unreal. Hogwarts Legacy is best 70euros I have ever spended for any type of deluxe version of the game, the story (i finished it yesterday) was amazing. Loving every minute of it, i feel like im home and i am home. Yes ofc I would love to have more quests (meaning main story) more than we have already, but its amazing as it is. It runs well on low graphics and it still looks stunning with low graphics.I will continue playing, i will play on everyhouse. Started from slytherin, because that my house and next one is.. either hufflepuff or griffindor, but i will play on everyhouse to get the whole hogwarts experience! I highly recomend this game to everyone:) even for you who isnt a potter fan :3scenes, story line, npc characters, quests etc, every part of of this game is well made. as a potter fan i love it, and i will love it till i die.Hogwarts is my home❤️"

Side missions are engaging with quite a bit of variety. They have nailed the  part of the game as well. You actually have to do  to be able to learn and unlock various spells. I just wish the spell management system via set was a bit better, it becomes a but cumbersome to juggle the sets in the heat of the combat.Now coming to the biggest issue - I have 5800x + 3080 + 64GB RAM and the game runs on an NVME, yet the shaders load slowly every time I launch the game. I'm playing at 4k with DLSS at Performance without any Ray-tracing (Ray-tracing absolutely sucks in this game) and yet FPS constantly drop to under 25, sometimes to 15 when loading a new environment/scene. After a while you don't notice the performance drop but it's horrible.

Well done, Avalanche Software!Please keep up the good work and hope you guys will continue to polish the game further to iron out the oddities here and there, such as the mood-breaking return-to-neutral-expression-between-sentences facial animation on NPCs and the weird Ray Tracing issues in certain areas (one treasure vault was blindingly bright while certain part of the lake reflects light that it shouldn't be reflecting; oh, my scarf sparkles too).For those who are interested in a game based on the Wizarding World, look no further. The issues I mentioned are really just nitpicking. This game is of AAA quality right off the bat, and they already improved the PC issues on the actual launch day. You don't even get this quality in many of the supposedly AAA developers these days anymore.The money's totally worth it. Watching movies and buying books to read would easily cost more than this game's pricetag, and you can't even modify anything in the movies/books, but you can do things in a game.

I don't like it, but it is not a deal breaker, since everything else about this game is great with one exception:Why the frick they give you alohomora so late I do not know. For everyone else: do not explore anything, rush main quests until you get alohomora, and then start exploring. It will save you a lot of pain and going through  everything three times over. This is just really stupid design if you ask me. They should give you alohomora right from the start without you having to unlock several levels of the spell."

I'm enjoying the puzzles, the small details of magic all around Hogwarts, the combat is more or less what I expected, and the world is beautiful. The characters are quite a bit more diverse than they really should be given the setting, but it's not particularly detracting from my experience overall due to them not being my focus.I never liked Harry Potter for the writing and characters much anyways, certain key parts here and there, sure... But it was always everything else I liked, and this game is delivering on that so far. The books held me as a child through the theater of the mind constructing a magical world, and the movies held me even more. I hope Avalanche gets to make a sequel or some other game in the universe, because they've done a pretty good job when weighed against their development history. The only other thing I can find to be critical about that detracts from the experience is that the game does have genuine reports of performance issues. The one I've experienced is a periodic yet brief slowdown when the game starts building shaders as it needs to. It is a little bit annoying, but it's never happened to me in a moment where it was genuinely a problem. As for the boycott, I think it actually made the game sell more copies.

The game seemed to be marketed as some sort of RPG, but it has incredibly little in the way of good actual RPG elements (like a compelling story with choices that affect it). There are lots of side quests of different sorts of puzzles, but there are tons and tons of them. The map is quite big and scenic, but it's all rather repetitive- for example, there are probably 15-20 villages, but there is very little to distinguish them. Also, as far as side characters, they completely disappear from the game once you've done their side quest. It would be nice if there were more activities to do with the characters that are supposed to be your friend, but there are almost none. Also, I'll be the millionth person to say that a Harry Potter game not having quidditch is one of the biggest misses imaginable. Growing up as a huge fan of Harry Potter, it was basically my favorite thing to imagine myself doing. They put a lot more effort into a system of growing plants, making potions, and tending to animals. The animal system is very in depth, but not terribly exciting as far as Harry Potter goes. Wouldn't it make more sense to find the animals, catalog them, rather than capture them and keep them in your pen? The combat system was heavily criticized online, but I think it's one of the thing about the game that was done quite well. I think once you learn a few spells, it gets quite fun. The dodging can be a little clunky, but the comboing feels very fluid and interesting. Some of the criticisms about the antisemitism in the story seem a little sensationalized, but I definitely think there are several elements to the story that are amiss (the bad guys are fighting for... equality?) sometimes once your character clears out a Goblin camp, they will say something like ""It's too late for you to change your ways!"" which sounds a little dark, and doesn't help the games image. On the plus side, at least, the inclusion of Sirona Ryan is a nice touch. It's a nice gesture by the game creators to have a transgender character who is an important part of the story, and an interesting character to boot. Still, I can't get it out of my head that one of the goblins says, ""I agree with you, violence isn't the answer!"" to the leader of the goblins, which is an incredibly milquetoast, neoliberal vision of the world. I suppose that fits with JK Rowling's style, much to the detriment of this game. Like I said, if you're a Harry Potter fan, it's probably worth playing. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this to RPG fans at all."

The map is smaller than it was going to be and it seems many corners was cut im guessing to meet a dead line sadly if you looking to buy this game wait for a sale. And the fact they have said there not planning any DLC's  for this game make this game a one hit wonder. Now haven said all that the game play its self and story was great just need more i do recommend this game but when its on sale

Fun.Sure there are some things about the game that could have been done much better, such as the itemization in the game, pet buffs, or even being able to add some smaller details within the games core to make it feel even more enjoyable when times in the game get stale and repetitive. Despite the cons, the game is seriously one of a kind. The only problem is FPS. For those who are having problems with FPS (I was having so much trouble getting stable frames over 30fps during some areas and cut scenes). I have a 3070 paired with 32 gb of ram and a decent cpu so I should be getting well over 60 frames even on max graphics. That was the complete opposite during the first couple of hours in the early access. Come to realize that majority of everyones FPS drops were coming from outdated graphics card drivers and just the game being poorly optimized in some instances. If you're still having problems with FPS and you run wallpaper engine in the background as I do with multiple monitors. Turn off Wallpaper Engine and try playing the game and see if that fixes anything (fixed majority of my major FPS drops in multiple cut scenes and areas). I recommend this game to anyone who is curious to purchase because in all honesty, there's something in this game for everyone to enjoy. I rate the game a 8.9/10"

It goes to show, no one cares or believes that Rowling is a bad person, and the Harry Potter franchise is still very dear to a lot of us. But online hate and all that aside, is Hogwarts Legacy worth it? Not as much as many would make you believe. It's a fine game, but it still suffers from the open-world fatigue and incredibly boring and repetitive things you do in it.  👍 +Sebastian side-quest+Combat can get crazy later on+Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are incredibly detailed👎-Main story-Boring, repetitive, and easy ""puzzles""-Enemy varietyThe main story is as interesting as a wet fart. You play as a random character that you create, who finds himself caught in a strange plot set out by some goblin thugs. Things get revealed to you really quickly that you are special and you have ancient powers, because of ""reasons"" and you are tasked to complete several tasks to train your ancient powers as well as uncover what the goblins are up to. Not much else interesting happens in the main story at all, you fight goblins and some humans and you stop their evil plan to use ancient magic, and that's it. You'll never get attached to any of the characters, not even Professor Fig, mostly because you rarely interact with any of the main cast. The main story lacks a lot of what makes Harry Potter charming. The story feels like it was made on a factory line. The only redeemable story-related aspect of Hogwarts Legacy is the major side-quest involving Sebastian, a Slitherin student, and his sister. It's a long side-quest, and it will be the path for your character to learn powerful and forbidden spells if you should choose to. It was 10 times better than the main quest, had a more emotional impact, and Sebastian played quite well as your companion. It's a shame this path or quest you go on, was not connected completely to the main quest, and even worse, no major repercussions on whether you learn or not these spells. Story rating: 6.5/10I'll split the gameplay part into two: exploration stuff and combat stuff. The combat is great as you will learn quite a high number of unique and well-known spells. The spell system is basically like the ranged version of Batman Arkham games. You have a dodge, parry, or block system, you aim at your targets easily and just combo your spells, for example, you can use Levioso to levitate the enemy in the air and then just smash him on the ground or pull him toward you and then fireball him. All the spells have colors on them to indicate which spells to counter the enemy shields which are also colored. It's a bit tough at the start, but once you get into it, it becomes second nature to you. And just like in Arkham games, the ancient power functions like your ultimate spell which does random things to your enemies. You can also stealth a lot of the encounters but the enemy AI is practically brain-dead and it becomes so easy that you'll force yourself into combat. While the combat is indeed great and satisfying, the enemy variety is absolute dog sht. I haven't seen a worse game than this in a long time. All you're going to fight is goblins, some humans, and spiders the entire game. Bosses? Have fun fighting the same troll boss at least 10 times. It is a disgrace to the huge variety of creatures the franchise has. Absolute pathetic. The exploration is not so great, especially outside Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and even in these two specific places outside of visuals which I'll talk about later, gameplay-wise it's boring as hell. There is nothing to do besides solve the same math door puzzles 100 times, taking a butterfly to its destination a million times, or unlocking a gazillion of chests. Outside of these locations get ready to do 100 merlin puzzles which are basic as hell, pop balloons, and collect other crap. Speaking of chests, you get clothes that you can equip on your character for different stats, however, you have a very limited amount of inventory for them and to unlock more, you have to do those tedious merlin puzzles. If I was a 10-year old maybe I wouldn't mind all of this so much but the open-world fatigue is real and it's not even a good open world. There are other mechanics like upgrading your spells, and having your own special room where you can craft potions, tame beasts, and design your own place as you see fit. They're all-time wasters with 0 value or impact on anything. Gameplay rating: 7/10Voice acting is pretty good, even your main custom character and I don't think I've ever heard someone sound uninteresting. Shame the writing isn't that good. The soundtrack is pretty good as well, it sounds very Harry Potter'ish if that is even a word, basically fits perfectly with the whole magical adventure. As for the sound effects, sadly not so great, especially in interiors when you're blasting spells left and right the bass is incredibly annoying and boom'ish, so much that it muffles the music, the voices, everything. Audio rating: 7.5/10Let's start with the best:  Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. Both of these locations are visually stunning and filled to the brim with huge amounts of details, great level design, and random encounters. A lot of effort went into making these two locations, no doubt but the problem is, you feel very detached from them as if you are not part of the world. In all the encounters you happen upon, you have no control, no reaction, nothing unlike all events in RDR2 for example. Outside of these locations, things start to get ugly and the generic open-world aspect starts to show its true fangs. Performance-wise the game is a mess, with lots of crashes and bugs, loadings in the open world, and ray-tracing features that are absolutely useless and look worse than without, with the exception of the reflections because they completely nerfed/removed most of the SSR features to make RT look better. Absolute shameful. We had working mirrors in games 20 years ago but now it's not possible without RT? Cmon. Typical UE4 bs. Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7/10Honestly, I was considering giving the game a thumbs down, but it's not bad, it's extremely overrated because of the online drama and because we finally got a Harry Potter game, but if none of that existed and this game would've been called anything else, I can guarantee you, the steam ratings would be much lower, at mixed. Even as a fan of the franchise, I'd say, get it on sale."

2523,Ence,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046537756/,3,,0,69.9,March,5,45,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is definitely a must have game for all HP fans. When you are travelling around Hogwarts and its neighborhood, you can feel the spirit of the books and movies. The overall atmosphere of the castle and the world around are the most important aspects of the game and I give developers much credit for transferring Rowling’s world into a PC game the way they did.On the other hand, the game has some issues when it comes to other gaming features. From my point of view, the following are the most serious:After deep thinking, unless you are a true HP fan, I do not recommend to buy the game (at least not right now when the price is still quite high). After finishing the game, I must say I do not feel satisfied enough when I consider the money and time spent needed to play and finish it."

2529,xRMGx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xRMGx/,6,1,0,67.6,February,12,377,0,1,"Alright, so since they are not going to allow me to refund the game because I have played over two hours, I will just blast it in my review and hopefully help someone else in my stead.  For the first time in years, I pre-purchased a game, Hogwarts Legacy, and I pre-purchased the deluxe edition because I knew I was going to be playing as soon as it released.  And, for the most part, the game has not disappointed.  It is beautiful, gorgeous even, and immersive.  The world-building is on par in its “epicness” to the likes of Skyrim and GTA.  Not to mention, the world feels very much alive with all of it its small details, sounds, etc.  It is very fleshed out and I truly feel like I am a part of it.  Indeed, it is quite noticeable the extent of thought, love, and hard-work that went into Hogwarts Legacy.  I can see myself investing hundreds of hours of my time exploring, questing, and just having fun.However, Hogwarts Legacy is a product of its time -- a late 19th century world clearly built in 2023.  First example of what I mean by that:  There are no pronouns, everyone is they or them or their.  Me, I am playing a 15-year-old boy, clearly, a 5th year male Hogwarts student.  However, I am not addressed as he or him by NPCs; I am addressed as they, them, and their.  And, yes, it is noticeable; it feels forced and un-natural.  And, no, there is no choice in how you are addressed.  We are supposed to be in 1890s Hogwarts but the dialog sure does not feel or sound late Victorian.  Second example:  This game, as we know, is taking place in the late 19th century, but there exists an openly transsexual NPC and there is another NPC that not only is openly homosexual but is also married.  During this era there would not have been openly trans or homosexual people, let alone homosexual marriage.  That is not meant to be offensive, that is a fact.  And facts are stubborn things:  Such ""activities"" would have been very much indeed closeted, if not illegal, let alone even existing.  And all of this, by the way, I personally did not know until after having discovered them within the game myself, hence, Steam, why I requested a refund with so much time played:  Because the developers and the publisher were not transparent in the development of their own game prior to releasing it!As for play-ability, I do not know if it is because of Denuvo for certain, but I am confident that it is considering my rig is a beast, not to mention state-of-the-art (spared no expense), but my game will CTD when loading my last save, either right before the save is loaded or shortly after getting into the game, especially after hibernating my PC and launching the game the next day.  Sometimes, it will not even let me load the game -- I click Play from my Steam Library, or double click the shortcut, my Steam status changes to in-game but then mysteriously drops without the game even launching.  In this case, I must completely restart my PC to get the game to launch.  The former, I just try and try again and eventually I can play.  There are also these massive frame rate losses that do occur seemingly at random, out of the blue.  I enter a classroom to speak to a professor, for example, engage in dialog with the professor, and my frames drop to 30-40.I also want to mention here, to drive home the point in the failure of transparency on part of the developers and publisher, Denuvo was imposed in the 11th hour.  I would not have pre-purchased if Denuvo was a thing from the get-go.  Indeed, this game has taught me to never pre-purchase a game, ever, no matter how it is perceived or presented -- wait for after release and wait for reviews after release before purchasing, lest something like Denuvo be added at the 11th hour, or the game be not what is perceived to be even with outrage mobs.So, in conclusion, the game is beautiful and immersive, but do not get me wrong:   it also is woke; it is agenda-driven.  If you are looking for a Wizarding World game to escape the contemporary politics of real life, this is not the game for you, stranger.  Hopefully with Denuvo they will just simply remove it at some point; if they do, that part of my review will become moot.  Nevertheless, I really hope this review helps someone in making an informed decision prior to purchasing.  Here’s to hoping Starfield will be better.  Cheers for reading, and happy gaming!Edit:  Curious that it's saying I received this for free.  I most certainly did not.  Maybe because I tried to refund it and was rejected???"
2530,Remoraid Simp,https://steamcommunity.com/id/satanskates/,2,,1,26.3,March,8,61,0,1,"While I have enjoyed my time playing Hogwarts Legacy so far and would definitely recommend it as an entertaining and casual game that's content-rich and worth the $60 price tag, there are a number of things that have left me scratching my head throughout my time in the game so far and left me somewhat unsatisfied as a long-time Harry Potter fan. There are some spoilers below, so fair warning there. I first want to quickly highlight some of the things that the game does right, especially the combat. The combat is fluid, and the game does a really good job of making you feel powerful with only a few spells under your belt. The Talents (skill trees) are all pretty cool, adding to the combat in meaningful ways - cursing multiple enemies deals damage to all of them at once, the upgraded roll-dash is rad, extra layers for equipping multiple sets of spells, casting spells like Accio affects groups of enemies instead of just single enemies at a time, etc. The combat is fluid and largely interesting, and I think this is a real strong point of the game. The game has plenty of content in it, with hundreds of collectibles, a very sizable map, etc. There's plenty to keep you busy for dozens of hours, which is what I would expect from a $60 release in 2023. That said, there are a number of things that disappoint as well. One of my biggest problems with the game is that the loot system feels essentially meaningless. Every piece of loot that I've found throughout the game so far is a clothing item, a solid majority of which have terrible stats and end up being useless. The only consistent way of earning money in the game that I've found so far is by selling your clothing items to merchants, so 90% of the time you're just going to sell everything you find. Yet after selling your items, you're still able to equip the cosmetics from those items over the gear you're wearing through the game's secondary cosmetic menu along the lines of layered armor in Monster Hunter or transmog in Cyberpunk. So in the end, the general lifecycle for loot is: find a single random scarf in a chest at the end of a dungeon/quest, immediately sell it because of its terrible stats and that being your primary source of income, then equip its cosmetic anyways over the random hodgepodge of gear you have equipped. It makes a large percentage of the loot that you find uninteresting, since you know you're just going to sell it and still be able to use it cosmetically whenever you want regardless. Then you have the Merlin Trials, puzzles scattered throughout the map which, upon completing them, solely reward you with more inventory space for storing more clothing items. I never have any clothing items in my inventory anyways because they're largely pointless to keep and I need the money, so why would I go do the Merlin trials to get more space to store even more of them? In the end, the game disincentivizes both its looting system and one of its widespread puzzle systems/main early-game points of interest in one fell swoop. Another aspect of the game that's been somewhat underwhelming is the dialogue. Much of the characters' dialogue drags on and on, often over-explaining things that are immediately obvious while not addressing other pieces of information that would be useful. For example, I spent something like 20 minutes working through dialogue with Professor Weasley, listening to her over-explain how to decorate the Room of Requirement, but she never once took two seconds to inform me of the fact that I can skip time via my map. I never noticed or heard any mention of this until I was something like 12ish hours into the game, instead sitting on the floor in front of my classrooms at 2:00am to skip to daytime for class. You can't sleep in your bed in your dormitory as one would expect, so I just assumed the only way to skip time was to show up to a quest and sit on the floor. Random bits and pieces of small features like this could have easily been mentioned in dialogue with NPCs instead of them constantly over-explaining that there's a door 5 feet behind me that I should investigate. When so much of the dialogue is superfluous, I've largely started skipping through it to just get to the point and work through quests, which is rather disappointing considering how easily they could've done more to make the dialogue feel more meaningful.This also bleeds into the classes/quests. I went to my first Beasts class and spent a bit working through dialogue over-explaining things that I likely should've learned as a first-year student, just to be tasked with...brushing little puffball bros and feeding them pellets. You do this for two different kinds of creatures and class is abruptly dismissed. Afterwards, you have a conversation with a classmate (who makes sure to inform you that she imagines that the critter pellets taste like pudding) about poachers who kill the various cute critters and she tells you that she's going to investigate the poachers in the forest. And...that's it. You just tell her to keep you posted. No invitation to come with to back her up, no mention of where she's going to incentivize you to explore the map, no beginning to a new quest, nothing. No spells learned in class, no new features unlocked. Whole lotta nada. Why did I just spend 20 minutes sitting in class as a supposed fifth-year student, learning how to brush puffball homies and talking to my classmate about her grandma? Why does nothing come of my classmate telling me she's going to investigate a bunch of dark wizard ass poachers? I am the protagonist right? You see similar weird decisions all throughout the game: your dormitory serves no purpose, with no way to sleep in the bed and hardly any indication as to which room and bed are yours in the first place (but at least you can spin the globe that's sitting in the corner!). Your professors often teach you spells entirely unrelated to the classes that they teach - why is my Herbology teacher having me levitate wood boxes in her classroom with Wingardium Leviosa? Ain't that Charms? Why is my Potions professor teaching me a spell to push books around in his classroom? Why are all of the brooms literally exactly the same stat-wise, making the only distinction between them aesthetics? Why am I forced to spend 20 minutes putting 14 paintings on the walls and changing the color of the curtains in the Room of Requirement instead of doing literally anything else? Thematically, there have been a number of moments that don't feel like they belong in the world of Harry Potter. Why am I fighting ancient Zeffo guardians straight out of Jedi Fallen Order, chucking big energy balls at  a Wizarding World/Harry Potter game? Why do the ancient magic dungeons feel like they're pulled out of BOTW aesthetically? Why is the castle literally completely empty at night, with nobody telling me to stop wandering the halls or anything? Why is the famous changing staircase a circle that doesn't change at all? I mean, come on man, they got the staircase right for the PS2 games 15 years ago. There's no reason for it to have not been accurate here. The game clearly has passion behind it, and it is undoubtedly a good time and fun to play through, with plenty of content to justify the $60 purchase (hence why I'm recommending it despite my nitpicking), but enough things are fluffy, inconsistent, or thematically off that I'm definitely left with an uncanny valley feeling at times. As a lifelong, borderline obsessed Harry Potter fan, there's plenty of preexisting worldbuilding and lore to build off of, yet many elements of the main story feel out of place in the world of Harry Potter. Some parts of Hogwarts are recognizable, but a lot of it has less resemblance to the Hogwarts that we know through the existing Harry Potter media out there than I would have expected/liked. There's just enough slightly off to the game that makes it not hit how I hoped it would. Food for thought in the end."

Fast-traveling is a great option for those who would rather teleport places- The room of requirement brings the personalization aspect that many will like, with furniture, potions/plants stations and magical creature- Fights are fun with the variety of spells you can use to defeat enemiesWhile the game does miss Quidditch as many know and is in no way perfect, it is an amazing experience worth trying.

I didn't expect this game to be THIS good.Be aware though, this is an adventure game with a lot of puzzles and story. It just happens to have really amazing combat system. I also want to say that this game oozes love. Developers definitely were enjoying making this game and did put a lot of care in this title.+Combat system. Damn, it's so much fun. Basic spell casts, block, parry, perfect parry, dodge, dash/teleportation, counterhits against unblockable moves. A lot of special spell interactions too. Like how you can deal a lot of damage to an enemy if you freeze him and then cast cutting spell. Or how you can dodge from troll's blockable attack and use Flippendo instead, to make him hit himself with a giant club. Once you unlock 4 spell diamonds, combat system really opens up and every battle turns into that deadly fencing match with a lot of different spells. Probably my favourite aspect of this game so far.+Good enemy variety. Every type of wizard enemy has his own interactions that makes them unique. Same applies to other enemies as well. Boss fights were pretty enjoyable too, even though on a more simple side.+Puzzles. A lot of them. Like, really a lot of them. And they don't get old. I've spent a lot of time running around solving Merlin trials, or picking the locks (yes, it's a mini game too), or catching flying pages, moving boulders with different magic, catching creatures, etc etc.+Story. They really did well with the story. I enjoyed both main and many side quests.+Replayability. Different houses have unique quest in game. Also you can come to the cleared enemy camps and fight enemies again. Can replay arenas endlessly too.+Room of requirement and animal keeping. Honestly, I'm not much of a stardew valley dude, but this aspect is pretty fun even for me.+UI. Damn, UI settings are so good. You can disable or enable pretty much any UI element. Can turn off screen shake too. Thank you devs!+Vibe. This game absolutely manages to catch that wizarding world vibe and immerse you. As for negatives, there isn't much to be honest.-DENUVO.-Character customisation is limited to presets. I kinda wish games nowadays had character creation on par with Nioh 2 in terms of flexibility. Also first 3 skin tones are the same and they aren't that pale to begin with.-Talents and spells. I wish there was more of them. Like stuff that enemies cast too. Reducto, for example. Or others.-Slight stuttering in Hogsmeade in autumn season. Didn't have that in any other seasons."

When I was younger, I even memorized spells and was fascinated by the creatures and world-building the Harry Potter universe has. Whether people like J.K.

prizeThat's right, a first class one-way ticket to AlbuquerqueOh yeahYou know, I'd never been on a real airplane beforeAnd I gotta tell ya, it was really greatExcept that I had to sit between two large Albanian womenWith excruciatingly severe body odorAnd the little kid in back of me kept throwin' up the whole timeThe flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanutsAnd the in-flight movie was Bio-Dome with Pauly ShoreAnd, oh yeah, three of the airplane engines burned outAnd we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillsideAnd the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody diedExcept for meYou know why?'Cause I had my tray table upAnd my seat back in the full upright positionSo I crawled from the twisted, burnin' wreckageI crawled on my hands and knees for three full daysDraggin' along my big leather suitcase and my garment bagAnd my tenor saxophone and my twelve-pound bowling ballAnd my lucky, lucky autographed glow-in-the-dark snorkelBut finally I arrived at the world famous Albuquerque Holiday InnWhere the towels are oh so fluffyAnd you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wannaIt's OK, they're cleanWell, I checked into my room and I turned down the A/CAnd I turned on the SpectraVisionAnd I'm just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillowThat I love so very, very much when suddenly, there's a knock on the doorWell now, who could that be?I say ""Who is it?""No answer""Who is it?""There's no answer""Who is it?""They're not sayin' anythingSo, finally I go over and I open the door and just as I suspectedIt's some big fat hermaphrodite with a Flock-Of-Seagulls haircut and only one nostrilOh man, I hate it when I'm rightSo anyway, he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkelAnd I'm like ""Hey, you can't have that""""That snorkel's been just like a snorkel to me""And he's like ""Tough""And I'm like ""Give it""And he's like ""Make me""And I'm like ""'Kay""So I grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagusAnd I bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrowsAnd I took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigationYes indeed, you better believe itAnd somehow in the middle of it all, the phone got knocked off the hookAnd twenty seconds later, I heard a familiar voiceAnd you know what it said?I'll tell you what it saidIt said""If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again""""If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator""""If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again""""If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator""In AlbuquerqueWell, to cut a long story short, he got away with my snorkelBut I made a solemn vow right then and there that I would not restI would not sleep for an instant until the one-nostrilled man was brought to justiceBut first, I decided to buy some donutsSo I got in my car and I drove over to the donuts shopAnd I walked on up to the guy behind the counterAnd he says ""Yeah, what do ya want?""I said ""You got any glazed donuts?""He said ""No, we're outta glazed donuts""I said ""Well, you got any jelly donuts?""He said ""No, we're outta jelly donuts""I said ""You got any Bavarian cream-filled donuts?""He said ""No, we're outta Bavarian cream-filled donuts""I said ""You got any cinnamon rolls?""He said ""No, we're outta cinnamon rolls""I said ""You got any apple fritters?""He said ""No, we're outta apple fritters""I said ""You got any bear claws?""He said ""Wait a minute, I'll go check""""No, we're outta bear claws""I said ""Well, in that case, in that case, what do you have?""He says ""All I got right now is this box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels""I said ""OK, I'll take that""So he hands me the box and I open up the lid and the weasels jump outAnd they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin' me all overOh man, they were just going nutsThey were tearin' me apartYou know, I think it was just about that timeThat a little ditty started goin' through my headI believe it went a little something like thisDohGet 'em off meGet 'em off meOhNo, get 'em off, get 'em offOh, oh God, oh GodOh, get 'em off meOh, oh GodAh, aah, aahI ran out into the street with these flesh-eating weasels all over my faceWavin' my arms all around and just runnin', runnin', runnin'Like a constipated wiener dogAnd as luck would have itThat's exactly when I ran into the girl of my dreamsHer name was ZeldaShe was a calligraphy enthusiastWith a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peachesI'll never forget the very first thing she said to meShe said ""Hey, you've got weasels on your face""That's when I knew it was true loveWe were inseparable after thatAw, we ate together, we bathed togetherWe even shared the same piece of mint-flavored dental flossThe world was our burritoSo we got married and we bought us a houseAnd had two beautiful children, Nathaniel and SuperflyOh, we were so very very very happy, aw yeahBut then one fateful night, Zelda said to meShe said ""Sweetie pumpkin? Do you wanna join the Columbia Record Club?""I said ""Whoa, hold on now, baby""""I'm just not ready for that kind of a commitment""So we broke up and I never saw her againBut that's just the way things goIn AlbuquerqueAnyway, things really started lookin' up for meBecause about a week later, I finally achieved my lifelong dreamThat's right, I got me a part-time job at The SizzlerI even made employee of the month after I put out that grease fire out with my faceAw yeah, everybody was pretty jealous of me after thatI was gettin' a lot of attitudeOk, like one time, I was out in the parking lotTryin' to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencilWhen I see this guy MartyTryin' to carry a big ol' sofa up the stairs all by himselfSo I, I say to him, I say ""Hey, you want me to help you with that?""And Marty, he just rolls his eyes and goes ""No, I want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw""So I didAnd then he gets all indignant on meHe's like ""Hey man, I was just being sarcastic""Well, that's just greatHow was I supposed to know that? I'm not a mind reader for cryin' out loud Besides, now he's got a really cute nickname, Torso-Boy So what's he complaining about?Say, that reminds me why I am I making this? Oh yeah I made Weird Al in this game Would Yankovic all over the Warts Legacy again"

It's a real dream coming true! INSANE level of details. Very rich environment/surroundings full of objects to observe and interact with, places to explore. NPCs feel alive with tons of interesting dialogues and animations (NPC A.I could be better though). Really HUGE world. The castle itself is an enormous maze you can easily get lost in. The size of the castle alone is more than satisfying to those who value big map size and is so large that you almost forget there are vast areas exist beyond waiting for you to explore. Breathtaking magical atmosphere. Adorable beasts. Living world. Tons of quests, collectables, customization, activities, secrets and puzzles.. and much more. Occasional FPS stuttering and drops (not often, and only for a few seconds). Needs a little more optimization and polishing. However not that bad and doesn't ruin your experience at all. Completely playable. I recommend turning ray tracing off for now until the game gets patched properly. But in general it runs pretty nice and smooth."

First a TL:DR Version:TL:DR: It's a good game, but not a perfect game. I enjoyed it, the Hogwarts castle is beautifully made with all the care and attention to detail a Wizarding World fan could want. The music is absolutely amazing, the environment is stunning. I wish they had spent more time in Hogwarts and the school aspect, i wish your interactions with NPCs were more in depth, and your choices made more a difference. Good game, not perfect, but still fun.Pros:+ Ansel Photomode works!+ Book accurate, including Ravenclaw colors and symbol+ Great music+ The castle is very well designed+ Large open world+ Ton of clothing customization+ Combat is fun, but challenging, with lots of combos and juggling possiblity + Peeves is here!+ The room of requirement has TONS of customization, truly can make it your own+ Most Puzzles are interesting and not too tedious+ You can pet cats!+ Animal collecting and breedingCons:- 1 crash in my entire playtime, so not too bad- Model pop in sometimes- Your character comments too much, especially during puzzles giving clues. I want to figure it out myself game!- Classes are very basic, mostly cut scenes. This isn't Bully or a school sim- Lots of repeated paintings in the castle- Voice pitch in character creation is robotic sounding- Stuttering on mid range computer during combat / NPC heavy areas - Character customization for face is very limited, but still decent- Cutscenes stutter and FPS drop worse than any other part of the game - For a game set in Europe in 1800s, some people might find the racial diversity immersion breaking- Can't interact with other students very much outside of quests- NPCs dont react to anything. Spells, breaking locks, etc- Your choices don't make that much of a difference- Open world missions and tasks can get very repetitive if you don't enjoy that kind of thing- Spiders, LOTS of spiders, for you Arachnophobes out thereBut for me, personally, the game scratches practically every itch I have for a game:+ Puzzles and mini games+ Dungeon crawling+ Pokemon (magical beast) collecting and breeding+ Decorating sim with the Room of Requirement+ Farming and crafting+ Fun combat"

I was once talking to a shopkeeper, and could see in the background a wizard wrestling a vicious cabbage in his garden. I feel as though I'm in the world. I like my character. I played through without spoilers to get the authentic experience, something I don't usually care about -I actually like the combat system for once. It's challenging on normal, but just the right amount of challenge. Visually combat looks really good too.-Very beautiful world, something that matters to me. Dark forests, windswept craggy coastline, old forgotten places-Very forgiving game. Difficulty settings you can change whenever. No timed quests. You can change night/day without penalty.-the Room of requirement is amazing!! Love the customization options. -the vivarium concept is outstanding! They're gorgeous inside and out.-the music and sounds are very pleasing. My character's voice is exquisite. I could listen to her talk forever-I love being able to customize my gear's appearance as I please, this feature is fantastic-I haven't seen a single bug. Just one dude floating next to a cliff. Well, he's a wizard, so maybe he was supposed to be.Areas for improvement:-It's VERY controlling about when you get what, and you have to wait until the end of the main story to get some extremely desirable things, so you don't get to enjoy them for very long. I don't want to wait til end of game for **spoilers** a ground mount, last vivarium, dark magic spells, etc.-The fully upgraded room of requirement doesn't have enough slots for all the beasts you'll want to keep. Not even close. With all the possible colors, they need to expand slots. There's tons of room in there-there are ""rare"" beasts to find, but they aren't very imaginatively done. Who cares about an albino niffler? This is a magical world. How about a purple spotted sparkling niffler? A blue glowing unicorn? The variety offered is like the difference between beige and brown. The regular animals are usually more colorful-no romance. They say they left it out because they're kids. But the kids are facing adult situations like killing and dying. And kids that age go to dances and stuff in real life. Don't be stodgy. I really enjoyed the date feature on the mobile game.-i hate puzzles. This game is puzzle heavy. If they're too hard or involved I just look them up. -I did manage to get a character I truly enjoy looking at, but it wasn't easy. Hopefully they'll eventually allow modding with sliders.-I hope they bulk it up. This isn't exactly Skyrim, where you could never finish every quest. It isn't too small to be worth the money, it totally is worth it. But... end game content in seriously lacking, relegated to mopping up after the party"
2569,Zbrggs,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034123727/,4,,0,155.2,March,12,61,0,1,"While engaging for a time, the game quickly becomes stale and repetitive. An overabundance of repetitive and tedious side activities detracts from the main story and leads to burnout without any feeling of reward. The lack of unique dialogue ruins what little RPG elements the game presents. At the risk of compromising my review, Rockstar could have re-skinned Bully and made a more interesting Hogwarts experience."
2570,Max Harvey,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006927113/,3,,0,16.4,March,25,387,0,1,"BEAUTIFUL but BORINGIncredible work which is ultimately boring.  The artwork and design are amazing.  Every element of the game looks beautiful, right down to the menus.  The voice acting is superb.  The magic and crafting system is competent but nothing special.But the game is BORING.  The combat system is simplistic and not much more than button mashing, and where other systems would require tactics, this one just needs you to hit the dodge button at the right time.  You can explore the open world, but it's BORING.  There's not much variety and enemies just inhabit limited zones until you choose to go attack them.  And everything is far to spread out so you waste masses of time pointless running from place to place.  Plot development is GLACIAL and padded out with pointless BORING side quests.  And once you have interacted with a character, such as competing against another student, they will say exactly the same 3-4 lines every single time you interact with them.It's a great pity - the art design, voice acting, visuals, etc are AMAZING.  But game play was completely ignored. Once the novelty of being in a brilliant depiction of Hogwarts wears thin (which happens quickly), the game basically boils down to one long dull grind.I'm glad I've seen inside it, but I  really didn't get my money's worth.  Wait for it to go on on sale."

This Early Release is anything but customer friendly. So far, WB/Avalanche haven't made much of an effort to fix this problem.What everyone actually wants to know, though: Is the game any good? Probably yes, but I can't enjoy it because of the fluctuating frames.

I purchased the game on a recommendation from a co worker.The game is story driven, though very easy to over level if you are following main story as well as side quests.  Over leveling meant encounters which should have been difficult were easy for me.  Note, this may not be the same for folks who got the game for the Lore and not video game savvy.Yes, modern social engineering is present in the game, take it, leave it, wasn't necessary nor did it 'add' anything to the story.Graphics - I had no issues playing Ultra with raytracing on.   The landscape was beautiful, but lighting between the world and the character is odd.  Outside of cut scenes it felt as if the character was in front of a green screen instead of being part of the land they were traipsing or flying around.Characters - skin textures (not colors ... textures) are flat, no depth, even when changing complexions.  However the NPC skins, especially aged had more depth.  It's like the avatar's normal maps were missing.Largest Con - Item handling.  Hate it, hate it, hate it.  No such thing as storage.  While you can keep the 'image' of the item, and reskin what you are wearing,  You cannot fling your robe across a chair, drop gloves on edge of desk.  Stack components on a shelf.  Blaergh blah bah hum bug.Lastly - replay factor, for me at least is lacking.  Unless you are hunting achievements.  I'll get my money's worth out of completing the story, but that is about it.  Shame really, game feels like it was so caught up in trying to keep everyone happy, there isn't enough 'oomph' in it, either at the story telling level or the gaming level for me to want to go back and watch the movies or read the books.

Other than a few minor bugs (like hair and clothing twitching in place), it's a very solid, very polished game. It slowly unlocks more and more customization options as you play through the main storyline, so maybe I shouldn't be running around doing all the side quests, but it's very enjoyable to run around and find some ruins and then puzzle out how to get into the locked area with a treasure chest in it.And that's really what the game is about - puzzle solving. Combat is trivially easy (Press Block when it tells you to Block, press Dodge when it tells you to Dodge and you will win 100% of the time with 0% damage), but the game is not really about combat, it's about the giant puzzle box known as Hogwarts and Environs. Notably, all the leveling you get in this game are from completing challenges and solving puzzles, and not from combat (though there are combat challenges technically). So if you very thoroughly search Hogwarts, you can be way ahead of the level you're supposed to be, which is kind of fun, honestly."

If you're not a fan of games with tons of cinematics or puzzle-solving, I'd recommend skipping the title unless you're really into open world exploration games.During the early access, RTX was essentially broken on any video card so if running the best option you can on your hardware is a requirement for you to consider the game fun, you might want to hold off a bit.

I was concerned with Hogwarts. But the school is massive and intricately designed. There was so much to do and so many puzzles which did not make it feel empty.  However, the performance on PC is horrible. The game stutters constantly. Let's hope that further patches will fix this problem."
2605,Akiirah,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Akiirah/,4,2,0,57.1,March,1,137,0,1,"LOWER END SYSTEMS:I'm only 20-30 hours in, but the game is extremely unoptimized at the moment for lower end systems. I'm using a 1660Ti, 32GB ram, and without ""performance mods / fixes"", the game crashes every 10-15 minutes (ie: you have to install Ascendio from nexus mods, modify the Engine.ini & CChromaEditorLibrary64.dll, turn on GPU ""Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling"", & change some Nvidia Global Settings). After the above performance fixes, the game (mostly) stops crashing, but I have to run it on 720p, with AMD 2 Upscale, Good Preset, (RTX off obviously). Anything higher, and the game crashes every 10-15 minutes again. Every time the game updates, I have to reinstall the performance mods. Denuvo DRM continually runs in the background, in short it scans your system looking for any tampering in the game files. Even though Empress (a cracker) recently ""removed Denuvo DRM"", there was no real performance gain, because the crack can only bypass Denuvo, but it continues to constantly run in the background. For those of you running the game at 120+ fps, a ~20fps performance gain is negligible, but for someone like me who barely runs the game at 20fps, it would be double the performance. It constantly stutters during cutscenes, and when loading new scenes. Don't get me wrong, I've really enjoyed the game post-fixes, the world is beautiful, and feels far more expansive than the movies, and for any Harry Potter fan -- it's nothing short of a childhood dream come true. But I would not recommend the game right now, or at full price. There's many other issues like the female models all use a copy-pasted Male animation rigs & weights, causing unexpected results, like the female models grimacing, making malicious, witch like faces in-game (Google it), and running around like a hooligan with no grace or femininity at all. There's no White / Pale Caucasian or Black skin tones, it starts from tan & ends at a dark brown. All these bugs are listed on the Hogwarts DB and will potentially be worked on in future, but modders seem to be addressing them way faster than developers are. I'd say give it 6-12 months and wait for a sale, hopefully WB removes Denuvo, and the game is in a much optimised state after updates & fixes. Otherwise, we're going to have to rely on the modding community to better the game. I will amend this review once the game is in a better place and I only discourage it in it's current state, and on lower end systems.  P.s If you have a higher end system, have FOMO / fear of missing out, and want to talk about it with friends, by all means get it."
2606,ᴅɪᴅᴅʟᴇʏ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Diddley4209/,5,,0,2.7,February,14,373,7,1,"Phenomenal world design, directly drawn from the Harry Potter universe, but everything else falls completely flat. The characters are one-dimensional, without any additional complexity beyond ""good"" and ""evil,"" and the dialogue is ridiculously childish to the point of lunacy. The main character is your generic self-insert chosen one protagonist, which can be executed fairly well, but isn't in this case. Your status as a ""student"" is completely inconsistent with the gameplay and power fantasy plot, while there is almost no interaction with fellow students in a realistic way besides them simply praising you as this yet unbeknownst prodigy. Roleplaying elements are ""present,"" but they feel more haphazardly tacked on rather than actually adding anything of meaning (side quests are as generic as they can be, and dialogue choices offer no real choices or complexity). The gameplay is actually fairly well-executed, duels are fun and engaging, but certain fights certainly rely on sponginess, and the UI design is abhorrent (animations are impressively slow, while important gameplay elements are locked behind talents). Performance issues are present, but not unusably so, although it is comical for this to be an issue in a game with character models ripped straight out of 2015. Despite all this, it's definitely not a terrible game, with a very polished open world, beautiful art direction, and complete faithfulness to the Harry Potter lore, but it's by no means an especially great one, offering nothing new or special despite the illustrious Harry Potter skin. As far as licensed games go, this is a fantastic one, and Harry Potter fans will likely love it, but as far as games go in general, I'd find it difficult to recommend, even though I loved this series when I was younger.6.5/10"

My overall score for this game is 6/10.I dont know where to start from so i am gonna just list all the negative stuff i encountered while playing the game.Firstly the main storyline is pretty badly excecuted, especially at the end of the game after the final boss fight there is no interaction with the keepers to conclude the story, the game just ends there.There is also a hasle of a sidequests to unlock some spells, mainly for alohomora felt like the most useless spell, completing the quest to get alohomora lvl 3 felt rly bad, all the rewards i got from opening lvl 3 locks is just a couple gold and maybe a item which feels pretty bad because all that time spent on the quest just to be able to get a couple gold felt pretty demotivating, the only use for aolohomora lvl 3 was to get one of Hogwarts secrets.A lot of things felt like they were there just to give you options, like catching beasts just to be able to put 4 of them in farm when it shows having much more slots, without the option to upgrade all for you to get some materials to upgrade items which felt worthless because they are lvl based meaning you upgrade the item and the next item you get is already better than it, not to mention upgrading stats just unlock the other stat to upgrade. Meaning if you have attack item upgrading it you get defense so it didnt felt usefull to upgrade items, making the pet system worthless.Combat felt nice at first but then you notice thats all there is to it, all the boss fights are pretty much the same in execution. During combat with multiple enemies the warning to parry/dodge isnt showing always you need to listen to audio que and even then you dont know are they targeting you or the ally you are fighting with.A lot of QoL are in need, don't know why they arent done yet, especially for selling items it feels demotivating to explore since you dont have a lot of inventory space and need to go sell items every so often, and selling requires you to hold the button for each item individually and yes i had inventory fully expanded.Exploration, yes it didnt feel good, there are a bunch of caves that i thought at beginning to be dungeons but all they are are you unlock the gate enter pick the item and thats it, in some there is sometimes puzzle but yeah thats it most of times. Good thing is if you revelio while in the air it shows you all the places you can go, except some, but there are very little fun adventures most of them being side quests.The game starts strong but falls down very quickly, had to make myself play in order to finish it. The game feels like gujian 3 but executed much more badly."

Not at all.- The quests are absolutely AFKable. Talk to person x. Bring me object y, defeat group z.- Collectibles/Challenges (100% achievements) are boring as hell. Merlin challenges are too simple, Items are completely random and there is no real value to selling them- Professors give housepoints, but the hourglasses don't do stuff and there is no housecup.- No quidditch regardless of there being a field (probably a future DLC, but the studios already said theyre not in a rush to make DLCs)- The repetitiveness of dialouges are terrible; seems like all roads lead to hogsmead.- The main story is boring up untill the last quest. The Sebastian storyarch is more interesting than the main story.- Combat is WAAAAAAAY too easy.- Room of requirement is useless. Because if you loom your gear to do more damage combat will just get even easier and who really needs potions apart from doing quests to get more spells.- The restricted section is only restricted when you go there for a quest.

A positive thing I can say is that I really enjoy the combat system, it's fun to spam the opponents with your spells. The main quest is boring and don't get me started on the side quests. OFCOURSE you are the one student who gets everything right at the first time, WITHOUT ANY PRACTISE? Sure. I feel like it doesn't really matter what house you chose, you still talk in the same tone and treat everyone the same while sounding like a robot. The character customization is fine in my opinion.The idea of having a 3D-ish map is really cool, but I don't know how many times I missclicked a Foo-flame in hogwarts.You might have a unisex character, but are still not able to wear every outfit?

2629,RobbyBunny,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RobbyBunny/,2,,1,15.5,February,13,566,0,1,"Before diving into the review, it's important to address the controversy surrounding the author of the original Harry Potter books and her exclusionary statements. It's entirely understandable for those hurt by her opinions to boycott this game. This review, and the praise and criticisms within it, in no way reflects my views on the statements and opinions held by the author and I stand in support of anyone unwilling to purchase this game for that reason.Hogwarts Legacy is a nostalgic experience for Harry Potter fans, with stunning graphics and attention to detail in the world of Hogwarts. The open world allows players to explore the castle and grounds, uncovering hidden secrets and discovering new areas as they progress through the game. The spell system is simple at first but becomes surprisingly intricate and detailed as players progress. The puzzle elements in the game add a new level of challenge and depth to the gameplay.The original music remixed into the game adds to the overall nostalgia and atmosphere, making it an immersive and faithful experience for existing fans and new players. The tutorial, while detailed, can be a bit frustrating as players lose control of their character at times to progress the story. The collectibles in the game add to the overall lore and provide a sense of discovery for players but it can feel like they are included primarily to pad out the length of the game and can feel repetitive at times. The game has a wide range of accessibility settings, including a granular difficulty slider, making it accessible to a wider range of players, including those with disabilities.However, there are some larger drawbacks to the game as well. The severe performance issues caused by the Denuvo anti-cheat system can be a major hindrance, and the NPCs often feel like set pieces rather than living, breathing characters. They don't interact with the player, making the world feel less alive. The main antagonist feels a bit childish, but the overall narrative is engaging and interesting.Another minor annoyance is the inability to pause the menu during cutscenes to adjust settings, including volume. This can be a mild nuisance for players who need to make adjustments in the middle of a scene.In conclusion, Hogwarts Legacy is a beautiful game that is a must-have for Harry Potter fans. The attention to detail, spell system, puzzle elements, and overall narrative make it an enjoyable and nostalgic experience. The accessibility options and granular difficulty slider make it accessible to a wider range of players. However, the severe performance issues and lack of interaction with NPCs are significant drawbacks that should be considered before purchasing."

Anyways, I'm absolutely impressed with how the music emulates John Williams' scores and is an absolute love letter to his music.  This game truly feels like the definitive Harry Potter experience. It's neat how you can chain spells into combos. One of the few small gripes I have is I'm pretty much forced to use the default voice as the other ""voices"" are just pitch shifts of the same voice and therefore sound very modulated, very synthetic, like they sound like they're talking through a paper tube or something. The game as of the time of playing it seems to have trouble with shader compiling as it wants to do this slowly every time I launch the game. The game has tons of spells and cosmetics in it. It's nice that you can have your gear with stats reflect the cosmetic choices that you want too. If you don't like the look of something you're wearing, you can disguise it as another piece of your gear or just decide to hide it altogether.

Sadly it could've used a little bit more of that dedication on the PC port front, the game is very resource heavy and it will push to the limit, even the newest GPUs, There are issues with strange frame dropping, which seem to be improved by the latest patch, so maybe there is hope?Another gameplay aspect that I found strange is that the enemies scale with you, which is very weird. Especially since the game has a lot of spells in place for you to find a weakness in enemies and at the same time is incredibly rewarding ""EXP"" (finding pages of your Field Guide and completing minor side activities will let you breeze through levels, even if you don't want) wise.

Outside of missions, the world is boring. There is no curfew outside of missions, which is a thing that I expected to be in the open world. Quest givers are  in the same place 24/7 (it can be 3AM and a 2nd year student will still be in the hallways asking for help). Shops are open 24/7, so nobody goes to sleep. The only use for day/night cycle that I saw is that there are some beasts (capturable, not enemies) that spawn at night and you can only use your telescope to look at the stars during nighttime. You can use unforgivable curses, but npcs don't react to that (again outside questlines tackling that), so yeah, the world feels pretty much dead. Combat was fun enough in the beginning but after awhile, you get bored since enemy variety is lacking.Overall it is an OK game, but if you have played any open world game in the last 10 years, this is basically it with a Hogwarts skin. Its worst crime is that it makes me think of older games that did what Hogwarts Legacy does, but better. I'd say it's a 6.5-7.0 game, but the reason I gave it a thumbsdown is because I cannot bring myself to return to the game and finish it."
2643,Sweet Chary Pie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fattygwopstack/,3,,0,12.8,February,19,156,0,1,"Game has so much potential, unfortunately Avalanche and WB shows they are just money hungry and didn't fully test the initial launch or patches. Initial launch was bogged down with random crashes that would come at totally random times and would never present an error. After that was ""fixed"", their patch wiped out save data. So, now it's a reliability issue on time spent in game. If you feel like pouring time in to a game that looks stunning, is fun as hell when it works but may require you to start the process over at any random amount of hours in game, pick it up. If you dont want to support bad publisher and developer activities, stay clear."

Now I have reached a point in the game where the castle itself is becoming less and less important, the focus is shifting heavily towards tedious fetch- or collect-quests that either make you backtrack to previous areas or have you scurrying around the countryside. Not at all what I imagined before playing this game.The entire school aspect in this game is so underdeveloped, and interaction with npcs is so basic, this game bears little resemblance to Harry Potter literature, which strongly focusses on things like character relationships and bending the rules. There are no rules to bend, everything is just lifeless. It's more like a Hogwarts tech demo with a boring Ubisoft countryside RPG slapped on to it. Everything just feels so unimaginative and the only thing good about the gameplay loop is the combat.I will probably not even finish the main quest, since that story isn't that captivating either."
2645,Foulcher,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012818026/,2,,0,33.3,March,23,"1,121",0,1,"As for many games these days, my actual review is mixed so my choice is guided by the current score (too high for my taste) and by the state of the game. Indeed, the game itself - if you forget the technical part - is mostly fine but not great anywhere aside from the game wolrd which is visually stunning. The story starts well but is rushed at the end and provides no surprise (the situation is known from the start, the bad guys stay the bad guys, etc.).The gameplay is acceptable (a bit more above average on the modern third-person adventure AAA games) but reaches a thresold very fast. The ""difficulty"" then came from HP bags and never really varies. I have played Forspoken before, and even if it had a lot of issues, the gameplay was way funnier and more various.The world is beautiful and huge but the quests are very bland. The environment is not interactive at all and despite having many activities, most of them are superficial.Overall, the adventure is OK but you truly want to finish it to be done with it as there are too many fillers and mostly bland characters.On the technical side, the game is a joke and funningly the game updates make it worse and worse. Considering how much money they made on this game, they could have at least put some effort in it. Indeed, I have tested the game with a RTX 4090 + i9 9900k and then upgraded to a 13900k+DDR5 6200 (not for this game hopefully) and you always have popping textures/shadows, areas with very low framerate (35-40 in Hogsmeade with 9900k, 55-60+ with 13900k) and crashes (since a recent patch). It is not really understadable as the game is not that impressive (sure the RT is great and the map huge, but it is not that impressive and sometimes quite ugly). This last point alone is enough to give a negative review. Sure they did not (hopefully) asked for a ""special"" price like Forspoken but still it is a AAA price and a top seller, so you cannot deliver such a badly optimized copy (which get worse and worse ""patch"" after ""patch"").  A mediocre game."

Of course there's some small performance issues but nothing that can't be fixed with future updates. This game is what every single Harry Potter game released until now should have been. This opens up so many possibilities to expand the world, like making 2 more sequels or remaking the entire Harry Potter series. I mean most of the hard part has been done in this game (creating the world and the castle) so all it's needed are some small changes to the world and new storylines. One thing I hope, is to see more Hogwarts content in the near future!"

The game has been out for about 2 weeks and it's already one of my top favourite games of all time! I 100% everything you can possibly do in the game and i didn't have a single complaint about doing it.- Very enjoyable exploration.- Good inventory space once more inventory is obtained, still very playable without.- It's very enjoyable to grind.- Mobs are killable and aren't annoying whatsoever.- Bosses are very fun and not hard to defeat. They may take a few tries depending on your difficulty but overall extremely fun.- For such a new game, it has quite a lot of content.- Combat is very well done and very smooth.- Puzzles are very well done and fun to complete.- Character creator has a lot of good options.- Travelling is very easy and well done with broomsticks and even fast travel that doesn't make the game feel cheaty by skipping. They worked it into the story well.- Well done side stories (Sebastian was amazing)- Many spells to choose from.- Lots of relatives to future Harry Potter characters to look out for and admire.- Achievements are fun to complete.- Beasts are well done and exciting to hunt especially with their shiny variants.- Finally, it does not get old :)- Some glitches but being worked out constantly (Game is very new still so its understandable)- Voices of your character can sound echoy if changed to a higher or lower pitch than the normal.- Could have been a few more different types of side missions.P.S. it was honestly hard to think of cons for Hogwarts Legacy so that says something for sure!Overall, Hogwarts Legacy was by far one of my favourite games I have ever got the pleasure to play and didn't have a second where I wasn't enjoying myself!"

It's a fun RPG with a huge respect for the original lore and story of the books. The concept art and design of the characters and locations is insanely detailed and even risky in some aspects (taking into account that great part of the castle was never shown in the movies for example). There are some bad aspects I would like to cover, first of all the game is not that well optimized: the shaders have to be installed every time the game is opened, continuous fps drops and some too lengthy loading times specially when changing areas of the castle. Some animations when using the floo flames for example would help to make the game a bit more immersive.All in all, it's a very enjoyable game for almost any consumer, from potterheads to those who have barely touched any game through all the rpg lovers."

How does this game hold up? It's ok - best to wait for a significant sale or a significant price drop. If you're a fan of HP you would probably like this game quite a lot, but if not then you're not missing much if you pass on this game. Some semi-coherent thoughts:Main story: not particularly interesting. Characters: annoying or not interesting.- a large part of the game is helping other students who, much like children in real life, are not fun to talk toCombat: pretty good- parry or dodge attacks in time and weave in attacks when you can. It's a fun formula and even though there are only a small variety of spells I didn't have any issues with that. Combat on hard difficulty was still a lot of fun- you're encouraged to use certain spells and combos to accomplish ""dueling feats"", but you don't have many spell slots at a single time often leading to having to open up the list of all your spells and swap them in. Exploration: good- the castle looks great and there's tons of tiny stories and notes everywhere. They're not tediously long either - just little bits that make the world more interesting eg. half-transformed teacup, the letter from the headmaster telling teachers they can only hang out in groups of up to 4, a cave full of frogs, a bathroom stall used for raising plants. Puzzles: repetitive- I think in the process of trying to make sure that no matter where you go you can find something to do they ended up just copy-pasting the same puzzles all over the place ala Breath of the Wild's korok seeds.w"

You eventually can spend Talent points to unlock 3 additional pages/loadouts which solves that mostly.All of the side quests are interesting by themselves with no basic ""go fetch"" side quests. Most of them are either introducing you to the various collectible/puzzles in the world or require a little exploration and thought.Gear is fairly plentiful and you have access to a transmog system from the start which automatically remembers the style of every item you have picked up. So, you can sell stuff freely and always look however you want. Would've been nice if you could set a few ""outfits"" rather than having to manually go through each gear piece but that's a pretty minor complaint.You eventually unlock a room that you can decorate freely with items you unlock as you explore the world, and then eventually you can raise and look after various beasts here too. The main purpose of this is to supply materials to upgrade your gear, however, caring for the animals, customising their habitats and just watching them interact with each other is very relaxing.Overall, the game is very enjoyable and at around 35-40 hours to hit 100% completion the length feels just right."

2707,BrianH1988,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BrianH1988/,1,,1,57.3,February,22,"3,879",0,1,"Overall pretty good at times, incredible at others. This game has little bearing or care of the movies. It's very interested in the lore of the Wizarding World as a whole, and it never feels like it's trying to do anything more or less than be a vertical slice of the Wizarding World set to the backdrop of a fifth year attending Hogwarts. In a day and age where games try to do everything and be everything so often with the open world formula, it's entirely refreshing that nothing you do when you go out into the open world outside of the main questline will be copy and paste, though a lot of things will feel like familiar iteration quite often. Hogwarts itself is a treat, Hogsmeade is a joy. The open world between and around them is teeming with things to do ranging from 'I solved a complex puzzle for one chest' to 'I found a labyrinthine maze almost at random full of stuff'.The main story is, with a few notable exceptions, almost entirely forgettable, and the final stretch feels like it was flat out unfinished in parts compared to the rest. Where this game truly shines, and shines hard, is the excellent overall VA, writing, and setup and reward for the side quests, some of which net you cosmetics, others are downright mandatory due to giving you spells, and still others are just a joy to complete. Even the average fetch quest in this game usually has some pretty compelling reasons to see it through. What I'm saying is, you don't play this game for the main story to begin with. You play this because all the rest of the content is gonna scratch that wizarding itch games like Elden Ring just couldn't quite provide, in a world where there is no melee combat and everyone flings spells at each other.Those spells, by the way, have very varying effects. Early on you'll feel like they become a bit redundant- and then you get your talents and realize that by the time you fill out your trees all of these will function radically different than they did at the start. Considerably negative marks go to the fact that there are relatively few crowd control spells that give reasonable effects given how the AI reacts, and this means that once the game starts throwing 10-20 enemies in multiple waves at you, which it will, combat overall becomes a tad cumbersome. The decoupled dodging mechanic and enemies that guaranteedly home in on whenever you see the circle indicating to press the dodge button means the whole flow of combat is quite stunted later. The fact that enemies level with you means you will never truly be allowed a power trip. Sadly this is not just a few enemies, but almost the exclusivity of them. No Oblivion dichotomy here where some enemies level with you, they're almost always exactly at your level. I know more than a few people for which this would make any game a deal-breaker so it's certainly worth mentioning here. There are also myriad difficulty spikes in even the main story, much less in the content and sidequests. Gear will not make you into a walking tank by the end given what the game throws at you, take that as you will. More often you're going to feel like things ended very quickly or took far too long.All things said and done though, with the level of quality so much of the game has, I would consider it heinous for me not to give a game developed with such a clear love for the source high marks, when it generally coheres so well."

However I feel that a lot of content in this game was either half removed/made and or not optimised.- Good amount of quests that also played on your morality.- Fight scenes were fun, Remove the lock target and you'll improve the fight scenes greatly (I used controller). - The puzzles and side quests were engaging and fun.- I played my only play through on the hardest difficulty, I have not 100% the game but its already taken about 69 hours.The things I feel they need to add into the game or fix:- Fully bring in the curfew system.... Literally only two missions forced me to sneak around. Using invisibility was almost unused for at least 98.5% of my game play. With this I also feel your house/dorm room really isn't utilised at all. I think i spent less than 30 minutes there the whole game and that was mainly at the beginning. - Why is my character the only one wearing a different style of house robe? It would be nice to see other students wear a variety... I did see a single student wear a quidditch outfit, which was very out of place (because its its banned at hogwarts this year).- I won't get into a quidditch rant, obviously thats been touched on many times over.- Some voice lines get very over used, mainly the Hogsmeed one (we all know what this is). - I would also love to see more races/time trial's for the brooms.- More duel's would also be awesome!- The evil ending didn't seem as flushed out as the good ending, it was very glazed over it seemed (I did both endings).- Maybe a year 6 DLC?Over all, I would be happy to come back to this and see if their has been more updates to the game play, maybe some optimisation. I don't feel like its game of the year but I had a very fun time playing it! I'm Excited to see what the future holds for this game!"

Highly recommended if you can play on PS5/Xbox or at a future time when the performance issues are (hopefully) fixed.That said, if you're already a Potter fan you'll probably enjoy this on PC even with the performance issues, it really is a love letter to the fans filled to the brim with nods to the books and movies.

I can't even imagine what they can do with this title in the future, the potential is endless.: It seems many people are experiencing issues most notably constant stuttering and huge frame drops likely caused by Shaders loading in which we PC gamers came fond of.

Some technical issues here n there, but nothing hectic for me. Sound design is awesome. Can see people complaining about repetitive fetch/seek quests, but that's alright. Doesn't feel too forced.

Can't wait to explore the Forbidden Forest next stream finally 😆If you want to see my reactions to everything before you buy feel free to check out    but if you like the franchise, puzzles, taking your time to really immerse yourself and absorb it all....I really do think there is a LOT here to love. You can feel the passion from the creators emanating from every inch of the world. People have even started making mods for it already! I wouldn't be surprised if this was the next Skyrim if they release a dev kit!Graphics : 10/10  Especially on reflections* 🤤Audio : 10/10 I wouldn't accept anything less from a game of THIS franchise, even the unnamed npcs have lots of interesting chatterCombat : 10/10  The most fun I've had with combat in a LONG time, I live for that hack & slash fast pace. Choose normal or hard only, thank me later. Difficulty DOES spike after a certain early point in the main quest though.------GUI : 9/10   I have to take off a point for not being able to preview owned gear at the shop and the counter blocking my view, but I see mods fixing that soon-----  EDIT: GUI : 10/10    I've been made aware that once you unlock gear you can change to it's appearance at any time so you don't actually have to worry about accidentally selling anything that looks cool, the counter in the way is still a little lame though, use arrow keys to turn the camera.Character creation : 8/10 Without mods the lightest skin is still mid tone and the darker skins are a little greyish/reddish but mods fix it. Doesn't have enough eye colors imo, I wanted red lol. Have to choose a premade face shape. Also the hairs aren't my favorite and the lighting in creation is misleading to what it looks like in game. Once again...mods..Puzzles : 8/10 Some are a bit simple once you learn the way they work (arithmancy and moths) but they still feel magical. Mods could make them crazy 😁 I understand they didn't want to make them too hard for people lolLore  : 10/10 There is SO much that isn't in the movies, and I imagine not in the books even sometimes. The whole world just feels so fleshed out. I actually want to go to Universal now XD* Appears to actually run better on older gpus at least at this timeTLDR; Play normal or hard. Immersion. Future GOTY if they make it more stable for 2k-4k gpus. Geeky VTuber heart go brrrr💜Also, the Slytherins aren't evil, you can totally play as a good Slytherin. 🐍P.S. Real life politics have no place in game reviews, playing a game isn't going to kill anyone, you don't get to control/bully others.

2738,gh0stly,https://steamcommunity.com/id/_gh0stly/,2,,1,107.1,February,11,190,2,1,"This game is highly addictive and as a Harry Potter fan it definitely checks all of the boxes.First and foremost the level of detail is insane. From the lore, music, cast of characters, magical creatures, and the castle you will not be disappointed. Speaking of Hogwarts Castle, you can and will most definitely get lost inside of its walls 10x over and never get bored of the sheer amount of content and secrets hidden for you to find. At first glance you almost couldn't believe they really went the extra mile and made it as fleshed out and lore accurate as they did but boy, you'd be wrong. There was definitely a labor of love put into this project and it certainly shows.Now the game does start off fairly slow. But once it opens up the exploration is great. You'll find yourself wanting to scour every inch of the map because there's always something to do and people to see. Loot however does leave a little to be desired. With most of what you unlock being purely cosmetic you would think there isn't much incentive to grind out gear but I still found myself being compelled to. However, once you unlock the Room of Requirement that's where things start to get very interesting. You'll be able to fine tune your gear to your exact play style so long as you have the required items to do so. Plus let's not forget potion brewing, caring for magical beasts, and so much more.Combat in this game is fun as hell. I can't see myself getting bored when it comes to mixing and matching different spells to pull off some flashy combos. Also utilizing the many different spells at your disposal to solve puzzles both inside of Hogwarts Castle and out in the open world is such a great touch.I did get the 72 hour access so what I will say is this. The game is surely not without its flaws. I'm by no means running this game on a potato PC yet some pretty poor optimization has forced me to have to finagle with my settings to find the right combination just so I can maximize my frames without them consistently tanking. I do experience some frame drops running around Hogwarts Castle and some towns occasionally so that's mildly annoying. But again, pre day 1 patch so this is pretty much to be expected. I have no doubt in my mind that as time progresses these minor issues will be addressed and this will be a thing of the past.One thing I will say though is this game VERY loosely reminds me of a Fallout 4 morality system. What I mean by that is, if you so choose to go the evil route you never quite feel fully evil. More or less you start to feel somewhat like a pretentious smug ♥♥♥♥. By all means I was not expecting a fully fleshed out morality system to begin with and I knew going into this game there wasn't going to be one included anyway. However, I just personally felt that regardless of my actions and decisions in the game I still ultimately feel like the good guy.In truth I absolutely love Hogwarts Legacy and I'm for sure having a blast. I've done so much at the time of writing this review and yet I haven't even scratched the surface of what's to come. I can't seem to put the game down and whenever I press play for that first session of the day I lose countless hours immersed in this world that was built. I guess you could say that's always a good sign. I can easily see this game taking close to if not well over a hundred hours to uncover all of it's secrets. I'm certainly here for all of it!So do I recommend it? Without a doubt. Whether you're a fan of the franchise or a newcomer this game is a must buy. If you're on the fence maybe wait for a sale but even at full price with the amount of love that the developers added to this game I can safely say it's justified. After all, there's certainly been worse that's come out within the past few months at a much steeper price."

I'm so happy this game did so well on launch day and I'm gonna sink more hours into this masterpiece. I'm a huge harry potter fan and just walking through the castle of hogwarts and the outside just kept making me smile, but for those who don't like harry potter but interested about picking this game up, then don't worry this game is beginner friendly and is not gonna throw things at you that you're supposed to know if you ever read the books or seen the movies and I like how they did that.

I do wish Quidditch was in the game but that can always be added at a later date and time.Pros:- Fantastic open world- Very fun to explore- Combat feels super fluid- The spells are really fun to use- Customization is great- Clothing looks incredible- HOGWARTS (it feels so amazing to be able to walk around in the place we all wanted to go to school)- Secrets (so many secrets)- Broom travel is what I've always wanted from a Wizarding World game Cons:- Optimization at launch is really bad, hoping for it to be fixed in upcoming patches- Some Quests feel lackluster- Your choices don't matter as much as I hoped they would- Gives Rowling more unneeded publicityAll in all this is the game I've been wanting since I was a kid and the devs delivered more than I could have imagined.I'm looking forward to any DLC these devs throw our way."

Graphic are good but the ray tracing seems to cause some frame skipping even after the Nvidia updated driver. The story starts off really strong and gets you hooked, which is why I assume it started off with really good reviews, but looses its steam fast and tends to meander through plot holes and plot twists you see coming a mile away. The voice acting is off on some of the quest giving NPC's, the mouth is not sync'ed with the voice. And some NPC's the actors voice does match the character model at all, like it was rushed in to finish the game.

2749,Supgad,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198256402665/,1,,1,207.9,February,11,17,0,1,"I must start this by saying, I adore the game. The world the developers created is ripe with nuance and detail that any fan of the franchise will appreciate, and this world is an easy one in which to feel ‘at home.’ I played for nearly 12 hours on my first day with the game, and I only skipped off for sleep at the insistence of my husband, who was incredulous I was still up at 07:00. I was transfixed, transported, delighted. It’s the Harry Potter game some of us older folk have been wanting for actual decades.It’s easy to get lost at Hogwarts, both because the castle and its grounds are positively enormous and because the small touches make the place sing. It’s a joy to stare at every painting, statue; it’s fun to even traipse through the various lavatories, to find bubbling cauldrons and other gadgets in some of the stalls. It’s the Hogwarts we came to know and love from the books and the movies, but it’s one built for us, and it’s one that we can and are, in fact, encouraged to explore. The Field Guide, while a gimmicky crux of the core story, is great fun to fill out with Pages, though I suspect once you know where and how to collect them all, the lustre on subsequent playthroughs will be thoroughly diminished. I also must laud the developers for the combat system. It’s surprisingly challenging, even on Normal difficulty, and there is a frenetic pace to larger encounters that genuinely keeps me on my toes and ever-so-slightly stressed. While I do believe one could just as easily get by with simply Basic Casting between shielding with Protego, the ability to weave, synergistically, various spells in our arsenal into a visually arresting, almost gymnastically choreographed sequence creates for great, nearly endless fun. (An aside: I recommend erring on the side of simplicity when it comes to selecting your wand ‘style’ at Ollivander’s. There is a deeper wand customisation feature in the game in the form of wand ‘handles.’ Unless I’m a proper git, I wasn’t able to change the ‘style’ after I purchased my wand, and so many of the wand ‘handles’ I collected during my travels looked terrible with the ‘style’ I initially chose. I ultimately created a second character and opted for the Classic ‘style,’ simply so my wand could carry many more ‘handle’ options without looking utterly horrific. You might prefer a hideous wand, though, so… to each their own.)That said, this game is, by no means, perfect, though the bulk of my complaints is nitpicking.For starters, it must be mentioned that there are numerous performance and graphical issues on PC that I encountered, at least at the time of writing: trees or NPCs would vanish and then snap back into place and violently shake about as if throwing some epileptic tantrum, causing my frames to drop into the single digits; the game would crash reliably at certain cutscenes, or randomly and abruptly for no reason; Professor Weasley during my first day at Hogwarts got stuck on a door frame, thrice, and I needed to reload a previous save and pray just to leave Ravenclaw Tower. Turning raytracing off ameliorated many of my issues, though the fidelity degradation from doing so was noticeable. That said, the majority of my time in the game has been smooth and seamless, but when the game suffers an issue, it’s positively unenjoyable. From my very first moments in the game, I came to believe that the character creator is a bit underwhelming. It seemed at first blush to have countless permutations that would allow each of us to create a player character that as closely resembled ourselves as possible, but my characters almost always end up looking the same, regardless which starting model I choose. We aren’t even permitted to tweak or change our body type, always playing someone with a slender build. For a game that touted itself as one that sought to deliver a Hogwarts experience unique to us all, I’d have preferred the chance to really mould my player character myself, with a creator similar to… I don’t know, Dragon Age Inquisition, for example? And while I can understand the logic of not allowing Dumbledore-length beards on fifth-year Hogwarts students, short beard or stubble options would not have been out of the question for teenagers, I don’t think, and would have been a very welcome addition, indeed. My next gripe is with how lifeless so much of the castle feels as it relates to NPCs. So many NPCs are installed simply as window dressing, having neither names nor any meaningful dialogue on tap. They simply stand about and ignore me, even as I barge or bumble through them or their group of peers. I’d have liked if they at least had unique names, similar to other large-world games that name literally every NPC, no matter how irrelevant; or I wish they were actively playing Gobstones, or wizard’s chess, or were dueling—something!  As it stands, many NPCs are missing something that would make them feel livelier and as if they were an actual part of the environment. Next to that, I think so many of the typical RPG elements are a bit light. The vast majority of quests are of the ‘go here and cast this one spell’ variety, which feels both overly pedestrian and woefully underwhelming, and the classes we attend are glorified cutscenes wherein we do one quick tutorialised cast sequence for our spells, and that’s it. Further, it’s abjectly aggravating, indeed, that, during a quest, we aren’t able to venture too far from the discrete quest area, or from whichever NPC we’re supposed to follow—if we do, we get a horrid red splash screen telling us to wander back, and we are confronted with a ‘game over’ if we choose instead to ignore it. Often, during a quest, I would see something off in the distance I wanted to explore or collect, but I was barred from doing so, making the need to traffic back at a later time just for some lacewing flies rather tedious. Even the moth puzzles around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade alike, while mesmerising and charming at first, were a bit thin when you realise you don’t need to pay much mind to what’s in the frame, so long as you’re willing to run around the immediate vicinity with your Lumos-activated wand aloft. Hell, the dialogue options we are asked to choose from during conversations with students or faculty amount to little else than the impression of choice—they offer very little by way of asserting a particular personality for our character, and no one seems to have any pronounced or discernible reaction to the various options we can select. It’s all a bit illusory, and shallow—a missed opportunity, if you ask me. All of this is to say that the calibre of the quests and the NPCs stands in stark contrast to the game world in which those quests and NPCs are set: the quests and NPCs are largely dull and lifeless, while the world is rich, varied, gorgeous, and teeming with seemingly endless possibilities. It’s my earnest belief that the open world, and our ability to traverse virtually unimpeded through all of it (i.e. if you see a door, it’s practically doubtless you can pass through it) is really the selling feature of the game. For some, this might be precisely what they’re after; but for others who might have anticipated a richer, choice-driven, story-focused game, it may land with a thud of disappointment. Oh! And the camera in this game is a shambles. It feels claustrophobic at times with how narrow the field of vision is, even if you opt to max it out. I find myself, even after this many hours, desperately scrolling backwards on my mouse wheel to zoom out, only to be stuck in semi-third, semi-first person perspective.Put simply, the game is fun. It’s gorgeous. It’s staggering how much detail and how much life the developers breathed into this open world. It’s still, in many ways, a dream come true. It just isn’t perfect, though expecting perfection is folly. I highly recommend!"

2757,Peacekitty,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022261876/,7,2,0,77.3,February,14,146,0,1,"Starting off on the first point, I have say visually Hogwarts Castle was very fun to explore, finding its secrets and getting lost while searching for various collectibles. However once the magic was gone, I could not help but watch my disappointment grow ever more as the game did not pursue a normal school year as I was hoping for. Most of our activities take us outside of Hogwarts and little is spent inside the castle itself except for hunting down its secrets and collectibles, while our house is virtually non-existent. Only 1 student plays a bigger role in your house of choice, while others barely show up at all. We do nothing to help in earning house points, participate in house activities or even see our fellow fifth years in the dormitory room at all. The game has a shallow point in building friendship, but we barely ever do that except for only 3 students of which only consist of Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, and Slytherin. Ravenclaw is sidelined to side quests and a major story quest but does not even have an achievement at all like the 3 students which is poor planning.Hardly do we ever engage with our house or have any gameplay or story points that ties us to our house curriculum and we barely get to know any of our house students from 1st to 7th year. I wish this game had a companion system, which allowed us to build friends and be able to explore the world with said friends, from inside our chosen houses or making friends outside of houses, using their knowledge to gain access to more secrets or learning new spells but none of this ever happens at all.All of the time I am spent alone travelling around the world that feels empty because the magic is mostly visual, not gameplay aspects nor storytelling aspects. The only times that students do play a part, is only in a handful of major story quests and it feels more tacked in than genuinely feeling like I am exploring and tackling on the current threat to the world with friends I have discovered within the school.On that note, the magical experience of being a student in Hogwarts is sorely lacking. It feels too much of an generic open world RPG than an open world Wizarding World RPG because Hogwarts just does not play a bigger role than I expected. Choosing your house, doesn't matter because you don't do anything with your house. This game just steers the wheel conveniently pushing you from one plot point to the next without ever making sure that the whole school year is the focal point of your adventure. I wish there was more in this game that had to actually do with you being in Hogwarts, going through the school year and slowly uncovering the current threat, the fated adventure you have to take without being rushed into a generic Route A then to B style open world RPG that simply has the Wizarding World tacked into it.A final note, would be the Curfew in Hogwarts. There is none. Only 2 quests touch upon Curfew and it is promptly forgotten. There is stealth in the game, but it barely does anything except making it easier to clear an area. The game would have been more exciting if exploration during the night in Hogwarts you had to navigate around prefects, teachers and Peeves to collect the collectibles because night time in Hogwarts frankly was dull and boring with the occasional peeves just doing random things. Tied to the 1st point, this is another big disappointment. The classes are simply there visually but we barely take any classes at all except for the times when we need to learn a new spell. Even then, the classes do nothing but push us to completing a quest where a teacher just teaches us a spell then disappears until they are relevant again, if ever.It is perhaps the biggest flaw of this game, as much of the collectible system, combat mechanics and the exploration aspects should have been tied to the classes you take and sidequests could have been tailored to the Extra-curricular classes you can take. Even major story plot points should have been handled through classes, instead of you running off to the wild blasting things left and right without a care just to push Plot A to Plot B.An example would be the Astronomy class, which only plays a small role in you running around the wild finding Astronomy tables to collect Astronomy signs that don't even have a collection tab for them and only exist for the sake of padding the game. The only other thing it does is to introduce a character that plays a role in a story quest and nothing more. Astronomy and Divination could have been tied to talents, allowing us to unlock talents based on the celestial signs we uncovered, learning more about them through classes and forging our own talents as we travel through the story. Defense against the Dark Arts should have played a MAJOR ROLE as we spend most of our time blasting things left and right. Magical History also should have played a MAJOR ROLE in the main story, helping us discover the past more, learning hidden story points that could have helped us take an alternate route through the story.Even then, I wish Magical History was able to do more, as the Cairn Dungeons we find for gear are just randomly found walking around or zooming around. Instead of this, Magical History should have been tied to this system, in that advancing this class would have allowed us to learn more about the random caves and Catacombs we end up stumbling into as well as research and uncover new hidden areas that were lost in the past. Charms and Transfiguration could have been useful to expand the volume of spells we have to use in solving puzzles in the game as most of the puzzles only revolve around Accio and Flippendo with the occasional good-old blasting objects out of the way.Charms and Transfiguration could have also played a major role in expanding the inventory, instead of us having to complete useless Merlin Trials.Potions play a woeful role, as the teacher should have been more ingrained in the story itself.  We don't even have to study the ingredients for it, we don't even have to study the damn potion itself because we can magically make it instantly without having any nuances to it. Hell they make you go through the steps with Wiggenweld but they don't make you work for the other potions which doesn't have a gratifying feel to it, when you are just looking at a timer ticking down on when it will be finished. With only 4 potions in the game, it feels as though the potion mechanics were an afterthought and not properly implemented to the game. Herbology is the same as Potions, with only 3 plants being combat items. Again, same point with Potions.Flying Class is pretty much a dead class, with the class only useful in being a tutorial on how to use a broom ingame. The rest of the broom mechanics is done through a student in time trials and an quest from a shop to upgrade the speed of your broom. You don't ever get to learn any advanced mechanics or be able to do cool stunts on a broom and instead just acts an alternate method of transportation. Again, like the rest of the classes, there should have been more effort to fine tune this area.Care of Magical Creatures is tied to Room of Requirements, which honestly was handled wrong. We should have progressed through the classes, learning new magical creatures and discovering their habitats through the classes instead of being able to just randomly go out find the beasts to ""Save"" instead of a house-elf hand holding us."

It was fun in the first few hours.The good:The game is immersive and has great graphics.The bad:- There is barely any challenging combat.- The choices do not matter.- There is way too much busy work.- The game holds your hands too much.- The game is trying to push a particular ideology.Unless you are a Potterhead, there is little reason to play this game."

It's even in the name ffs, but you can only play your wizard/witch like the developers intended.You can't be a dark wizard/witch (no ""good/evil""-morality system)Choices (if there even are any, I don't think so), don't matter at all...Standard lifeless open-world (like the Ubisoft-""formula""), filled with worthless copy-paste crap collectibles. The people in the world won't react to anything you do, not even when you break into their houses.I was really into it at first, and I thought after the slow start, there might be some more to it and I was waiting for my first ""evil"" choice I could make, to form my own ""young Voldemort"", but it never came.In the end after nearly 30hrs, I'm really disappointed and I'm sure if they would have focused on traditional RPG elements like ""choices"", ""morality-system"", ""interesting side-quests and dungeons"" etc. etc. and would have scrapped all that modern open-world bullsheet, then it could have been really amazing...I'm curious if Hogwarts Legacy 2 will be better, but I doubt it because the reviews are so positive and they made a sheet-load of money.

2760,apollo.media,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198305262106/,3,,0,65.2,March,26,25,0,0,"I would summarise my opinion of Legacy with a fairly simple anecdote:There was this cool looking area that I investigated out in the open world. There was a puzzle to get in, which was interesting and made me think. After getting inside and exploring, I found that the prize for my exploration was a chest...Pretty cool, so I figured something rewarding must be inside.Spectacles. Ugly as sin spectacles that were significantly lower than my current ugly as sin spectacles.This is the common theme of Hogwarts Legacy: Lots of places to explore, and virtually nothing of value or interest will come from doing it.Your clothes all look the same, with varying levels of nerd. You're constantly running to a shop to sell off all the crap you have, because none of it holds any originality or value.At some point i missed some chests in an area that would not allow me to return and at first I was frustrated, because I'd lost an opportunity for loot. Eventually I realised that there is absolutely no value in chests. Occasionally you find an item of a higher level than the one you currently have and switch it out. Since most items are quite ugly, you then have to go into the menu and change the appearance of said item to something less painful to look at.The game just feels so... Pointless.Quests are unfulfilling, because there is nothing to look forward to.Take a game like KOTOR: By trying different quests and working for good outcomes, you have the chance to get interesting new companions, cool sets of gear and better weapons. There is a purpose and reward for your effort and hard work.There is absolutely no reward for your time in this game.Granted, not everyone cares about loot, gear and items.The quests I found to be fairly good overall, but... Again, I don't find myself immersed, or impressed.A great example would be a quest to infiltrate a castle, which sounds pretty neat. I chose to go stealth, as that is my preferred playstyle for which the game offers.While undetected and moving through the castle, I was set upon by a group of goblins that just appeared. They somehow knew exactly where I was, but made no attempt to alert the others.This process repeated for the rest of the quest, making the entire experience very dull.You are given the element of choice, but it is completely superficial, which really just wears on you after a while. If I am given choices, I want them to matter. Otherwise, just make the quests linear and hire better writers.Basically, this game has no direction. It is filled with incredible views and areas to explore, but true world building isnt about pretty landscapes and castles - its about character development.Hogwarts Legacy, to its detriment, focuses on the former, not the latter.I'm not a big fan of a black or white recommend system, so I would say that this: Hogwarts Legacy is a game that has its moments, but is poorly executed and severely lacks imagination.It's too bad. I was very much looking forward to this game and have sunk a decent amount of time into it.But, it'll be a one and done for me, as I'm quite sure there isn't anything worth coming back for a second playthrough.If this game fit the bill for you, all the power to ya. But I expected significantly more."

I don't think I ever stopped smiling - stumbling upon enchanting little detail over enchanting little detail, from honking flowers to beautiful unicorns and SO MUCH GOOD FOOD! The sheer amount of detail in this game is incredible! It adds so much! It's literally a magical experience! A lot of work and love went into this!Great combat, tons of exploring, fantastic beasts, interesting characters, humor, intrigue, suspense, mini-games, this game has it all and more! The graphics look fantastic (I tried ray tracing, but in all fairness, except for a big drop in FPS I saw no great improvement looks-wise, in fact, the surface reflections were rather buggy with its overly-glittery.sparkling effect - it looks plenty wonderful without any of this) the controls were easy to get used to, albeit a bit clunky at times. It had a few glitches but nothing game-breaking. The occasional bad guy and/or loot bag being stuck in a rock and/or underground, immaterial voices (but it IS Hogwarts! Could have been anything ;)) the biggest annoyance was the Polyjuice quest - without any spoilers, it just took me several re-loads to get out of the castle to the objective. Other than that - smooth sailing. I can shamelessly, wholeheartedly give this game a solid 10/10! I enjoyed it from the first second I started, to the very last collectible and quest. I'll most certainly be doing many more playthroughs as for the different houses alone it has, to me, immense replay value!"

I was so damn excited for a new Harry Potter game, I could barely contain my excitement! When I got home and downloaded it, I will say the first few hours got me hooked! I was fully immersed as a student at Hogwarts. However I would soon come to realize that this game was missing something crucial to the wizard world... They had no QUIDDITCH! LIKE WHAT?! QUIDDITCH is an INCREDIBLY INTEGRAL PART OF THE WIZARDING WORLD. The fact that they only had a line or two about ""cancelling Quidditch because someone got injured"" is INSULTING to any Harry Potter fan. Just imagine your character being on the broom just chasing that golden snitch! Like how exciting wouldn't that be! Dodge-rolling in the air, tackling other students, it would just be so AMAZING.Not only did they not have Quidditch in this game, they also only had 28 spells out of the hundreds that exists in Harry Potter which is a quite disappointing amount.

2777,Zydrate,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zydrateacademy/,2,1,1,105.5,February,11,657,3,1,"I’ve never played a Harry Potter game before this, because they  all seemed to just play through the book and movie plot lines over and  over again. Sometimes as Lego people. I read the books, watched the  movies, and therefore held no interest in the franchises foray into my  favored hobby. Legacy has quite literally the game I’ve been waiting for and that’s a shared sentiment I’ve seen.Story wise, we play a newcomer to Hogwarts but we’re inducted as a fifth year. Extremely rare but not unheard of. Your custom character’s backstory is completely obscured and the story nor dialog reveals a single iota of information about who they are and where they come from. It’s up to us to fill in those blanks.Immediately in the tutorial/prologue (the tutorials continue well into the game itself) it’s revealed that our MC (main character) possesses the rare ability to witness and utilize a form of “ancient magic”. We then discover a strange, previously unknown symbol to the wizarding community and alongside your mentor Professor Fig, that kicks off the main plot. In my first impressions I considered this a bit derivative, as if it’s banking off the movie’s success. The game doesn’t waste a single chance to reference something from the books or movies, like the mooncalves first seen in Strange Beasts or the mandrake replanting class from Chamber of Secrets. Some moments are cute, but during the mandrake replanting I found myself thinking we’d explore literally anything else because per my previous point; I’ve seen that already. Other times are more subtle, like how you can literally stand at the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets with a little lore page detailing a little snake etching but no other in-game indication of what it could mean. I prefer the subtle approach to fanservice like that. As stated, some moments are better than others but this game takes the shotgun approach.One of the things that awed me about the game is how absolutely gorgeous it is, down to the atmosphere. Despite what other reviews state, I find the facial animations to be some of the best I’ve seen. There is the occasional oddity where after every spoken line, an NPC will briefly revert back to their neutral expression which can be jarring depending on how stable your game is. It’s often seamless, but sometimes my computer lags a bit (I’m a bit under the minimum requirements) and I just see their faces cancel itself out.As I always say to anyone who will listen, the first once or twice I did the flying class I could not stop smiling. The teacher spoke to me as if I was on an amusement park ride but I didn’t care, as I got a fairly scenic route through the Hogwarts grounds that we didn’t really get in the movies. Tutorial mission thought it might have been, the music cues were perfect for the mood it was going for.Fans of Harry Potter may very well be in two camps. One wants to capture their childhood nostalgia, the idea that they could be whisked away to a whimsical school to be taught reality breaking spells. The other camp perhaps just want a nice action RPG that just happens to be set in the universe and lore that they love. The first camp will absolutely adore the first 10-15 hours, after which the classes will very much dry up. They’re cute, giving the usual “move the mouse in a certain way” minigames. I do wish they were more complex, or there was more to do but I also completely understand that this game is very much marketed towards teens so they need to keep the pace going and the objectives accessible. Meanwhile, the second camp of fans will very much enjoy themselves. The whole prologue of the game can take a few to several hours before the final mechanic of beast-rearing is introduced, so after that the combat takes center stage....And the combat is actually quite great. There can be a good flow between using the right category of spell to cancel out color coded enemy shields, while making sure to counter or dodge as the right prompt presents itself. Players of Arkham, Mad Max, or Middle-Earth will be familiar with the flow. After a while however, the region level locking became a problem as the late game became far too easy. At one point I was a level 35 (cap is 40) but I kept facing level locked enemies like 20 or 30, almost all of which only took four basic attacks to kill. I had to resort to mods to remedy this issue and increase the difficulty. Hard mode in-game does well in raising the reaction times needed, and it also makes enemy shields come up much quicker, often quicker than your cooldowns which forces more spell switching which I enjoy a lot. However for those who catch onto the flow of it, even Hard difficulty can come across as fairly easy. Another thing I went to mods to help with.I feel like this game brings to the table that HP fans have  wanted. If you wanted the school experience, it’s here in in bite sized  chunks, a class or two at a time for you to navigate the wonderfully  designed school with all kinds of bits and bobs to discover. If you’re  one of those HP fans who thought the combative implications of the world  went under explored, then there’s plenty of it to be had here as well  between shooting at wolves, spiders, bandits, rebels, and other  creatures with fake made-up names.    It is perhaps not as much of an open world as players may have wanted.  There’s plenty to explore to find chests and loot, sometimes blocked by  ways you don’t have access to quite yet. The game doesn’t throw every  tool at you immediately to let you loose upon the world and for good  reason; because there’s not a whole hell of a lot to do town by town.  This is not a “pick a direction and go” kind of world, as early on you  get a tutorial notation saying that some activities are straight up  locked until you get certain spells.  The real meat of the game is in its quests. I will say most of the side quests are rather uninspired and after a couple dozen hours I was only really doing them to unlock appearances and crafts for our Room of Requirement, a place you can decorate and utilize as you see fit. But most of the writing in them were fairly basic. You help one goblin get his cart with art supplies, and that’s really the end of that story. Another you help track down a woman’s missing brother, which just introduces the Inferi (undead) of the lore. Game tells you to hit them with fire, and that’s all there is to that story.In fact, a lot of the game is tutorialized in the first half which can be grating for those of us who catch onto how the game works quickly. This was particularly obvious when you are introduced to the Room of Requirement, where a Weasley ancestor spells out every little thing you can do in the room down to making you place five rugs and five wall hangings before the quest continues, as if doing it once isn’t enough to understand the basics. Again I understand that they do this to keep the game accessible for the lower end of age brackets. While we’re talking about that kind of thing, some of  the activities can feel a bit like busywork. I am particularly irritated  at Merlin trials, which are never complex but always tedious. There are times where I couldn’t even find the solution, despite flying around spamming the Revelio (revealing the area, Eagle Vision Style) and then discovering that if you go to far away from the  trial it resets itself.  They’re also the only way to increase your inventory space  (which fills up quickly because loot is absolutely everywhere). I’m okay  with the various bandit camps and animal lairs but it does reek of that  Ubisoft-ness that has tired gaming in the last few years. 100 hours in and I probably have another 20-30 more to go as I continue exploring the nexus mods page. I do not at all regret buying the game and I’m enjoying it greatly. It really was the game I was waiting for, and I really hope the developers take notice and work on expanding the great foundation they laid out for us."

2782,KKB.Not.So.Happy,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026087995/,2,,1,66.7,February,14,36,0,0,"Pros:1. Combat is fun; animations are great. Enemies strengths and weaknesses clearly defined and overall very fast paced. 2. The environment is fantastic. Truly feels like you're living in a magical world. You can spend the first 10 hours just exploring hogwarts. Cons:1. Story felt a shallow, voice acting mediocre and the quests can feel more like chores than fun. A typical good guy vs bad guy storyline. Bit boring imo. Same for relationship quests. Also you don't really feel like you have any sort of connection with anyone; its just a chore you have to do to unlock spells. 2. Your choices don't matter. Whether its your wand selection or dialogue choices. All roads lead to the same place. 3. Gear progression is very plain. The process for farming mats for your gear is forced upon the player and can feel like more of a chore than fun. 4. Very low replayability; game at a certain point becomes extremely easy even on the highest difficulty. Many of the items at your disposal like potions, combat plants, seem more like bloat and completely unnecessary in combat situations. Summary: Great game if you're a completionist/Explorer type. If you play games for a good story with complex dialogue options this probably isnt the one. If you like combat the combat system is good but at a certain point (pretty early in the game) you become so strong that you roll over anything and everything pretty easily even at the highest difficulty."

2789,Kaiser Lucilius,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KaiserLucilius/,2,,1,36.2,February,15,710,0,1,"I might change the review when I have completed the game, but right now I am saying it's a 9/10.The music is great and a good mix of the movies and an original score.Personally judging the game on its own it's what I expect from an AAA-produced game, or at least how it should be. So far it hasn’t pushed a lot beyond graphics but it really nice to look at even on the medium settings. Everything just works as it should and the game is very well optimised. You get to do a lot of customization beyond your character's physical appearance you also get to choose their clothing very in-depth.You can save mostly whenever you want which is something I always appreciate, I feel like few things can ruin the experience of a great like not being able to save when you really need to. You can also link up to Pottermore, to get a few goodies. You can basically pick and choose the house you want to join. Thankfully the houses aren’t as factious as I feel they were in the movies, so you can actually just have a nice start at school and make friends which I really feel hits the mark.The only problem I have encountered is with my controller, but that problem might have to do with steam or the controller itself. And some small lighting issues but I am playing on medium graphics so that might be it.The control scheme is fine it’s what you’ve come to expect, but it works, a very tiny problem I feel is with spells like Accio, the strength of the spell is determined by how hard you press the button but they didn’t address it in the game so I had to look it up.Combat is fun, and there is a fair amount of difficulty settings to choose from.There are also a lot of accessibility settings which is really nice.Story wise I am hooked but unable to say if it gets a satisfying payoff since I am only a few hours in.So overall a 9/10."

2796,Wraith,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wraith1988/,5,1,0,21.7,February,17,358,2,1,"This game would have been exceptionally great except for one fact. You are a student at Hogwarts. The fact that you are a student at Hogwarts makes 0 sense to the game. You spend most of the time not even near the castle and hardly ever interact with your fellow students. Most of the RPG systems don't really make much sense as a student. Why is my character attending class dressed in full plate armour? I thought Hogwarts was known for their nice uniforms? Uniforms in a school don't work with an RPG armour system like every other RPG known to man has. How is your ""armour"" supposed to look progressively cooler when every student is supposed to look the same?Also, why are the teachers encouraging a fifteen year old to explore the country side and burn every poacher, bandit and dark wizard alive? Avada Kedavra, quote from the wiki - ""When cast successfully on a living person or creature, the curse caused instantaneous and PAINLESS death, without causing any injury to the body, and without any trace of violence."" But no, how dare you cast such an evil spell, here, I know, burn the man alive so he can suffer before he dies, if he dies at all, lets hope he lives so he can suffer for the rest of his life!Why am I so lonely in this game all the time!? Where are all my friends and class mates? These characters are ALL boring which is okay because I can't spend any real time with them apart from a quest here and there. There is nothing special about any of them except for Sirona Ryan who's voice sounds like it was recorded from a speak and spell and is so out of place I had to download a mod to hear the ACTUAL TRANSGENDER ACTRESSES VOICE which sounds perfectly normal and lovely btw. But then if they didn't make her voice sound like a robot, nobody would have known she was transgender! Oh no! Thanks for the out of place BS. It truly did not make the game any better for me and really seemed shoehorned in.I'm on PC why am I switching to more action bars. I have at least 30 buttons on my keyboard that aren't bound to anything I could be binding them too. Combat, while still fun yet easy, would have felt a bit less clunky if they included PC only options such as that, which doesn't seem like it would take that long to implement, but what do I know, people only make these sorts of changes in mods all the time...Finally, there is a TON of misinformation about houses out there. Before I played the game I've heard ""‎Gryffindor has the most side quests and Ravenclaw has the least"" and ""Every playthrough is different depending on which house you choose!"" Literally none of that is true. A single quest changes and some of the characters may or may not comment on your house... sometimes... maybe. That's it. 99% of dialogue is the same and besides that one quest, none of the game cares what house you choose. I'm gunna be honest, I didn't really need all that but if every single side quest is just an errend with no real story to it (The other children took my smelly marbles aka gobstones can you go find them for me? Yeah, that's not a story, that's busy work), maybe you could have tried a little harder here. I think I would have been fine if the house really only changed the color of your clothes IF the side quests were really meaty and had actual story repercussions but if all they are is a list of tasks to complete then where the hell is my house content?!?!?They did nail the world though, which for me rings very hallow without all of the stuff that they left luke warm. If you don't care about a games story and if you don't mind that most of the game doesn't make much sense, then this game is for you, but it seems that most people don't mind that stuff. I do.Oh yeah, and my character running around repeating Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio everywhere he went sure was immersive. Can you imagine a scene where Harry Potter is running around repeatedly casting Revelio, messing with all the random crap around Hogwarts? ""Harry, why aren't you in your bloody class?"" ""I need to find all the butterflies around Hogwarts and take them to their mirrors so I can collect their pages.""If this game didn't have Hogwarts in the title, nobody would be playing it."
2797,Samuel.Marshall,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198089863276/,7,1,0,40.1,February,19,13,0,1,"Disappointed. As a fan of original Harry Potter series I was anticipating for this game and hoping that they will not turn it out to a multiplayer, donate-oriented crap. Well, my hoping came true! But not in the way I expected.First of all, the time period is long time before Harry Potter story. So, no beloved and famous characters and nothing from the modern world (except of LOTS of diversity, lgbt and more agenda).I launched the game and the first thing I saw is NO opportunity to launch game in native fullscreen, only borderlss. So you CAN'T choose a resolution. Wow!Then character making, and the second thing I saw is NO opportunity to create a white character. The whitest skin colour available for customization is still not even close to my colour in real life. Fixed it by mods. Wow x2!Then the game started and the third thing I saw is really poor optimization. My PC is pretty modern, but the game was stuttering and lagging a lot. Fixed it by mods again. Wow x3! Shall I continue?Story is undescribably boring and not interesting. I found myself skipping ALL the dialogues after 10 hours of the game (maybe even earlier). The only side quest line I liked is about Sebastian. It has some drama, and interesting story.The activities are just a joke. Map is HUGE and has only 3 types of activities that are repeating, repeating, repeating and repeating...Neverending dunges with hoblins and spiders, and even in main quests and side quests they are sending you to the same caves and dunges to fight spiders, trolls and hoblins. Again and again. The game about Hogwarts has ZERO Hogwarts activities! There is NO competition between faculties (you know, 10 points to Gryphindore! or 5 points to Slytherine!), there's NO quiddich, NO interesting lessons in Hogwarts (except seveal main quests, where you just attend lesson, skip the cut scene and betting back to clearing dunges from spiders). It has NOTHING for the exception of good-looking entourage that you stop enjoying after 3 hours of playing.Just imagine: the protagonist is the choosen one (why and by who - no one cares and eplains normally), you applying for a 5th year of studying knowing only 3 spells, starting attending lessons with the rest studens EQUALLY, and no one is telling you ANYTHING about it. Everyone is equal in this game, guys. No one from opposite faculty is trying to bully you or make some kind of conflict. NOTHING interesting, NOTHING special, NOTHING unique.Even Avada Kedavra is disappointment. it can't kill everyone. Only some types of regular enemies and trolls.Forget about one-shotting bosses. Forget about fun in this game for the exception of first 5-7 hours. Nothing changes in this world, you are not affecting anything by your actions.And you already perfectly know what exactly is expecting you further in this game.This game is a good example of a modern-type of games that keeping releasing year by year.And a good example, that even if you will take a s**t in a plate but put a note ""Harry Potter"" - the people happly will start eating it, saying this is a masterpiece 10/10, while feeling of nostalgia is covering their eyes and ears.If you change the entourage for anything else - you will get a typical grinding, boring, idealess game that we already saw 100 times.5/10 only for familiar places that I was glad to attend. And that's a very pity.The developers had ALL the chances: the most famous franchise, budget, support... but the lack of creativity."

So this isn't exactly gonna be an unbiased review but I absolutely love this game, exploring the world has been a delight and exploring Hogwarts has been something I've wanted to do for so long not to mention finally having a proper RPG in this universe where you create your own character is something I think most of us who grew up with the series always wanted. I find myself getting distracted and just getting lost in the world in all the best of ways, can't say for sure if it'll be the same for someone who isn't as into the series as I was but for anyone with even a passing interest in the game's setting, I'm sure it'll be an enjoyable experience. While I do have a few complaints most of them are nitpicks except for one, the performance is pretty bad with constant dips in performance. Even Cyberpunk wasn't this bad at launch for me in terms of performance but otherwise I fully recommend the game especially when the performance is finally fixed."

There's some cool physics puzzles and the game is charming enough, but I actually think it would have done better as a story game, without the open-world elements; keep Hogwarts, Hogsmeade and the story dungeons, and the game would have been much more impactful"

2827,Alas,https://steamcommunity.com/id/alas1815/,3,,0,54.5,March,30,"2,057",0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy made quite a stir on release. The JK Rowling controversy notwithstanding, it looked great and was praised as the Harry Potter game all long-time fans of the franchise were waiting for. I am not such a fan. My attachment to the franchise is rather looser. Yes, I have watched the movies, even liked some of them. I have also visited the exhibition housing the movie version of Hogwarts. But it's not a big or important part of my childhood, as it is for many. Nevertheless, there is some familiarity and I do like a good open-world game from time to time. As such I was eager to try this game. A rare event. Let's see how that went.Arguably the game's greatest selling point is the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry itself. The Castle is lovingly reconstructed and fully explorable. Well, provided you can be bothered to do the fetch quest necessary for the lockpicking spell at least. It is also iconic enough that even people with my limited familiarity will recognise a great deal of locations, items and activities. The rest of the world is also generally beautiful, with some impressive vistas and interesting art direction choices to be seen. Unfortunately, it is just looks. The game offers but limited opportunities to interact with the world. Outside of preset activities/missions you can't really do much. You can't go to classes, or even prank your fellow students. That was a mild disappointment. But still not enough to sully the accomplishment that is Hogwarts.Unfortunately, this is where the good part ends. The game has little else of value to offer. The plot is a D-movie level schlock, unoriginal and entirely unimpressive. Anyone who doesn't guess the direction it's taking at least halfway in is simply not paying any attention to the game. Not that I could fault them for that. The main character is an underdeveloped and overused archetype, a Mary Sue that can do no wrong, even when playing with the Dark Arts, it's all kosher for Mary. The overwhelming majority of the missions are simple fetch quests. In fact, the game offers a masterclass in how many different ways once can masquerade simple fetch quests. The game tries to make up for its lack of interesting content with padding. There is, naturally, an inventory system and other cookie-cutter RPG-lite elements too. Those also serve little purpose and wouldn't have been missed if they weren't there. The setting in general comes with its own set of issues. For instance, the decision to set the game in the 19th century is completely incomprehensible and detrimental. Adding this distance to the timeline effectively eliminates the chance of encountering the more famous canon characters and their relatives. Or hearing of their tales. Which would have allowed even those with a more peripheral association with the franchise to experience some nostalgia, ie from the movies. It makes even less sense if you consider that the game earns nothing from this timeline change. Hogwarts and the wizarding world is effectively stuck in the 19th century anyway. You could have set the game in the 21st century and almost nothing would need to change to accommodate for it. If anything that way even all the ridiculous forced diversity present would make somewhat more sense. Somewhat.Finally, there is combat. Lots and lots of combat. Seeing the bodycount the protagonist racks up I had to keep reminding myself that this is still based on a book for kids. Be that as it may, there are some interesting elements here. The variety of spells present can offer a number of ways to approach a fight. It all works out ok at first, but as you progress through the game and the battles become longer, it hits you. It is tedious. Spam all your spells, wait for them to recharge while avoiding the enemy, rinse and repeat. That's it. Thankfully, there is one specific build that is utterly broken and can be used to end nearly all fights much faster. It requires the use of the Dark Arts though. So if for RP reasons you opt not to go down that path, well sucks to be you. Personally, I'd rather sacrifice every goat I have at the altar of lord Voldemort, than sit through one of those long-winded fights again.All in all, this was a disappointment. I can't really say I hated the game, despite all its flaws, mostly because I couldn't muster enough of an interest to give a dime. For all the noise that surrounded it, it is just a bland open-world experience. One of those where you have a checklist and you just go from place to place on the map gathering collectibles. Granted, the art directors and artists do deserve an Oscar, but everyone else involved is up for a Razzle. Perhaps megafans of the franchise will appreciate the game for what it has to offer, a glimpse of the wizarding world. Still, as far as I'm concerned, Hogwarts Legacy commits the most cardinal of sins. It is boring. As such, not recommended."

Before I give any criticism, I will give credit to where credit is due. This game is gorgeous, and for the first 20 hours I was mesmerized by the magic and scenery. The gameplay was definitely a learning curve for me, but once I got used to the mechanics on controller, it was very fun and satisfying to duel other students and enemies. I also enjoyed customizing my Room of Requirement to my liking and stumbling across interactions and hidden areas throughout Hogwarts itself. These aspects felt like my personal highlights to the game.SO I'm sure I over-hyped myself for the game before the release and was expecting a sandbox-esque rpg with a lot of lore to discover. Unfortunately, Hogwarts Legacy isn't as much of a rpg as it is more of an action-adventure game. Much of the story I found to be very shallow and a lot of the characters (if not most of the characters) I had a hard time caring about throughout the story. The ending, for me, fell flat and lackluster, feeling very rushed and an afterthought.In conclusion, I don't think this game is bad and there were parts of it I did enjoy. I do think that the devs put focus on graphics and design above the story and lore. With that said, I would give the game a 5.5/10, and I would recommend this game for older kids (14-17) who enjoy the Harry Potter series."

You have to unlock the fun elements of this game, so at the beginning it feels weird... you want to explore but you don't have the proper tools... you can't figure out things on your own.. you actually need to do side missions in order for the solution to unlock, which is a horrible mechanic.The school and the map feel empty, the npc's are very VERY outdated, they don't react to you, they are solid walls you can't even touch them or bump into them, you can shoot any spell at them they won't even react, they will just go on with their animations.

2880,Redkitties,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Redkitties/,3,2,0,77.3,February,13,117,3,1,"REVIEW SCORE: 3/10WHY:Combat:No invincible frames while casting. Want to use the tools/utilities the game encourages you to use? Interupted while using plant bombs, doesn't go off, no invinc frames. Want to use a potion that'll help with the 5+ mobs the game throws at you during main and side quests? You click it, drink it, and get interrupted, doesn't go off, damage taken because no invincible frames. Want to cast a spell to break an enemies shield? If you can SEE it- these things flicker in and out of existence- wondering why it's taking no damage? the INVISIBLE shield it has! guess you'll just have to squint and try the 3 different types of spells you have- but WAIT, as you cast a spell, it gets interrupted because there's NO INVINCIBLE FRAMES. Want to cast your own shield? it lasts half a second! because unlike the enemies, it WORKS DIFFERENT, for some unknown reason, it's more like a parry than a shield! But thank goodness you have a dodge that you can be hit out of rolling/aparating (with the talent upgrade), and even when you complete your dodge roll, the enemy has blinked to where you come out of it and hits you with such a short warning simple- THAT DOESN'T PROC/SHOW MORE THAN HALF THE TIME- that you can't even dodge again, or cast your shield spell. On top of that, the enemies have lazer focus on you, so you get double hit by a spell and the melee enemy! And that's not even mentioning the enemy AoE effects! Like the warning prompts to shield or dodge, these ground AoE effects are so faint! In every situation where you're thrown 5+ enemies in a gauntlet, you can use this AoE lightning potion that is SUPER helpful- it breaks enemy shields and deals damage! But wait! the enemy (ONE enemy, as far as i can tell) has a lighting AoE spell as well! and it DOESN'T show up at all when you're using this potion! So you just get one shot!Oh, and your spell range is very short. so for big enemies, you still feel like you're in their face and you can't effectively kite.EDIT: i forgot to add, when you play on PC/keyboard+mouse, it's frustrating to have like 20 spells, and only be able to cast 4 at a time/have access to 4 spells. You have to swap between 4 different groups of 4 spells. makes it incredibly difficult to have fluid combat. I wish there was an option where i could just have a spell bar, honestly. ( I ended up using a mod from nexus that let me rebind the other keys so that when i hit ""5"" it would swap spell group and cast number 1 of that spell group. It was nice, i just had to commit the spell slots to memory during my 70 hours of playing,MonkaS.)0/10 FRUSTRATING COMBAT.Note: I did play on the Hardest difficulty, and all it did was promote me stacking health potions. Get hit once? health pot because all my health is gone. Even with the best gear upgraded and slotted with this games form of ""gems"".STORY: Honestly, the side quests were WAY more interesting than the main quest. NO, it's not because of hate crime. Although playing through this game, at every turn I did have moments of joking with myself, going ""Wow, Hogwarts promotes teaching children to steal, break into peoples houses, never go to class (as they were always short cinematic that did nothing and didn't add anything to the story) endorses slavery with house elf's still, enforces racial biases are cultural norm with how goblins and centaurs are seen by the character world,"" just all in good humor of pointing out these big no-nos.Talking about the spells, as someone who played all of the harry potter games as they came out, I already knew all of them! including some that weren't even in this game! So as I found myself doing the pre-quests to unlock the spells, i found myself, a seasoned harry potter gamer, frustrated and low on patience, because these pre-requests to unlock the quests were filler- they offered nothing to enrich the experience of playing the game, and barely added any lore to the known universe.The side quests, as I said, were fantastic. I liked the side characters, and I wish that there were more. Some classes let you talk with other characters, and I wish each of them, who had names and I recalled their faces/models, got the same character/friendship quest lines as three of the side characters did. As someone who played Mass Effect and Dragon Age, I am down to do 8 character side quests that adds and expands on not only the main story, but the characters themselves, as well as the universe around me, the player character. The main story was short, disappointing- but only because it was boring. Go here, do this, big battle royal and boss fight, all x 4. Then, another, and then, the last boss fight. Which, had the same combat problems as I listed above that i'll list/summarize here so it's easier to digest: AoE prompts too quick to respond to, no ground AoE warnings, no invincible frames when I cast, No STUN reward on the boss when I complete mechanics that diffidently seem like they should- at least in every other video game I have played.Honestly I have no idea how i would improve on the main quest besides adding real choices that aren't just ""Keep things the way things are"" or ""Do the bad thing that x,y,z, but not really, because I'm still the main protag, so I have to be morally good."" No ambiguous choice, no morally gray, not even a ""RED"" option that would be ""DESTROY"". Something that I was actually really surprised of, because in this case, I DO want to destroy the reapers- and I'm not given the option?! Crazy.Side quests: 5/10, Carried the game hard. Main quest: 1/10 was okay, eh, could have made the game without it and I would not have missed it. Honestly. It's okay to just make friends and stop ""petty"" crime as a 15-year-old, I don't have to save the world every damn time.EXPLORATION: Not as bad as what assassins creed as become. Yes when you complete something there's still that annoying unstoppable cut scene, like every time you would take down stealthily someone in Deus Ex except 5 times longer. Yes, there's flying. Yes, there's collecting. Yes, there's marking things off the map and feeling satisfied. Yes, there's clothing shopping and transmog. Yes, there's even breeding animals in your broom cupboard! But does the things add any lore or imagination or thought to the world? not really, no. So...It's just things to do and things to unlock. Minimal satisfaction, and luckily, there's enough that you can staggar the side quests and main quests with the exploration so you don't feel like you're dead, awake, and just doing chores.Overall? Maybe a 4/10. Water textures kept bugging and threatening to crash my game.I read ahead online and saw there was a checklist to graduate your school year after you complete the main quest- as i'm writing this critique on a break from the last boss. I think from exploring throughout my 51 hours of gameplay, I have that checklist done except for the remaining two(?) post-game quests. So that's nice, I guess.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game, and If I did, I would tell everyone to buy it for around 30% off, and play on the easiest difficulty, because the hardest one is not satisfactory, especially with how the combat is. Still, I did enjoy seeing a new harry potter universe game, and I hope that this low scoring and the problems I have listed do not discourage but instead encourage a better next video game, whatever this company might make. And that we don't always need to be in High School to be a wizard/witch, the world/universe exists outside of Hogwarts/childhood.And if anyone is wondering HOW I COULD BUY this video game because of who receives the money?I'll humbly service my fellow Queer people until the good orgasms out way the whatever 40-some percent goes into the coffers of someone whose far richer than the Late Queen of England."

The intro gives false hopes as the game starts becoming a stutterfest with massive and constant FPS drops when you arrive at Hogwarts. From there the performance has not gotten better. I'm running 1440p High preset, no RT with 60 FPS cap. Did not see any performance difference after changing settings so I left it at the recommended High preset. Hopefully some patches will come through to properly optimize the performance but right now, don't make the purchase. I will say that the temps on my card are superb compared to other intensive AAA titles, though. If the game sees performance patches, I will gladly change my review to recommended.Gameplay = FantasticPerformance = CrapSPECS:RTX 3070 8GBi7-11700f32GB RAM 3200MhzGame is running off a 1TB 980 Pro M.2 SSD.EDIT: The day one patch did fix a slight amount of stuttering, however the majority of the performance issues are still prevalent. Hogsmeade is probably the worst right now, with 33-43 FPS being the average in that area. Traveling inside Hogwarts still gives massive drops. The combat is done extremely poorly here. No way to train or practice and the very little combat you have thrown at you doesn't not give you time to feel out the controls. I'm like 10 hours in and still haven't gotten my own broom, so anyone saying the story mode is only 20 hours is lying. I'll still be waiting on a real patch to fix the serious performance issues most seem to be having.EDIT EDIT: Most of the performance issues have been ironed out. Hogsmeade still has a bad stutter issue but other than that, the game runs incredibly smoother than before. I can now fully recommend purchasing the game in this state. I still think the combat could have been handled better earlier into the game. After the patches, I can now run the game at Ultra (except for effects because High looks wayyyy better than Ultra)"

Spend your time elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you love Harry Potter and would like the chance to explore Hogwarts (Unfortunately everything else isn't really the same and even Hogwarts is somewhat different...) Then this is the game for you!Great game, HUGE open world that I was so excited to explore, great quests, puzzles, and mini games. I'm only 9 hours in and there is still so much I haven't had the chance to do that I'm so excited for. Even after getting through the main story I'm sure I'm going to have a lot to do. They paid extremely close attention to detail including things like little enchanted tools you can interact with or tulips(?) that make a funny noise when you walk by them (definitely the smallest feature I had the most fun with), or the candy store with all sorts of funny effects (unfortunately you can't take them out of the store.). I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the fact that there are ""Guide Pages"" in the game. They are little lore tidbits that you can find here and there while exploring and it not only incentivizes exploration, but makes it feel like you really have a reason to wander around and just look at the huge world that's been laid out before you.Complaint #1 - was that it feels almost like the LGBTQ content was forced down my throat just because it's ""politically correct"" to be put in the game. Personally I feel like it was only included due to the backlash J.K. Rowling received for some of her comments on twitter just to not only defend herself but also expand the audience to those she may have previously offended. I have nothing against the LGBTQ community my complaint is due to the fact that peoples beliefs and way of living become marketing strategies. That's just horrible to me. It doesn't detract from the game in any meaningful way it just kind of urked me a bit.  Correct me if you believe I'm wrong. Complaint #2 - The voices are messed up. Any character (including your own) whose voice has been edited with the pitch slider sounds like a robot and it really breaks immersion.Complaint #3 - Optimization is DOGSH!T. I have to run the game on the lowest settings to play... Not too terrible for myself as I do like to play a few older games such as TESIII:Morrowind and graphics don't bother me as much however, in today's day and age graphics are almost everything. Not to mention the game is nearly unplayable due to the glitches and bugs for most people who aren't as lucky as I am."

Never read the books and only thought the movies were okay.  That being said, the story is off to a good start and I love almost all of the characters.  The graphics are great and the music/sounds exactly how they should be.  The side quests are decent as well.The combat is average.  Yes, it's different and unusual, but it's the same thing after awhile.  Pop something in the air, hit it, bring it close, hit it some more.  It's a rinse and repeat.  Plus, the combat doesn't happen that often, which I guess is fine.  It's a lot of walking around and talking to folks.The collectables are just too plentiful.  I wanted an open world game, not a collect them all.  Yes, I can skip them, but that's what they poured a lot of pointless content into.How spells are learned is sorta dumb.  It's a minor mechanic, but it's still annoying to deal with.Minor pop-in occurs, usually students popping in.  But that's a minor complaint.I'm sick of collecting things.  Don't care that it's optional, it's part of the game and should be criticized.  There is literally a mechanic of collecting things so you can unlock a spell to collect more things.  When does it end?I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!"

I love the side quests with the friends you get to know in the main story, but I think it would be better if you get one friend per school you choose, to make it feel more special. Aside from the aesthetics of your bedchamber and your coat, there's nothing special about the school you choose.Don't get me wrong, the game is awesome, but being part of Hufflepuff or Grifindorf doesn't make any difference in any of the quests, which is a shame."

I really should have learned my lesson about buying new games on release when this happened with 2077, but here I am again dealing with the same buggy mess. When it's working it's good. I'm enjoying walking around Hogwarts and the surrounding area. I wish there was more lore with the field guide pages, like with the old Mass Effect codex, but I love lore, so that's probably just a me thing. I'm not much of a gamer TM anymore, so I don't know really what to say about the combat other than it's there. I suck at it, but I'm sure that has more to do with just me being old and bad at games now, and not the actual combat mechanics. I get the idea that you have to match the color of your attack against the enemies' shield color, but it's difficult for me to do while against multiple opponents at once. I don't know if some AOE spells become available later, but that would make it a lot easier for this old-timer. Combat Update: There are potions and magical plants you can use to help you in combat, and you can power up some of the spells to make them hit more than one target, so it get easier to take on more than one person at a time. It's nice I can customize my outfit, but it would have been a lot better if I could toggle on the option to hide the piece I don't want to be shown, like the gloves or face mask, instead of having to choose the option every time I change that item of clothing. Especially because the game is prone to crash on me in that menu over all others for some reason. Without going into any spoilers, I'll say the story is alright so far. It's nothing groundbreaking, but I'm interested to see what comes next most of the time. They've opted to make the MC kind of bland to make it easier for the player to insert their own personality in there. And some dialog options can make them act in conversation one way or another, but I don't think it leads to anything in the story. The side characters are a bit more interesting, but I haven't gotten too far yet, so I don't know how much more there is to them compared to the MC. Character customization was also just okay. It's not as robust as other games but has more options than some. I'll say I don't think the McElorys will be able to get a good monster out of it. Overall, I would wait to buy this until the major bugs are worked out. so far it's been just ok, so unless you're a huge HP fan I just don't see enough here to justify dealing with the headache right now."

2906,Zhyenya,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zhyenya/,1,,1,72.1,February,21,130,0,1,"It's not often a game can completely immerse me into its world. Within the first 10 hours or so, this game  me in, even for someone who's not a huge fan of the HP universe. However, as the game continues beyond that 10-ish hour mark, you start to notice the flaws. Even though this game receives a thumbs up for me, I think it's fair you should know what to expect.You'll first notice how magical the world is around you. The castle feels alive. You're in classes learning spells and meeting the professors and students. The talking paintings and gargoyles will get a chuckle out of you. You watch Peeves ruin a student's day. You find mysterious doors and wonder how they open. A student is stuck in the air from a levitation charm and can't get down, and his friends abandon him because they forgot about a homework assignment. The headmaster scorns a student for being an idiot. You're slightly scared of the Forbidden Forest as it comes up in the story. YOU CAN PET THE CATS. It all feels wonderful.But then you start to get used to the charm, and you'll want to interact with it.You can't cast spells on students, nor talk with them unless they have a quest to give you. I'll walk past a student who was part of a relationship quest, and they won't say anything to me. You'll eavesdrop on other students' conversations, but they have no flow. There are no prefects or other authority to enforce the rules of the castle; it doesn't matter when I show up to class or if I'm out past curfew. The open world doesn't help either. Although it's fun to cruise on your broom and view the world, there isn't much life or activity outside the castle. Unless you're achievement hunting, all of the collection chests, Merlin Trials, field guide pages, and so on feel like filler.Also, you can learn the Unforgivable Curses  No consequences, no story implications, not even unique dialogue from NPCs. Regarding combat, you'll learn four categories of spells: Force (purple), Control (yellow), Damage (red), and Unforgivable Curses (green). With four spell tabs of four spells each, you can have 16 spells at your disposal at any given moment. You'll first learn how to juggle enemies and keep them in the air for as long as possible. You'll also have ""combat challenges"" that give you a random challenge to complete, and some of them will teach you powerful spell combos (one of my favorites, Glacius -> Diffendo). Some enemies will have purple/yellow/red shields. Hmm, they have a colored shield, and I have colored spells. After a while, the combat becomes pretty easy, even on Hard difficulty. Also, on the ""Collections"" menu you can learn about each enemy's specific weakness. For example, if you cast ""Flipendo"" after a troll slams the ground with his two-handed club attack, the club will flip and smack the troll in the face for decent damage and a stun. You would think this is useful information, but like I said, the combat is pretty easy. As long as you can block/parry effectively, and you have your go-to spell combos and juggles, you don't need to know enemy-specific weaknesses. I didn't even experiment with specific enemy weaknesses until long after I finished the main story and was achievement hunting. No spoilers, so don't worry.I actually really enjoyed the relationship quests. I was invested in their personal stories and learned why they were so passionate. I never really understood why the main villain was passionate other than a bad experience with wizard-kind.You're ""the chosen one"" who can interact and wield Ancient Magic, an extremely rare ability. To some this is a very boring and cliché story, but that's OK! I can work with that, but clearly the developers didn't work with it.Outside of progressing the story and a ""focus meter"" for a powerful attack during combat, Ancient Magic is so boring. This is by far my biggest gripe with the game. BY FAR. I promised I wouldn't spoil the story, but there was so much wasted potential. You can't infuse your modern spells with Ancient Magic. You don't learn more about how your powers work, or what else you could cast. You could add so many game mechanics and RPG elements with this ""rare"" form of magic BUT THEY DID NOTHING FUN WITH IT.These were my personal gripes with the game. The Harry Potter universe doesn't fit the open-world format in my opinion. Focus on Hogwarts so you can jam pack it with rich experiences and interactions. Also with so many god-tier open-world games such as Breath of the Wild and Read Dead Redemption 2, the bar is up extremely high, so it will definitely not reach those expectations. I think the developers Confringo'd themselves in the foot by making it open-world instead of hyper-focusing on detail.With all of that being said, I give these criticisms with tough love. I seriously haven't been so entrenched in a video game's world like this game has. I don't regret playing this game, and there are plenty of magical moments to make the game worth it. 7.5/10 wtf there's no Quidditch"
2907,ChoopChoopMyMorningWood,https://steamcommunity.com/id/10100010020/,1,,1,49.7,February,11,243,0,1,"I came to support Rowling & stayed for the game.Exceptionally well made for beginners of RPG games. Very streamlined & story focused.However, when you already have experience with such games, the beginning may seem very slow to you, as it does to me. I am a couple of hours in & I still feel like I'm in tutorial mode, because the game constantly teaches you everything it has to offer, in numerous steps. Usually, I like to branch out of the master story, to explore the world on my own, although this is not really possible here, because everything is closed off, if you don't have the right level or the right amount of story finished (both are very closely connected to each other, as you will learn).After 6.9 hours playtime, I finally can do real open world RPG stuff!What I personally don't like about this game, is how all different factions are streamlined & feel the same, when you talk to them. There does not seem like there's a big difference in mentality. Anyone you can hear talk, sounds the same, from what he's saying. So, if you wouldn't be able to see, who belongs to which faction, from his robes, you wouldn't be able to even distinguish a Slytherin member from a Hufflepuff one.The biggest issue for my playthrough is, that I chose Slytherin for a reason, but from what I am saying & what I'm doing, I basically have my balls cut off, doing the same stuff any nice, kind & too helpful pupil would do.I wouldn't expect a different storyline, just for one house, but I would've expected different interpretations. For example, when I help someone, it's mostly to help me & my fellowship, rather than the others. While playing Hufflepuff for example, it would be probably more altruistic.So, I really miss the faction differences, one would expect in such scenarios. (At least something like in the older Elder Scrolls games, where you would be hated, disliked, liked or loved, depending on your faction, etc.)The other thing is, that it does not feel like it's super broken or anything, but it's clearly unfinished. For example, you cannot even talk to random people. You just press F & they say a single line. You do not even engage in a dialogue. I would expect this would work in certain scenarios, like in the beginning when you get to the school or at least with a couple of school attendees, that randomly walk around the places inside the school. At least give me a real dialouge.I'm giving a thumbs up, because it's fine so far & I can certainly recommend it to Harry Potter fans. It's clearly made for a wide range of age, including children.If you are well versed with RPGs & are not a Harry Potter fan, at all, you should play less than 120 minutes & decide for yourself, how you like the pace. The pace won't change for a while, which you cannot skip, circumvent or delay. There are lots of cut-scenes & goodies for fans of the franchise.P.S.:All the non-sense about attacking the licence holder, before the game came out, was futile & simply unnecessary.The game is already extremely politically correct. It does not talk out loud about political opinions, but it clearly wants to display through its cast, that they follow whatever freak might accuse them of not showing, if they wouldn't have included it.So, don't worry, whoever is honest, will acknowledge that the game is fine, even for those, who complained about the licence holder."

I was working through college at Barnes and Noble when Half Blood Prince came out, and experienced what a HP book release looked like to a bunch of fans like myself. I graduated college the year Half Blood Prince made it to theaters, and had my daughter the year the movie franchise ended. A HUGE part of my life included ""living"" in Hogwarts. Previous games were fun, but this one is completely built for fans of this fantasy world. We can attend classes, explore the entirety of Hogwarts, secrets and all, AND THEN explore the rest of the world. They even went to the trouble of giving not just a day/night cycle, but seasons as well. Meandering through Hogsmead during the fall and seeing the halloween decorations makes me so happy. I didn't expect this game to be as good as it is, but I'm almost 50 hours in, and loving every second of it.

Terrible performance issues like frequent fps drops to 10-20 fps that last anywhere from a few seconds all the way up to a minute and crashes should be non-existent in a game like this when I have a 5800x3D, 3080, 32GB of fast ram, and playing on an NVME ssd. Changing settings doesn't ameliorate these issues either. The worst part is that on console, these performance issues don't exist. The PS5 version doesn't have the aforementioned issues whatsoever. I'm tired of getting poorer performance on PC than on a console that costs the same as my CPU alone at launch did. It makes the idea of buying AAA games on PC pointless.The game doesn't deserve anywhere near the 93% rating it currently has on steam, but because it's Harry Potter it gets a free pass."
2912,»cieply!,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970858038/,3,,0,46.6,March,17,184,0,1,"A beautiful world but a hollow game, which at times felt as if it was made by people who do not like games. Long sequences with zero gameplay that are pure presentation, which is made even worse by a supbar story. We spend a whole game chasing a mcguffin, in the end not even learning precise nature of said mcguffin. Some dark magic questlines were interesting, but unfortunately they went a very tired and predictable route of black and white morality, with good magic bringing peace and happiness and dark arts bringing nothing but pain and sadness. Often control would be taken away from the player to allow the story to progress where the writers want it, even (or especially) if it made little sense (think all the Kai Leng shenanigans in ME3). Strangely enough no professor seems to mind the player casting avada kedavra right in front of their noses. Lastly there is a lot of mechacincs panning out the mediocre gameplay and story to make it longer than it should be. We have to grow magical plants, captu... ""rescue"" magical creatures, breed them, collect fur from them, all on timers that are to make us come back over and over again as if we were playing magical crossing.

While the characters are nothing breathtaking, each fills the world well, is written well, and is voice-acted well. Professors and companions are quite memorable, as are the major NPCs. Music score is very beautiful & especially a vibe while flying, in vivariums or is Hogsmeade.Gameplay is quite fun. Combat is easy to learn but hard to master. The various systems, such as flying, the vivariums, and the beast care, are all significant parts of the fantasy of the wizarding world. Lots of puzzles and collectibles are strewn about the world. The journal entries do make em worthwhile if nothing else then for the lore. Gear system could have been better as the way it is now apart from legendary rarity none matter at all. The upgrade system based around traits are good however unlock incredibly slowly for their max level. An immersive money sink is required, as apart from basic utilities to progress the game and occasional clothing, there is nothing to spend the money on. Side quests apart from companion quest aren't much to write home about however do provide some nice pieces of cosmetics.The character creation could have used a bit more robustness as, more often than not, you may end up having three different NPCs that look like player characters at the same time and in the same place. The game could have benefited with a default player character with more detailed model in order to avoid the above fiasco as it is anyway fully voice acted. The NPC could also use a bit of an overhaul to increase the believability of the world.The game could have used with a few more side quests or with a bit more experience as a reward for various activities as on the first play through in spite of doing every side quests apart from 'The Man Behind The Moon' I wasn't able to hit level 40. As a reference the Field guide completion was at 94%.The dark arts path was a letdown; it unlocks incredible late & is overall lack luster in terms of its effectiveness. However, the rest of the talent trees hold up well and can allow you to hit for some incredible damage numbers.The sum is greater than the individual when it comes to Hogwarts Legacy. Much of what I have listed can be chalked up as nitpicks. They are only apparent because of an otherwise incredible attention to detail. All in all, Hogwarts Legacy is an easy recommendation in case you want to just get lost in a world for 100 hours on end, with the added benefit of it actually being a good game and not a grind fest designed to suck in all your time like so many AAA games these days."

Instead we get 100 boring caves with boring loot. - Professor Sharp is a discount Professor Snape- Professor Weasley is a discount Professor McGonagall- Professor Fig is so unlikeable, I wish he got killed in the prologue. Why is he even involved in the whole story?- Remainder of Professors are stereotyped or also discount HP Series professors, eg: Professor Garlick, or the Divination teacher being a wannabe ♥♥♥♥♥ fortune teller.- The headmaster is boring and the game uses him to scare you about being expelled but nothing ever happens regardless. - All student NPCs apart from Sebastian, Ominis and Poppy Sweeting are boring. - Slytherins aren't even Slytherins, they are just discount Ravenclaw. What happened to being 'le bad purebloods?' - All broomsticks except 1 are horrendously trash, they look like something out of some anime. In what world would they add motorbike seats to a broomstick? There is literally only 1 model that doesn't have it and feels somewhat like from the movies. - 95% of cloth appearances in the game are horrible. Also, no Nimbus broomstick models. The upgrades don't actually upgrade your speed or control, they only extend your broomstick sprint time, which is unlimited anyway if you fly at a low altitude. All voice actors are tryharding and forcing their lines, they are overly expressive. The devs didn't know whether they want to make a cartoon game for younger audiences or something realistic. All dialogues are too long and boring, and they are unskippable. I never asked additional questions because I don't want to sit for 5 minutes talking to a NPC. Combat is good, though I would've liked an easier way to switch between spells, 4 per spell set is not enough. Would've been good to allow us to change the basic attack to something if we use a talent point or upgrade the wand or whatever. Ending was boring and obvious. I chose to take the power for myself and I didn't even get it. He just waved his wand around as if he's gonna absorb or control the power but he didn't? What was the point in giving me a choice. Hard difficulty was too easy. Only heal, edurus and maxima potions were needed, and rarely. Getting better stats on clothing was stupid, the differences between green-blue-purple-gold loot was minor and I only changed my gear every few levels. Rest was sold for tons of gold. Upgrading gear not worth the time, I only put some traits into my clothes by the end of the game. So many collectibles and unlockables scattered in the world and the devs didn't think to give certain rare things (like unlocking your house chest) an end-game item stats that is by far better than randomly collected chest loot, since some keys were locked behind alohomora anyway. Appearance-only reward for the house chest is a big disappointment. All in all, the game had a huge mountain of possibilities and decided to trash it. I'd recommend watching the film series instead of playing this."

While that doesn't change how JK Rowling still has Trump Derangement Syndrome and refuses to house immigrants in her own mansion despite calling the UK to house more immigrants, it seems that the Woke mob has indeed tried to push a bridge too far by attempting to forcing JK Rowling to apologize for her stance regarding her opposition to child sex change surgeries, I commemorate JK Rowling for standing her ground and refusing to apologize to the Woke mob. I bought this game to support her valiant efforts in fighting child sex change surgeries, and so far even managed to enjoy the game. It also helps immensely that there are also only two genders in this game and you cannot transition from ""witch"" to ""wizard"" without any ""wix"" to represent further mental illness that is outside of the two biological genders of male and female. Though it is disturbing that there are only two presets for white characters with the rest of the presets being black or asian and the game tries to push you very hard to make non white characters, the cementing of there only being two genders still overwhelmingly outweighs as a positive over the forced diversity (less white people) and being an asian myself who isn't white, I can live with that. I still created a white character though, and I would like more presets for white character options."

I would have liked to see something closer to Skyrim, Elden Ring, or really an implementation that called for us to explore and be engaged. Instead each cave, despite your characters vocal 'I better be careful in here' they take literally under 60 seconds to finish with usually a single chest to open.- I would have liked the ability to actually companion with some of the followers. It would be cool to explore with another wizard.- I would have liked there to be more comments/interactions from your actions.

So, I enjoyed the franchise, but I am not a devout fan like many others.That said, this game would have passed by me without knowing about it, if it wasn't for all of the nonsense about boycotting it, and the crazy hate that a game has managed to generate before it was released. I purchased this to take a stand, and as a result, I've found myself impressed and have been having a great time with it.It's visually great looking, and so far I'm enjoying exploring the world, dueling with my wand, and I'm curious where the main story is going.I do wish the side characters had more dialog interactions with them, beyond just their side quests. And while the game normally runs smooth for me, there are times where it does stutter for a moment as it's clearly loading in assets.If the game ends strong, I'll likely even give it a second play through, to see how some different choices may change things up."

The love and care that went into this game exceeds all expectations.However, there are also criticisms:-Basic premise: If you are looking for a Hogwarts school simulator with lessons, classmates and common room feeling, you are wrong here. The castle is only a backdrop and only ""lives"" during the quests or cutscenes. Exploring the castle and the surrounding area is very nice, but quickly fades away.It's basically like a modern Assassins Creed or Far Cry, but in the Harry Potter universe, you're not really part of the world.-Main Quest and Side Quests: The main story starts strong and unfortunately becomes very weak towards the end or the narration just stops. The side stories with the individual students is the highlight of the game.-Obvious cut content: Important parts of the game that would have complemented the gameplay loop are simply missing. In particular, a night system for Hogwarts and a morality system would have been appropriate here.You run around with your teacher and friends in several quests shouting Avada Kedavra left and right without anyone caring.The ""ancient magic"" that you master after the story of the game also comes up far too short outside of quests and cutscenes.-The spellcasting: The game leans very heavily on your character becoming a ""Dark Mage"". You kill with every spell and the unforgivable curses have a huge skill tree to defeat enemies even better. Especially without the skill tree, some spells feel useless.-Open World: The open world is unfortunately far too big as we know it nowadays. The north of Hogwarts and the south up to the central mountain range are perfectly okay, but there is a huge area underneath that is only visited twice during quests and is otherwise completely uninteresting.Large empty areas with copy-paste bandit camps and animal spawn points, a few balloons in the air and puzzle tasks. That simply didn't have to be there. Instead, places like the forbidden forest are too small in my opinion.There is a lot to do in the world, but what you can actually do is very limited. It's not much fun to solve the same puzzle for the 15th time or to defeat the same 10 different enemy types.-Items, Potions, Animals and Crafting: The system is kept simple and especially the plant cultivation and animal husbandry are quite nice and go fast enough not to feel like a grind. The potions are strong enough that it is actually worth upgrading before battles. However, it is almost pointless to upgrade items before level 40, because you get new items all the time and hardly need to rely on the modified values, even on the hard difficulty level.Translated with  (free version)"

The game also wants to skirt around the whole JK Rowling transgender stuff, so it doesn't use any gendered language. You aren't allowed to explicitly say whether your character is a male or female. Whenever somebody refers to your character in dialogue, they use they/them pronouns, which lame as hell and a cheap way to solve the gender issue. Story is also boring and dumb."

Side quests aren't very rewarding. And the story is as bland, generic, and confusing as they could make it. MC is the chosen one who can use vague ancient magic that can do a bunch of random stuff depending on what the game needs. I only like a few NPCs. Most of them are annoying. And your choices/ role playing options as a character are very limited. Basically, do whatever you want-- it'll all have the same outcome.And yes, the 'controversy' over jk rowling was stupid. But this game's attempt to compensate for that is even stupider. This is supposed to take place in late 1800s, yet 'reflects the world we live in today'. Just made everything feel like a joke.This game is pretty, but too simplistic for my taste. And the story would only please the type of people who protested it. Ironic, really."

Now, almost 20 years later, Hogwarts Legacy dropped.This game is incredible. It is everything young me dreamt of as a Wizarding world game. it is magnificent!my pc cant really run the graphics higher than low and it still looks pretty as hell!The combat is intuitive and there are a lot of secrets to find, trolls to slay, magical beasts to find and characters to meet!

If you a big fan of the HP universe, then you will likely get significantly more enjoyment out of this game. However, I am a casual fan and still am enjoying it quite a bit. The amount of detail in the environment is immense, one of the best looking games I have played in a while, there is a lot of character and detail everywhere you look. The story is really well written too, really feels like a genuine HP story. As far as the open world and game mechanics go. It is really strong in some areas, there seem to be a good number of optional locations and objectives, but there isn't a whole lot of opportunity to really customize your build. Overall, it is more Witcher 3 and less Skyrim as far as RPG elements go."

2956,MasterLash,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027606852/,2,,1,80.3,February,11,341,0,1,"So far this is an awesome beautiful game, well worth picking up and playing. Not often I say this lately but this game is worth full price. Id love to see a couple expansions like a dark arts arena for pvp as the combat in the game is good and I would also like to see quidditch added. I will add more of a review as I progress the game.**Edit **So after a good deep dive into the game I can give my view on a few more things. Good and bad.* Challenges - About 70% of your game time will be doing small quests that make you work something out. first time I did this i thought it was awesome. Sadly they have around 7 ideas for these and just make you do it 60+ times for just the Merlin trials alone. With the spells they have more ideas would of been easy or even half the number of the things are its beyond boring. 90% of caves turn out to just be the same steps to a small open area with 1 chest that offers random loot likely worth 90 to 200 gold. Pointless and over done. Only one set of challenges made me pay any sort of attention and those where the Depulso rooms.In short all are good but someone made the bad decision to make you redo them way wayyy to much. Really ruins the memory of doing them for the first time and stops you wanting to replay the game.* Talents - Very op, It dose not matter what you pick you will be crazy op as the bad guys cant keep up with you even with out godly talents. For example the Edurus Potion Potency talent.Available from level 5 will make you invincible for a short time, you can also carry 12 of them so you could be untouchable for a very long time. Super easy to replace ( and free after you buy the seeds ect) That is one level 5 talent of 48. They could do with a little re balancing to make the mid/late game feel as fun as early game combat.*View/ Surroundings - Beautiful, Everywhere I have been has been amazing. Only game to give me this much wow was Red dead 2 and elden Ring. Plus seeing these places in movies and reading them in books just adds to the hype.*Combat - Tricky one as I honestly love the combat and feel with all its options you can play how ever you like and be relevant, My only issue is you become op way to fast and nothing stands a chance vs you. Plants = Aoe control god, Potions = You becoming a god, Light or hard spells your a total bad ass. Id even say the light spells offer a more fun pace as pulling a dark witch to you spinning them around, turning them into a tnt barrel then throwing them at there friend is just golden. Dark Arts are crazy strong so fun to use when you feel slighted. Play how you like and your be op no matter what you do. hell I dont even block just elden ring roll away from everything. * impact of choices - Non, at no point have I felt what iv done has changed the story in any way. It is like most traditional rpgs where your following the hero not like alot of newer styles where everything you do affects the world. You could cast the kill curse in front of everyone in Hogsmead and they would just go about there day. *Customisation - 10/10 You can change your char, room, wall paper, outfit, broom, mount, appearance. Only thing I would add would be to change the colours of gear but honestly they pretty much nailed this category well.Upgrading gear - pointless, you never need to worry about gear as you are just so op anyway plus you get better gear non stop with every chest,Taming beasts/Breeding- Ok yea its pretty pointless but it feels nice and I think its turns into a beautiful set of rooms for you to play with. Really add to people wanting to Roleplay this. Bugs- Iv not come across many at all, the off chest giving me another 500 gold and a few robes glitching into the npc bodys to make them look really silly. Basically a few little things that really never affected my game play more than add to my giggles. Stuttering lag ended soon after launch and even that wasnt that bad.Overall Its a great game and I believe still worth the full price. I would love them to add dlc as soon as they can to keep the hype rolling as they have a good work that needs more main storys.I dont feel the game is that long and a bad call to make you do the same puzzle tasks hundreds of times for nothing more than to add hours to the game play leaves you wanting some real content. That said its so beautiful and hell it might be one of only a few games to come out that is playable. Its exactly what you expect and want it to be. Anything else you want me to review just add to the comments and I will give you my honest thoughts."
2957,Mira,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mira1018/,3,,1,25.5,February,11,26,0,1,"As a TRANS gamer and someone who loves the Harry Potter world. This game has been nothing but blast. Upon release it mad minor hic ups for FPS drops, which was easy to look pass.Gameplay: 9/10The combat is responsive, snappy & most of all? Engaging. You learn more tricks about fighting enemies and cool combos that introduced within the tutorial systems of fighting the training dummies.Scenery & Graphics: 9.8/10It's an emersive world that you can get lost in. You can get freaked out by the creepiness of dungeons, the noises spiders make when they're crawling on the ceiling and most of all being in dark places only being lit by Lumos. I found myself captivated instantly and consistently within the grasp of this game.Story & Plot: 9/10Without spoiling. You'll see. :) the game has a good story, there are moments it leaves you puzzled, but things will come and get filled in later.Dislikes:The character creator - This is just me being picky, but the voice ai is awful for pitch, but the hair styles are posh and I love them! Sliders would be a good addition one day for this game - Obviously more DLC is coming to this game with how it is built.TLDR: I think you should play it and ignore what haters are saying. It's a great game to get lost in and forget about the troubles in the world. There are more things to worry about than royalties of a beautiful game going towards someone who is voicing their opinion."

From the story, to the world, to the characters, just everything. It is amazing. 31 hours in and I've pretty much just explored doing side quests and just seeing the world around and inside of Hogwarts. Now it's not without its faults, there are a few things that are repetitive like a lot of the ""challenges"" in the game, but even with that I still find myself loving every time I do it. Another thing negative for me is that many of the characters in a sense feel emotionless and soulless, the main character included (at least the female one, that's who I chose) dont get me wrong i think the voice acting is amazing. it's just the animation in the faces, specifically the eyes that seem off idkBut anyways, It's honestly just a really fun game in my opinion,, and it is one that I know im going to just sink so so many more hours into because I truly can't get enough of it.

I never really had much curiosity but since I was stuck at home I decided to watch. I liked it, it was a cool experience but I wasn't obsessed with it.But after beginning to play this game I went and started re-watching the movies because it felt so GOOD, this game is splendid, from the character construction to the ambient to the AMAZING Hogwarts Castle with INFINITE rooms to explore, which is something crazy. In my first couple of hours, I  went to the Castle and roamed around discovering rooms and secrets.The combat is fun as well, but a bit confusing with all the spells, In fights I usually just press random buttons to cast spells.The graphics are amazing, and the architecture and detail of the Castle are incredible. The customizability of the Room of Requirements is something that I didn't expect, the Vivarium is also cool, with the possibility of having a lot of tamed friends there.Overall this game exceeded my expectations by A LOT and I'll most likely give it my award for the Best game of 2023."
2968,Mike_OD,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mike_od/,2,,1,54.5,February,11,229,0,1,"If you are a fan of the books, I highly recommend this game. This game jives with so much of my own imagination when I originally read the books. Hogwarts Castle itself is beautiful, inside and out, I could not have asked for a better take on the castle. Hogsmeade is a more fleshed out village and again something more in line with how I originally envisioned it. I could go on and on about how the game tickles that joy center in my brain for how it brings my imagination to life, but let's move on.Combat in this game is a joy. Better with controller for sure, but doable with mouse and keyboard. Before they started showing it off, I was skeptical on how it would work but the combat just flows so well. Being able to chain attacks and either switch to another spell set or simply swap spells out on the fly makes the combat feel very alive. Playing on Normal difficulty is a nice challenge at times. I haven't even finished the game yet and already sunk a bunch of hours into it. There's been some small gripes here and there, but nothing overtly egregious to say ""this game doesn't deserve your money.Ignore the noise, if you're a fan of the IP and enjoy Open World Action Roleplaying Games, then get this game."

Playing on normal difficulty its fairy easy. just spam your spells while hitting 'q' and 'x' as the indicator appear. and while i havent tried it myself i dont imagine harder difficulties are much better. just more enemy health and less reaction time if i had to guess.to reiterate, from a point of view the ignores the nostalgia factor of the setting, the game is mediocre.BUT if you are even sort of a harry potter fan, then you will LOVE the game. it gives you so much more to explore and discover about a world you're already interested in.also the game has performance issues in the form of FPS lag spikes on occasion, but setting NVIDIA DLSS to performance mode helps a lot, as well as some unofficial mods that help performance. im only giving the game a positive recommendation because i know that existing harry potter enthusiasts will enjoy it regardless of any of the issues."
2982,thunda,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ra1dr/,32,3,0,17.3,February,18,17,1,1,"Lets start with the pros:- Hogwarts itself looks great, at times I felt like I was in a Harry Potter movie- Music is decent, they remixed the classic HP tunes- Graphics are decent to great- Voice acting is pretty goodBut unfortunately once you look past the surface, a lot of problems start to appear. Unless youre a blind fanboy. One of the biggest issue if not the biggest is the empty open world littered with completely pointless stuff like Merlin's Trials, Treasure Vaults etc. Stuff straight out of Ubisoft's book for ""How to Pad Your Game's Length"".It would be alright if for example the Merlin's Trials were like 8 trials total, all wildly different. Merlin's Trials are simple puzzles you have to complete in droves to unlock more of your very limited inventory space. After you've done 3 different Trials, you've done them all. Unfortunately there are over 90 of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trials.Treasure Vaults are like Merlin's Trials but even simpler and and the reward is opening a door in to a tiny ""dungeon"" (and I mean tiny, takes 5 seconds to reach the loot) where one piece of loot awaits you, usually just something trash (its all randomized so you can even savescum before opening any container)And there's tons of these, just littered everywhere. And you cant turn them off. When youre flying on your broom and press R to reveal nearby interesting locations, a huge mass of these icons pops up in your face and you just want to quit playing.Side quests are nearly all simple fetch quests, some dont even bother hiding it. I just currently got a literal fetch quest where I have to make a delivery in a far away place. I know I wont finish this quest.There are over 150 so called ""field guide pages"" to collect in Hogwarts alone. These net you XP which is needed to level up. 90% of the content in this game is Ubisoft style completely pointless garbage. And I really mean around 90%. 5% is fetch quests and actual good content is the remaining 5%, the main quests which are actually fun to play.Forget about anything interesting happening anywhere, the NPC's are all just as soulless as for example in Cyberpunk. There is no AI whatsoever. Forget even about stuff like for example in Witcher 3, where even small bandit hideout location often had a bit of attached lore in the form of a diary of their latest victim etc, just fleshing out the world. None of that here.I'm 17 hours in and I just have no interest playing anymore, its very formulaic, very tiresome, and apart from the occasional fun main questing, overwhelming majority of the content is braindead boring. And I didn't even mention the performance issues. They can fix the performance but they wont fix the game design choices made."

I played this game for 40 hours at the time of review and I played mostly with a keyboard and mouse. Do not pay $60 for this game unless you're a die hard fan.Pros: Graphics are great. Minor bugs, only required a reload once due to a quest companion running in a circle it was more funny than annoying. There are lots of autosaves if you lose power etc. Broom riding is smooth once you get used to it. The magical Beasts and the room of requirement are sick. There are several spell combos you can pull off which makes decision making while swapping between spell sets important.Cons: The flying mounts do not feel as fast or control nearly as well as the broom, this made an ""epic moment"" stale instantly. There are only 3 useful talent trees and talent points are limited as leveling up becomes much slower and talents are not available until level 20ish (if you do every side mission along the way). I played the opening parts of the game on normal until I got comfortable with the keybindings and then I switched to hard mode. The difference in difficulty is non-existent. Casting dark magic in front of your companions can trigger an audio queue (over and over again...) but I've yet to see any sort of repercussion for using an unforgivable curse which makes it again.... stale. There are no reputation systems, dark/light side systems, there is no depth. The moment you get bored of combat. There isn't a compelling reason to play other than completion."

Aside from it being the 'Harry Potter' Universe game we've always wanted. It easily has more diversity and inclusion in it then all the books combined, plus there's a portrait in Hogwarts of what looks to be JK Rowling burning at the stake. The diversity/inclusion I speak of is not in an ""Intrusive, woke, agenda setting"" kind of way, just normal. Like ya, there's POC, and pronouns and people of different gender profiles *surprise pikachu face*, as if that's not how real life already is. Pros:-Story-Graphics: Amazing in 4k Ultra-Customization and Transmog system: The item system is intuitive and the transmog system is simple and effective.-Combat: Takes a bit to get used to but it's super smooth on K&M-Best Keyboard & Mouse port I've seen yet-Exploration and environment: Can literally spend hours just exploring Hogwarts and still not even scratch the surface-Use of magic to explore the world and solve riddles and puzzles-Fast travel: Not a generic fast travel system. They actually use the 'Floo powder' system in a great way.Cons:-Character creation voices: Could be better, and there are some in-game audio issues related to it.-Controller play style: It's surprisingly garbage compared to Keyboard and Mouse-No quidditch: will likely be an expansion if I had to guess, though they do make an effort to explain it away in the beginning of the game.Minor cons:-Some audio and visual bugs-Wish they had more hairstyles-Wish the 'Sorting Hat' ceremony was a bit more in-depth. But I get why they made it the way they did.-Most of the NPCs are fairly generic and you can't interact with them. Wish the NPCs had A.I. similar to GTA or something.-Some stuff you can jump or vault over, other things you can't. A bit restricting or railroading at times in terms of exploration."

However:In no way shape or form does it matter which House you pick for the end story or generally for the in-game experience. Yes, you do get few lines ""Yes we Slytherins are better etc etc"" but that doesn’t really feel like the game is acknowledging my choice, I’m still dealing with the same protagonists in the same way. (I just finished as a Slytherin, and am about to play as a Ravenclaw). When I reached the end, “evil ending” doesn’t really matter, yes, your eyes glow red for a sec in that cut scene but you don’t get cool new power, nothing really happens, “good ending” feels more dignified towards professor Fig, and honestly, I picked that one since it made more sense.Unforgivable curses are amazing, but the things that you can do with ancient magic feel more “unforgivable” :D you literally have the ability to disintegrate someone from existence, or to slam his body repeatedly against the ground. The only people who care if you know unforgivable magic are ashwinders and Ominis on occasion, literally nobody else cares. Too many caves and Merlin trials, you really didn't need to put soo many, or at least make those more rewarding please 😊 I really don’t care about Quidditch :D never liked it, but the broom experience is amazing in on itself. More magic slots are needed, and more spells please :D Alohamora needs to be an early spell, and tbh I don’t care about the “spinning tumblers” too much, yes that can be annoying sometimes, I hate the fact that Alohamora had “three levels of difficulty”. And finally, more lore please, more magic, more lore 😊 The game is amazing, beautiful, soo many things to explore, it really makes you feel like a witch/wizard. I literally tell people “don’t buy this, you will lose yourself” :D."

3006,FYRNØX,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shivathedeceased/,2,,1,59.1,February,13,626,0,1,"Probably the best Hogwarts experience out as of the time of this review, but I think it's missing quite a bit. If you aren't a Harry Potter fan, this is simply a decent RPG game. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you'll probably be slightly disappointed that it's not as immersive as you thought, but you'll still enjoy it. I think this game could have benefited from more strict and immersive rules (for example, a REAL curfew system) and maybe more frequent/daily classes you can attend, if you so choose to. More spell variety would be nice, since many of the spells are simply the same except with a slightly different tweak. Would have been nice if there was more of a use for locations an everyday student should go to, like the dormitories. Hopefully future modding can implement these things. Additionally, there are also many differences between Hogwarts from the books/movies and this game, it feels a tad smaller than I expected, but honestly a lot of this could just be the magical nature of the castle and the era, and maybe they based it more on the books than they did the movies (at this point I'm nitpicking, it's still a really cool castle to explore). Plotwise, this game is severely lacking. The best plot in the game isn't even found in the main story.TL;DR, my only gripe has been how I have barely felt like I'm immersed as a student at Hogwarts and more like I'm immersed in an RPG game themed in the Harry Potter universe. That and week 1 performance issues (why the hell does this game recommend more than 20 gb of RAM, and why is my 3070 struggling with it)? As it is now, it feels just like any other RPG game which follows the same formula. Hopefully future updates come (which I doubt they'll do), or modding makes the game better."

No. It's easier to spread hate about a game instead, attack people and streamers who waited years for this.I literally waited for over 15 years for a game like this and I LOVE it. Am I transphobic? No. Do I have trans friends, yes. Does it *ing matter? NO. Will I still play this game and recommend it to anyone who likes open world adventures? Hell yea!Some people need to wake up again and focus their hateful energy towards the real problems of the world. It's so easy to say ""you're a bad person if you play this game"", without realizing how hurting this might be for some people.Yes J.K. earns money with the brand, but the developers were the ones working hard on this game to make it possible for us to live out our inner child again. This is what I pay for. Now to the game itself: You can explore literally everything, take many sidequests or just follow the storyline. I'm 20h in and I just unlocked broom flying. Much more to come, I'm excited. So much detail and love is put into the castle itself.  It lures you to come back each time you've learned a new spell and try out if it works with certain riddles.Graphics are beautiful, I recommend to leave the image calibration on default for more depth and richer colors!Its wonderful.9/10 recommended.  -1 Because you can't have love interests. lmao."

Almost an overwhelming amount of side quests to complete, but they don't feel as repetitive as most other titles. The only thing I don't like is how crowded the Hogwarts map is, I wish it was a little more in depth. The way points really get in the way sometimes.

The world is beautiful and so detailed it's straight out from the books/films, it's shows the love and dedication of the devs. The gameplay is awesome, casting the spells you know from HP is so much fun and pretty much carries the whole game. BUT next time it won't be enough. The story and almost every character is extremly shallow, uninteresting and dull. The game just feels too nice. Everyone (except ofc the bad guys) is super kind to you and all you can do is nice things. Yeah you can learn the unforgivable spells (and no one bats an eye when you use them...) and you have the choice to do the ""evil"" path, but everyone's like ""hey that was rude! anyway thanks, you are the best!"" and in the end you are still the hero. The only mission that felt interesting and real was the Sebastian side quest and maybe Poppy's. Next time we need more depth both stroywise and characterwise. Decisions needs to have more weights and consequences.In summary: a beautifully detailed game for HP fans with enjoyable combat. but the story and characters needs to be improved."
3017,TympanicPulse,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tympanicpulse/,2,,0,75.8,March,5,62,1,1,"This is a rant with what some might consider spoilers:This game was given to me by my boyfriend and I was excited to play it. But after putting quite a few hours in, it's very obvious that this game was rushed and not tuned at all. They gatekeep tons of things behind quests that feel arbitrary because the story itself is weak as hell.  Nothing you do has any consequences in the game. Reading the map is really hard. They have contradictory information, like your collections are not totals in the game, it's just a random amount that they deemed enough for a collection. Which does make it very confusing to know if you have actually found what you need to find or if you want to 100% finding stuff then GOOD LUCK! There are inconsistencies in the map, like some of the field guide pages have an icon that you can select to help you find it, but then lots of other field guide pages are completely invisible with no map marker, not to mention the fact that you have to be right on top of the page and facing the correct direction for it to appear, leading to me running around in circles trying to find something that I'm right on top of because I'm not facing the exact pixel they want. It should be a radius affect, Also, the little pages disappear immediately, whereas chest and locks and other things will stay lit up for several seconds when you use the reveal charm. Why the discrepancy? They wasted money on paying Simon Pegg to be the headmaster because the headmaster has like 10 lines and none of them require Simon Pegg. They wasted time and money making every single staircase in the trials move for no reason other than to make it pretty. When they should've spent that time making the story more interesting. Why doesn't my character have a background? No mention of parents or where I come from or how I found out about magic or who I was before I'm getting on a magical carriage. I talk to so many people in the game about their families but mine, for better or worse, is entirely absent from the story. All the characters are just completely flat with very little to absolutely no character growth at all. You, as the main character, do not have character growth. Also, all the women stand with their hands crossed over each other in a very submissive, waitstaff, choir girl way and it absolutely disgusts me. The male characters all stand normally with hands are their sides and they gesture normally when they talk. Not enough voice options. I also agree that I don't like the house elves plight. I know it's part of the overall world, but I like to believe that there has always been that student or group of students who wanted to free them every year even if it doesn't happen. I do not believe that Hermione is the first one to think this in the books after the school has been open for hundreds of years. Lacks dynamic and morality. Ranrok, the antagonist is lame.  He constantly is on screen in cut scenes wanting to fight me and then the next scene is me fighting the people he was talking to. Like, where did he go? And he just wants power, no real reason. They try to make using the unforgivable curses like a big deal, but its not because like I said, there are no consequences in the game for any of your actions. I really wanted to like this game. And it was cool to see Hogwarts on the screen and be able to run around, but the story itself is really lacking, and I totally see some of the prejudice that people were concerned about towards women and stereotyping groups of people. Also, they are already talking about HL2 but no mention of DLC for HL. That's a huge red flag to me from game developers. Hope this helps your decision :)"
3018,lol.its.viv,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198418819539/,3,,0,29.9,February,13,2,0,1,"So, I'd like to start by mentioning that I bought this game (deluxe edition) before I really looked into the controversy surrounding it. Once the early access period started and the game started blowing up, I started learning more about the prevalent antisemitism and the problems with supporting the game. Now, the open world is great. It's a fun open world, the combat flows nicely, and I like Natty and Sebastian. However, when I started playing the main story of the game I got really uncomfortable. The characterization of the goblins and the general premise of the goblin revolution rubbed me the wrong way. The quest with the house elf who served the Black family also made me very uncomfortable in how the house elf was treated and how the situation was generally received. I like the inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters, however just including a character does not overshadow the fact that there are very problematic and uncomfortable themes in this game. Aside from that, personally the voice acting in the game is very flat and the character animations during dialogue scenes are extremely lack luster. It felt like watching a pair of posts have a discussion when the content they were talking about should have had more emotion behind it. There were also some volume balancing issues that were hugely annoying. Going from playing to a cutscene the volume would shift drastically. Overall, I really wish I had done my research before playing this game as I would not have wasted $80 on a game that supports antisemitism and transphobic agendas and, frankly, has lack luster dialogue animations and voice acting.  To the animators and graphic designers, the game is stunning and combat is great. I truly did enjoy the room of requirement and the vivarium. However, I feel bad for even buying this game due to its problematic nature and the message my actions sent. I have since uninstalled the game and I am truly sorry I bought it in the first place. I personally do not recommend this game but everyone is free to make their own choices."

Oh hell yeah the performance is brilliant if it does not load ANY TEXTURES!Okay I can't play very far. I am a victim of this random in game stutter no matter what graphic settings I choose. Unless this is getting fixed I can't say very much about the game except it looks nice. There is also an issue with the pitch of the voice meaning every tick left or right from the default pitch will make the voice sound robotic. The Pop in is almost GTA San Andreas worthy. Textures literally pop in right in front of you. The random and not consistently reproducable stutters and FPS Drops also seem to affect the physics, meaning I do not think it is Texture related or anything. TL;DR: It is a very bad port. Wait till Warner and Nvidia got their stuff sorted out. Give it another month and the game probably is actually good. Until then I will keep a negative review.Update: Two patches in. The first one actually made it better and I was about to change my review scoring. Today it got another patch in and now I am even worse off then without any patch.

It has a linear set of main quest missions, with a bunch of side quests sprinkled in. My overall impression is it is very much the same as many other open world and AAA games out there, without much innovation. The best thing this game has it has going for it is it nails the atmosphere of harry potter in the character acting and such. You can tell as much from the trailer. Otherwise, I've kind of grown bored of the game 10 hours in.The biggest downside of this game is the performance. It was released in a completely unready state, I honestly suggest waiting for performance fixes for this game if you want to play it. When you start the game it appears to run perfect at the recommended settings, but the second you get to hogwarts you'll see problems. This game seems to struggle when loading the transition between two areas, which happens all the time in hogwarts. You'll notice once you enter a new room or go outside, the game dips from 120fps or whatever your normal fps is, down to 10-20fps. Then, after 10s of seconds it goes back up to your normal 120fps again. There is some critical code optimization that needs to happen in this game.Interestingly, even if I set the game to all low settings, the graphics still look like ultra settings, even after rebooting the game. Seems buggy."

Boring story and characters, it seems the writers forgot that this game was about the harry potter universe. Its astonishingly unoriginal, and considers collecting a certain amount of objects or killing a certain amount of enemies to make sense as homework for your classes. The school aspect of Hogwarts is missed completely, and the excitement of wand duelling a worthy opponent is nonexistent as you instead mow down armies of uninteresting goblins and poachers.Im a story/immersion focused gamer, so for me, this game did not capture what made Hogwarts so special in the books or movies. The school looks great, but is devoid of life. I wish they hadnt made the world so large and instead focused on Hogwarts grounds, allowing for more concentrated expirience.I have a lot of disdain for these AAA gaming companies who are perfectly happy releasing games that are just 'ok' instead of TRYING to make something new."

Changing an items appearance is free, and you can do it as many times as you want and whenever you want. The only downside is looking a bit goofy/MC when you're in a classroom full of people in school uniform and you're dressed entirely different.Even if you're not a fan of the movies/books, this game might still be for you.

3065,TheTitaniumDragon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/,1,,1,171.9,February,11,"1,923",0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world RPG set in the Wizarding Universe of Harry Potter, a century before the events of the book series. This is a game that is designed for fans of that universe – Hogwarts Castle, the centerpiece of the series, is marvelously detailed, and the game is full of the whimsy that the brand is known for. Visually, the game is a marvel, full of intricate details – Hogwarts Castle is the single best looking area in any video game, ever, and the world at large is quite nice.The game has you play as a fifth year student – a 16 year old – of the visual appearance and name of your choice. You get to get sorted into your house (though in reality, you can choose it), get a wand, and get to explore Hogwarts. You learn spells, and instead of fighting like a FPS or a standard action game, the game has a wholly original combat system based around matching shields and managing spell cooldowns and choosing your targets. It actually works well, and unlike most games which either abstract it a lot or feel like third person shooters, it actually feels like it is its own thing.But, while this game is a visual masterpiece, it falls a bit short on the actual experience. The game has a really good opening sequence, full of marvelous visuals and a lot of interesting set pieces, but after you get through the tutorial and start in on the game proper, you realize that there were some sacrifices made along the way to get this out the door, and this unfortunately makes the game world feel much less alive than it should.The other students are basically scenery – you barely interact with them, and the only times you really do is quests, of which there are an enormous number. Few of your fellow students or professors get much characterization – really, only four or so characters in the game really get explored all that much, and even then, one of them is terribly bland, and all but one of them have very bland designs.There are no companions here – there are some quests where you are accompanied by one of four fellow students, or by a professor – but they don’t last all that long, and they don’t do enough to characterize most of them. Ironically, the Slytherin companion is the most interesting one – and in fact, there are two interesting Slytherin characters, which works very well as they have a pre-existing friendship and you are sort of “intruding” on it, which creates an intersting dynamic. Moreover, one of them is very much into Dark Magic and is very emotional, while the other rejects it as dangerous. The one who is into it befriends you and influences you to try and find a cure for his sister, Anne, who has been cursed, at whatever cost – but even as he seduces you to the Dark Side, it kind of becomes clear that he is going too far and nothing he is doing is ultimately going to work out.Unfortunately, while this is a good tragedy, it is interspersed with a general plot that is nowhere near as good. One of the other students is okay – she has a bunch of beast-related sidequests – while the third is a fairly lame do-gooder whose characterization isn’t exactly exciting, and who is presented as some exotic figure – except the school is *extremely* international (much more than in the series) resulting in her not seeming so exotic at all. It just doesn’t work.There’s theoretically one more companion, but his existence is so fleeting that he shows up basically one and a half times. It is obvious he was meant to play a bigger role, but it seems like whatever subquest he was getting got cut – either because it wasn’t very interesting or because of a lack of time.Indeed, it is very obvious that the game was meant to have a companion system, where you brought people around with you; there’s remnants of dialogue from that, and unfortunately, without it, the world feels very sterile. You can’t interact with anyone but shopkeepers outside of quests, and so while the world is pretty, all there really is to do is to run around collecting stuff – which there is a plethora of, but it is mostly the same stuff, over and over again, outside of Hogwarts.The greater open world is honestly pretty weak – it looks good visually, but gameplay-wise, there’s just not enough enemy variety to sustain the game. The game could do some interesting puzzles, but there’s only a handful of them, mostly in Hogwarts, with most of the rest just being “use spell on object”. The actual combat is okay at first, but by the end you are just an overpowered wrecking ball and nothing can stand in your way, even without the use of Dark Magic, and the lack of enemy variety makes it increasingly repetitive the longer you go on.The overall plot of the game is only okay as well. It starts off very strong, but unfortunately, your lack of bonding with characters greatly undermines the core plot – bad things happen to people, but it’s hard to care because you have no reason to care about these people. Some of the side plots are stronger than the main plot, and don’t end up tying in as strongly as they should have, and in the end, you have this climactic scene with a bunch of characters that you interacted with three times in the game at most, because you literally can’t interact with them outside of their very limited quests.The game also doesn’t really deliver on the notion of being a student – indeed, your character is implausibly powerful for a 16 year old, and takes out veritable armies of goblins and dark wizards single-handedly. The classes are very limited and superficial, and you have little interaction with most students or professors, which is a shame, as Hogwarts was far more interesting than the all too repetitive open world.As a result, the game at times had a hard time holding my attention – I have “171” hours in this game, but the actual 100% time was 77 hours, with the rest being alt-tabbed out. And of that, I’d say that about a third was high quality quests, and about two-thirds was wandering around exploring the open world to collect stuff that was, frankly, kind of pointless.Finally, the game has some performance issues. It does not run terribly well, and if you are running an older rig, expect to have to upscale the graphics to get something other than a slide show.Overall, I think this is a valiant effort, but the shortcomings hold it back from greatness. It’s worth playing if you’re into the Wizarding World and don’t mind open worlds, but I would recommend focusing on the quests, particularly the main quest, and mostly ignoring the open world – there’s not much that’s all that fun out there."
3066,ark,https://steamcommunity.com/id/asinglemoisttowelette/,1,,1,31.4,February,11,437,0,1,"Okay, 19 hours in I've got a good idea of how the game feels. The gameplay is fun but the first hour or 2 where you're doing the introductory quest can be slow because of the dialogue and cutscenes (Don't get me wrong the story is really interesting, but if you're looking to get into the gameplay immediately then you need to get through the introductions first). The fights are really fun and make you feel like you're in a duel against other wizards. The combat is not deep it's quite literally just spell casting. There are no melee weapons, but there are plants and potions that will aid you in combat. There's no mana system or stamina system it's all about whether or not you can outcast an opponent and time your blocks correctly (kinda like shadow of mordor/war) you can dodge and counter/block. I personally had issue loading into areas on the first day of launch on the 7th, but it's steadily gotten better the more i've played. Hopefully Avalanche releases some updates to fix some of the memory leak issues. However, i'm sure they'll push out optimization updates as soon as they get enough player data and input. I'm genuinely a fan of the Harry Potter books and the game really actually feels like Hogwarts so far. It's also a completely open world. I'm doing the main quest right now but nothing's stopping me from going to Hogsmeade or just wandering around doing side missions or looking for collectibles. The game gives you a lot of freedom when exploring too. Once you're given your first broom you can basically fly anywhere you want (Except for the no-fly zones which stay canon to the movies/books). Besides the stuttering the game has me hooked and is a perfect 9/10Although J.K Rowling's name is attached to the series, the developer and publisher of this Hogwarts Legacy deserve all the praise it's getting for their hard work. Simply forget about her and the game is one of the most enjoyable of 2023 so far. It'll be hard to top it."
3067,Starliner,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Starliner/,3,,1,97.8,February,11,499,0,1,"I have sunk 28 hours into the game so far and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed!!! The game transports you straight into the magical world of Harry Potter, like no previous entry has before. It's a true masterpiece.From the stunning graphics to the intricate storyline, everything about this game is incredibly well done. The characters are incredibly well-developed, and you can really feel their emotions and motivations as you play. The game's open-world design allows you to explore Hogwarts and its surrounding areas in ways I never thought possible, and the spellcasting system is both intuitive and challenging.But what truly sets this game apart is its attention to detail. The developers have truly done their homework when it comes to the Harry Potter universe and it shows. From the little quirks of the professors to the way magic is used, everything feels authentic and true to the original books.Overall, I highly recommend this game to any fan of the Harry Potter franchise, as well as anyone looking for a well-made, immersive game experience. Hogwarts Legacy is a true testament to what can be achieved in the gaming industry, and it sets a new standard for what a game based on a beloved franchise should be."

3077,Batberg,https://steamcommunity.com/id/batberg/,11,1,0,3.9,February,14,199,2,1,"Let me preface this by saying I'm in no way a Harry Potter fan - but I am a fan of RPGs and open-world games, and I've played a lot of them. Hogwarts Legacy is a love letter to the world of Harry Potter - taking place before Potter's time, the game has you fight against a goblin rebellion by harnessing ancient magic. The nature of this magic isn't clear, but of course, your character is the Chosen One, so...The gameplay is incredibly basic. Spam cast magic, with the occasional switching of spells in order to form impotent combos that don't really do much damage to your enemy. Your character is a Hogwarts student , and yet he is learning the magic of a first year - yet, at the same time, he can learn the unforgiveable curses and use them without punishment or repercussion. Combat is slow and clunky, and there isn't enough variety to really keep me interested. The game is mostly about exploration. Find this, collect that. Hogwarts is filled with secrets to seek and puzzles to solve, but they don't feel organic - rather, they feel as if they were added in order to make the game artificially longer. Movement is really slow, which just makes me less likely to want to collect everything.This is where the game stands out. As a fan of huge, sprawling maps, Hogwarts itself feels too small for my liking, but the detail that has put into building the castle is phenomenal. Staircases, corridors, towers, and parapets all come together to form a wondrous piece of architecture - and you get to explore it, albeit, feeling less like a Hogwarts student and more like a placeholder for someone more important. Hogsmeade is less beautiful, but still a spectacular sight. The game is filled with bland NPCs, and the secondary characters are not much better. Dialogue sounds artificial, almost robotic, and before long I was spamming the skip button because of how long the conversations are.I cannot recommend Hogwarts Legacy to anyone with an ounce of sanity. The game is clearly unfinished - features promised by the developers -  - have not been included in the full game, obviously coming as a DLC at some unknown point in the future. The combat is clunky. Exploration seems to be key to the gameplay, but it is so slow. The game itself is optimised poorly. THE GAME IS BORING. Out of my four hours, at least an hour and a half of that was spent in cutscenes, by the way. Please don't buy this game.Oh, and to the reviewer who likened this game to the Witcher 3. Not only is that a grave insult to CDPR, but what kind of drugs were you taking when you wrote your review?"

It's 10/10 from me. Absolutely love it, for big Potter fans it seems to cover all bases with so much detail when exploring around the different areas. The battles are good fun, puzzles tricky and the story line is wonderful. I'm playing on steam deck and haven't noticed any issues with performance other than being a bit fast on battery depletion from 50 fps. I would recommend this game to everyone. It's fabulous. I hope they bring out DLCs for quidditch and other fun parts of the films/books that so far i've not found in the game."

Rowling's world of harry potter.While the game let you plays as student in hogwarts school, this game is by any means not a school simulator with action like ""Bully"". Think of it more like ""skyrim / witcher 3"".Pros(+):+ Big map area with very detailed environment.+ One of best game graphic released to date.+ DLSS, FSR, XeSS+ Great combat and snappy movement.+ Transmog feature so you won't looks silly with your randomized loot.+ Bunch of side quest and activity to do.Grey (?):? Control kinda clunky since attack and choosing spell is same button (with controller).? The game is mostly dialogue based and exploring the world.? Colored rarity gear + leveled gear.? Very rare but annoying FPS drops.? Non-scheduled school class, you can come anytime as long it's daytime.Cons(-):- Lack of photo mode as this review written.- Most enemy acts same, combat get repetitive real fast.- Houses you choose for your hogwarts school doesn't affect much, or any.The game is pretty much worth full price if you're a potterhead, while i'll suggest to wait for atleast 30% sale if you're just average RPG enjoyer.ps: Lack of combat in this game makes me rate this game sleep/10"
3081,kevin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kvnenn/,5,,0,27.3,February,12,443,0,1,"Let me get this straight - I love this game. It is almost certainly the greatest Harry Potter game ever created, and I really do wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in trying, or are already interested in the Wizarding World universe. However, despite recommending it, I'm also giving it a negative recommendation (ironic, I know). However, this is for good reason. This game takes a lot of inspiration (in my opinion) from the Witcher 3, from the quest structure, quest log, repetitive places of interest, and even the absence of many choices. My main critique of this game was that this game was marketed as having choices that would directly affect the future of Hogwarts - this couldn't be further from the truth. This game is so incredibly linear in terms of storytelling, and the few times the game seems like it's giving you a choice to be somewhat evil, it still winds up being lighthearted. There is no player freedom. It looks like you can say something mean to someone, you choose that option, and then you end up saying something nice anyway. It makes no sense. Another concern, and the final nail in the coffin that made me so angry with this game (despite how much I love it) is that your house really does NOT matter. Regardless of the house that you choose, you still end up on the same missions with the same people, and there are no students in your common room that you can befriend. In fact, your common room is useless beyond the first few quests. Essentially, choosing your house is just choosing your favourite colour. Expanding on the previous point of your house not mattering, my character was sorted into Slytherin, and I wanted to roleplay as a typical, snarky Slytherin student. Instead, regardless of the character you make, they will talk as though they're a shy 12 year old who kisses the feet of everyone asking for help. This game does not deserve the RPG tag, and I'm disappointed in the developers for marketing the game as a ""choices matter"" video game - it doesn't. The dialogue options should have been cut, because it doesn't change anything. I do really enjoy this game, I do recommend it, and I will complete it, but I have to leave this here as a warning to all players that the game is not what it was marketed to be. It is still quite enjoyable, but it's not what was promised."

3089,cameronfrost00,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198138552553/,3,,0,55.2,February,14,40,0,1,"First of all, steam only lets you give a yes or no answer to whether you recommend this game, so this review isn't entirely negative. Ill start off with what I liked:- The open world is very well crafted, it's not big but they make it feel big which you can go out an explore from the start. - The story is ok, but nothing special. - The combat is fun and relatively well designed. - The puzzles aren't too repetitive and are pretty interesting, reminding me a bit of GOW. Now the negatives, and oh boy there's a lot:- Frankly this game is way over hyped, yes it exceeded expectations but only because they were low to begin with. - The quests aren't really quests but feel more like tedious errands you have to do for people in order to progress through the game. This was one of the most awful aspects for me, and really tested my patience. Things like ""go use a mandrake root on some enemies"" only so you can run back to an npc to get the new spell wingardium leviosa, even though there's seemingly no reason why you had to do these chores in the first place. Every side quest is more of chore you have to do for someone, like go find an item at x and bring it back to a and then go and find another item etc. Even the classes feel tedious and boring, because i know ill have to do one of these stupid assignments after every one of them. In other games, they would fit more into optional challenges players can do to earn achievements or filler, but here they form the bulk of the content. 10 hours in, i was tired and desperately hoping that if I progress far enough something interesting will happen. - None of the npc content was intriguing to me at all, and they are usually very shallow. For example, there's a part when you have to answer trivia about the wizarding world and one of the questions was 'what are the deathly hallows', and one of the options was horcruxes. I chose this option because I thought it would be interesting to see the npc's react to you knowing about horcruxes, which from the book were supposedly a big no go topic, but the npcs have absolutely no reaction and just say oops you're wrong. Why add horcruxes as an option and then completely ignore an opportunity to show interesting canon reactions, like i may as well have said slugs. This brings me to the next part:- If you actually want to role play as a dark wizard the game will not let you. Yes, you can use the unforgivable curses but they're locked behind a side quest that will literally take you to the end of the story by the time you can use spells like avada kedavra. Funnily enough though, this side quest had more character development than the main story. The spells are treated pretty much like every other spell anyway, there's barely any response from npc's and will react pretty much the same as every other spell you use. I used crucio on someone next to the damn professor and he didn't care or react at all. - In terms of dialogue, it's like your character is constantly high or something because he's always smiling and never really reacts angry, scared or anxious no matter the situation. I liked a few npcs but most were pretty much the same in that regard. It takes a lot out of the experience because the story tries to make you feel like it's important, but then the characters react like its another Tuesday. - There isn't really any grind or reward for gear like other rpgs, it's simply finding gear in some random chest and then equipping whatever gives you better stats.- Most of the open world side content is filler. Go clear camps to get runes to apply to your gear, over and over again. It seems they locked your inventory capacity just so they could fill more content, so you have to run around doing 'merlin trials' just so you can increase inventory slots, which makes no sense when they give you a bottomless bag to put animals in. - Getting new spells would feel rewarding if you weren't fighting the same enemies you were in the first hour of the game at the end of the game. Overall, it's a game i'd buy after playing every other good rpg out there and was bored looking for something to play. I wouldn't even say it follows canon that well. Don't buy it thinking you're getting something as detailed as RD2, GOW or Elden Ring, but it's by no means a terrible game and I can appreciated the effort the devs put into making it."

WHAT A GREAT TIME TO BE ALIVE!Remember old first three games, and how I liked them and this one is better in mostly every aspect. Map is big enough to explore, music is great, overall atmosphere is fantastic. It’s so addictive just to gather resources, finish challenges and some sort of tasks. There are a lot of small details about the world which are noticeable for books and movies fans and enjoyers. About mine experience with technical side: mostly 60 fps, small drops 1-3 fps when I am fast travel somewhere or when I get into new location. I’ve locked fps to 60 in game with vertical sync on, motion blur off, all settings are on medium except textures (high). Res: full hd. Specs: i5 10400, rtx2060s, ssd, win 10, 24 gb ram.Of course there are some things I wish would’ve been better or changed at all:-map(when you press m) is quite bad, especially Hogwarts map. It’s quite misleading and hard to backtrack anything in castle.- potions making, I wish it will be like Oblivion at least or like Kingdom Come where you are actually making potions instead of just waiting 30 secs.. boring, could’ve been better.- not many good secrets and secret passages in the castle itself, it feels great but with new technologies they can make Hogwarts even better, unfortunately they didn’t- no chests or other things to gather your gear, you can only sell it or destroy it, and Merlin’s trials aren’t that much effective to increase your slots..- they could’ve done lessons more interesting to attend + add some books in the library so people could read them, like in Skyrim for example.- no Quidditch, broom flights feels great, but I hope they will make quidditch as a separate DLC or may be in future games.To sum up, strong 8 out of 10 from me, great game regardless of it’s problems and long awaited game in Harry Potter universe. I think most of the HP fans will like it and I recommend it to kids too, great game to just explore and fight some enemies.P.S. thanks for Japanese voice-overP.P.S. let us remember wise words:"

Just a plain boring main character- I miss a cool rival like Draco Malfoy. Everyone is super nice and no one has real ambitions. Give me some slytherin vibes.- The gear system is like all over the place.

3106,Stabbykinz,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044107262/,4,1,0,23.2,February,13,338,0,1,"So this one was...tough. There's a fair amount to like about the game. The visuals are stellar, the world is very pretty to explore and soak in, the combat is pretty thrilling and spectacle when you're fending off multiple enemies at a time. The wizard fashion is easily my favorite part along with the interior decorating for the Room of Requirement, even if the decorating is a bit limitedBut the game's title is completely misleading. This isn't a Hogwarts game, nor is there a Legacy. I'm writing this review with 23 hours clocked in at the moment, and the issues were slow to arise, but glaring as the illusion of this game drops. I'm not going to cover the spec issues and poor optimization, they put in DRM software so I was already expecting frames to be all over the place. (Surprisingly it wasn't all the time, but I won't be talking much more about those details.) With that much time sunk in, the biggest glaring issue I've come across in this title is that I don't know the main villain's motivation, I don't know the side villain's motivation, and I don't even really know what truly sets apart ancient magic from regular magic. But it gets worse, and I'll try to keep it readable, if not brief.The game starts with you already being a fifth year. This...was honestly disappointing. I figured it would have been the case since the character creation already has you mostly grown up, but I was really hoping to experience a more modernized gaming experience of -Hogwarts-. But, alright, I can probably forgive that, even with the character creation being limited from what had been previously showcased before. But...then the game just tosses you in? There's no real build up, or background choices, you're just someone that got picked as a fifth year, and then you can see ancient magic, and the Sorting Time? It's a bit jarring, but at least the voice acting for my lass is decent. But soon enough you're a stellar student breezing through very basic assignments, getting showered in praises in spells, and it just...feels very weird. The game's got some pretty bad protagonist syndrome, but it gets worse, ironically, when contrasted with the professors, a couple students, and the background NPC's.I have to take further points away from Hogwarts Legacy, because the vast majority of the side students are kinda grating to listen to, and you don't get super close to them, as far as I know.. Side quests across the board are a bit inane so far and have mostly involved characters going 'I can't be bothered to do this thing, go do it and find out what the thing is'. I  give points back for the Professors and Natty. Ronen is especially one of my favorites, well voice acted, and brought so much energy that I was actually excited to do classes for a bit. Most of the classes are one/two-off though, even Natty's charm and delightful lore couldn't really lift my spirits when I found out that I wouldn't be interacting with them as often as I thought. Further more, listening on the NPC students in conversation, getting howled, or interacting with folks in Hogsmeade really made them feel grounded and part of the world...And I think that's what broke my immersion. That's what was wrong with my character. They have no Over the course of my twenty hour plus experience, I realized that my character has nothing really tying them to the world or the story beyond ""I can see wibbly wobblies in the air!"". Their past might as well not exist, they exceed at everything despite only having veeery rushed training versus the students who have been at it for . They don't have any  in fighting the antagonists, or finding out why they have the SPECIAL E Y E SSS (my brand!). They are pretty much an engine for the story to keep trucking a long and a yes-woman for all of the authority figures, ready to help and do things because they can and the story demands it. The NPC's feel more grounded and believable than my own character, which makes the contrast so grating that it breaks my immersion. I get that wearing the 'hero hat' immediately destines the PC to become powerful through the course of the game, but it feels like the game does everything its power to alienate you from the other students and characters from the get-go.But that's just the  alienation. Let's talk about the physical.Funny enough, the ancient magic thing is not the worst part, considering how they barely go into details about what is, not even in bread crumbs of info as you progress. The worst part is that this is an open world. Not Disco Elysium's non-linear open world, I mean pick-any-Ubisoft's kinda open world: mile wide, inch deep, ♥♥♥♥ all to really do. It's pretty to look and and trounce around in, but aside from wiping out wildlife and poachers, or delving into dangerous places for the next piece of fall fashion, going out into the world (aside from Hogsmeade and a handful of villages)...doesn't really do much for you unless you're looking for ingredients? But you  to go out there for a lot of the main quests which means less time at Hogwarts, an experience which was already fairly bare-bones to begin with without you literally absconding whenever you want and not giving a ♥♥♥♥ or getting punished for curfew breaking. I really think the game would have fared better with  far more focus on  and giving you certain locals to explores as the story calls for it.So to boil it all down: your characters feels groundless and improbable, pretty much a walking Mary Sue/Gary Stu/They-ry Glu, with no real motivation or stake in the story. 20+ hours in and the game still refuses to give even bread crumbs on the motivation of either antagonist, nor do you see them. No real distinction between ancient magic or regular magic, even with what little the game shows. No connections with any of the students outside of two of them, and it's pretty obvious who. Professors are amazing but your interactions with them are limited to serving the progression of the 'story' and getting more spells. The game literally requires you to go out of Hogwarts regularly, ignoring curfew, no real point in interacting with other classmates and no getting points for your house to my knowledge. The whole experience starts off really well and fizzles out over time as you realize that the story is flat, you've got no ties to it or the world, the Hogwarts experience is so accelerated and anemic, it feels like a  to everything else...and there's not  else to begin with. If I had to sum up my experience in a few words, it feels like I spent a lot of money on a wizard fashion and combat simulator with some very watered down plot. Which sucks, because I was genuinely excited for the game, and I really wanted to give it a chance. Maybe my opinion'll change as I get deeper in the game but I doubt the issues that have plagued this game for the first twenty three hours will suddenly improved over the next twenty three. I think I'd rather play Stixhaven or Kids on Brooms at this rate.I am definitely using this game for making character refs, though."

I have a 10850K, RTX-3090, and 32gb of RAM. I should be able to play this game fine, like all other games. in stead I have spent 4 days trying to tweak settings and get the frames stable. I can get what seems like ok stable frames rates, turn a corner and they tank to the upper 10's and 20's. I figured I would what for the day-1 patch before passing judgement or requesting a refund. My friends on PS5 are having a super smooth experience. I bought this game on steam so I could play it on steamdeck, since it's verified.....verified hot garbage!!!! on low setting with everything off and windowed 720p you are lucky to run at 30fps with frame dips everywhere.

I have made the character with the options that are currently available, but he is not as hairy as I would like him to be. He only has an afro, no beard at all. :(​And you may be thinking... ""The characters are school children, how could they possibly grow a beard? It wouldn't make any sense."" And to that I retort, I had a best friend in middle school named Anthony who had a full Mario mustache.​Sincerely,A sad, beardless Hogwarts student"

3118,Drake Ravenwolf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Drake0713/,2,,1,132.4,February,11,299,0,1,"I'd describe it as 3rd person Skyrim with almost Dark Souls style (ranged) combat assuming you play this on HARD, which you def should.  Even on HARD, it feels just a smidge too easy; I chose to do the Dueling quest without a companion which pits you against 4x other caster enemies and as long as you time your ""block"" spell correctly - you can do that without taking any damage at all.  Still fun gameplay imo, absolute LOADS of collectibles to explore and find and it's all kept track of so you know what you might be missingAs for the ""politically devisive"" aspects; the first time you meet the trans character it is very jarring - like why is this a thing?  And everyone always referring to you as ""They/them"" instead of he/she is def annoying, but if you ignore those aspects, I'd still recommend this game to anyone who likes the Harry Potter books or just likes this style of gameplay.PS there is a mod available if you want to actually play as a white person; the default ""whitest"" setting is still quite tan, and there is a reason everyone praises how attractive Professor Garlick is (all the other female npcs... aren't)Keep in mind; there are still loads of performance issues at the time of this writing.  Some people cannot see more than the epilepsy warning before crashing, others have constant stuttering issues, your mileage may vary, but I'd hope they'll all be fixed with some more patches"
3119,CEI Hero,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199069484090/,5,,0,58.9,February,15,23,0,0,"Playing on hard. This game starts out amazing. Its like watching a movie, but the combat is challenging, dynamic, fast paced, and addicting in a way that old hack and slash games used to be. Here's where it gets lame: The challenge burns out FAST. By level 19 I stopped picking up gear and looting chests because it was simply not needed in order to keep killing enemies. I stopped leveling things and unlocking spells because there was no need for my character to get stronger. Just to give it a foolproof test, I ran to the edge of the map. All of the edges. Which did not take me long, which was even more depressing. In all the land, I could not find a foe that I could not best, even in ""end game content"" areas, so to speak. This made the game hollow. Then I realized: there are only FOUR types of enemies. You read that right, 4. Bipedal humans (or other wizards and witches), giant frogs, giant spiders, trolls. After you learn their moves, you just breeze through any part of the map. Oh yeah and goblins. so 5. Anyway: 1.) Too easy2.) Small World Map3.) Needs more enemies 4.) Game too shortConcept is fantastic, whereas elden ring was a ""souls"" type game based off a popular book and movie franchise, hogwarts legacy is a ""scrolls"" type game based off a popular book and movie franchise. But they should have taken the PVE enemies more serious. That specific dynamic is the foundation of what keeps you advancing your character, ie: playing the game. And maybe I'm wrong about all this, but I shouldn't be able to sprint anywhere on the map and survive willy-nilly, when I just started the game a few days ago, so, there's my final point."

3125,Nyuu ♥,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nyuuuu/,3,,0,38.3,February,12,77,0,1,"Good game, lacking a bit of upgrades for spells / brooms and customization (not a lot of wand design, only a the handle can change) but not so much a big deal and it feels great.Although a reputation system would be a big+ aswell to avoid lockpicking or casting forbbiden spells infront of your teachers without any reaction.The story feels flat, I don't care about any characters, You don't feel like a student in 5th year (learning lumos in 5th year lmao) your house have no impact, classes are boring and useless, no house point system.. NPCs are idling in the castle without any interaction possible so in two words """" at all for me.Side quests are so bland go kill goblins / dark mages in a camp and done or press a button to resolve a puzzle and loot an item in a cave thats it.Loot have no sense, and is scaled on your current level so you should keep some chests if you want better stuff later... Legendary is a joke and you'll find plenty of ""legendary"" stuff, in fact so much you'll find yourself selling legendaries for some inventory spaces. There is no combo of items or themed sets of item giving some stat boost or any effect.The HP lore is underexploited, somethings are only mentioned for the nostaligia effect but there isn't many actual enemy creatures (no dementors :'( no pixies, no werewolf no gytrash etc )  Main enemies you'll encounter are And on top of that the game crash way too often (more than 15 times in 37h ) sometimes even in loading screens.. and yet I still wanted to launch it back to play the game.But one day a crash turned into a blue screen which is wayy more annyoing.. and still after a reboot I could still play the game. However the next day the game crash again with a blue screen but this time after rebooting my save was gone.. And that draws the line for me I'm not willing to invest 40 hours back into a game that will eventually crash 50 more times and erase my save without any warnings.Even after checking for files and retriving 2 files I guess it wasn't my save.Stability issues aside I still think it's a good game because I had some fun playing it while it lasted but it could've been WAAY better if they pushed it a bit further and a bit deeper plot- wise and not keeping it as simple as possible."

Hogwarts is incredibly beautiful and the surrounding area is rather large.Been looking forward to being a student at Hogwarts? I have, for literally more than 2 decades. This one still disappoints. Your first potion making class is a press-the-right-button-cutscene.. Your undercover dueling club is a infinite tries, and then everybody becomes extremely impressed when you suceed at your 10th try, like you are the god of dueling. And the difficulty is scaled by adding 4 people to fight you, so a ""duel"" is you vs 4 other people, you can bring a friend if you want. But somehow they always outnumber you. Fighting, it looks pretty and feels OK at best, and fighting is clearly the most developed of the game mechanics in the game.The broomstick flying is horrendous - Both on gamepad and key/mouse, the controls are terrible, they can not be changed on gamepad and only a few of them can be changed on M/K. And there's a lot of invisible walls, want to go through those cool little archways in the bridge? Too bad, not allowed. Want to do some cool diving maneuvers, well the game will make sure you only angle to about 45 degrees downwards, because more would be.. fun?They could have done so much with this great set, but they seemed to have spent too long on overscoping instead of nailing some core game features.Immersive roleplaying experience? Not really, unless you love waypoint markers telling you where to go exactly instead of actually looking around and exploring the world. And if you want to play without the waypoint markers, good luck then. Just after you arrive at Hogwarts, Professor Fig will send you an owl (read: you will get a voice message like you had a cell phone or something) telling you to come to his office. With 0 explanation of where that'd be and no options to ask anyone. The game assumes you play with waypoints on, it does not assume you want to actually explore by yourself. My character keeps talking to himself like some crazy guy. And it gets repetitive.This game has A LOT of issues, and yet it's so beautiful, it sort of makes me sad that I don't want to spend more time in this pretty game. 2 years more development time, maybe it would have been great. As it is, it's decent at best."

I will 100% miss things but I will include what sticks out the most to me this second.OVERALL: 9/10, well worth $60 even if you don't like HP, just as a fantasy open-world RPG. I have enjoyed every one of the 20, then 30, now 40 hours spent in this game and I mainly went side-questing and exploring instead of story.As an aside I play on ""Hard"" difficulty and am on my first run as a Slytherin.======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======CATEGORIES: Steam Deck experience, PC Experience (combat, bugs, visuals, favorites, complaints)======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======Steam Deck Experience: Probably about 5 of my hours so far, controls were very easy to adapt to from PC, ran extremely smoothly and had no Deck-specific complaints. Especially with this being a single player non-internet game I can easily imagine this being my go-to Steam Deck game.======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======PC Experience:     Combat: Very early in the tutorial you are shown how to fight, block, and do basic attacks. Easy to learn, and a nice introduction. As you progress and learn more spells, blue bar special moves (not specified for spoiler reasons), shielding/cursing, and environment interactions, combat goes from ""spam my favorite chain"" to ""pay attention, play to your strengths, and exploit weaknesses"". Personally, I struggled against specific bosses and Battle Arenas which only increased my enjoyment compared to the small encounters I quickly overcame. Fights that took me two or three tries, pouring out my inventory to turn the tide had me ecstatic to earn a victory.     I am also usually extremely bad at stealth options in games but this works exceptionally well. I can clear entire camps without being detected or at least make a hard fight more in my favor by taking some out beforehand. Even ""Infamous Foes"" could go down with no effort with a well-executed assassination.Pros:- Easy to learn, hard to master. Play ""Story"" difficulty if you really don't like it, I love it.- You fight how you want. I intended on not using Plants or Potions but then discovered how useful they are. How your spells interact are up to your casting order.- Dark Arts are completely your choice, and while they are exceptionally powerful the recharge time makes up for it.- Enemies scale. I massively over leveled doing side quests where at Level 30 (out of 40) I was doing Level 12 Main Quests. Enemies were still either 20ish for easy or 34ish for more difficult encounters. Amazing.Cons:- Ran into some issues with Advanced Dodge Roll when bosses would attack where I would get hit anyway. Annoying but a learning moment.- Hard is hard. Less reaction time, more aggressive spells,  hits hurt more. I'm often chugging Health Potions since most hits take >2/3 of your HP. Again, other difficulties are available.[Again, this is all I can think of at the moment. Play for yourself]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======Bugs: Pros:- Personally experienced 0 crashes, and all bugs have been visual- Places I think I've been softlocked the game teleports you to last safe ground so no reload or reset requiredCons:- You'd have to visit others reviews, personally no issues.======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======Visuals:I did upgrade my PC purely to place this game, but wow are the visuals worth it. I was so happy Graphics defaulted to Ultra. The lighting is fabulous, moving inside-outside or vice versa transitions very smoothly.Pros:- Spell effects, character details, environment effects, everything is gorgeous- Smooth transitions- Seasonal changes are especially beautiful (snow, autumnal colors, etc)Cons:- Hardware intensive- Seriously don't blow up your PC======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======Favorites: I mentioned I spent most of my time side-questing. That means I was so content just exploring, flying around, gathering materials, doing puzzles, etc etc I didn't mind not doing the main plot. One of my favorite parts was when I fought a bandit camp higher level than what I should've been near and was able to beat it with some careful planning and executions.The ""base of operations"" in this game is exceptionally well done in my opinion. The resources are easy to gather for the ones in the world, and while initially expensive to make local harvesters the rewards easily pay it off in the future. ""Rescuing"", taming, and farming beasts is also exceptionally rewarding.Enemy Encyclopedia is especially helpful detailing often uncommon ways to beat enemies, or how to weaken them for more damage.Open Exploration, the world is very large and fast travel is easy. Broom flight is fairly early on and the other mounts later but they all have their perks. Also there's so many different brooms to choose from.Character Customization / Equipment: There are SO MANY options to discover for outfit parts, and the ""equip for stats, vanity for looks"" method is perfect. If we just go off equipment, my character looks absolutely goofy all the time, but instead I was a full-plate Knight in a green Snake scarf running around fighting bad guys. Equip for stats, pick your vanity, sell the rest, rinse and repeat.""Morality"": Obviously outside of Dark Arts or Not usage, most of the time on Quest turn-in there are 3 options:1. ""I did X thing, have a nice day"" (Positive)2. ""X was really tough, can I get a reward?"" (Positive still, but more money)3. ""X is mine now."" (Negative, STILL GET NORMAL REWARD)It was very entertaining the first time I refused to tell someone how to solve something they found and told me about, then later heard them complain I was insufferable. Great NPC interaction with no real consequence.Or choosing NOT to learn the Unforgiveables really has no downside outside of your preference.======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======Complaints:  Again, specific things I can think of right now.- Gear slots are so small, even with expansion over time it is a little annoying to be mid-quest and see ""gear slots are full""- Common repeating voice lines. ""Seems like every road leads to Hogsmeade"" ""You cannot IMAGINE how inconvenient travel was before I invented Floo Powder!"" - You have to minigame pick every lock even as you upgrade the skill for higher ones. Just let me auto-unlock the lesser ones if I'm at a high level already.======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======[]======So yeah that is my review currently. Thanks for reading, I tried to organize it. This is definitely my longest review ever but with how long people hoped this game was good and how excited I am to play it, it is well deserved.Make your own opinions and drink water :)"

Probably because I was a original a HP reader since 1997, I dreamed about being invited by Hogwarts by the age of 10-11, and I was so sad that I wasn't the chosen one. Now a got a second chance to enter my childhood dream2. Not that hard to fight actually, tho I really need to think about the skill set before going into any fights.3. The main storyline is ok but not that super interesting... The real deal is to explore the school. Several facts I'm not satisfied with this game:1. I would argue about the faces a bit... anyway i can go with mods, nvm2. Not able to change controller key binding, re-training is painful and unhelpful3. Map is complicated I understand, magic school afterall.

There are some moments of graphics clunkiness, but not to become an issue and overall it is a pleasure to explore. Combat is surprisingly complex with the initial impression of being simple.

3158,Liefde,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zmfg/,2,,0,16.5,February,15,183,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is more an interactive lightnovel, than a game. You're a character in an open map that's filled with fetch quests, mini-games and things to kill/collect.There's little to no player agency & the world doesn't really react to you, in fact, aside from cutscenes, mini-games and combat; you'll basically not exist to the outside world.You're barely in class and the classes you do take are cutscenes that you watch in order to deliver your fetch quests.Gear is inconsequential as are most RPG mechanics in the game.The story itself is alright, but nothing mindblowing. It's the standard: You're a special chosen one who can do special things no one else can. Great world, but I'd hesitate to call it a game. My recommendation is to only buy when discounted."
3159,Jose Ternel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tehmarik/,2,,0,24.1,March,8,273,0,1,"As much as I like the aesthetic of the game and the re-creation of Hogwarts and surroundings, the gameplay is stale, with a combat system that could've been much better but is under-exploited, the set of enemies is very limited and they have features that are not so distinctive, but above all the open-world content is dull and stale. I would still recommend the game to a fan of the Harry Potter franchise, but not at full price, far from it, and I would strongly advise not to target 100% and to skip the open world content. Some quests are fun, character interactions is ok-ish (however the constant praising of the player pretty much for doing nothing is annoying), and the story, although I have not completed it yet, seems ok so far, but not great. Overall, it could have been a good game, instead its a mediocre or below average game in a well-done Harry Potter universe, which makes it ""passable"" at best."

3169,Skairen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Skairen/,1,,0,19.5,February,16,"1,231",0,1,"I have completed the story 14 missions total, several of them with some blocks that forced me to complete secondary content. While most people had terrible performance and is true that in my case I also had bad moments with it, I was able to complete it in 19h.Honestly the story is quite simple, the stakes are there but it really doesn't feel good and every dialogue choice doesn't really matter on the development of the main story only how the individual dialogue develops.Performance is even after the patch, not great. I had big stretches where I was able to play at 60 fps at 3440x1440 (ultrawide) with most settings at ultra, a few on high and DLSS at quality. But i had several drops to the 40fps and many to the 50-55fps with quick recovery. I believe most developers nowadays are trusting in technologies like DLSS and FSR to carry them the rest of they way and skip on optimisation. Sadly this is not the way in my honest opinion as a developer myself.The game clearly needed more thought and time. We know the first impression is important and this game is only selling because the IP it carries. It is fun to play for a bit, it makes feel like a wizard yes, but sadly it becomes monotonous towards the middle and is just tedious towards the end. Cooldowns in this case are more annoying than anything else, you base damage can be improved but towards the end many big enemies take forever to take down without the actual spells. Some missions have spells requirements which I understand as they are needed for completing certain sections but level requirements are useless on the easier difficulties. I can easily deal with a dozen enemies 1 or 2 levels above me and it won't matter. At least if your spells and attacks are combined right and your are playing on the easiest difficulty.Again, the game is not bad. I really don't care about the drama about JK. I don't care about seeing more black people. I don't care the sexuality some characters.  I care about the work and this work is currently average for me and for many people is quite unplayable. So no. I don't recommend it. Wait until the performance is fixed and it is on sale. Perhaps then you will be able to enjoy it better."

Nothing less. Everything you're familiar with the books or films appear here.Basically, you ARE Harry Potter, under different identity (name/appearance/house of your choice). You ARE the chosen one w/ the special power. Start the predetermined journey on the first semester at Hogwarts. Disobeyed school's rules and uncover secrets. Have epic fights w/ bad guys and save the day. Then sum it up by the headmaster of the school at end of year ceremony (with a house win).It's not a bad format... but after like two decades of this story-telling, I already have enough.Instead of the same final epic story, where every player walk the same path to the same conclusion (well, not the same, you are presented with a choice to finally be a bad guy or a good guy in the finale quest 🤷‍♀️). Why not let player craft their own unique story? Not unique like just selecting a unique wand. But the whole experience. Which class to spent a lot of time to master (let the player build a character whose never cast spell, but rely on plant alone, for example). Which quest to take in order or just simply skip it entirely to find another way around . ETC.Why not just let the player be a normal Hogwarts student, experiencing the school in the way they like, have a personal experience with their time in the school.---Gameplay-wise, admittedly it is a fun experience for like the first 10 hours, but after that it just chores of unended unfun prolonged quests.Quests are super linear. Walk from this too that in almost straight path. Do some actions. Watch cut-scenes. Rinse and repeat. Puzzles along the way are mindlessly simple. Optional pickups are tiresome to pick since they're hidden behind narrow walls that force you to go slow (very cheap trick I'd say).Also, the game is NOT an open-world like it advertised. Wanna explore on your own? Here's a level 3 door lock that you won't learn how to unlock until doing some chores that take 3 hours IRL. Wanna go ""Pokémon"" all those magical beast? This one won't spawn until a very late main quest, despite you've found its nest. (if you want the true open-world experience, just go play Zelda BOTW!)Most important of all. There's no consistency with the lore! Hogwarts forbid students to wander around in the castle at night. But you can just go anywhere anytime without the fear of being spotted. Wizarding World condemn those who dare to cast Unforgivable Curses. However you can Abracadabra everywhere without any penalty.Sigh...It's not really a  game, at least that's something you can expect from AAA studios. But it is, at most, on par w/ the previously existing books/films/games in the franchise.Holding hand, I'd say that. Like watching a movie with interaction. While it's might be fun for some people, this is just not work for me."

You cannot take any companions with you on a quest or to just wander around Hogwarts similarly to what Skyrim and Fallout offers, nor you will have some sort of friendly gathering. Like in DA:I, for instance, when Varrik and Bull encourage you to spend time with your friends and this leads to playing games and friendly bartering. Surely a game about a school full of young wizards would have to offer something like that?Professor Garlick said that the friends you get in Hogwarts stick for life, and yet I found myself feeling even more alone than I thought I would, because my MC did not get any friends - just random quests from the NPC's who forget about my existence after the quest is done.That being said, the world that we get to play in is phenomenal and feels extremely nostalgic.

I picked it up because I saw someone play a short while, and whilst I thought the carriage with no horses was a glitch and facepalmed thinking we had another cyberpunk on our hands, and then you see a death and they appear, Thestrals. That's all it took. After so long, seeing so many beloved franchises slaughtered, every year a new saints row, Rings of Power or Velma. Finally a development team that knows it's IP and sticks to the source material. I'm glad I did, the world is beautiful, it might eventually fall into the same activities most open world games do to pad out their map, but it actually felt interesting and looked damned good doing it and whilst the story isn't revolutionary it was passable and the exploration was enough to keep my interest.I Might not have gave a damn about the circumstances surrounding it, but now?Justice for the Kettle and the wolf."

If you are a fan of the wizarding world, then this is a game for you. However if you just want to play a fun open world game, don't get this, while it's a solid game there isn't much to interact with outside of missions, yes you can explore hogwarts, hogsmead, etc... however most interactions will be with shop owners, professors, and the occasional student when a quest requires it. Story wise (the reason I play games) it lacks depth, outside of the few side quests with fellow students (the main trio) there really isn't any point to the rest of the quests. All the main quests feel like fetch quests, with the exception of one...Yes most missions require combat, but that's somewhat repetitive, and clunky even on a controller; most of the puzzles in the game are simple, over too quick, not to mention that the PC will give you hints non stop after about 30 seconds to a minute.by the end of the game I just wanted to be done, even with the pet breeding, flight, exploration, combat etc...It felt like a slog.TLDR: Decent game, needed more features, lacks much needed depth to both gameplay and story"

The combat is nice and the world these developers created is simply amazing! I will give this game a 9/10. This game would be perfect if it had a morality system and if you could interact with npcs. It would be amazing to see students actually go to their dorms to sleep instead of just simply vanishing during the night and also perfects guarding the school. If there are plans for a dlc then I would love to see something involving the goblet of fire or dementors. Overall I enjoy this game and I can't recommend it enough.

Well, so far, Hogwarts Legacy is both a really fun RPG and a complete game on release, who'd have thunk it?. Having a great time with this and i plan on taking me sweet time over it. One thing I love, for instance, is the fact I could be en route to a quest when I will spot something else and off I go on another tangent, so much to see, do and collect.  A beautiful game.

The mechanics are fun and interesting, the spells are responsive and fun. The game world seems huge with a lot of fun puzzles to solve, characters to meet, and sidequests for days.

Hogwarts School itself is a masterpiece and a pleasure to explore. The characters feel real enough and not too caricatured, and the main story line is engaging and fun to play through.Where it misses the mark is that you don't feel like a student at Hogwarts. You don't really attend and significant classes or feel like you're actually in school, so you can't really fulfil that fantasy we all had of getting that letter and being whisked off to be a witch/wizard.That aside, I can't not recommend it.

So what exactly makes this game so great? Well, I have to start with the gameplay. Set in the 1800s in England, it embraces diversity thatOne should be constantly aware of. In this case, there are so many quests and side missions,Many different kinds of quests, from side quests to relationship quests, all told we're talking...Eighty-some gigabytes and there are over 100 quests to keep you engrossed for a long timeNever be caught without the correct spell combinations. You should have at least 1 attack, 1 focus and 1 summoning spell.Action is first and foremost, I love the spells and the ability to cast them, but Really, I don't see what all the fuss is about, I can see why 1.3 million people have streamedEvery time I play it, I feel like there's one more quest, then I see 4 hours have passed. Meticulous is the design of the game, You can pet cats and protect yourself from trolls. Exciting, intense and graphically awesome, I feel this game is one of the best of 2023None of it matters without game play, and I find some of the items hard to find but have fun. Forty-one percent of the time you will feel like you're struggling and it makes you better!Often I found myself having to double back to complete a quest but then I get a new spell.Really, the best ones are the unforgivable curses and the attack spells, the truth isEvery time I see my player scream a name, I kinda wish I was doing it myself, to be honest.Variety, I love how the shields need certain spells to dispel.Enchantments just require proper timing like Quicktime movies. The game is a classic and IRecommend picking up at least 2 copies, one for you and one for your friends. :)Review score: 41/10"
3205,Ophelia,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Andr4geo/,157,17,0,72.4,February,14,288,24,1,"I just finished the game after +50 hours and here is my thoughts:The game is well designed in the sense that the environment looks amazing. However, I was expecting this game to be a more ""choose your own story"" adventure game.I would've preferred if you started from year 1 in Hogwarts and could make something of yourself i.e, becoming a dark wizard or going into the ministry or stay as professor at Hogwarts, your choice of ending. But this provides none of that. Instead, you are thrown into a set linear story path that you cannot divert from. I dont get the experience of studying in a school, but only playing a normal Open World game with magic school as the background. There is no routine in this school, you dont take class unless the quest asks you to; you only sleep on the floor when waiting for someone; you dont eat food; you dont actually make friends at your own will (collect different teammates will be so much fun); there is no actual difference or competition between colleges.so much more could have been done. I am just disappointed.The main draw of the game, Hogwarts, is both a blessing and a curse. The animations of the stairs building, ghosts popping in and out, and the joyful music playing are probably the best parts of the game. That's all there is to it however, It just looks good. You cannot interact with any of the students The only option is to walk around, observe, and eat an apple.The only other game I played set in an environment like this was Bully, and that game offered way more freedom than the developers here have allowed. It's hard to immerse yourself when you're pretty much watching a movie about your character, rather than actually playing as them.and side quests is just... look like they here by forcethey were so casual, like ""go collect ..."" or ""go find ..."" etc.and the fun thing is, the game has only 26 spells. Yes, you reading that right, only 26 and you can only equip 4  spells at the same timethe animations is great, i cant deny that ... the way of dangling the wand, the shape of the cape, the magic ... they looks amazing. but when looking at a game like elden ring who has 150 spells, and the game isnt only a wizard game...they could have been so much more doneskyrim even has speels than over +150, and just like elden ring, that game has much more than just magic.i dont really know if my expectations were high about this game but ..im about to tell you much more bad sides of the game1) Boring premise of the main story - yet another ""you're a wizard"" moment where you're that rare kid with super powers that very few others have. I wish it was more grounded with you being a regular student who got him/herself into trouble with friends and now are trying to solve things you may have ruined to begin with.2) ""Loading doors"" (one of the most annoying problems)  I can't enter a different location for a few seconds as the location itself is being loaded and thus the door won't open right away.3) Cutscenes. Feels very rushed. Some cutscenes are short, some characters reply without any expression or care. Classes last for a few minutes and it's always you doing things. Learn a spell. Click click. Voila, class is over lads. It feels that devs put a lot of effort in re-creating the environment and then they were told: ""Yo, you have 1 month to release the game"".4) Population - while the game has day/night cycle, I don't see students & teachers going to their beds in the evening. Location ""despawns"" populus behind your back. You can be semi-afk staring at a beautiful painting playing a nice melody and suddenly, location is empty because its night. You look around once more, its full again as its morning. But you don't see them coming downstairs or upstairs, they just appear. Its this odd feeling when world is sort of alive but it isnt. Feels more like a checkbox to me at times.and agin im going to say ;Words can't describe how disappointed I am in this game. This was advertised as ""make your own path"" kind of game, yet it can't be further away from the truth. There is one path, and it's the one the game gives you. There is no becoming a death-eater, or a being universal... you're just the character the game tells you to be.The whole game is lifeless, NPCs don't react to anything you do, you can talk to some of them but that's it. You can go around casting spells, no one will even look at you or react the slightest. You can go and enter people's house after forcing their locks, go through their chests, they won't say or do a thing, they just act like you're not even there.Most of the time you can't jump to places, invisible walls everywhere, making exploration very linear and flavorless. Combat is fun, but I'm still looking for difficulty. Basically entered one of the most dangerous places, the Forbidden Forest, after 2 hours playing and defeated everything that came my way without breaking a sweat, there is no real danger or even sense of danger, and of course you can't attack centors, because yeah... you're not a bad person, so the game won't let you do bad things.You can fly on a broom, and again, no sensation or feeling of speed, you can go into an obstacle at full speed and you will just stop, no impact, no animation, nothing. You just stop like it's okay to ram into a wall.The only decent thing about the game so far is the story. It's well designed, for now, but there is not much choices or decisions to take, and the only few really don't change anything to the story... you just go with it and follow the game's lead. It's basically a playable cinematic.one more thing about the quests:An adult woman, about in her 30s-to-40s from the looks of it, is asking the main character to “follow the butterflies” into the Forbidden Forest, because she’s interested where they lead and is herself scared of going into the Forest because… of her Hogwarts background. The teachers told her that Forbidden Forest is off limits to students because there is a lot of dangerous stuff there that will get her killed as students are not yet prepared to deal with it.Let me emphasize. A grown woman who studied at Hogwarts and knows for a fact that entering the forest is forbidden to students and is scared to go there because she doesn’t want to get killed by dangerous stuff out there… asks a Hogwarts student to go into Forbidden Forest. Not because she’s desperate, not because this is a matter of life and death to her… but because she is curious where the butterflies fly off to. Unbelievable.She’s not the only one who will ask the main character, a Hogwarts student, to do stuff that is in direct violation of Hogwarts rules in a way that doesn’t even imply that it would be breaking the rules. Quests like that are everywhere in the game.The characters will ask you, a Hogwarts student, to kill deadly Acromatulas, collect stuff in the Forbidden Forest or take on a camp full of dark wizards without even remembering that they are talking to a student. Even teachers will do that. But then when we need to go to the restricted section of the Library, suddenly the rules are in place again and you have to sneak around the librarian lest she tells on you to the headmaster.I just returned from butchering an entire village worth of dark wizards and I’m being threatened to be told on to the headmaster?i will re-play the game all over agin and hope at least some of the mechanics will change.. (probably it will not but i'll give it a shot.)"
3206,alastair21,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024667462/,3,,1,25.2,February,18,223,0,1,"This game is cinematic and immersive. Visually impressive, even on medium graphics settings. It is very story driven and parts of it, particularly early on, make you feel like you are playing a movie as much as a game. However as you progress on a bit more classic RPG elements enter in with more freedom to wander around and do things at your own place, or to follow the story(s) as you chose. Well worth a play if you like single player RPG's, regardless of how much of a harry potter fan you may be. But for those that are, there is plenty of attention to detail."
3207,Xzenon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thexzenon/,2,,0,82.8,March,5,506,0,1,"If you like the Harry Potter universe, then you should play it. It's the third best game after Chamber of Secrets and Philosopher's Stone. Otherwise, maybe wait for a 50%+ sale or skip it altogether. Pretty self-explanatory People like to complain about the performance for some reason. Except for Hogsmeade where you don't spend a lot of time, the game runs great (4K Ultra w/o RTX with a 3080 at 100+ fps). At the beginning of the game you find a lot of different puzzles in the castle and also run into known elements and locations from the books/movies. If you're a HP fan, you're going to love the first hours spent exploring in the castle. It's pretty bad. You keep doing some trials for the Keepers, because they don't trust you. Meanwhile, the villains are just chilling and doing whatever they want. After you solve all trials (and start to sympathise with the woman that disagreed with the Keepers) you get a series of arena-like fights and the game ends. There are a lot of NPCs, but you can't interact with them. You can't even talk with your friends outside of their repsecitve questlines. You have loads of Merlin trials and empty treasure vaults. The castle provides the most content and you'll exit it pretty quickly (maybe after 1/3 into the main questline). You get a couple of interesting minigames like the Accio one and the duels, but you can only play them during the sidequests, you can't replay them whenever you want later on. There are close to a hundred Merlin trials and there are 4-5 different types of trials, so it gets boring really fast. In addition to this, most treasure vaults just make you fetch a cube to the entrance and that's it. Pretty obvious complaint, not sure what the hell the devs were thinking. There are a few exceptions such as Natsai and Sebastian, but the other voice acting is pretty bad. The voice line choices are also pretty weird in some cases, such as when you enter an empty treasure vault and the main character says they must be careful, because it's a dangerous vault (they might die of boredom). Everything about this spell is dumb. You learn most destructive spells before Alohomora; you can even learn the unforgivable curses before getting to Alohomora level 3. Even after maxing the spell, you still have that annoying mini game. There are far too many spells you have to cycle through and you can use at most 16 spells at a time, meaning you either use a couple of slots for utility spells and give up on some damage spells, or you have to keep switching utility spells and keep all the damage spells available REVELIO REVELIO REVELIO REVELIO REVELIO"

It has everything you could want in a open world game including but not limited to exploration of a vast open world of massive scale, a pet & mounts system including flying mounts, fast travel for when you don't feel like taking ages to get to places you have already been before, epic magic spell casting battles, crafting system that is actually fun, the choice to leave main quests to just journey around the map doing random encounters & fighting monsters, and the list goes on! Extremely fun with fast easy to learn spells, & potion usage! The combat system is brilliant, and very fun too!Yes there are world boss monsters to encounter, but also lots of lessor creatures to do combat with including stuff like zombies, giant spiders, giant riverside reptiles, and much more to discover. The pet system is amazing too, the game turns into Hogwarts Pokemon once you unlock the ability to go out and actually capture beasts to add to your collection of pets! Besides flying on a magical broomstick like in the films, you can unlock flying beast mounts as well later on! I could say more but I am still finding new things in game myself even after 56 hours in thus far, & excited to continue my adventures for a long time to come! :DI recommend this to anyone no matter if a Harry Potter fan or not. If you love fantasy open world games that give a true sense of freedom of exploration, and to play it how you want your way.. Grab Hogwarts Legacy today, you will not regret it!NOTE: Be warned though, this may not play well on a Potato PC, & or low end laptop so be sure before buying this you have a decent rig. LOL It's a beautiful game, & needs those extra graphics, plus 16 to 32 ram to fully shine! :D Oh, & for that extra quick load time when needed run on an SSD. Cool thing is most of the game you won't be dealing with load screens in open world.. Only small quick load screens hidden as doors and such will be found within the halls of Hogwarts sometimes. :)"

Graphically, even on lower settings it's a beautiful game. By far one of the most visually stunning games I've seen. VA work is sadly not as good being a bit hit and miss. Sirona the trans barkeep is just terrible. What's worse is that it was done as clear pandering, as all the other languages she's voiced by women. A few other characters are also a bit meh, but none really grating on the ears. The music is pretty par for this type of game. Nothing overly spectacular but nothing cringe worthy. Story, again pretty par for a Harry Potter story. I enjoyed it, but there were no moments of being blown away. It's a solid story, but nothing special. I do however wish the leveling up was more open. They male it clear early on the only way to really get EXP is from the story missions, which sadly means there's no real reward for exploration. Also regrettably there's no replay ability to the game, its a one and done. Even playing through as different houses doesn't make major changes. I Hope they do some dlc that expands past the story, though not really sure how that would work. I would like to see either a update or something that would make the classes more interactive, and add some coop."

The latest issue is that my gf's saves and mine require tricking the game into remembering your save data and I was able to recover my character through doing a maneuver with the appdata while in-game. Obviously the worst is the random lag spikes that can drop you as low as 14 fps in one instance. I might've missed it going to but damn it's a pain, and really jarring to the otherwise wonderful experience of the game. DO NOT BUY NOW -- BUY LATER If you're not already playing it and on the fence, please wait for a patch, the game would be much better after patch unless you want to configure your pc to handle this memory leak of a game.

3230,Smartik1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Smartik1/,4,,0,64.7,February,27,255,0,1,"Can't recommend it in the current state. Whatever fun I could have is constantly undermined by the performance issues and design choices.- Stuttering / low FPS - Even with RTX 3080, 5900X, 32 GB RAM and running off of m.2 SSD the game keeps dropping from 100 FPS to 4-13 FPS all the time (easily lasting 20-30 seconds at a time). The stuttering is really noticeable every time it kicks in, including during cutscenes. This is without ray tracing and with DLSS enabled.- Menus / notifications - The menu system is a nightmare. There are dozens of menus and submenus with slow animations and transitions for every click you make. Every couple of seconds (literally) the game generates new notifications within these many submenus and bothers you with them until you go inside and mouse over everything that is new. You find yourself constantly having to go in to tick these things off across the various menus and sub-menus. You can't directly access the main settings page with save/load either, it is one of the many sub-menus.- Revelio - Leveling in this game is gated behind uncovering codex entries, which are invisible until you reveal them with this short range short duration spell. Guess what you will spend the whole game doing. That's right, endlessly having to cast this every few steps.- Gear slot limits - Someone though it would be super fun to not introduce the limits in advance. Because of how fragmented the menu screens are and how they are structured (no common inventory, each body part has its own screen), it doesn't look like there is a restriction. They then send you on an instanced story mission with at least 7 pieces of equipment in treasure chests (every chest only has 1 item) you can't loot, because every step of the way you get a ""your gear slots are full"" notification"". Very helpful.Besides the terrible performance, a lot of the design choices are there solely to arbitrarily inflate play time. I'd much prefer a shorter game that actually lets me play it without arbitrarily slowing it down with animations and repetition."

3233,The Darius,https://steamcommunity.com/id/the-darius/,4,,0,228.6,March,13,477,0,1,"The game is very poorly optimised to run in even the best graphics cards out there. Running on a 6-core i7, 32 GB RAM and an RTX 3090, the game needs to be upscaled from a 33% resolution with low settings on ray-tracing or, else, it just crashes out. I cannot use a second monitor, or it crashes out. I cannot keep my windows resolution on 4K or it crashes too in 4K or the game remains windowed if desired at 1440p (as there is no fullscreen option, only windowed fullscreen). Streaming it over discord makes it crash too. Guess what having a web browser running in the background does too...The story is good but it is tiring to get woke crap shoved down the throat by constantly referring to characters by they/them or the excessive diversity being pushed that is completely out of historical place as well as being inappropriate for underage players. It was also tiring to constantly being reminded that JK Rowling was excluded from the story design (even though the fine print says that her team was involved). Virtue signalling at its finest.And, yes, the game is aimed at underage players: when you create an account online to play for the first time, the only age options are ""under 7"", ""over 21"" or an individual option for each age between 7 and 21. However, the game has content that is not adequate for young children.The animations are poor, they are constantly repeated throughout the storyline and, after 2 hours of playing, everything is repeated endlessly. NPCs are terribly dumb and constantly get stuck in awful animation and/or dialogue loops, they never react to your presence (not even when you casually get into their houses and steal their belongings). There are 4 different faces and accents in NPCs (either background or mission characters) and they are stiffer than a marble sandwich, lacking in expression except for frowning and bobbing their heads.In comparison, GTA V, which came out 10 years earlier, has 100 times the amount of NPC dialogue, 10 times better facial expressions and body movement, a much more refined clothing interaction (whereas in Hogwarts Legacy people's robes glitch forwards and stiff through people's legs as if it were an elephant trunk) and incredibly more immersive cinematics and mission dialogues.Clothing options are very limited, character customisation is a farce as you will always end up with 4 different possible variations and very tiny variations on top of them. Inventory management is very badly designed, vendor UI is disastrous, looting items is a joke and needing to identify gear in a completely different map location from where vendors are located is a pain.The game was clearly designed by people who had never played an RPG (or any games, for that matter) in their lives and simply tried (and failed) to constantly reinvent the wheel in every aspect possible. As an example, in even the most mediocre RPG out there you can sell items to a vendor by simply browsing with arrows and Enter, or by clicking/right-clicking, etc. Some even include a ""sell all"" option. If you accidentally sell an item you didn't want to, you can rebuy it (sometimes at the same price, sometimes more expensive, but you can always get it back). Borderlands even includes the option to lock items from being accidentally sold if you so wish. In HL you have to hold click for about 3 seconds to sell each item. And then it's gone forever. Because except for 2 (yes, actually two) vendors, they all continue to sell the same items from level 1. This is clearly a vestige from console, but it is still poor design even for consoles.Enemies are either spiders (small, large or boss), goblins, humans (either poachers or animagi), trolls, inferi or dugbogs. The different variants simply have different HP or different attack patterns. Some missions put you face to face with magical stone guardians, but you only encounter them a handful of times. In comparison, Diablo 1 (from 1996) has 18 different base enemies. Diablo 2 (from 2000) has 65. Borderlands 1 (2009) has over 25. And Dark Souls 1 (2011) has dozens.There is very little content after beating the main story other than finding all the merlin trials for a Steam achievement (because there is no in-game reward for finding all of them, the last reward comes after finding a few dozens of them).Except for a few cinematics, every single mission dialogue is in a static stance like the pesky episodic interactive adventures like Minecraft Story where you simply choose from 2 or 3 dialogue options and there is no impact on the story whatsoever, other than learning the 3 unforgivable curses. Granted, you may earn a few extra coins by asking a reward but nothing else.There is erased content that has been exclusively made available to console peasants even though Steam customers are charged the full list price. Allegedly, the content will be made available to PC players in the future but who knows if it will be in a month, six, a year or 10? We are not talking about a unique skin or similar: PlayStation customers are given an extra potion (to reveal world chests in the map), an extra mission, an extra dungeon, an extra town location and the ability to own a shop. Simultaneously, the game is constantly teasing us about Quidditch, which has conveniently been left out of the game so devs didn't have to go through the ""nightmare"" (¬.¬) of coding in the ruleset or testing it. All the while, giving us sad little minigames which are 2 minutes away from being a bejeweld/candy crush copycat. The dark arts hat is purchasable but only through a bundle, as it has been unlisted as a separate item: for some reason devs even have an issue with selling stuff to their customers if not through some histerical, picky means.Last but not least, the game art is wonderful and the love for the franchise by the artists can be seen. Hogwarts is wonderfully recreated and the surrounding world is breathtaking to behold. But the devs made them no justice by releasing such a broken, buggy, glitchy, untested, pathetic and inexcusable ""game"". Unsolvable puzzles because pieces keep falling out of the world, pouches of coins that fall through the objects and become inaccessible, annoying camera mechanics that impede you from admiring an environment (cannot look up or down during flight, cannot look around properly in small rooms or tight hallways), awful combat mechanics and over-simplified spell usage in order to cater to primitive console gamepads, unrewarding world exploration, hollow side quests aimed at children under 10, a terrible use of NPC vendors, labyrinthine and convoluted dungeon/map/castle design combined with a useless minimap that cannot be forced to remain north-up or made to zoom in/out (forcing you to wander a cave you cleared for ages until you find your way out), a lack of a menu map to, at least, primitively navigate an area (the world map gives you a general overview only) and a spell to reveal all secrets, lootables, etc which ironcally contradicts the difficult navigation simulator. The list goes on and on. Not even the anglicised pseudo-Latin pronunciation of spells makes any sense (Accio is pronounced Ack-yo as in old Latin, Incendio is pronounced In-send-yo as in modern Spanish), as well as the obnoxiously sad magic that is provided to the player (whereas supposedly lower level witches and wizards are able to cast amazing spells like it's nothing).Do not confuse the love for the Harry Potter/Hogwarts world with the overwhelmingly positive reviews this game is being given as if it were a masterpiece. It is an abhorrent abomination that does not belong on either its price range, its franchise or 2023. It is a rushed beta that has been poorly ported to PC. Steer away from this game."

Can hardly be considered a real RPG experience, the few choices you make have no impact and hold no weight. Part of the magic for me of Hogwarts and the Harry Potter universe are the friendships in the books and movies, companions essentially. You can forget about that in this game, a ridiculously small number of characters will send you a letter via an owl for a mission and then you go do it with them only for it to be mentioned maybe once or twice more at some point in the game. Pretty sad, if this was delivered through any other IP it would be considered a massive letdown, the only thing this game has going for it is the universe created by JK Rowling."

Either you use curses or not...-Choices of dialogue have virtually no consequences-Character customization is not really up to other AAA standards-Feels like the character has no agency, or rather, you have no agency over your character's development (i.e. forces you to work together with annoying classmates from other houses)-obscene amounts of panderingA lot of interesting frameworks created but there's no real follow-through to make them great.Overall feels like wasted potential and becomes stale quickly."

This is the RPG Harry Potter fans have been waiting for. The map is extensive, reaching far beyond Hogwards and Hogsmeade, and you can learn a great deal of spells which have plenty of roles and uses in and out of combat. Additionally, there are many in-game armor items which can be customized to look like any armor item you have ever collected. For example, if there is a hat that has really good stats but looks ugly, you can ""customize appearance"" and have the ugly hat look like any other hat, regardless of if it is still in your inventory. There are many side quests that are more than your typical ""fetch quest,"" and you can build relationships with other characters. I have spent so much time on side quests, I am very much looking forward to where the main quest goes.Would 10/10 recommend to any Harry Potter fan, and would 10/10 recommend to anyone looking for a new and unique RPG."

THAT IS NOT OKAY!Hogwarts and surroundings are interesting to explore. Searching for stuff and being able to search for more stuff after getting new skills is fun. The world really looks magical and very ""Harry Potter-like"".Story and characters are extremely generic. All the teachers are boring AF; blank, boring, stereotypical pieces of cardboard! Same goes for students. I dont give a sh-- about anyone of them (the main character included). Same goes for the antagonists. Is it that hard to write a plot and characters which isnt based on clichees and stereotypes which have been used sooo many times.... The interactions between the characters are just so blank.... so meaningless... Clothes: WTF? It destroys the complete worldbuilding! Imagine, you are in a school where everyone has to wear a certain uniform.... Now some new dude comes to school and he wears some colored goggles, a leather-coat and some colorfull payjama-pants.... And noone give a f.... Teachers dont event react to it!In my humble opinion, you cant do it in a game about Hogwarts... You can do it in GTA: San Andreas, but not in Hogwarts. There must be a logical explanation, why one student in the whole school keeps on dressing up like a f.... fashionista AND why noone reacts to it! Clothes which are part of the regular game have to be a part of the gaming world.... Fighting: It isnt that much of fun... No comparison to the amazing combo-flow that I experienced in Batman Arkham City... In Hogwarts I tend to more ""not like it"", than ""like it"". A couple more word about clothes: Clothes seem to be the only loot you will find in the whole game (besides gold, that can be used to purchase CLOTHES!). In a Hogwarts-World there has to be a reasonable explanation, why a student is allowed to wear clothes which are not a uniform at school (and why others arent allowed). It got me so annoyed that I lost all the fun opening chests and making quests... Because I just dont understand what I need all those clothes for...Another thing about clothes is the limited space in inventory: Once you found something around 10 pieces of clothing, you cant pick up more. You have to go to a vendor and sell them there (or you have to destroy the clothes you have). This is really annoying, since you keep on finding clothes like all the time.... At that moment I wouldnt recommend buying the game. I would recommend waiting for updates which fix the issues with the performance. The only really good thing about the game is the design of Hogwarts and its surroundings. They feel magical and for the first 5 hours they are fun to explore. Once you realise that exploration leads only to finding more clothes, which break the illusion of world building, it also loses its appeal."
3247,adamant,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adamantiwe/,1,,0,54.9,March,7,387,0,1,"Overall, first few hours were very entertaining and exciting. Then it wears off and you have to play it just for the sake of completion. Was somewhat fun, but probably wouldn't recommendWhat I liked:- Hogwarts castle itself is well-designed and fun to explore;- Poppy's side quest;- Game's prologue;What I disliked:- The main story becomes repetitive and boring roughly after your first visit to Hogsmeade. Overall it's pretty plain;- As is the case with most ""open world"" RPGs, the world is vast, but feels very empty and repetitive after few hours. While Hogwarts itself is well-crafted, anything outside of the castle is very repetitive and tedious. You have ~100 Merlin trials, a lot of bandit camps, a lot of dungeons which all feel the same with very little variation and completing them doesn't feel rewarding at all;- Absolute most of the chests contain some useless garbage which only purpose is to fill up your inventory very quickly, until you sell all of it just to free it. This feels dungeon exploration even less rewarding, as most of the times some mediocre chests is the only thing you'd find there;- Avada Kedavra is meant to be unblockable (unless with physical means or in very specific circumstances). Yet, thrice in the game the main character blocks it by simply cross-casting smt into it;- No meaningful karma system, no consequences for using unforgivables;"

3250,A Balanced Breakfast,https://steamcommunity.com/id/abalancedbreakfast/,1,,1,71.0,March,1,235,0,1,"Fantastic game, far better story, world-building, and depth than I expected. The devs could have easily coasted on the Harry Potter IP and made a game that tons of people would pay for, but chose to make a truly rich, deep game with tons to explore. PC performance is a bit too inconsistent to not mention, though. Thankfully, the performance during the most important parts was great. I would get a rock solid 120 FPS during major battles, but then drop to a stuttery, inconsistent 40-50 FPS (with clear frame drops regularly) during some overworld tasks or in seemingly basic, enclosed spaces like stairwells. Seems like the devs put a ton of attention into getting performance right where it mattered, but it's a bit disappointing that areas that would seem on the surface to be extremely easy to render have less than half the FPS of other areas. I suspect in time this will be fixed, but for now it is something to keep in mind. Regardless, if you don't have more than 16GB RAM, don't even consider playing this at 1080p or higher, even with DLSS at ultra performance mode. This is truly a ""next gen"" game in the sense that it is totally unplayable on old hardware.The performance issues are extremely easy to ignore however, because the game is fantastic. The normal difficulty is honestly probably a bit too easy, but maybe hard mode is a significant step up. Idk, haven't tried it yet. I have about 85% completion of the game in total at about 40 hours of game time, which seems like a perfectly reasonable game:price ratio. Highly recommend."

I know the controversies... and I think this has to be said.Don't take away my childlike wonder. Seriously. If you need a lesson in how awful authors are, go look up Lewis Carroll (the writer of Alice's adventures in wonderland) and about a thousand other terrible people who somehow lucked into making something worthwhile. JK Rowling is an awful human being, and she should be condemned for such. But if you go around thinking that just because she is awful, doesn't mean the art isn't separate from the creator the second the last pen stroke is written, I'm sorry but you are just plain wrong. What would convince you that it's okay to take away someone's joy just because you don't like the author. I don't like many authors. They are miserable people, its kind of a pre-requisite for being a writer (EX : guess I hate myself today, I'll go write a book) I enjoy Harry Potter and can safely say that doesn't make me an antisemite, and it doesn't make me anti-trans/anti-lgtbq+, please let people enjoy things FFS.As for this game... every time I pick it up...

3260,Hiedra,https://steamcommunity.com/id/OMGharri/,1,,1,63.9,February,20,137,0,1,"Buying this game came with a lot of questions from friends. Why spend so much money and support a terrible author in one game? Let me start off with the elephant in the room. The greatest fault with Hogwarts Legacy is its universe creator. J.K. Rowling’s bigoted shadow looms heavy over the Harry Potter universe, but her personal failings should not ruin the joy that this game provides. Unfortunately, Rowling owns the intellectual property for all things Harry Potter. The ugly truth of the matter: she will earn royalties from Hogwarts Legacy sales. It is the only thing she earned from this game. Nothing about the successful story telling or enriching player experience belongs to her. That matters to me. This game gives me something to love about a fantasy world in which I invested years of my childhood. Hogwarts Legacy very purposefully works to defy Rowling and her vile opinions. Diversity and representation are abundant. Goblinkind are multifaceted and well represented. However, following canon, house elves are still enslaved. The player does not stop or fight a slave rebellion as was feared prior to launch. The Harry Potter world is not utopic. There are issues that parallel our own international conflicts. A quote that has stayed with me following the completion of this game is “not all is what it seems.’’ We cannot have light without darkness, nor joy without pain. I appreciate that Hogwarts Legacy attempts to address this dichotomy in a way that gives depth and meaning to a difficult subject matter. Now to address two major social uproars surrounding this video game. First, Sirona Ryan, the first trans representation in the Harry Potter world. She is a great character. Sirona’s side quests are interesting and key to understanding a specific professor’s experience at Hogwarts, as well as the culture of Hogsmeade and surrounding countryside. I didn’t hear about the controversy surrounding Sirona until after I completed a good portion of her quests. Needless to say, I was flummoxed. Her name is directly inspired by a Celtic goddess of healing, which seems thematically important to her character and relationships with others. It is not a wild, unheard-of name nor is it stereotypical or offensive (see Cho Chang or Kingsley Shacklebolt). People need to stop making problems where there are none. Second, Ranrok and antisemitism within the Harry Potter world. The original movies and books portray goblinkind much the same way as western antisemitic caricatures. Goblins’ portrayal as stingy guards of Gringotts is very much in line with historical western views of the Jewish people. Hogwarts Legacy keeps much of the canon reference to goblin controlled Gringotts. However, unlike in Harry Potter, goblins are important and well-developed characters throughout the game. Short of the beginning, there are no banks in sight. Goblins are given a range of emotions, goals, and personal histories deserving of any major character(s) in a story. The best way to disenfranchise a people is to tell only a single story, an issue addressed by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in her amazing TED talk. This absolutely still applies to the fictional representations of real peoples. Rowling created a singular view of the goblins in Harry Potter. The creators of Hogwarts Legacy did no such thing. You get the whole picture within this game, even the ugly parts. I cannot go into the argument about Ranrok without spoiling major plot points of the story. All I can say is that concerns of antisemitism are unfounded specifically in Hogwarts Legacy.Moving away from social discourse surrounding Hogwarts Legacy, it is important to address the pros and cons within the game design and playability. It is a beautiful game. There is a vast open world to explore and an incredibly immersive experience to keep one occupied for days. I loved the ambiance and mood established within the soundtrack. Character designs varied for NPCs. Major characters were unique and memorable. Everything is voice acted and the voice acting is skillful. Character customization is good, if not a little limited. Thank the stars for good looking hair physics. Hair that moves. Detailed strands. Eyelashes. Everything I ever wanted in Dragon Age: Inquisition. With that said, this game was not properly optimized for PC. It is clunky in parts. Admittedly, I played on a budget computer with low settings and my AMD card may be the culprit. My specs should have been just fine on low; however, I frequently experienced clipping, artifacting, and memory leaks. Restarts were needed on a semi-regular basis. My game saves were not at risk, and I could play a long period of time without an issue. Water was my biggest graphical hurdle in the game. Crossing a bridge resulted in artifacting. Swimming resulted in artifacting. Calm stroll through the meadow? Artifacting.In addition, I really wish I could interact with major characters beyond the side quests. I could ask professors questions occasionally, but I couldn’t converse with the wonderful Ominis Gaunt about his infamous family or the somewhat annoying Poppy Sweeting and her love for beasts. I really wanted to build relationships with school peers in a way that the game simply did not provide. Some side quests were tiring and unrewarding, only there for achievement hunting and nothing else. Really though, Zenobia can take her Gobstones and piss off. Don't get me started on the damn demiguise. In truth, these complaints pale in comparison to the enjoyment I found in playing this game. I want more. I demand DLC for certain plot lines. I want to continue the stories of certain characters. My choices in the game made me feel a lot of complex emotions. I can safely assure you that this game delivers."

Despite all its flaws its a great fanservice games that gives you an opportunity to engage with Harry Potter universe in numerous ways, there is something almost for everyone. Aside of that. This game is a most decent open world action-rpg. Role-playing element is extremely weak, your choices doesn't matter at all and the way world interacts with your character is quite strict. You could go on adventures with some npcs, cast unforgivable curses in progress and torture your victims in unimaginable ways and you're still a hero.Side-quests and open world structure is just another Checklist open world game cliche, where exploration means nothing and all activities are pretty much the same. Main story / relationship stories are weak as well. You won't get any explanation or answers on your questions at all. Your character is a nameless doll without story. Vilians and other character motivations are unclear. ""The power"" nature and why all of a sudden you have it is NOT explained whatsover. Don't expect anything serios or deep. This game's story feels more like some sort of weak justification to make scenes.But visual part and scenery are impressive and give enjoyable experience. Itemisation made me feel like i'm playing destiny 2 or something. Felt out of place.Battle system - its alright. Took some time to get used to and I wanted to have more space to bind the spells and use them all, i didn't want to choose. I finished the whole game on Hard.I finished the main story and some extra stuff that was interesting for me, but I'm not sure, if I will push for 100% because its just grind of similar activities without any challenge or actual reward or purpose. So. If you like the Harry Potter universe - its a must have game. You'll get a lot of enjoyment from it because its been made to satisfy the fans. If you don't like Harry Potter universe - this game is 6/10 open world action-rpg with cool graphics."

3289,Barrista,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052914702/,1,,0,51.4,February,12,54,0,1,"The game itself looks good, beautiful even, but it has a lot of technical issues and isn't really that ""open"".  If you are in love with the world of Harry Potter then you will love this game.    Leveling is slightly interesting and there is more to do beyond ""kill x monsters"" if you like puzzle and collection games.   But the TL:DR is wait for a sale because while it's good?  It's not that amazing for price.  Why would I give a thumbs down to a ""good"" game?  Expectations vs. reality.Is this a HP version of Skyrim?  Absolutely NOT!   There is a main quest and once you unlock your broom the world will feel even smaller and you will find the invisible walls.  Most dialogue choices don't affect anything regarding the story.   Even some ""side quests"" are mandatory to continue the story.  As others said you don't really interact much with anyone in your house unless you pick a house certain characters are in.  Because of this the entire house ""choice"" feels pretty meaningless.Fighting is fluid, but the game does start to feel repetitive combat-wise and it doesn't really feel like talents are necessary to spend as you get them.  Since you can't respec it would likely be wise to just increase spell slots and upgrade the spells or abilities you like as you go.  Technical issues:If you look at other negative reviews most of them are the same complaint - this game is a resource hog and not just for your GPU.  There have been 2 patches as of this writing and those, plus my changes to Windows Exploit Protection (look it up) have my game running fine on high with a 3070Ti, but I know many people who are still have issues.  I would say obey the recommended specs including for CPU or just buy for console.  That said, I don't have music or anything else running on my computer while I play this for fear of technical issues - I don't have this concern with any other game.Other slight annoyances? Cannot move UI elements.Cannot remap abilities so if playing with keyboard a slip of the finger causes an issue.No photo mode or way to zoom out too much.  I'd really love to share pics of my character with my friends without having to remove all UI elements.No Whomping Willow - I would expect a tree that large (in width) to have taken quite a long time to grow.Why is this woman in the room of requirement pictures ""petting"" house elves?  it's creepy.Refunding talents - you would think the ""room of requirement"" would find a way to give us what we require to do this in case someone makes a mistake?"

It's Hogwarts, doors are open to you. The quests - even all the basic collection quests - are the perfect excuse to explore. The secrets and environmental details provide a constant payoff to your efforts. Classes are a abbreviated (of course), but still fun and they feel rewarding.

There is little to no interaction between mc and the other students and there are no minigames to play with them either. MC is a complete teachers pet regardless of what you want your character to be like and in that aspect it makes sense that the other students ignore you. There are zero consequences for your actions, so you can't be whatever you want to be as the story is set in stone, you can't fail anything either. You can use unforgivable curses as much as you want and nobody will give a ♥♥♥♥.The progression in the game is also horrible. Around a third of the way into the game you unlock the ability to unlock locks and what you unlock is tier 1 of 3. Exploring before being able to unlock tier 3 locks is a waste of time as you'd have to backtrack just to get that one tier 3 lock. Gearing doesn't really matter at all and you just smack on whatever has the highest stats, you don't even need to upgrade any gear ever, the only thing gearing really does is make you look like a clown. There is a fashion system so you can change appearance to not look like a clown, but it resets whenever you equip new gear, so you might as well just stay as a clown. The game tells you that you start unlocking talent points from level 5, but you can't unlock a single talent before you're well over level 10. The talent points themselves are mostly useless due to the combat being extremely easy and the only good talent is increasing revelio range as you're spamming revelio constantly during your entire playthrough.The open world offers nothing interesting to do. There are a ton of merlin chores to increase your gear slots, but none of these offer any kind of challenge. I usually enjoy platforming, but the merlin chore platforming trial consists of jumping from one massive block to another that is right next to the other, they are impossible to fail. It's just so incredibly boring. There are also a bunch of caves and treasure vaults, but most of the time they are as follows; run down a passage and loot 1 chest. Good job you've cleared a cave. Some time you actually have to open the cave or treasure vault in some way, but as long as you have at least one active brain cell this is very doable. On extremely rare ocassions there is something you have to do in the cave to get your one chest, but as long as that one brain cell is still active you'll manage. On even rarer occassions you might encounter an enemy in a cave (OMG) which you'll destroy in a second, what a challenge. There are some other activities in the open world like you can pop 5 balloons in a row on your broom, this is so engaging and fun. There are even landing platforms you can land on and that's about it. The combat is dreadfully easy, you are playing with cheats as your aimbot is turned on probably as it was developed for consoles. You can aim normally, but then the game zooms in so the back of your head covers half the screen. The lock-on targeting system for PC is garbage as the way you switch targets is with the arrow keys, so never lock-on to an enemy, you have aimbot anyway. The enemy never dodges any of your spells either so feel free to massacre them. The enemy AI is really bad as well which makes an easy game even easier, the best example are the dugbogs which routinely gets stuck which means you can spam them down without them even moving. However the game should get some praise now and this is related to some mechanics of different enemy types like how you can use flipendo on the club of a troll after it has swung at you to flip it into its face, these kinds of things kept the combat from being completely boring. The secrets and puzzles of this game were not challenging at all for the most part. For example one of the hogwarts secrets are light 4 braziers on a bridge and then match the symbols. Whoever was in charge of designing the puzzles must have been designing this for toddlers. However I will give praise to one single thing related to puzzles and that is the depulso puzzle rooms as they were the only fun puzzles to do in this game albeit a bit short. The by far best part of this game is the room of requirement which will appeal to people that like making houses in the sims. The room of requirement also have up to 4 vivariums unlocked through story progression which can hold the beasts you capture. The game should also get a bonus for having very good shiny rates for the beasts as I don't think many would have wanted Pokemon levels of shiny rates for the beasts in this game.There's no quidditch in this game which is understandable, but instead it was replaced with broom races. You are challenge by some arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ named Imelda to beat her times. To describe how easy she is to beat, you can start the race, then go make dinner, eat your dinner, take a ♥♥♥♥ and then come back to still be faster than her. She is supposed to be the fastest racer at Hogwarts, but after leaving her in the dust you can check the leaderboards for the race and she's nowhere to be found. The leaderboard times are not very difficult to beat either which is disappointing. I was hoping there was more broom races, but there are only 3.-Spoilers ahead-As is very common now the story is set in stone, none of your choices have any impact whatsoever. Towards the end of the story two of the main antagonists have a falling out and one of these confronts you and offer you to work together with him to take down the main antagonists. Personally I would have liked to be able to accept this offer, but instead MC is dumb and wants to kill him instead. There are technically two endings, but they are extremely similar and the ending is decided by drum roll... dialogue options before final boss fight. Nothing really matters and that is extremely evident throughout the game. The characters are also really shallow, but then again we don't really interact much with any of the characters.If you want to play a game set in the Harry Potter universe I'd rather recommend the older Harry Potter games as they are far more engaging and challenging."

3319,Enevile,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053564015/,2,,0,62.8,March,8,54,0,1,"Alright.. This game.. Wow, you can tell so much love went into the making of it.But, that just makes it so painful to play through.And that is more or less my entire thought on the game. The game is the perfect example of a 5/10.Are there reasons to not buy it, or not play it? Nope. None at all, completely worth the money.Does that mean you should? Well I guess that depends on if you want to spend money for half of an experience.Every thing you do in the game, will make you wish there was more, and that is the travesty of the game. There isn't more, and I dont mean content alone (because that certainly is the case), but I mean;Spells : There are 20-23 Spells, some utility, some combat, and some both. Which just begs the question, how immersive is a world that is completely based on magic, with only 20ish spells? Not even all the ones from the books are in the game, and I would expect there to be more than are in the books. I would expect them to have new spells, and all sorts of crazy interactions.They sadly, do not even meet you halfway here, I would have aimed for 50-100 unique spells, with massive intereaction for the game to feel like a true harry potter game. You get 20ish spells, and 8 or so have very enjoyable and interesting interactions. The rest are just there.The spells that interact will leave you wishing, yearning, and completely unsatisfied while you think of all that could have been.Thats how the entire game is by the way. Pets are even worse, there are about 20 pets you can tame and breed. It does nothing. Helps you enchant your armor.Armor as well, will leave you feeling like there should have been some sort of system ontop of just.. ""Power"" and ""Defense"" with enchantments to enhance your spells in .. perhaps 10 very bland and generic ways. Just increased damage, nothing special. Imagine the game with unique effects, like poe or diablo uniques... Imagine this game with the items of Elden ring.Talents are perhaps the closest thing to complete the game has, and that sadly still is a half filled glass.They're interesting, and would be perfect for a teaser to a much larger and robust system.As it is, theres very little downside to just picking whatever you want, as you'll have all of them minus 12 at max level. They dont really change the game a whole lot,and if you arn't doing dark arts, then I imagine you'll actually have unspent talents left over.Exploration and rewards.. They give generic armor upgrades, that will honestly annoy you towards the latter half of the game as its all level based and you wont be leveling too fast so you'll just end up destroying and vendoring things. Theres a slight reward to explore every nook and cranny, until you have decent gear, then the chests might as well contain 50-200g. Which you can't really spend on on anything, as the shops are actually never useful in the entire playthrough.The cosmetic part of the game is really the only part of the game that seems somewhat well and fully done. And I would still love to see double the armor customizations, but I'm greedy. And then we come to the games one saving grace.. The actual look and feel of the world. Its gorgeous, and I love just looking at the landscape or buildings. The painstakingly lovely amount of effort that went into hogwarts and hogsmead are obvious, and.. then that will make you look at the rest of the world and wish.. wish that that much love had went into the rest. You'll actually wish the Open-World was smaller, so that they could have made more unique places. Imagine plundering the endless depths of gringotts, or going to azkaban.The questing, sadly.. Is.. a love-hate relationship. You will love probably 1/3 of the quests, some are very well written, and others will have you questioning why they were even put in the game in such poor condition.And its not very hard to google that there are no plans for new content at this time, as Alan Tew the Lead game designer has said openly.TLDR: This game, should have the early access tag on it. Because it is at best 1/4 of a game. Spend your money if you want, but its clear that IF the game ever gets completed to industry standards, it will be a long time coming."

The world is designed to perfection, the combat is fast and fluid, and the graphics are . The overall difficulty of the game is quite easy (puzzles, combat etc) but it's fun and engaging. I also love the music and how different activities have their own soundtrack, like when you are flying on the  through the valley and this awesome music starts playing out of nowhere.You can really tell when a game is made with passion and whether you are a Harry Potter fan or not, this is a must play."
3324,krsname21,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999908080/,3,,0,26.5,February,12,78,0,1,"I, like most people, was really excited for this game.  There was a lot of hype coming from the community as well as the game maker.  Unfortunately, it has failed on many fronts, but there are also some good aspects to the game.  However, at this point, I would not recommend it for the state it is in and for the price it is at.  The good: the graphics are well done, the fight system is pretty good, there are a ton of quests to run, the base story is also pretty good.  That's about it. The bad: there is a serious issue with performance.  Lots of glitching, items floating in random places, in one instance, the mobs had the giant square pixel graphics splaying across the screen unable to be rendered correctly.  While there are many quests, they become monotonous because they are recycled.  The world is beautiful but again, if you've seen one part, then you've seen the whole map, villages and NPCs included.  Also, the constant collecting stuff... like.. I'm colleting just to get some gear glamour?  Not only, but there is WAY too much emphasis on the collection system.  Why even have a story if all I am doing is running around constantly to collect stuff that has 0 effect on gameplay?  Character creation is a complete joke.  For the price of the game and current standards of character creation on massive games, they have completely failed.  The ability to play your character how you want in game is non-existent.  The game maker stated specifically that the player could create their own path through the game, this is false.  You have several dialogue options when talking to some people, but there is no difference of outcome regardless of which dialogue choice you make.  How this game was marketed, there should be multiple outcomes of gameplay and paths your character can take, i.e. pure good all the way to pure evil, complete with varied storylines.  There should also have been varying paths depending on which house you choose.  What is the point of having different houses if it has no effect on gameplay?  The leveling system needs a TON of rework.  I had already made it to level 20, but my quests weren't even to level 10 yet.  The problem here is you have level 8 spells (not even access to talents yet), but fighting level 30 mobs.  This outleveling also causes issues with the amount of quests that show up.  At one point, there are just too many side quests all over the map.  There are a lot of quests that will disappear once you've hit a benchmark in the main story, so if you don't do them, then you lose whatever possible upgrade you can gain from them.  And, when you have 20 side quests available, you just get thrown too far from the main story and it kills the flow of the game.  How you gain upgrades (armor) is also not working.  There needs to be a way to acquire the recipes in a more accessible way than just RNG from a bandit chest.  I mean, we're playing freaking witches and wizards, and you're teling me I can't acquire a recipe in a legitimate way to make my character as powerful as I can?  Joke.  The main boss fights that you encounter are also a complete joke.  There is practically zero strategy invovled in beating them.  When I fight a boss battle, I want to feel like I actually achieved something.  With this game, you just cheese your way through fights.  There is no sense of accomplishment.  There's a lot more, but I think at this point, pointing out the issues just becomes redundant.   The main point here is they need to take a step back and seriously reconsider the way the game moves forward.  There is a ton of potential here to redesign and and make HL an amazing game with some serious longevity (maybe consider also making an MMO).  Right now though, it just isn't working."

It crashes constantly, especially when using the Floo Flames to teleport. I figure these issues are due to the density of objects within certain places. I'm sick of the game forcefully closing all the time, I'd rate this a yes if they didn't rush the project and release an unfinished non optimised game. Note: I play this game using a RTX 3070 ti, meaning there should be no reason for these issues.

I verified my files and I later re-downloaded the game, absolutely did not help. I emailed support with full details on what measures I've taken and screenshots of how I do own the Deluxe Edition in my library. Got a generic reply explaining random things about the game, things that didn't have anything at all to do with me. I then didn't get a reply for 2 days. After 2 days I got a copy-paste of the first reply, nothing else. Game was literally unplayable for so many people. The Community Discussion page was going crazy with tons of people who were having the same issue and there was absolutely no help. Horrible release that I, along with other poor fans, had to pay for.

Forget the haters, if you like Harry potter and it's universe you must play this game.I can't stop playing, as simple as that. I forget to eat, go to the bathroom and I am unable to take breaks. It's that good!The gameplay is fantastic, great exploration, fun combat with different mechanics, lots of spells and combinations, interesting story and lore. The attention to detail the whole map has is just amazing. There's things to do anywhere in the map, puzzles, dungeons, treasure, trials, challenges, etc. The design of the game is beautiful and the OST is just brilliant hitting the right themes at the right moments, excitement, sadness, epic. Flying around in your Broom is a wonderful experience! The locations once you go inside on foot are plagued with details, exciting combats and plenty of enemies.The outfit customisation couldn't be better, you don't have to hoard everything to get dressed, once you get it you can use that skin on any item keeping the best stats with your desired aesthetics. What a great choice from the Devs. This is Fashion Hogwarts at it's best. Want to roleplay as a student of your house? Do it. Want to change into Swimwear for a swim on the lake? You can!

One good point is you can forget about lock-on and switch feature, since the mouse is more reliable so you can just aim and fire, no strange behavior like using controller.Mid game is boring, you will have fetch quests, collectables, etc. Since most of the NPCs are bland and the some puzzles are just a waste of time (unlocking, collect house medals, etc.) it brings the whole game down.In summary:- Are you a Potterhead => just get the game- If not, wait for sale or at least wait until the game has patched for PC performance issues. It's a very bad PC implementation."

From what I expected out of a licensed game set in the HP universe I can say that the end result went above and beyond my expectations.On the other hand, for anyone not into the HP universe this would probably feel like a pretty generic open world game. There is definitely a lot of room for improvement in a lot of systems, such as making the combat more complex, making the gearing system (a lot) more complex, making the open-world challenges more interesting (most of them are pretty boring and there is a LOT of them), making the main story a bit more interesting and adding more interactions and puzzles to Hogwarts itself (the Repulso rooms were a blast! the math puzzles not so much). I hope that now since they got a huge amount of world-making work done they can focus on these other systems and make an amazing sequel!"

Every corner you traverse is guaranteed to lead to a new wondrous moment.Combat feels pretty good and has some mastering to it that is just as satisfying as the rest of the game. This game's dopamine doesn't always come in the traditional way. You're supposed to explore and the game rewards you for it mechanically, but mostly, you just witness a moment that you feel like only YOU got to see - that is something special!"

The battle mechanics continue to be entertaining, the new spells and talent system are enjoyable, broomstick and gryphon flying are incredible and a lot of fun. A certain secret room and its flexibility are rocking my world. This game has A LOT of depth. --------------------------------------------------------First, I was skeptical of the game at before playing. There's a lot of ways a game developer could miss the spot with a game set in a universe like Harry Potter and my expectations weren't very high. I'm delighted to say I was proven wrong. I have 6 hours into playing and so far I absolutely love it. I enjoy the beautiful graphics, the battle mechanics feel intuitive and natural and not at all what I was expecting. Being a Portkey Games project and having played the mobile Hogwarts Mystery I was expecting more spell tracing and less active battle, but again I was proven wrong, and happily so. It's incredibly entertaining not to be limited to casting spells only in certain areas but instead to be able to freely fling spells all through the school. It's encouraged in fact to discover secrets and hidden treasures! A quick list of the things I really like for those who don't want to read a lot:- Gear appearance (and ease of ""transmogging"" your clothes appearances)- Spellcasting- Open world gives a skyrim meets harry potter vibe- Money is earnable but not just given to you without a little effort at least- The story is rich and engaging- Beautiful graphics and amazingly beautiful landscapesSome things I think could change or be improved:- More interactable NPCs- A bit more clarity on the defense and offence stats from gear and how they effect your character- A more in depth Sorting Hat experience, the interview with the hat is only a couple questions so it would feel more authentic and give you better investment in your character if you really felt like the hat quizzed you more about yourself."

This really plays like most open world Warner Bros. Games, such as their Middle Earth series or Mad Max. If you are getting tired of games like the God of War reboots, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Evil West then I honestly wouldn’t recommend this for you. However for everything this game copies it does it really well, combat is especially entertaining. My big gripe is that The first semester of the game really takes its sweet time in pacing the unlock rate for different spells. I might have been at 6-7 hours before I unlocked my broom and I was really only doing main quests. I would honestly recommend waiting to explore the world at ur own pace only when you’ve reached the fall season.Great game"

This is one of the most immersive worlds I have seen. Avalanche studios really did their homework on Harry potter lore. The game is set in the 1800s way before Harry Potter. You play as the “chosen one” with special powers to see ancient magic. The game play is nice, they have many collectibles and lore artifacts you find. The story is very good and entices you to move forward, but the best thing is the characters. The side characters quests are even better than the main story!!

The old games, those PS1, PS2 games come to mind except the graphics look meticulously detailed and perfectly portrayed with the latest ray traced lighting. You got all kinds of activities that seamlessly are integrated to exploration of the map. The combat is very satisfying with lots of options. It feels like the most RPG of the Potter games with a dash of fast-paced souls action in the way of a nice dodge roll with apparent iframes. Lest I forget the story, it's top notch writing, acted very well (in the mo-capped scenes), and engrossing. I could sit down and watch a movie with this game's premise.The ray tracing is very taxing and I think the DLSS is not fully working right in the launch version of the game.

A fan of HP universe, I also enjoy playing video games in general, so this is right up my alley. The game turned out to be quite disappointing, unfortunately.There is very little pros, so I'll mention them at the top:1) a variety of activities (merlin trials, broom races, beasts/pokemon collecting, exploring caves, dueling, summoner's challenges, etc)2) a big world to explore, and game gives you the means to do it comfortably (broom, mounts, floo powder)3) Hogwarts is designed with a lot of fine details and looks niceThat's it for the pros, I guess. Here come the cons.1) It's not really possible to customize the appearance. Yes - there are races, no - you can't be fat or have a big nose, or thinner lips. There is a painfully limited amount of everything - faces, hair styles. You just have to roll with it.The facial animation gives justice to Mass Effect Andromeda. Most of the time characters have neutral expressions. As soon as they try to smile, though... it looks so janky ICANT. The game intentionally avoids facial expressions as far as I can tell. No one's cried or looked surprised, or angry throughout the game. It's all expressed via voice.2) I was 100% sure that we were going to get a list of questions or a prolonged conversation with the Hat, that would determine our House. HA-HA-HA, are you brave, loyal, curious or ambitious? I could not link these options to the Houses for the life of me.3) We start not knowing a single thing about our avatar, we finish completely oblivious as well. There is literally NO background, no story, no nothing. The character is completely empty. How old are they? Where do they come from? We spend a full year at Hogwarts - when is their frikken birthday? Who are their parents?This absence of information makes the character completely unrelatable. There is no bonding, no sense of association.4) Our ""companions"" struggle to share some of their backstory, but end up one-dimentional anyway:- a girl, who loves animals- a brave and just African girl- an emotional dark wizard boyThey have no life outside of their relationship with us. The dialogues are so pompous and lifeless, MY GOD. They repeat themselves sooo much - it happens all the time actually, the repeating. All other students cannot be interacted with, and don't have any meaningful NPC routine. They say the guys near the House points sandglasses are still cheering, up to this day.5) This whole 4 sets of 4 spells thing.... Try pressing 1-2-3-4 for spells and Q for to shield and Ctrl to roll.Thanks god you can change the bindings a little. Also, who on earth produced this great idea to have only 4 sets of 4 spells, but 26 active spells??? Why do I have to meddle with them every time I need to change smth in the Room of Requirement or brush a beast??6) - : there are 4 or 5 distinct trials. As soon as you've tried them all - that's it, they are not interesting anymore. There is no challenge whatsoever, they are not puzzles in any way, just busywork. The animation IS UNSKIPPABLE AND ALWAYS THE SAME, it gets even more annoying the more you do it.- : the same issue as above. Besides, the loot is limited to gear items, so there is no element of surprise, you're not eager to find out what you're going to get. Besides, the clothes models are VERY much alike - some only differ by the shade, and the choice is rather poor in the end.- : once you catch and put them into a vivarium there is nothing else to do. Yes, you'll brush and feed them a couple of times, maybe breed. You can give them a toy and watch them play a bit.- : the Alohomora mini-game is so brainless, yet you can't disable it. You also have to watch the UNSKIPPABLE animation, again.Dueling and summoner's challenge are actually fun, but the game portions them out as quests, so you can't just play/fight any time. Besides summoner's challenge opponents are extremely weak and give 0 competition.7) There is nothing to buy really (besides brooms and spellcrafts), so you just sell-sell-sell to clear out your inventory. I ended up with 80k gold. At the same time you can only produce money by selling gear items, so you have to loot-loot-loot. You can't sell ingredients or potions. OH YES, you can also sell beasts, but you're not a poacher, RIGHT?8) I think the devs/writers/POs/whoever forgot that the main audience for this game is adult people, not 10yo kids.Poachers are bad, but we are good, so we snatch the beasts from their dens and put them in our perfect little zoo. Could you justify it a bit more, please? Maybe it would be better to save the caged animals, and they are wounded or smth, so they can't survive on their own for now.Killing is OK as long as it's not an Unforgivable curse... I mean, c'moon.At the same time you can cast Unforgivable spells in plain sight, and no one would bat an eye.9) You may as well skip all secondary quests - the fact that you have completed them is not reflected in the world. To illustrate the extent of this - I was SHOCKED when professor Weasley mentioned that she was aware that I had saved (caught) a unicorn. The game's never mentioned any of my other actions.Okay, I'm gonna stop for now, but if I remember smth else I will update my comment."

It's a great Hogwarts walkaround experience, the combat is better than I expected it to be and roaming the world is fun... but overall, 20+ hours in it's still giving me new mechanics and I've felt like it's still holding back. I can't stand games that have the bulk of the game as an extended tutorial. Especially since the Hogwarts experience is quickly engulfed by the size of the world and fast travel. Without more Fire Emblem/Persona style relationship and classes it feels a missed opportunity in a lot of ways.Gameplay wise, the quests and story so far are passable, but the open world is as by the numbers as you can get. Exploration quests, puzzle quests, collections upon collections upon collections and the gear upgrades aren't exciting whatsoever despite them being everywhere.It's a really strange game to try and review, yes I'm having fun, but there is always a ""just let me play"" frustration behind it all."
3371,.Z,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zqn/,2,,0,53.1,February,21,453,0,1,"An average, borderline mediocre game. Like the movies, the magic fades away as you progress through it. The dialogues are boring and cringe-inducing, and the story is beyond stupid and unsatisfying. The quest system is outdated, and the missions themselves are as basic as some of the worst Assassin's Creed games. The game is filled with idiotic filler content like ""Catch 100 Pages"" or ""Do 100 Merlin Puzzles,"" which can be resumed in the same four or five gameplay loops that repeat ad nauseam. There is an in-depth Requirement Room system, a breeding system, and a crafting system, all of which are utterly useless as the game is made for kids, and you will cruise through it on the highest difficulty level whether you engage with those systems or not.The only great aspect of this game is the wonderfully modeled world. Roaming around Hogwarts during the first few hours is truly amazing, but sadly the game keeps disappointing after that.Overall, I think the developers were not properly managed, and the focus wasn't put where it should have been. Better dialogues, a better story, or a fully-fledged karma system would have done so much good for the game instead of crafting or 6,000 useless skins for the Requirement Room.In conclusion, I highly recommend avoiding this game unless you're a big Potter nerd."
3372,Khali∻,https://steamcommunity.com/id/etcetera_/,2,,1,58.6,February,20,33,0,1,"I spent 32 hours playing the game and was thoroughly impressed with what I saw. The attention to detail in the game's design is truly impressive, with every corner of Hogwarts and its surrounding areas brought to life in vivid detail. The story itself is engaging, with a strong sense of progression and character development.One of the things I enjoyed most about Hogwarts Legacy is the freedom it offers players. With so much to explore and so many secrets to uncover, the game allows you to move at your own pace and tackle challenges in your own way. Whether you prefer to focus on combat, exploration, or puzzle-solving, there's something for everyone in this game.Combat in Hogwarts Legacy is satisfying and varied, with a wide range of spells and abilities to master. The game does a great job of balancing the challenge of combat with the need to strategize and use your abilities effectively.Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with my time playing Hogwarts Legacy. The game offers a truly immersive and engaging experience that is sure to delight fans of the Harry Potter franchise and newcomers alike. I can't wait to see what the final release of the game will bring."

The game play is super enjoyable and I loved that it was open world with exploration encouraged but not required. The NPCs had good backstories and I actually found the side quests actively engaging, which is unusual for me!The music is amazing and very nostalgic and it feels like a love letter to the films. I liked that there were morality questions in the game but found the lack of consequences for your character to be a little odd - using unforgivable curses in front of teachers for example without repercussions - and the voice lines can get a little repetitive.Overall though I really loved this game, it felt magical to play and would definitely recommend it, especially for those who grew up alongside the books and films."

I had a problem with performance issues at first but figured it out after spending hours optimizing my PC using Google and YouTube, which I never had to do for any prior games I've played on my PC.  There are also a few bugs I encountered but nothing game breaking or couldn't be fixed by just teleporting.  Besides those two problems, I really enjoyed the game.  I will admit, the game feels really short even for a completionist as myself.  I played my first playthrough without any guides or searching on google to figured out anything and still manage to beat the game and obtain all but 3 achievements in about 80 hours.  Still worth playing as it's a unique experience and I recommend it to everyone."

Sometimes it feels overwhelming with the customisability of everything, from your gameplay style, the spells you want to keep on at all times, the skills you can unlock, your character's looks/fashion, etc. But, IMO, the game presents things slowly so you can adjust to what you can do.I love everything about this game.

It's an RPG light where you play the role of a student at Hogwarts but you can't really be evil and there are no real choices and branching of story depending on what you do.

I played through the games tutorial with absolutely no issues, not a single instance of any dropped frames. The second I enter Hogwarts itself, the game turned into a slideshow. It stutters heavily even walking up a staircase, turning the camera, entering a new room, stepping near a door or casting spells to the point of unplayability. What I played of the tutorial was fun, wish I could actually play more of the game. I have the exact system that Avalanche themselves recommends for the game on high settings:- Intel i7-8700- NVIDIA GeForce 1080ti- 16gb of ramThey are either entirely incompetent or lying about what the actual recommended hardware for this title is. I have tried everything in regards to fixing this issue, including:- Changing all settings to low- Lowering the resolution- Manually updating the games DLSS- Trying all DLSS settings- Disabling v-sync - Reducing camera acceleration to 0- Enabling TextureStreaming in the Engine.ini- Reinstalling the game- Updating my driversRegardless of patches, this review is staying negative. Companies shouldn't be encouraged to release half-baked PC ports, this shouldn't be an issue and I shouldn't have to spend hours trying to make this game functional."

But Wow that cut scenes and the fighting and the flying of a broom was spectacular.Managed to get 100% on the game as well, which feels like a awesome accomplishment, Since there was so much content, it was all enjoyable to do as well. Having a ridable mount was a great feeling as well. not just the broom, exploring the world of Hogwarts and all of it's landscapes was truly something else. Interacting with all the different professors and students for sidequests, as well the mainquest. Was a great enjoyment.The spells and traits worked very well. And you could go in stealth as well, which was cool. The quests was really nice to go through as the adventure moved forward. hoping for the next game of Hogwarts or whatever the next game shall be, Will be really exciting to see what may came out of it. Really looking forward to see if there is anymore story or DLC that could be added on this franchise of Wizards and witches. The battle sequences was superb!

If you are a fan of the books/movies, and grew up reading/watching them like I did, then you are in for a treat. There is so much to do, explore and see. I think within my first 10 hours of playing, I still hadn't explored all of Hogwarts castle alone. Even before then, it opens up to be even larger than you were probably first imagining. The story line is pretty awesome so far, and doesn't feel like it's just tacked on to an open world RPG.Only thing I wish they had added was a fully fleshed out Quidditch game to play. I guess I can hope for a DLC later on including it. Even without it, this game has been an absolute blast with new things still unlocking as I play (Room of Requirement being an awesome example).If you are remotely interested in the Harry Potter universe I absolutely recommend it.

3418,Cynical,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198865753910/,3,,0,21.8,February,19,148,0,1,"I like most open world games, its a pretty guilty pleasure of mine, but Hogwarts Legacy was one of the most disappointing games I've played. Its not terrible, but for all the hype this game got, it didn't live up to it. This is the first true ""Harry Potter open world game,"" and they missed the mark. Yes, this is one of the best looking games I've ever seen, but the world doesn't feel like a real place.Take Hogwarts, the main area of this game. It looks really good and there is a lot of areas and paths, but NPC's don't feel like they live there. They usually just stand there, doing nothing, repeating one or two lines over and over. You cannot use your spells on them, and you can't talk to most of them. This is how its like for the entire game, even outside of Hogwarts. NPC's don't feel like real people because there's barely anything you can do with them. The same goes for Hogsmeade. I genuinely was excited to head to Hogsmeade when I heard it was in the game. I was hoping for a place with dozens of memorable interactions and hoping for a cozy experience. Somewhere where I could just chill at after completing a hard mission or defeating a big boss. Instead, the lack of interaction made the place feel lifeless. I only came there to head to the shops or when I had to go for certain quests.The combat is also really bad. Its not just a lack of enemy variety, this game feels too easy. I beat it on Hard and never had much trouble with it at all except for the final boss. All the potions and stuff you can craft is useless. You don't really have to think in the game. You can just keep shooting spells over and over, and either dodging/parrying. There isn't much depth to the combat and it gets really tiresome. Its essentially just attack, dodge/parry, kill. Since the game scales, and you'll never find an enemy that is a lower level than you, your spells never feel powerful. Enemies get extremely tanky during the late game, and it turns into a real chore, where you just attack and dodge without reason. Plus, since you can carry 25 healing potions, its really hard to lose a fight. The story is also really boring. This problem would be fine if the game didn't choose to focus on it, but it does. The dialogue is extremely dull, characters don't have real personalities, and your main character is so lifeless. I was never able to get interested in my own character. The game also emphasizes ""choices,"" but from my experience, there are very, very, very few that actually matter. It sucks as well, they can make a really good story with the material they have. Its in the universe of the Wizarding World, set years before the events of Harry's adventure. They had the freedom to create any story they wanted, as long as they had the same relative places, spells and ideas. Instead, Hogwarts Legacy feels like a really tiresome adventure, where your character just gets all the information he needs through hours of trials and tribulations to defeat the evil ""bad guy."" Its an idea done better before, and Hogwarts Legacy has nothing interesting to share on it.There are also many minor problems as well. The Room of Requirement feels like a Sims style, ""create your own house,"" just slapped on at the last second without much care. Its extremely boring and doesn't matter at all since the game is already so basic in its combat anyways. The Unforgivable Curses literally do not matter. There is no consequence for using the 3 most broken spells in the whole game. You can use them right in front of the teachers, and they will not react. It'd be cool if the game had some kind of morality system or something. Its the Unforgivable Curses, they're supposed to be banned and never be used, yet you can use them like normal spells. The game level locks you from doing main quests, meaning you'll have to grind tiresome side quests to get back into playing the game. The side quests are not great either. Either you need to collect or find something, or ""Help said character complete this task."" Dungeons or caves are just combat arenas that have pieces of loot in them. Plus, the loot boils down to simple stat increases and you don't really have to think about what to wear. Just pick the gear that has the best stats and wear that. Personally, I thought that a lot of the gear in the game looked really stupid. Your character can look really dumb sometimes in the game. At least the game lets you change the gear's appearance without needing to change the stats. I appreciate them for including that. There are also way too many collectibles in this game, simply used to pad out time and get old quick.Despite my dislike for so much of the game, I can understand why people are enjoying it. The game looks amazing, its fun to travel on the mounts you get in the game, and once you get them, the world really doesn't feel so big. I actually really liked this. It doesn't take forever to get from one place to another. Even going from the end of one side of the map to the other doesn't take as much time as I expected. The music is astounding. The last third of this game, especially the last few bosses, are really fun and the highs of this game for me, and the parts where the combat truly shines. I can see why people may enjoy this game, but for me, the magic, no pun intended, was lost very early on. What turned into my own adventure and shaping my own path in the Wizarding World soon turned into an exploration game that turned to tedium.I really thought this would be the next open world game that would keep me hooked, but I guess I was wrong. For what is essentially Avalanche Software's first game, this was an extremely ambitious and creative project. I can see that this was a passion project for them and that they put their heart and soul into it. It is just unfortunately, a very flawed experience that didn't live up to my expectations. For now, I recommend waiting for a price drop before buying this game. Its not trash, but it simply isn't the Harry Potter game I've been waiting for more than 2 years for."
3419,razing32,https://steamcommunity.com/id/razing32/,1,,1,49.0,March,28,"1,200",0,1,"Hogwarts legacy is an open world action game with a Harry Potter skin.If you like open world games , you will probably like this.If you're just a fan of the series/world your mileage may vary.The world is big - and has a lot of locations from the books.You get to explore Hogwarts Castle and Hogsmeade.My issue with the world is it feels to big at times.Maybe i;m not the target audience but there is just too much filler.You start out fine growing plants and brewing potions but soon you have a lot of other crap.Field guide pages , flying pages , Dadelian Keys , Moon statues , Merlin Trials, Ancient sites , Boss enemies , Astronomy tables etc.It feels like too much at times.And since some of these are tied to level progression or unlocking spells you are kind of forced to do them.Merlin Trials unlock more invetory and since you trip over items on every mission you need them.There is barely any reason to upgrade ""armor"" since you find more and better on almost every second mission.Combat is a very Simon Says QTE affair. It starts out fine but in late game there are so many enemies it becomes a colored disco.Orange prompt - block , red prompt - dodge , plus colored shields to destroy with colored spells. And a few miliseconds to attack enemies with basic attacks.Seriously - it gets to be - dodge , block , dodge , block , block , dodge , 3 miliseconds to brake their shield and repeat.Also shields should block the spells of the color they are not advertise what spell to use to destroy them.That;s like a bullet proof vest with the caliber of the bullet that can perforate it written on the front.Story is decent , though it does borrow a bit much from the books/series.Harry Potter is a magical child , you're a magical child.Harry Potter meets a Hippogriff , so do you.Harry Potter can see Thestrals  , so can you.House Elves are treated badly there , some here are as well.Some of the side missions are better like Sebastians.The world itself is a bit weird. There are goblin renegades and bandits and poachers everywhere and no wizards seem to bother.Why does a teenager have to fix their problems.That's like a SWAT team outsourcing a bank robbery to a teen from the local high school.Poachers are bad for plundering rare beasts and getting their alchemical ingredients.But when you take them by force from their home to a vivarium and gather their ingredients and sell excess animals to a pet shop that's somehow fine.Oddly there are students and teachers from Africa and India , both of which were colonized by the British Empire at the time the game takes place and not once do any of them say ""Oh btw , mister/misses British student , your country is kinda opressing mine. Messed up , 'innit ?""Performance is a bit of a mess and the game is resource hungry. And it doesn't even look that good in some aspects , like facial animation.They cut Quidditch. I just don't get it . Even earlier games on much less powerful consoles had Quidditch.In game reason is some pure blood got injured and the headmaster , a member of the Black family canceled it.You can ride a broom and ride through rings . Wooopeee such fun /sarcasm. Great to see the rings from Superman 64 still found work.Seriously , why the hell did they cut Quidditch ? How about cut some stupid rings , Merlin trials etc instead.Overall it's a competent action game but the amount of side fluff you have to do gets boring fast.Must be why every damn Foo Flame is mentioning your field guide and why the voice actress for professor Weasley emphasizes the FIELD GUIDE.Whether you like this or not depends on you and what type of game you like.Wasn't for me . Not bad , just too loaded with what felt like mandatory side stuff."

The spells remind me of how ancient tech works in Zelda Breath of the Wild. The spells are physics based and can be used to solve puzzles as well as battle. The cadence of the attacks are similar to Dark Souls (but less challenging). You'll really like this game if you like Dark Souls - but this is far more accessible. This game is not hard, it just has a similar combat pacing. The environment is really gorgeous, and the animation work is amazing.Pros: - Really nice looking game.- The combat is really fun. - Physics based puzzles were well executed.- Dark souls combat cadence and dodging.- The texture work and animations are really good.- Potions, breeding, and gardening were fun to explore and use in combat. - Tons of outfits to choose from and really good customization for your own room. - Engaging quests.- The Hogwarts castle is probably the coolest building I've seen in a video game.Cons:- Did this need to be an open world game? The open world exploration is bland. There's no point to doing most of the ""merlin trials"" and ""caves"". I just skip open world exploration in this game and go from A to B. - Loot system isn't exciting.- Puzzles get repetitive 20 hours in. - No quidditch :(."

I grew up reading these books as so many others did, and couldn't wait to walk around Hogwarts as a Ravenclaw student. I have completed the game as a Ravenclaw and found the map chamber with all houses. Would love to see more DLC to expand on the story. The combat was a pleasant surprise and was fun and inventive. My only real complaints are that I would have liked a more developed Ravenclaw companion, choice on your characters backstory, and to be able to sit down/interact with more objects. Overall I would highly recommend to any Harry Potter fan!"

It's pretty. It's not repetitive. It's an open world without a lot of BS. There's an annoying crafting thing added on top of systems, but it's not necessary even on higher difficulty, so you can engage with it only as much as it's interesting to you. In fact, this is true about most of the game: this is the kind of open world that is fine with you engaging with it as much as you want. The world is static and uniform, but it has plenty of varied simple, and quick challenges with generously spread rewards. It's a fine distraction if you want some mindless fun. Especially if someone in your family is a fan of the franchise and demands you to play it."
3438,heyevery10,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067965692/,1,,1,60.7,March,8,734,0,1,"Average story but the world building is great the zones you get to explore and do quests and other open world tasks are lots of fun, the side quests are hit and a miss and I really only liked the Slytherin relationship questline  out of all of them. The combat is flashy initially and getting new spells was really fun but once you have them all unlocked and understand the combat it begins to feel very samey as you develop your own routine for combat., This game is also determined to make you look like a clown 24/7 so I found I was constantly having to transmog my gear sets anytime I picked up a new piece of gear. The crafting system around the  is lots of fun and I found that added alot of reasons to complete the rest of the game. Performance wise the game still is not great and found Hogsmeade and Hogwarts to chug anytime I loaded in even with mods that help with it. Hopefully the performance issues continue to get patched, currently I give the game a 7.5/10 would recommend a sale unless you are a Harry Potter fan"

3440,bird,https://steamcommunity.com/id/davidteket/,1,,1,84.3,March,7,124,0,1,"That part when the graphics turned into Deathly Hallows tale scene. Or the part where we saved 2 hypogriffs and I was flying with one above the lake, then I just scratched the water surface with its leg just like in the movies. Or that part where I first entered the Forbidden Forest at night, sneaking slowly in the fog to avoid centaurs... Or that feeling when I got sorted to be a Rawenclaw student just based on my answers.Or the part where I accidentally discovered the ghosts' party room. Or when I had a tense fight and I accidentally yeeted one dark wizard off the cliff and out of the universe with a defensive spell. And the whole game has moments like these scattered around all waiting to be discovered by you. It's far from perfect and it's really like an 8 out of 10 game, mechanically speaking it's similar to Shadow of Mordor. And this is not a negative aspect, its just what you should expect from the game. If you are an HP universe fan, this is a must have for you still.The music the visuals are all there. Every single detail of Hogwarts, Hogsmeade and the Highlands is just look how it suppose to look. But be careful! The game needs a high-end PC. And don't even dream about ray tracing. It eats a 4090 for breakfast. Thankfully the game looks almost the same without RT. From a sketch of books, to best seller books, to movies and to this highly detailed HP universe game. And we fans have been all there, and now we are at Hogwarts experiencing it real time and interactively.Highly recommended, even purely for the experience alone, along that, it's an enjoyable game.Hope they will add DLC's in the future. The modding support is already great and I've read that the game will receive a 6DOF VR mod too"

3448,FoxyMellow,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018035181/,1,,1,59.7,March,6,102,0,1,"It's a solid game, despite rumors of game breaking bugs and stuttering issues. While playing I encountered FPS drops caused by NVIDIA drivers, not the game optimization. As a person who doesn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the drama surrounding J.K Rowling and the LGBTQ - ALPHABET , I decided to play the game and judge it solely on performance and quality of play. Long story short: Story is 9/10 featuring interesting plot, fleshed out characters and decent drama. The story also wraps up pleasantly without leaving out important plot points drifting in the wind. Unfortunately the story itself could have been elevated to a whole different level if only the writers had the forethought to do so. Despite that it's still pleasant enough for a HP fan or a casual RPG enthusiast.Graphics are 10/10. This is without a doubt the best looking, most polished Harry Potter game ever created. Characters, creatures, spells, backgrounds, everything looks fantastic even on normal graphical presets.Difficulty is 7/10. While the game does require the player to make tactical decisions and think before engaging a large group of enemies, it's easy to exploit your main protagonist powers to quickly overwhelm and destroy anybody that attacks you. Even on Hard difficulty, enemies don't pose much of a challenge.World building is 10/10 without a doubt. There are so many elements that come together to create an amazing experience filled with magic and wonder. I played for roughly 60 hours leisurely exploring and doing side missions and i feel like a still missed about 10 or so hours of content simply because I beat the game and saw no reason to go for collectibles. Even if a player has never experienced the Harry Potter franchise there is plenty of content to catch you up to speed and deliver a magical adventure. For those who are familiar with the source material, there are subtle (and not so subtle) winks and nods towards feature events happening behind the scenes of the game.Overall the game is fun and delivers what it promises. Could it have been better? Yes, of course. Mechanics could have been more robust. Enemies could have been more diverse. Choices could have had a bigger impact. That's not the point thought. What the developers proved with this game is that they can deliver an open world HP game with an original character that is story driven and impactfull while also respecting most of the source material. I look forward to the next installment which will hopefully explore more mature settings and plot lines, away from Hogwarts."

From the moment I started playing, I was blown away by the game's visuals - the attention to detail is truly stunning, and it really feels like you are exploring the magical world of Hogwarts.But it's not just the visuals that impressed me - the story is equally captivating, and I found myself fully invested in the world and characters of the game. What really sets Hogwarts Legacy apart, though, is the way that small tasks and quests are seamlessly woven into the story progression. I usually find these kinds of tasks to be tedious, but in this game, I actually enjoyed doing them - they added depth and richness to the world and helped to flesh out the characters and story.One of the things that really stands out about Hogwarts Legacy is the passion and love that the developers clearly have for the source material. This is a game that was clearly made by people who care deeply about the Harry Potter universe, and that passion shines through in every aspect of the game. The attention to detail, the lovingly crafted environments, and the richly developed characters are all a testament to the developers' dedication and love for the world of Harry Potter.Overall, I cannot recommend Hogwarts Legacy highly enough. It's a truly remarkable game that manages to capture the essence of the Harry Potter universe in a way that few other games have been able to do. If you're a fan of the series, or just love immersive, story-driven games, then this one should definitely be on your must-play list. Five stars, without question. 25HRS"

3478,Konos-P,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198128178175/,2,,1,100.8,February,24,12,0,1,"TL;DR - This is a great game if you're not a Potter Head, and an amazing one if you are. 9/10First off, this is a great game. There are moments that are absolutely breath taking. This game FEELS, LOOKS, and (almost) sounds like the Wizarding World we grew up with.Pros:          • The World is BIG, Hogwarts actually feels like a massive castle and the surrounding country is bigger than you think.         • The Original Story is good. Not 'groundbreaking' but a complete joy to actually go through.          • The game play is very fun. Easy enough to not struggle too much, hard enough that it rewards being good at it.         • The many, MANY nods to the franchise never feel forced.         • Your character looks like an actual person as do most of the cast.         • Even with some older textures, the game is breathtakingly beautiful at times. Watching the sunrise over Hogwarts? Magical. Seeing the ""Private Garden"" for the first time actually brought me back to the Oxford Botanical Gardens- one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. They really capture the beauty of England and Scotland.Cons:      • The textures are slightly older looking     • Some of the voice acting sounds more like a parody of a character than an actual character.     • Broom Flight Controls are not intuitive to anyone that has flown in other games.     • Wish there was a bit more variety in the clothing, but 1800s gonna 1800s.     • That weird 'blank face' all characters get right before the cut scene ends. Once you see it you can't unsee it."

I've practically tried all the fixes listed, even turned the graphics into what's comparable to mud just to see if I can play for more than twenty minutes at a time to no avail. It doesn't help the patches have only made performance worse.. don't let the 40 hours lie, I spent most of that trying to get it to run and it liked to say I was running the game even though I'm sure as hell the Exe wasn't even in my task manager.  I doubt I'll get a refund on this game do to that and honestly it really feels like all I did was waste money. For those who are interested maybe give it some time before you buy it least you wanna be one of few who got screwed over like mysself and oh you'll probably get told to 'get a better computer' even if you possess a 2080 and are having issues."

As somebody who never cared about Harry Potter and only played this because my wife wanted me to play alongside her...it really deserves a ""meh"" sideways vote, but it's closer to a no than a yes for me. This game is entirely reliant on theme, and I don't care about the theme. You take away the theme you have a fairly generic open world slog here.A map full of trials and collectibles that are in no way shape or form engaging or entertaining. TONS of half bakes systems just to say they are in there. ""Potions and herbology!"" Nope, just a menu, a menu and then a mobile game like timer in your face. Flying exists on brooms and animals but it's so slow and clunky you'll just fast travel everywhere. The game is wide as an ocean but there will be NO DIVING if you catch my drift.The combat is a highlight. The way you can string things together into interesting combos is really fun. Problem is, you'll never be in a fight big/long enough for it to really matter. Once you unlock a few key talents combat can be almost completely nullified. It is still the best part of the game by far though.God...really wish there was a sideways thumb. If you love the HP universe this game will delight you. If, like me, you're not already a fan, it won't make you one."

Sadly it's another poorly optimized PC port more dependent on your wallet than dev optimization.  But if you are willing to sacrifice visual quality and deal with consistent stuttering in the most fascinating locations (Hogwarts Castle & Hogsmeade), and are also a Potter fan, this is an easy 9/10. If you are a casual gamer, this is a 7.5/10.  And for the PC Master Race with 4090s to spare and modding is in your blood, this could potentially be a 10/10.Edit: would still recommend but removing 3 points for Denuvo not letting me play my game offline even after 109 hours logged."

Honestly have not played a game that paid so much attention to detail since RDR2. Best open world game since RDR2 and Witcher 3. Don’t listen to these clowns who say the story is a-aight! Did they not do the Sebastian storyline? Did they skip the pensieve cut scenes from the main story? Not to spoil but there are some hard hitting moments, that left my jaw slack in surprise.

I enjoy the familiar bits when the original music starts or I recognize a name. I wish there was a next chapter for this, that ties more into the original lore of the books.I think I would enjoy it even more if it was multiplayer. Going to classes or on quests would be even more fun with friends.Only thing I dont like is the minimap, it shows you a chest is there, but it could be on a different floor up or down, that just made me waste so much time! I wish I could just make it so, it only shows the current plane I am on. Otherwise I love it 10/10 recommend. :)"

The quests should scale to your lvl/Power.Looking forward to see what will happen next, if we get DLC's other than Skins or if this is where it ends. I for sure hope there will be more too it.Big up to Avalanche Software for the work they've done. They had a lot too lose with this and they just won."

That said, the game is also sadly marred by some very dated and clunky RPG mechanics, and if one were to open a museum of game development terms, Hogwarts Legacy would be the spotlight exhibit for ""pacing issues"".7/10"

Explore! Tame Beasts! Cast Crucio on your Enemies! It's all in good fun though, I love how big the map is and I loved the questing and leveling system although others may not have felt the same. It felt easy and tied Main and side quests in together to advance the story. I don't say this very often, but I could see myself playing it again and again after the first play-through.

This game is very poorly optimized, it runs very poorly on a 3080/5600X at 1440p (no raytracing, with DLSS) so I would recommend waiting for some patches if you are not a big Harry Potter fan. I am not going to re-review later so I will put this disclaimer so you know what you are getting into.If you are a big Harry Potter fan, this is a really great game. Hogwarts is amazing and I do wish you spent more time there, you spend maybe half the time at Hogwarts, maybe less. The rest of the world follows the basic open world Ubisoft formula and could definitely use some work in a an expansion or sequel as it gets very repetitive. For the game play, I would call this an RPG only loosely. Yes you are ""role playing"" a wizard but the actual game shares very little with the RPG genre. You have no stats except ""Offence"" and ""Defence"" which is a number that can only be altered by changing your gear to one with a bigger number. There is a ""skill tree"" but the skills only slightly alter the different spells (make explosion bigger for example) and have no effect on how you play the game and you can not make different ""builds"" with the skill tree, so everyone will be playing the game the same way, maybe using different spells more than others. I would classify the game  as an open world adventure game more in the Assassins creed category than an actual RPG.Overall though, the game is pretty fun and aside from the technical issues, the game play is pretty sound. It is a must play for any potter fans and a pretty solid open world adventure game for non- Harry Potter fans looking for more in the genre. I would say, if you arent a Harry Potter fan at all or have very little knowledge of the Harry Potter world, I would wait for a sale. The best parts of the game are the callbacks, lore and expertly crafted Hogwarts castle that wouldnt hit as hard if you are coming into the franchise blind."

Love seeing them all eat 💩 the game is amazing go play it and dont let the alphabet mafia intimidate you.
3538,ItsLittle,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199023307866/,1,,1,65.1,February,16,47,0,1,"Probably the best game I ever played. I am absolutely in love with Hogwarts Legacy! The story, the world, the beasts, and the customization. Everything is perfect and just as I imagined. If you are a huge fan of the wizarding world or just simply looking for a game to get lost in and escape the real world for a bit, this is the game for you!"
3539,anarchy753,https://steamcommunity.com/id/anarchy753/,1,,1,121.9,February,15,354,0,1,"At this point, I've finished a 100% run, and rerun the first 2-3 hours for each house in order to get the unique house quest/achievement for each.Pros:I love the style of the exploration. Both in and out of the castle felt significant and they managed to have two very different scales still feel relatively similar in value. The open world map is well done, and unlike other recent titles all of the locations feel hand-made, as opposed to something like Assassin's Creed Odyssey or Elden Ring which fill a much larger map by copy-pasting the same camps/dungeons/assets ad nauseum.While it is clear that most dialogue options don’t have an overarching effect, the actual dialogue choices are strong. Most games will give you the most bland a-or-b decisions, but there were a number of key moments where you were given a really good compromise between what seems like the obvious choices.The main story felt great within the universe while still being a completely unique concept. The story itself wasn’t the most engaging but it gave a cohesive reason for progressing. The side quests were incredible, and to be honest, the Sebastian Sallow questline completely overshadowed the main story. It had brilliant characters, it was emotional in a realistic way and it genuinely makes you consider your choices.I didn’t like the gear system, but you unlock transmogs for everything you find, as well as “collection” ones that are a transmog without an item. Being able to keep appearances I like without it affecting stats is great.Combat was generally fun, following the Arkham-style of basic attacks, specials, and emphasis on countering but in a much more ranged form. Some of the spells felt like they lacked a reason to exist (Incendio vs Confringo, Levioso vs Wingardium Leviosa) but at the same time it gives you options in how you play without forcing you to use identical spells to everyone else.Cons:The entire gear system is a mess. From the start of the game you have a wildly limited capacity to hold things, and no immediate way to sell them. (You begin with 20 slots, 6 of which are taken by what you have equipped) If you choose to explore the castle early on you will be punished by this. It expands later but it feels like there’s only a cap for the sake of being irritating so that a side activity can reward you with less annoyance.Upgrading gear gives it such a tiny boost, by the end of the game, stats-wise, you have 8 things equipped instead of 6 if all 6 are upgraded to max. There’s a LOT of extra trait upgrades, 2/3 of which are completely useless because I’m never going to spend resources on a level 1 or 2 trait when it is exactly as easy to install the level 3 of the same trait. Most of the traits are also terrible, why would I invest in giving 1 specific spell a small damage boost when for the same cost I can buff every damaging spell I have? It’s also worth noting that upgrades require the Room of Requirement beast care, and for the max upgrade you basically don’t have access to the beast required until 1 or 2 main quests before the end of the entire game.There’s a lot of small points where options just haven’t been considered to be less annoying. Once you can add traits to gear, any non-legendary gear is pointless as they don’t allow level 3 traits, so a “sell all X quality” items button at stores would be nice rather than needing to sell everything one by one. Transmogs also have to be applied to every piece you equip, and as you get a piece with better stats about every 5 mins, that’s often. It would be great to be able to apply a transmog to a slot in general and not have to redo it every time. Alohomora can be levelled up to get through higher tier locks which are basically just progression blockers until mid-game. The mini-game for locks is dull as hell, never gets harder, never changes, never becomes interesting, but you’re forced to do it hundreds of times just because. An option like “I’ve done the same minigame 10 times, skip this from now on” would be great.Lastly, I don’t really know if I’d put this as a pro or a con, because it fits into both depending on the player. I personally felt there were just a few too many ‘nods’ to the Harry Potter series. Like yes, it’s the same universe, the same school, but at a point it’s like herbology is repotting Mandrakes, Care of Magical Creatures leads to Hippogriffs, Nearly Headless Nick is trying to join the Headless Hunt and has BASICALLY his entire dialogue from the second book, every character has a surname relating them directly to a Harry Potter character. Like who the hell is Professor Weasley? Why is she so type-casted as Molly Weasley when she HAS to be related to Arthur instead? At some point it feels like the writers really need to step out of the shadow and do more with the elements we haven’t seen. Focus on creatures that weren’t the main creature in the movies, just do something a bit different. In that respect it again pulls me toward the Sebastian Sallow story because he’s a completely unique character going through a situation that’s entirely unseen in the series.Overall, great game. A little short story-wise, but plenty of side content that still felt meaningful within the world."

The combat must be repetitive"" when in reality, NO.The combat system is quite enjoyable. You can be very creative with the combos to some enemy types.Let's talk about pros and cons.- Great visuals and details- Good combat design- Great puzzles- Map is huge- Worth replaying in another house- Can have your own - And can build your own ""Room"", that brew potions, grow mandrakes, etc.- Lots of side activities- The Wizarding World is very immersive - Very hardware demanding game (32GB of RAM is recommended)- Inconsistent framerates (I got 180-200fps in closed areas while 59-70 in Hogwarts castle with RTX3080Ti)- Side activities are repetitive (especially Merlin Trials)  other than that, they are okay- Our character facial reactions are inconsistent- Hogwarts Legacy is a great AAA game and should be the standard of all AAA games. This is the kind of game worth paying and playing. The price is not too expensive (Around 50$ for me). Unlike the other game, what's that called?  thing? Charging you 70$ for that poop. :D"

If I were to have any complaint about the game I could only point to one or two things. Number one being inventory space starting out is very small. I'd find myself in the middle of nowhere and I can't carry anything so I either have to destroy something or find somewhere to sell it. My 2nd thing would probably the way the spells are used.Having to constantly swap by holding over on the Dpad can be a bit of a pain while in battle or when you're trying to do a combo because you can only hold 4 spells per equip space. All in all, I'd give this game a solid 8/10 possibly 9/10 ( I haven't beaten it yet.) It has plenty of stuff to do, things to find and enemies to fight so you don't get bored super quickly. If you're a fan of Harry Potter this game is definitely worth the money imo."

Easy to learn and engaging in everyway from the collectibles to the mystery surrounding the environment and story, I'd recommend it if it weren't for so much difficulty in managing my framerate. In less populous, tighter enclosed spaces my game can run on ultra RTX, vsnc off but theres an incredible amount of tearing and sudden drops in framerate. Even when I drop everything to low, RTX off with vsnc enabled, when I am outside I am still experiencing drops from 60 fps down to as little as 35 or even 20.

Hell, i didnt even know what the four houses were til i played this. Only criticism i have of the game is the lack of exclusive fullscreen, and performance problems. Even with a rtx 2080 which is beyond the recommended specs, im forced to run the game in ultra performance mode with the 'recommended' settings from benchmark just to keep a close 60fps in game. Outside areas of Hogsmeade being the biggest offender. Still game is highly recommended for anyone that likes great story driven single player action adventure games.

3649,Mikey,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeyTheDrifter/,1,,0,1.7,February,11,202,0,1,"Played the game for 2 hours and in all honesty had to refund it after that. The game felt mediocre at best. First of all there was the awful optimisation. I run a beyond decent rig, 2080 GTX and an i7. Despite of this, my fps reached 30 at most and 5 at worst (mostly at the start of every cutscene, which were a LOT in the first 2 hours, it was like watching a damn movie?. I also was not allowed to take my own name because apparently it contained profanity. (Also, weirdly enough, the game does not support full screen? We looked online but did not find a fix, best option we got was windowed fullscreen, tanking down the performance even further...)After that, the game dragged on for a while and we started to notice the horrible voice acting in your main character and most of the students. monotone and very uninterested. Second to that, the weirdest thing of all was that you could notice the pitch change in your own voice. Say if I were to pick a low pitched voice, you could actually HEAR the bass effect IN-GAME on your own voice, as if you were speaking through a voice changer app...After tanking through 2 hours of gameplay and 25 fps average, the game world still felt a bit stale to what i had expected. It felt empty and meaningless, like I was not a real part of it. Rather a scripted cardboard castle. The game then decided it was time to bug out ALL the trees outside of the castle, to which they all pretty much buggingly exploded and leaves were penetrating the inside walls. As soon as I actually had to step outside my FPS dropped to 10. As funny as it was to see I ultimately decided this was definitely not worth the 60 bucks. I'd wait for the price to drop or for the first month of hotfixing, after that it'll probably be a very nice game."

The feel and atmosphere is fantastic, the amount of detail is and care is jaw dropping, the visuals are quite good, and its a good game that rewards exploration too.  Even the combat, the weakest part, is still not bad and is getting better as they add more to it.  Its also very inclusive with a wide range of races, a good mix of male/female roles done well, and even a trans bartender who's treated with respect both in terms of personhood and in terms of them being formidable.The people trying to cancel this game and attacking other people for playing it couldn't have chosen a worse game to pull that nonsense on.

The attention to detail in this game is absolutely remarkable, and it's clear that the developers have a deep love and appreciation for the Harry Potter universe.The gameplay is top-notch, with a mixture of action and RPG elements that will keep you engaged for hours. The spells are intuitive and fun to cast, and the creatures you encounter are beautifully rendered and terrifying in equal measure. The choice-based narrative is another standout feature, allowing you to shape your own story and determine the outcome of the game.The music and sound design are also excellent, with themes and sound effects that will immerse you in the world and leave you with memories that will last a lifetime. The voice acting is also superb, bringing the characters to life in a way that feels authentic and true to the source material.Overall, I would highly recommend Hogwarts Legacy to anyone who is a fan of the Harry Potter universe or just looking for a fantastic gaming experience.

3668,VulgarMonkey,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vulgarmonkey/,1,,1,53.7,February,11,205,0,1,"This doesn't deserve a negative review, but I am surprised that the more critically-inclined of you haven't at least knocked this down a peg.Firstly, this is presumably a dream game for any Harry Potter fan. Notably it's not in the era of the books/movies, but everything outside of the familiar characters are present. Classes, Broom Flying, Beasts, Spells, Plants, The Room of Requirement, Hogsmeade, etc etc. There hasn't been a game so epicly recreating the Harry Potter universe that I'm surprised this wasn't done sooner.But to be frank; I think the Harry Potter IP carries the living F out of this game. At some point I had to acknowledge that I wasn't having that much fun. The RPG elements are too shallow. There's no significant ability customization. There's no moral alignment/consequences for clearly evil actions/spell use. The pacing is wildly off (receiving gear with Trait slots long before I unlocked the ability to fill them, as well as being wildly over-levelled for the main story by only doing side quests as they presented themselves). There's the typical 'Ubisoft' style open-world fetch/errand quest (which seemingly has gotten a pass so I'd like everyone to remind themselves when the next Assassin's Creed comes around to lay off the regurgitated criticisms please).Like I said, these things are ignored across the board because it's Harry Potter - and a game like this has been well overdue. But when you pull away the outer layer you're left with a game that, by strict comparison, is without much substance. This is by no means a bad game, but it's not a great game. Calling it GOTY material is insanity. If this was a brand new IP, or even an existing IP from a hypocritically slammed franchise (see: Assassin's Creed), this would not be as favourable with it's audience.As someone who notoriously doesn't like Harry Potter, but will put interest into any game made with such clear passion, I've gotten so far into it before realising I'm just not actually enjoying it that much.Harry Potter fans will absolutely love it though - that pre-existing fandom will carry this over the line. Without it though, I'm falling short."

The game is set in the magical world of Hogwarts and the developers have done an amazing job in bringing the beloved world to life. The attention to detail in everything from the setting, to the puzzles, to the combat and gear, to the clothing, is truly remarkable. The passion behind creating this dream and giving it life is palpable and it shows in every aspect of the game.One of the highlights of Hogwarts Legacy is the level of detail in the environment. Walking the halls of Hogwarts, exploring the castle and its grounds, and interacting with the world and its characters feels like you're truly a part of the magic. The puzzles are challenging and rewarding, and the combat and gear system adds an exciting new dimension to the game. The clothing options also allow players to fully immerse themselves in the world and express their own personal style.I hope that the developers continue to add new content to the game in the form of updates and possibly even sequels. The potential for new adventures, characters, and experiences is truly endless. Overall, Hogwarts Legacy is a fantastic and immersive game that is sure to leave a lasting impact on fans of the Harry Potter series."

I was hoping it would be a solid game but holy crap, it completely blew all of my expectations away. First off, the world itself is amazing! Filled with tons of little details everywhere you look, from a random pot floating around watering plants to enchanted brooms sweeping floors. Everything feels like it's magical in some way. Graphically the game is quite impressive in both art design and technical prowess. Everything is detailed, vibrant, and it runs buttery smooth AND there's super ultrawide support!!! The combat take a bit to get used to but once it clicks, man, its a blast...literally. There's a solid variety of spells you can master and some can easily be missed depending on what quests you take or skip. The gear system is solid but nothing too incredible. You have your basic stat improvements and as you get further you can enhance your gear with various effects. The best thing about the gear system is the transmog system. You can make any gear piece look like any other gear piece you've ever acquired for that slot. There's wand and broom customization, you can also greatly customize your room of requirement and the beast room that is attached. There's so much to do and see in this game, even though I take my time with everything I always feel like I might be missing something. Also, none of the side quests really feel like the generic cookie cutter kind. Maybe I'm biased since I grew up with this series as the books were releasing, idk. Altogether, fantastic game made even better if you're already a fan of the IP. Highly recommend buying this one and since it's in such good shape, no need to even wait for patches for once."

3688,Husky,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PandaHusky/,1,,1,120.4,February,11,86,0,1,"This game is amazing. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is into the Harry Potter universe.I cannot really comment too much on the story as I'm taking my time completing it all but so far it's pretty good.Pros - The combat is really entertaining, fast past. It's easy to learn but hard to master - Good balance in the puzzles, not too hard but the solution isn't immediately obvious - I love being able to explore Hogwarts, Hogsmeade and the surrounding area on foot, a broom or a mount. The freedom is amazing - The room or requirement being your own little place is amazing, love being able to catch beasts that you can look after and even breed to get ingredients - The ability to add traits to your clothing and the ability to upgrade them adds another level of customisation which is really fun to explore - Love being able to figure out how to counter each enemy you come across and totally destroy them. The arenas are an amazing place to test your skills, especially on hard where you have to know spell combos and know how to counter each enemy while dodging and blocking attacks. I have not have this much fun in a long time in a single player gameCons - One of the biggest things that ruin the combat for me is this bug where I dash around quite a bit and I suddenly randomly lock onto a particular target that I have no way of unlocking and so my character is stuck facing a particular direction. Ruined multiple arena runs because of this. Only happened on hard diff when I'm trying to do challenge runs and I dash a lot - You are unable to use spells to interact with random characters, spells only work on enemies or beasts (kind of). This isn't a deal breaker, it just would be fun if you could interact with the other characters in the environment - No Quidditch. Kind of sad that they didn't add this buuuut they did add broom trials which is fun for now - I don't know much about how the castle looked around this time and this isn't something major but I will mention it. The moving staircase looks so much different compared to the movies, more spiral in nature and some of the floors don't have any rooms - Sad that you cannot have a dragon as a pet. I was so happy at one point until I realised you cannot keep a dragon. It would be even better if you can ride one - I feel like the trait system and the whole customisation of spells could have been done better. For instance maybe a path (if you want to have a spell be more about aoe or single target damage etc.) to add different playstyles. Right now most of them are just aoe versions and it seems like eventually you would just unlock most of them by the end of the game"

This game is a love-letter to the wizarding world. It's addictive and fun. Combat is fun and has progressive depth. Puzzles are a great use of magic. Story isn't resting on the laurels of any previous entries or characters and is intriguing with real tension, stakes, and danger. THE MUSIC and ATMOSPHERE are incredible. One of the best games I've ever played. 9/10Points taken for some rough looks on facial expressions or animations, some clipping and a few bugs, but mostly because no Quidditch/broom controls need work. I'm assuming they couldn't fit Quidditch in within their schedule and hopefully it comes in an expansion or sequel."
3696,MikBug458,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MikBug/,1,,1,87.8,February,11,147,0,1,"The desire of the developers to lovingly craft an interactive version of a setting so many people fell in love with is obvious from the get-go. The game isn't perfect, and does rely on some open-world tropes similar to those found in Arkham games and other such titles, and the enemy types start to feel same-y after a while, but despite this the combat system is enjoyable and deep so these never become points of frustration.The characters were crafted with care for the setting and the world is filled with so many interesting things to discover. The game also confronts some of the more problematic elements it inherited from the books. The mistreatment of house elves is painted in no uncertain terms to be barbaric and cruel, and while a main antagonist is leading a goblin rebellion, there are other goblin characters that can be befriended, and the main character can express sympathy for the mistreatment of goblins by wizard-kind while it is shown that most goblins denounce the terrorist tactics of Ranrok (Goblin antagonist).If you aren't a fan of HP, then once the world opens up a bit into the game you'll have a lot more fun, but for HP fans, the first section that keeps you in Hogwarts is incredible in how alive the entire place feels.Even if you don't want to buy the game and decide to sail the seas instead, play the game, it's worth it."

3707,Sheepii,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sheepiiHD/,1,,1,129.1,February,11,356,1,1,"I've played through the game, and beat it. I do love the hogwarts universe, and with that, I would give it an 8. But, taking out the bias entirely, I give it a 6/10. Lots to be improved, but I think we're in the right place to improve it. Pros:+ Good Combat+ Beautiful Game+ Seemless UI+ Has good cutscenes+ Story is engaging, and huge+ Has little to no loading time+ Fast travel takes out the unnecessary 'drown in travel' ideologyCon:- Some aspects seem too simple (Talents, leveling, gear system, minigames)- Arbitrary fetch quests to improve your stuff- The plot and protagonist's motives can be confusing to follow at times- Enemies are placed in places for no good reason- No quidditch (or multiplayer)- The characters are either dramatic or overtly joyful*Good Combat*Combat can be tricky to master for most games, as most RPGs are typically just, attack roll (and the harder games like Elden Scrolls are just attack roll better). HL adds a level of complexity that is unique to combat, not by drowning the process, but by adding just enough to make you think a little more. *Beautiful Game*I think this goes without saying. It's a lifesize scale of hogwarts. They did it justice. It did take out key things from the game, ie the changing staircases, the willow, but overall, it did match the expectations of everything, and the makeup of the castle made sense. *Seemless UI*There are some things that I find quirky about the AI, specifically the spell picker, and getting on a broom (pls make a hotkey for this), but the overall concept is intuitive, and easy to follow. *Has good cutscenes*They exasperated expenses into creating some of the coolest scenes I've seen. *Story is engaging and huge*The story has an interesting way of making the main plot (no spoilers) feel much bigger than it is. It leaves you constantly chasing answers, which makes the fluidity of the content much more enjoyable. Some of it though, can get a bit repetitive. *Has little to no loading time*Interesting concept of making doors loading screens. Never seen that before. *Fast travel takes out the unnecessary 'drown in travel' ideology*Listen, you know who you are game developers. Stop making half the content walking around the damn map. It's one thing to pace out a little bit for scenic purposes, but some of these damn developers take it to the next level of stupid that it rips the fun right out of the experience. It's lazy story development, by adding unnecessary buffer time, simply because you can't make enough content. Alright, rant over. This game does a perfect job of demonstrating the different ways of travel, so much that it may even be excessive. No one should really be complaining that travel is a problem in this game, when you can fast travel from anywhere on the map, to near precise points of interest. On top of that, you can walk, fly broom/mounts. Hell, for some quests, they'll just straight up teleport you to where you need to be, or open up portals to your destination. Big thumbs up. **Cons***Some aspects seem to simple*The minigames are a joke. There's no skill curve to them, they exist purely to be a minor inconvenience. I'd like to see more thought provoking mini-games, but that's a lot easier said than done. The talents feel pointless, I spend more time in there thinking about what I want to waste my talent points on, because outside a select few talents, I dare say most of them are useless, and provide less of a reason to upgrade. Quality of life upgrades are where you should improve the experience for players, without giving them an actual advantage. With talents, what you could do is instead of these arbitrary, 'U dO mOrE dAmAgE', you could have something like, 'You can fly out of combat', or  'You gain momentum on a broom by going down' or even 'you get to kill the clown that keeps annoying the piss out of you in the cast-' nvm. Regardless, I feel we can do better in this department. Leveling, oh boy. You do one side quest, and you're basically outscaling the main quest line. You should scale your quests better. The gear system is horrendous. I don't know who thought it was a good idea to add spider protection onto a cloak, but they should feel bad. There are such niche purpose to having certain things, that it gets unneedlessly overshadowed by the more obvious, 'just do more damage hurr durr' aspects of the gearing system. Maybe aspects outside of defense and offense can be introduced, like 'you make 5% extra gold on sales, because ur a trader harry. IMAWOT', or some ♥♥♥♥ like that. But, I guess that brings me to my last point. What is the point in all the cosmetics, with zero ease of life upgrades. Sure, you can upgrade your broom (thank god for that), but cmon. Everything seems so baseline, that even the spells blend together and have no real significance outside the utility that some provide. *Arbitrary fetch quests to improve your stuff*Look, I get it. Every RPG in existence will have fetch quests. But, every single one? To gain any spell, you need to perform some tedious task of gathering enough money to buy something, to use it once, then never use it again. It never reflects on the story, they just say, ""alright, well I guess you know the spell now"" without any rhyme or reason as to how that happened, or plot development. Either the main character is by far the most powerful wizard ever, as I can master spells in one day, or there's something seriously wrong with the reflection of character progression. I'm going with the latter. *The plot and protagonist's motives can be confusing to follow at times*This can be a positive and negative. I don't really know what I'm doing, or why I'm doing it seems like a common theme in the story. Which, if that's what you're going for, you've done a stellar job. The storyline will often switch wildly, simply because they're trying to touch on the many aspects of the universe, which can heavily diversify the plot, and (honestly) lazily linking them together in some ambiguous fashion. The biggest issue I've found with the story is that it doesn't really feel like it's your story. It feels like you're apart of other people's stories, and you are the side character. I feel at times through the story progression that I'm just riding the wave, going down a tunnel, or exploring some tomb because well... I'm following some other dumbass that's doing it. It puts a damper on the significance of the main character, which by design is suppose to be the most significant. At highlighted points of exposition, it's goes on about how the humans and goblins are working together, only to counter that point in the next scene.*Enemies are placed in places for no good reason*Throughout the map there are enemies basically sprinkled about. There might be camps that exist, but they don't really make sense as to why they would be there. The dialog in some of these places are atrocious, but I get it, you're not going to have 1000 unique voice lines from your enemies... unless??? nah jk.. lol.... unless?? What if you just did it, you know? Just like actually put effort into making enemies, so the unique experience of dialog isn't just 'hey come out here, I know you're hiding', maybe it wouldn't feel so unimmersive. *No quidditch (or multiplayer)*Self explanatory"

Stay mad and if you think otherwise, please get your head checked because I'm starting to think its a mental illness.Also, going around spreading spoilers on social media... Maturity Level 100.Anyway, onto the review itself...The game is incredible. Literally a Potterheads dream come true. If you have the slightest interest in Harry Potter, please pick it up. Although it has nothing to do with the established canon, and I dare say, it works pretty well in its favor, its simply a must play. The combat is rock solid, exploring is rewarding. Characters are somewhat bland and you might be irked by the fact that there is seemingly no morality system but don't let that stop you from playing, please.The performance, in my 27 hours of playtime, has been mostly okay.

Ryzen 5 4600 processorgtx165016gbssd minimum settings still beautiful you will get around a steady 60-75 fps. you could play around with settings to get a better quality but i did not.Now the review itself after around 40 hours this game is amazing. the last game i played that had SO MUCH to do was probably skyrim. there is tons of stuff. whoever has 30 or 40 hours and says yea it was great did basically nothing except main quests. TOTALLY worth every cent. That is as much as i can say without actually spoiling anything. have fun!
3737,RavenShin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RavenShin13/,1,,1,29.4,February,11,159,0,1,"already played this game for almost 10 hours and honestly it's all i could've asked for from a harry potter game.there, within the first few missions, already is characters that are part of the LGBT+ community. including a trans woman who is voiced by a trans female voice actress and that is an amazing step for the wizarding world. all characters i have met so far have been amazing and not a single one forgettable. some characters also have links to characters we already know and love that aren't so obvious.game-play wise this game has not missed a beat. the controls have been so smooth and the spell casting has been done in a really interesting way that makes it simple yet engaging throughout.loading times between rooms are barely noticeable. if i hadn't seen the small loading symbol i would've thought there was nothing there with how seamless it is.and of course you get to pet all the cats!!!overall an amazing game and excited to continue and see what else this world has to offer!"

The Map has a good size and Hogwarts seems to be really huge. All in all it makes a lot fun to discover every corner. Even if you’re not a Harry Potter Nerd like me.There are some thing which are repetitive but that’s normal for this type of games.The fighting system is quite intuitiv. I play difficult hard and it’s competitive in some moments so you doesn’t have any dark souls moments ;)Im very surprised by the „housing“ system! It’s very detailed and gives u some kind of survival and building a home feeling.I have a rtx 3060 and an i8770k and having some framedrops but nothing worse.9/10 for now

It's story is captivating, the soundtrack is familiar and new at the same time and on the same level as the original John Williams scores. The game has a lot of canonical details put into it which will warm the hearts of Potterheads. It's a visually stunning game which gives justice to what we've seen in the movies, with great magic and transition effects. Combat is fun and engaging. If you're a Harry  Potter fan, and if you enjoy games with RPS elements, I high reccomend this game. The PC version has some FPS issues, which will surely be fixed with the upcoming patches and optimized drivers.Easily a 9/10 game"

I will not write about it, you can find enough on the Internet.I honestly see this game as what it is: entertainment.The Game itself is the first strong candidate for the Game of the Year Award 2023.It has a well written and told Main Story and a lot of great Side Quests wich sometimes reach the Quality of some Witcher 3 Sidequest, the World invites you to explore and most of the Characters are memorable. It combines many well working mechanics and succeds to capture the magic of the Harry Potter Universe.It's also quite inviting you if you don't know the books. I personally only knew the movies and had no problems following the peculiarities of the wizarding world.The Graphics are stunning and full of small Details and some rare yet stunning effects and mechanics (you will like it if you know how such programming mechanics work). If your Computer can handle them. The System Requirements are definitly not a joke and if you don't stick to them you won't have a good time. So know your Hardware and their counterparts. If a single part not matches the given requirements -> turn down to the next lower recommendet settings. If you have up to date current gen Hardware its the most beautifull game to date with great Performance. My 4080 is capable maxing out the game and provides high frame rates mostly far beyond 100fps in UWQHD and around 90-120fps in UHD. Including Raytracing and HDR for the extra eye candy without stuttering, lags or other disturbing factors. Solid 10/10 from me Thats how a game should look like in 2023. The Soundtrack is highly inspired by the Movie Soundtracks and fits every Moment and every Scene. The only thing that bothers me is that you can't use different languaged subtitles. The German voice actings in video games are mostly bad, Hogwarts legacy isn't a  exception. The English Voice Acting is great with some nice Details in the different used accents.The Combat System is refreshing different and thankfully at least for me highly intuitive. It's not overcomplicated and not oversimplified. At least for me (definitly not a die hard Harry Potter Fan) the game lives up the hype. As far as i see everything wich was promised is there.Get it if you like such games (and if your PC can handle it)Even the price is fair since there is possibly a high replay value because ever House has a sligtlhy differnet Story Progression and different House Quests as well."
3749,lörd farkwa ‡,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010992197/,1,,1,35.6,February,11,487,0,1,"Amazing. So well done. This will easily be a 200+ hour game (playing time, not inflated steam time). I'll give an honest review from a ~500 steam game ""game jumper"" and someone who thinks Harry potter is fun, but not really a potterhead.First off, it looks beautiful. The trailers looked odd? I guess is the best word. I was worried it would look rough. No, it's absolutely a beautiful game. However, I am using a 3090. My cousin (2070) has had issues. The castle is gorgeous. There are so many small details.The environment is huge and there is a lot to do. I was also worried that a lot of the gameplay would be in the castle. The beginning is pretty castle-inside-only, but you do move outdoors and then spend most of the main game out of the castle. The castle IS gigantic but there is a huge world outside, too. I am 15 hrs in and have only explored like 1/5th of the map.The player ""housing"" and beast keeping is cool. It's not too too in-depth, but it is useful. I spent a little time decorating my room and placing furniture. I have been capturing some cool animals so I can farm them for fur. I also have a nice plant growing operation for potion making.Combat is the perfect balance. It's dark souls-ish in the sense that you absolutely NEED to dodge and block attacks or you will die. But you don't spend 4 hours fighting 1 mob only to die by rolling off of a cliff. Potions are important, especially for boss fights.I had someone complain to me that there are only like 20 spells and that is too few. I disagree. The way combat is and the action bars are, having more spells would make the game unplayable. You can focus your talent points and items to use specific spells too.The story and atmosphere are amazing. Going to class is fun. Going to town is fun. Talking to people is fun. I am an impatient gamer and I usually skip cutscenes and blow through dialogue. Not here. I watch everything and listen to everything. I feel invested in what is happening, like I am watching a movie.Not many downsides. If I had 1 complaint it would be flying. The broom handles like a clunky mobile game. You dont hold W to go forward, you press shift to either stop or stay moving forward. It feels off. I am constantly crashing into stuff and flying into walls when I mean to stop because I'm holding ""S"" instead of tapping shift to stop. Some puzzles are repetitive and I get bored doing them for the 47th time, but it's not the end of the world.Ive only ran into 1 bug so far, and my brother had the same exact bug elsewhere in the world. I was running behind the great hall when suddenly I fell through the ground and died. I panicked as I hadn't saved in hours. But luckily somehow the game knew and autosaved as I fell (same happened to my brother). When i loaded in I was in the same spot but didn't fall through the ground. Overall this game is amazing. Buy it. You will not regret it. I promise you."
3750,Darth_Roxx,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199101597475/,3,,0,39.7,February,21,49,0,1,"I'd rate this game a 6/10. They have done a good job of envisioning and bringing a Harry Potter world to life. It's nice to look at and explore. However, after a while, it tends to become very repetitive and boring. :/ I was enjoying the story at first then that also became boring. Most of the exploration/open world activities get repetitive after a while. Do a merlin quest. Grab some beast. Get some chest. Kill the same bad guys. None of the characters are memorable. I kind of like Sebastián and Ominis, but even they didn't get developed too much. I like the tidbits of knowledge you get about the house founders as you play through some quests, but other than that, I don't feel like anything I did had any real meaning. It didn't change the storyline that much. I struggled to finish the game because I was just really bored. Still, I do think it's a decent game, and you may be better off doing the side quests and main quests only and don't do a lot of exploration as you will get burnt out by how repetitive it is. I think I'll play it again once there are maybe more updates and more mods to make the game more interesting. Right now, it's akin to a wide ocean that is not very deep at all. You have so many things to do, yet they are all repetitive and get tiring after a while. I really wanted to like it a lot more. There are way better open world games, so I think that's why as well I feel this one just missed the mark a bit. If you're a super Harry Potter fan, you may look past it. I'm a fan but not big enough to look past how boring the game became. Also, it is poorly optimized. Even with a 3090 and some settings tweaked, this thing drops fps lower 30 sometimes which sucks a lot."

3758,Kaiser_Tomas,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135246438/,2,,0,26.8,March,7,124,0,1,"I have to give credit where due, the artwork is astonishing. Truly a beautiful recreation of Hogwarts, the art team should be damned proud of themselves.Unfortunately that's about all the game has to offer, as other than being beautiful, it is extremely boring. -  ""Go to some cave which looks and feels just like the last one, fight a bunch of guys, earn some uninteresting dialogue"". No quest tries to do something different or introduce a new special mechanic. By the end i was just trying to complete everything as fast as i could cause i wanted to finish it and stop playing. -  It almost seems like it would be a smart combat that forces you to adapt to your enemies, but there is almost nothing like that. True some enemies have certain weaknesses, however they are quite hard to exploit since you have a small window to cast a particular spell, on top of that, these exploitations are generally not worth the trouble so you`ll end up just spaming whichever spell cools off first. And the game never forced me to change this with tough combat, this brainless method got me through to the end.- Along with my last point, comes the fact that there is  the game will try to tell you that there are X different types of goblins, XX different types of mages, and XX different types of animals or beasts, but in the end they all play out the same. There is no noteworthy difference between a goblin soldier and a goblin assassin other than some may have a shield which requires a certain type of spell (out of 3) to deactivate. Honestly more of a chore than an engaging combat mechanic. -  with no real risks or twists, quite the opposite of the original harry potter storylines. The main quest is also filled with plot holes, for example, the ministry saying there is no goblin threat and refusing to send help, all the mean time EVERY hamlet around Hogwarts is being harassed by violent goblins who will not doubt to try and kill children.-  I only found Sebastian's quest to be interesting since it had a gray morality, completing it resulted in progression by allowing to learn Dark spells and flush out characters. - Other than sebastian, the other  that it makes them boring. It makes them uninteresting and quite simply unhuman. No one is that good a person.- For a game that considers itself an RPG, the  No decision you make changes the game, and there is not much decision to make either way. When choosing dialogue options your choices are ""Be the nicest person ever"", ""Agree without being so nice"". There are no real friendships to make since choices don`t matter. ""You don`t wanna be Natty`s friend? We don`t care, we are choosing for you and she will be your best friend"" ""You don`t like a certain character`s attitude and would like to be an ass to him? well sorry, can`t do that. Everyone is your friend"". Hell within Hogwarts you can`t even have an enemy/rival as Malfoy was to Harry. Everyone is either your best friend, or the super boring bad guy who is just bad for the sake of being bad.- I understand the devs deciding this wouldn`t be a Hogwarts experience so I`m not gonna ask that of them. HOWEVER, this is a Hogwarts game and  Let me give you some examples. Classes only occur within the first hour of the game as simple 5 minute cutscenes. Certain missions in the game imply students can`t be up at night so you have to sneak, yet when free roaming if the day night cycle runs its course and nightime begins, you can just run around Hogwarts and no one will stop you. What makes the Forbidden forest the forbidden forest? Well i guess just the name cause other than that it is just like every other area of the open world. There are no house points, and no real impact on the house you choose. As another example, you can learn the unforgivable dark arts curses, yet you can use avada kadavra while fighting alongside a professor or classmate and they not bat an eye. These may seem like little things, but its all these little things that simply break the immersion and in my eyes are the biggest issue of this game.-  especially in scenes where the character is supposed to be shouting (its almost like when its 2 am in your house, and you wanna act like you are shouting but do it at a low volume since everyone is asleep). On top of that, you`ll get tired (and quite frankly pissed) by all the repeated one liners some characters will make throughout the game. For example each time you go past a fast travel spot (including after having just fast traveled), the foo flame statue will say one of 3 lines. This is EVERY TIME YOU FAST TRAVEL OR RUN PAST IT. As you can guess, thats a lot of time it says it. Same thing happens every time your character goes to Hoggsmeade (the main town), he'll say one of 2 lines. At this point this has become a meme.-  in the end most spells are the same. Damage or lift your enemy. The only exceptions to this are one that freezes, one that transforms enemies, and the 3 dark arts spells. All the rest do pretty much the same.-  Around mid game, the game tries to show you that you can use animal resources to improve your gear. However, each time you enter a cave, you'll find at least 10 chests which will certainly hold better gear than the one you are wearing. In the end this upgrading mechanic feels simply useless. You`ll always find better gear out there. Not that it makes much of a difference either way as the bonuses and effects of gear are practically non existent. I swear i played with a 80 offense cloak and accidentally equipped my first lvl 0 cloak and didn`t even notice until i opened the gear menu again 3 hours later.-  The game is one very long game. I honestly don`t tend to complain about the length of games and i do try to be as completionist as i can. However, this game offers a large numer of puzzles that are more of a chore than something fun to do. You can go through the world picking up flying pages, picking up stationary pages, picking up ancient magi balls which offer no challenge, do merling trials which are basically all the same yet the devs decided to put  (I`m not exagerating it is really 95 of them) in the game, etc. All these open world mechanics are just boring and have no real reward or sense of completion- This might be a personal nit pick but  and flying with the broom is SOO slow compared to what we are used to from the harry potter movies. Still a pity there was no quidich, but i guess they just ran out of time.Honestly i`m pretty shocked this game had such great reviews, i mean 93% on steam is nothing short of amazing. But i simply can`t understand it. Is it just me that finds all these problems? Or were we simply so desperate for a Harry Potter game that we were willing to look by all these issues?This is the first time I give a negative review, so i hope this helps for something. And if you do buy it, I do hope you enjoy it."

3760,Umi,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198260874476/,4,,0,55.5,March,1,106,0,1,"This was a promising game that I approached with an Open-Mind. I personally have only ever briefly read the books as a child, and have never watched a Harry Potter movie. I can say for certain that this was a very mediocre game, if it wasn't for the fact that it was in the Harry Potter world it would have bombed with negative reviews.My plan was to 100% complete this game to give a proper review, however I simply couldn't bring myself to complete repetitive Merlin trials, bandit camps, loot rooms-All copy and pasted mind you, nearly every single one of them. Most of the side-quests lacked world building, excitement, or even entertainment for that. The 3 main side-quests tied to achievements however I enjoyed very much, such as Sebastion's quest line, Poppy's quest line, and Natsai's quest line.The story for me was a 7/10 it wasn't bad, but I simply wish I had more control over what happened in the world. The feeling of choice was extremely lacking in this world, and the fact that I could use certain spells and not have consequences tied to them. The voice acting on the part of the main character you control is god awful, I couldn't tell if it was a real person or AI-Generated, simply boring voice work.The developers put 90% of their effort into building the world/environment, and 10 percent on everything else combined. The graphics in my opinion are also lack-luster. Looking at other games released before its time, it's optimization and graphics in general felt 2015 era. Not in all cases however, the world and game is beautiful regardless of that.The combat on the other-hand is okay, however the fact that trolls and bigger enemies, can TELEPORT to you across the arena to hit you in an instant without you being able to react to it is INSANE. IM A WIZARD... SO HOW CAN A BIG MOB TELEPORT TO ME WHEN I TELEPORT DASH AWAY?Apologies if this review is all over the place, I may change my review in time depending how this game's DLC and future look. But for now it will stay negative. People need to stop allowing game developers to half-ass games, especially on a franchise as big and beloved as Harry Potter. TL;DR Lack-Luster game design, gameplay, copy and pasted quests/locations/characters, Lazy voice acting and build design. Not worth 60$."

The only stand-out story was the side-quest to get the unforgivable curses.The gameplay is competent, but I found myself dominating every single fight.  On normal difficulty, even higher-level red-numbered ""boss"" enemies provide no challenge.Technically this game ran like ass.  I have a number of issues with it, on a machine that plays every other game in my library without issue.  I'm running an RTX 2060-S.I couldn't even play at 1920x1080 on Medium settings.

Even then, certain fights still turned into a slideshow unless I cranked some setting down further to Low, and once had to downscale to an even lower resolution.I tried at one point to watch youtube on a second monitor while doing random world quests.  It caused both the game AND the youtube video to stutter, drop frames, and full-on freeze.  I've NEVER had a game impact other applications in just an aggressive and invasive way.  It seems like this game was reaching outside of it's box into memory and resources it should not have had access to.When exiting the game, it would not actually close the process behind the scenes.  Steam would show the game as Running forever until I manually force-closed it.All-in-all, it was a mediocre game that ran like ass.  Wasted time well enough, but nowhere near worth the price tag."

The game is horrible optimized, even with a high end PC. Particles are the worst, only reason for hours is price tag. Wait for sale or fix for optimization.- Don't expect to use any of your brain cells playing this game, everything is going to be stuffed down your throat. Doing a puzzle? You'll get the solution by your character thinking out loud. Even on the hardest difficulty and all choices have ZERO consequences.EDIT: I know this is my personal view, but calling this game a RPG is a disgrace. It's like playing Assassins Creed: Valhalla, you're a ""viking"" on paper, but thats it. It's just one massive grind of either getting cosmetics or useless ""upgrades"" hidden behind a tedious task. Notice how all the good reviews is about how beautiful the game is and that you can pet cats.... Who cares, if that the reason for paying this amount for a game, then I guess i'm getting too old and goblinish..."
3767,Griffin Abstract,https://steamcommunity.com/id/griffin_abstract/,2,,0,86.5,February,20,919,0,1,"So this whole ""experience"" was ass to me, I really became disillusioned after about 70 hours during my forced second play through after my save file was nuked by a pc crash that probably was the games fault, can't be entirely sure about that though...I'll try to sum up all of my pros, and more importantly, my cons, without much further ranting, but do remember that everything I'm writing here is my personal experience with the game, if you enjoyed it that's great for you and I wouldn't ever want to take that from you. also some slight spoilers about game play ahead, you have been warned- the writing is shallow, cliche, and overall bad. story as well as side quests, I won't bore anyone with details here- the optimization, directly after release at least, is pretty bad. I played on recommended settings and 5 fps during cut scenes and game play were not uncommon, to an extent that makes the game practically unplayable. and that's even after applying some fixes I found online that helped at least a little- the game play gets old after about 30 hours even with all the spells at your disposal, which to be fair is about the time you need to complete the game when you ignore most of the side quests- the world relies heavily on fetch quests to have any content, to an extent that just makes everything feel like a chore at some point- the npcs are terribly buggy and don't contribute to immersion at all- the beast keeping/breeding system and the potions/herbology system are very underwhelming in general- the whole game is awfully unpolished, there pretty much isn't any part of this game that works 100%- the hard difficulty wasn't really all that hard for me personally, the late game especially is way too easy at some pointthe game does have a few pros as well though, sadly not enough to make me recommend the game to anyone, but here they are:- the world, when you can actually see it through the frame drops, is enormous and gorgeous. hogwarts castle in particular is a sight to behold- flying on your broom is incredible and for 90% of my play through, I didn't use fast travel because going places on my broom was way more fun for me- some of the spells can be combined to make some really cool combos- they actually give you a choice on whether you want to use and learn the unforgivable curses- the level where you - the room of requirement has some really cool design and is relatively customizable, definitely the best part of the game for me and a nice little creative outlet between missionsso yeah, you can really tell that this is avalanche softwares first game of AAA magnitude and all in all I really can't recommend this game to anyone if I'm being honest, but as I said earlier, this whole thing is very subjective and if you really want it, don't let me stop you. also if you're still reading this, why?on a completely different note, I grew up loving harry potter and the world and I still do, but it's really overhyped and I really cannot describe how much I dislike the author, and creating a whole game about one of the most problematic things about it, as in the goblins, really isn't a good idea to me. but here we are. have a good one"

At the time of this review, I've played about 21 hours and have only just scratched the surface.  It's an amazing feeling to live and participate in the world that we've read about and watched extensively!  Even if you didn't, you'd still get so much from this game.  The exploration is  with dynamic, candid events including students gabbing, broom-riders zipping overhead, and suits of armor scoffing and brawling.  Every time I jump into the game I turn off my additional monitors for that increased immersion that it has honed so well.The combat is fluid, responsive, and zippy. Power attacks  feel potent with enhanced ""thumpiness"" and ""oomph"".  Targeting took a few minutes to Get used to, but now it's second nature.  I freaking LOVE parrying enemy spells.The story is wondrous!  Fully voice acted, facial expressions are vivid, and I'm totally engrossed.  It just keeps wowing me.I fell through the world once while running around the side of the dark arts side of the building, but I'm chalking it up to a professor thinking I was up to no good. ;)If you couldn't tell, I have nothing but good things to say about the game, 100% recommend to you, your friend, and your mother.  Happy casting! o7"
3776,Webster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Twiztedterry/,1,,1,100.4,February,26,564,0,1,"Here's my final take on Hogwarts: Legacy after finally hitting ~40+ hours (still haven't finished the game).A few items to note:I played on the hardest difficultyI disabled the minimap functionI'm R/G colorblind, so take any reference to color with a heaping spoonful of umami.In a triumphant return to the World of Wizardry, Hogwarts Legacy does it's level best to make you feel like you're a student in the titular school. It does this by incorporating a need for education, by serving the purpose of training you in the over two dozen spells in the game. That is to say, that the education system stops there. Any who come to Hogwarts: Legacy expecting a simulation of classroom life will be soured by the experience. Your chosen house makes very little difference in the gameplay experience, in truth, your house really has no value at all in the overall scheme of the game, since most of your time will be spent outside the school performing tasks that are unrelated to education.However, Hogwarts Legacy does manage to capture what it's like to be a Special Child like 'ol lighning scar himself. You are set against the backdrop of the school, and given the barest amount of instruction in how to handle the myriad of messes you'll find yourself in. I oftentimes found myself stumped or confused as to how to solve a puzzle because I hadn't completed the requisite course to acquire the spell needed to solve it. You'll also be getting attacked by basically everything that exists outside of the many spotted hamlets and towns in the Scottish Highlands; be they brigands or bandits, poachers or dark wizards, spiders or trolls. The fun within this game lies in the combat. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is great, and the story is damn good. But the combat here is unlike anything I've played in my storied history of playing video games. You'll find yourself frequently rushing to pick the correct spell, or quickly aborting an expelliarmus in order to cast a protego, to avoid being disarmed yourself.The game does an amazing job of making the combat feel like real wizarding combat, sure. You can possibly survive in a fight against a dozen dark wizards, but you're going to have a difficult time, as every diffindo or crucio cast your way will create a hazard requiring a dodge, and all other spells will need to be blocked with protego. Now, it sounds on the face to be a straightforward think, this combat. The change comes, however, in the form of spell interactions. You see, a hastily cast glacius could lead into any number of others, such as a simple basic cast, or maybe an incendio. However, if you instead opt for a diffindo, descendo, or depulso, you'll be pleasantly rewarded with bonus damage due to the interaction of slamming or slashing the ice, causing it to shatter. These interactions are many and virtually none are explained by the courses, these are the things you must teach yourself. And all this is without getting into the fact that spells can be uniquely effective on certain creatures in certain cirucmstances. For example, cast a flippendo right after blocking a troll's club with a perfectly timed protego? Great, you just flipped that troll's club right up into his smug face. Cast a descendo while a spider is preparing a strike, bam - you've just buried that spiders fangs into the ground. This goes a long way toward making the combat feel real. That being said. The game does have some pretty glaring gaps that prevent it from being a complete experience. The lack of depth in the gear system is my biggest gripe, with the lack of quidditch being a close second. But there is one area that the game succeeds entirely, and that is being good. It's hard to remember the last time we had a really good magic-based RPG experience. So Hogwarts Legacy manages to squeeze itself in at the exact perfect time to be appreciated for what it does well.9/10"
3777,RazulDarkwood,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RazulDarkwood/,1,,1,96.2,February,21,119,0,1,"I want to start with this - I am didn't grew up with Harry Potter I watched the movies and I don't care about politics. I am a gamer I prefer to leave my comment after I've played around 2/3 of a game at least in order to have a grounded view over things. The game reminds me of Fable 3 (which I like a lot, which may also surprise some people). The sense of adventure is using from this game however I have to admit that there are moments when the immersion in the world breaks and that is around 50/50 percent thanks to the bad optimization, however I see that the devs work on workarounds and patches in order to improve this, the other 50% is thanks how the game is structured. Someone said in the beginning that some quests may become unavailable after some time so I tried playing most of the side quests from the beginning which stripped the main story to its bare bones at the end and made me fly through it thous making it feel short. The story is ok, its not ground breaking and I don't think its a bad thing here. The game makes the world shine, its fine that you are THE ONE, however I love it that compared to the world you are still nothing. The enemies won't just lie and die because you are THE CHOSEN ONE, they will fight you with all they got. The thing that drags the game to the ground are the NPC's lack flavor. Out side of those that are the main focus in your quests and the teachers, every other NPC is just there... they are rarely memorable. The things that I liked most was that around 80% of the puzzles are unique in one way or another. Some repeat, yes, however those that do are usually really good so its understandable to repeat them once or twice. Some dungeons are like missed opportunities though. Its ok to make something to open the dungeon, but at least put another puzzle inside not just a box with loot, it feels underwhelming. The lower part of the map feels rushed. I guess that is when they made a delay, we know they even cut a portion of the map so I guess they rushed the one below just to have as much content as possible. The lower part was also the place where I found most bugs. Even with everything that I mentioned the game was MADE WITH LOVE! I can't deny that the devs showed great amount of love and attention to detail for which they have my respect. I rarely see such love in games nowadays. If you want a nice fantasy story try the game, you won't regret it. Don't expect Mass Effect level of story, but those that like Fable series level of story telling I think they will love this game."

I grew up with Harry Potter even tho it wasn't really that important to me, I was more a Lord of the Rings kid. Still this is the game that I always wanted from the franchise. This game really does feel like a passion project of the devs and you can see it from all the small details that liter the world. Hogwarts itself is probably the most impressive structure I have ever seen in a game, period. You can go pretty much everywhere without fail its incredible. Combat feels fun and engaging and the spells are just fun to use.PC performance could be better but the optimization is not terrible, which is a bit refreshing for a modern AAA game, I did not have any bugs and glitches besides an NPC being stuck and walking on the spot, which was solved by reloading. I really do hope this game gets a bunch of DLC cause I would buy them.

I haven't had any game breaking bugs thankfully, although my graphics card will probably explode if I even consider turning any graphics setting higher than medium.... Nevertheless, the creation of the own character, the quite open game world and of course the combat is a nice refreshment. I love the companions (Sebatsian best boi, change my mind.) which would be nice though if you could take the companions with you permanently ^^All in all a great game and probably the wet dream for real Harry Potter fans.

The story is good, quests are NOT boring and repetitive like most other ""RPG"" type games out there. The combat is my favorite, never a boring moment there!My one gripe is that they gave in to woke silliness and added/changed some things to suit that crowd. All it does is pull you out of the world you're supposed to be immersed in. Remember, this is the 1800's, this woke stuff isn't a thing."
3827,drinksandjokes2015,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodgoreandghosts/,2,,0,14.8,February,20,69,0,1,"While the graphics and voice acting is top-notch and attention to detail is there, there is something fundamentally off about the game-play itself. The map system is poor and confusing and is not intuitive at all. The combat system is a bit clunky but works ok. Aside from that there isn't a consistent ways to earn money other than when you might randomly stumble upon an item that you might sell, and when trying to locate items to create potions or complete quests there sometime is no hint as to where these supplies or resource might be, which gets a bit tiring and confusing, especially when you cannot buy said resource or supplies. And much of the game-play feels like the world itself is very empty. What I am more bummed about is that they had the chance to do a very deep dive, like that of Fallout 4 of Diablo, for the skills and spell tree, however they didn't try any thing new but rather just used the handful of spells and abilities that fans of the franchise already know. The game so far hasn't added much of anything to the lore or story, so at the very least I was hoping for some fun mechanics and really be able to customize my character a bit more, but the system to do so just isn't there. It feels like a very high-end game made for children, which is disappointing since the core fan-base are now adults who grew up with the books and movies. Feels more like a cash grab for the franchise than it does fan-service."

The game however does fall into a lot of the pitfalls of other open-world games. *cough Ubisoft* Where we end up doing the same puzzles with the same exact solutions multiple times, fighting the same fights again and again, and with all the spells there is also such a huge missed opportunity for more systematic gameplay of games like Breath of the Wild. There's also no time to properly get to know many of the otherwise delightfully written cast of characters, before the game is already over.Overall, though, it amazes me how this got made so many years after the main movies ended and with all the controversy surrounding the property. This one is for the fans and while it has its flaws, it's definitely worth experiencing if you count yourself in that number. Otherwise, probably wait for a sale at least?"

My complaints: The amount of HP references are depressing don't get me wrong, love me some HP. But I wanted to see Hogwarts BEFORE HP not spend hours getting reminded of it at every possible opportunity. Even the background dialog is referencing HP. A couple of easter egg references would have been plenty buuut no, they apparently had such faith in this game that they decided to ride the coattail of every starstruck HP fan loving it no matter what.Its pretty repetitive, not just in the copy paste faces but the side quests are so...boring. I found I had the most fun not doing a quest and just wandering. That and it my personal goal to get all the moons. On that note WHY does Alohomora have a damn mini game to unlock something? This is not Skyrim, its a spell to unlock something dang it i would like it to just do it.Last thing, it totally breaks the illusion of being in Hogwarts when you can freely wander any where at night and not get into trouble! So next game let us have to sneak around at night to get moons and treasure and we can quickly slip away through locked doors with Alohomora that works like it should."

3838,Otohoto,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Otohoto/,1,,1,72.9,February,21,366,0,1,"I grew up reading harry potter, they're the books that made me fall in love with literature when I was maybe 10yo (mostly fantasy and sf to this day but still), so i was pretty hyped with this game, the thought of exploring a fully open Hogward really was appealingBut i have to say it, this game is pretty disappointingThe good points :-This game looks great! Every single area of the game clearly had a lot of love and efforts put into, the castle is majestic and you’ll get to visit almost all of the locations of the books/movies, all the little towns feels uniques, the dungeons are nice looking, and every part of the map have its own identity, from dark forests to windy coasts it's all looking amazing, this is clearly the best selling point of this game-The gameplay is fun, it's nervous, require some adaptability and is very rewarding when you get to master it, i advice to play the game on hard difficulty otherwise it's clearly too easy-Poppy Sweeting side quests, the only interesting quests imo, but that's mostly because you're dealing with magical creatures I guess-And... That’s it, sadlyThe ""meh"" points :-The collectibles, if you plan to 100% the game be prepared for a grind (i don't know why i did that to myself), there is some activities in the Highlands, but you can experience them all in the first few hours, after that you'll only find stuff you've already done somewhere else on the map, the best example being the Merlin's trials, there is only 9 different types of trials but there is 95 to do in total, it gets really repetitive and absolutely not rewarding after a while, why bother building a world this big and detailed just to fill it with the same things over and over? At least make sure your repeating activities are fun to play-This lockpicking minigame, why is this in the game? I don't mind a lockpicking minigame in an elder scroll or a fallout game, because it fit in the setting, but here i'm using MAGIC, the magician say the spell and the lock open, that's it! Here it's only breaking your momentum everytime you find a lock, and that's if you took to the time to find enough of a special kind of collectible to UPGRADE your spell to level 3 (??), otherwise you sometime have to leave it and come back later with the upgraded spell to get the collectibles it's keeping, even if it's in the middle of a dungeon (collect collectible to be able to collect even more collectibles? What a great gameplay loop)-The facial animations, i get that this is a hard thing to do in video games, but most characters looks like robots, and I can ignore bad animations and stillness in characters when a game is generous with the rest of the content (Fallout new vegas, The Witcher 3…), but here it’s very frustrating to watch if you combine it with the major downside :The bad point(s?) : Writing and immersion. I don't understand how the people in charge failed to understand that the writing and immersion were the two most important parts to work on in a game set in the world of Harry Potter, this game struggle to capture you and is all the time reminding you that you're playing a video gameThe main character is an empty husk, s/he have no personality, no background, no motive, the only choice you can make that will have an ""impact"" on the game is the starting house, ""impact"" because apart from changing your common room that you have no reason to visit once you took a good look at it and the colours on some outfits it's completely useless When you're presented a dialog option you can guess by the end of the dialog that all the option you had led to the same results without even needing to reload to check, if my choices have no impact whatsoever on the game and story then don’t give me a choiceThe plot is forgettable at best when it's not weird or just bad, there are very few side quests for a world this big and most of them are just uninteresting fetch questsThe characters are constantly explaining to you the plot and reminding you things you saw 30 minutes beforeThe game fails at being funny, sad or epic for the most part, i remember one epic moment toward the end, and Poppy Sweeting side quests which are pretty good but that's it, the rest of the plot couldn’t catch my attention because of how “standard” it isThe castle looks really, really good, but there is nothing to do in it apart from searching for collectiblesThe game struggle so much to have its own identity that it's constantly rubbing your face with things and scenes you've already seen in harry potter, everytime pushing you out of it's own story and settingYou spend the whole game fighting and killing poachers, because poaching is bad you see? But in the end you’re forced to turn to a poacher yourself if you want to upgrade your gear, capture animals, or “save” them as the game say, put them in vivariums, harvest resources from them to upgrade your clothes, breed them; you can even sell their offspring if you need some easy money The guy who upgrade your lockpicking spell want you to collect a good number of a certain item hidden in the castle and nearby villages, he want us to do that because the said items ""terrify"" him and he doesn't feel at ease with these things around, but that mean he know where to find them right? If he did not he'd have no reason to be afraid right? Well if you know just tell me where they are maybe? Who wrote that? Just make this guy a collectioner searching for rares items and it instantly make more sense because right now he's just being an as*holeThere is a lot of things like that that are frustrating to see if you think about what this game could have been if they hired some real writers and worked on the immersion, i would not mind this game being 50% of it's current size if that meant we could have a captivating story and a more interactive and lively HogwardI do still recommend the game because it looks great and is very fun to play, but if you’re a fan of harry potter don’t expect to feel like you’re a student in hogward, you’re more like a visitor in a museum, a very pretty museum"

3840,@Corefitz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Corefitz/,1,,1,90.5,February,13,332,0,1,"An aboslutely magical game!Having 100%'ed the game now (including all collectibles) I feel like I can give it a propper and fair review.Disclaimer: I'm avoiding spoilers to give those that have a legitmate interest a fair chance.PROS:-The game looks and feels amazing to play, the moment-to-moment combat is addictive and well balanced, every spell you cast feels impactful, dodging and blocking feels super rewarding... when done right, and punishing when you fail or don't react.-Visually, I'm happy to say I'm able to run on the highest of settings with ray-tracing on as well and... MY GOD. This is how I've always imagined exploring the wizarding world. It looks amazing! A few minor details stick out to me personally, but it is only REALLY obscure details.-The world feels alive! Truly, it does! Every little hamlet you come across feels like it's its own little tight community, every dungeon, den or camp you come across feels well made, only the treasure vaults is very repetitively in their designs most of the time. Enemies react to your playstyle! I went from an all out aggression style, to a stealthy one, mid-way through the game. After a little while, enemies mentioned more and more about my stealthyness over my previous style, but never forgetting that I had done things more 'wands-blazing' either.-Character custiomization is great! There's even a fair few things you can change post character creation! Transmog system is present, free and easy to use! And on that note, there's some gorgeous pieces avalible for collecting... I would highly recomment a -key- sidequest!-Choices are present and while I have yet to dive deeper into those, they seem limited mostly, but not entirely, to sidequests. (Take this with a grain of salt as, again, I have yet to dive into a different character propperly yet.)-The story is my biggest caviot though, albeit it's still only a small one. While it drives the game forward and does so well enough, I find that the sidequests draws me in much better. That's not to say the story is bad, because it isn't. I am just left with questions unanswered after having finnished the story.CONS:-The game lacks from optimization issues, as I've had a few game breaking glitches and even a a crash or two. but I cannot stress enough: THESE ARE FEW! compared to a lot of the other half-baked AAA games we get these days, Hogwarts Legacy stands MUCH cleaner and better polished from the get-go! and it's worth playin through as it is right now.-There is a certain 'Dark Arts challange' that have enemies mentioning you using Dark Arts upon completion, even though, when I did the challange, I hadn't even learned any of said arts, this persists throughout the game. I suspect that the game checks if you've used a Dark Art more than once, it's fair game to mention it.. even though the challange doesn't logically have any relation to the rest of the game what so ever. Because I have otherwise not used a single Dark Art in my first playthrough. Breaks my immersion a bit, but noone else even mentions it so it's a little weird.CONCLUSION:While Hogwarts Legacy is, to my personal preference, a puzzle driven game, if you're not into those types of games, there's story mode for you, which allows you to solve a decent bit of the puzzles with the press of a button. I can't say how many as I didn't play on Story mode, but I know it's there.On top of that, the game left me in tears of joy on more than a few occations. It can be an emotional rollercoaster if you allow yourself to be gripped by it.And let's be honest here: Flyring across The Black Lake on either Broom or Beast during sunsets/rises simply feels freaking amazing."

The graphics were incredible and exploring Hogwarts was incredible. I have been a huge Harry Potter fan for over 20 years and I really felt like they had brought the world from the books to life.But I was wrong. The world in this game is not alive, it's just a husk pretending to be alive. An illusion. The game is shallow, boring and empty.Never did I feel like my character was really mine, there is not really any choices to be made at all. This is an adventure game, not a RPG. But hey, adventure games can be great with a good story right? Yes they can! But this story is about as entertaining as bird watching (sorry to those who enjoy birds). The school feels empty, students don't react to anything you do. They don't react to the environment. It's just all so plain. This game is the water cracker of RPGs.I wish I could get a refund. Perhaps buy this game if you get it on sale for like $20. It's perhaps worth that much to take a virtual tour of this dull and empty hogwarts museum..5/10"

I came into this expecting a Harry Potter level story with me learning about the characters, being able to go on adventures with them and thwarting Ranrok's plan together. Instead, I got the most unimaginative and frustrating story I could've imagined. I really wanted to like it, I really did. The most interesting part of the story was the pensieve memories. Literally the only thing I was looking forward to story wise. Sebastian's entire character is that he wants to cure Anne and hes going to do whatever it takes to do it. There is 0 complexity, thats literally it. His entire story line is him teaching you curses and saying ""I have to do this to help Anne!"" You can't reason with him, you can't try to stop him, you can only select choice dialogues that all end up leading to the same place. Natty's entire character is stopping Harlow. She had a tragedy happen to her when she was younger, and that's it. Poppy is the animal lover with a complex family background, but that ♥♥♥♥ gets zero exploration. Poppy loves beasts but comes from a family of poachers. However, her Grandma seems to be a researcher or shares a similar extreme interest in beasts and the care of them. So how did her parents come to become poachers? Instead of asking these questions and getting some answers, you can only say stuff like ""Oh, im so sorry that happened to you"" or find out the most surface level ♥♥♥♥. There is also no companion system or anything like that. You can't walk up to the friends you know and go on an adventure to beat up poachers or loyalists. There will be multiple times your character will say stuff like ""I really shouldn't be here alone"", but you also have no choice but to be there alone. It doesn't feel like you have a group of friends at Hogwarts, the entire game feels very lonely with no meaningful relationships made. Combat AI - The combat AI is sometimes good, sometimes bad. In the fight against Rookwood, half of the AI just stood there doing nothing. It was like they saw 5 bogies targeting me and decided to take a break. Other times, they'll  stagger spell casts so if you protego and stupefy someone you'll get nailed by another spell and surround you. Stealth combat is pretty dumb. They'll watch everybody turn to stone and have no reactions. They'll occasionally run to the spot if they saw someone die in front of them, but you can just walk away and wait for them to reset, then rinse and repeat. It's pretty boring.Final Boss Battle - He only has 1 form. Big bad dragon. You destroy the three orbs with the correct color spell, then you attack him. This continues on for literally the entire boss fight until the end where he lands (WOW!). After he lands he turns into a Graphorn pretty much. Dodge the charge and fire breath and then beat his ass. He had this extremely large build up where he reveals that he has Miriam's wand and then destroys the container to absorb the final repository, for it to fall flat and become extremely lazy as he just becomes a red dragon that breathes fire at you. Like what was the point of all that? Got me all excited to fight a juiced up Ranrok who was gonna throw a bunch of spells at me for it to be a dragon with multiple phases that does the exact same thing each phase.Gripes:Beasts - You can't interact with them and they don't exhibit any special behaviors. It would have been cool if I put two Graphorn's in the room of requirement, and saw them exhibit territorial behaviors or play fighting of some kind. It would've been cool to see the Unicorns prancing around together. It would've been nice to see the beasts interact with each other, or groom each other. It would've been nice if I could interact with the beasts in ANY way besides summoning a brush or food for them to collect beast byproducts. All they do is walk around and graze or lay down. The only interaction you can do with the beasts is summon a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BALL. Yeah, the most interesting thing I can do with these beasts after rescuing them is watch them eat and walk around or summon a ball for them to run into and knock around. There is nothing magical about them after you rescue them. Wand Choice - You customize the appearance of the wand and thats it. The capability of the wand doesn't change based off of the core you choose or anything like that. Seems like such a waste for there to be no difference. Could've played around with attack range, damage reliability, cooldowns, etc. Also why is the basic attack always red? I can't change the color of that either? House Cup - Theres barely any emphasis or point in this. The points don't matter because at the end of the game you'll get 100 points and win the house cup anyways. There is no competition and its not satisfying at all in the end. One house will have some points, your house will have the most points, and two of the other houses will have none at all if you look at the points in the Great Hall. Dark Arts - Dark arts are op as ♥♥♥♥ and theres no downside to using them. No one will be wondering why you just used Avada Kedavra, it insta kills bosses like Harlow and trolls, etc. If you think that cooldown is how they balanced it, just pop a focus potion and spam the other spells then you have it back in no time. They keep talking about unforgiveable curses being bad and all but theres no repercussion or story impact to you using it. I understand that it probably wouldn't be as fun open world wise for you to have restrictions on your capabilities, but it felt so illogical it took me right out of the game and had me frustrated.Bosses - You can assassinate most of the mini-bosses. Avada Kedavra will kill them all. You'd think for being proficient in killing people with that curse, they would also have some measure of combating it. Especially as a boss.Immersion - I CAN'T GET IMMERSED MAN. Maybe my game was bugged, but the first time flying on the Hippogryph, there was no music. Took me right out, all I could think of was man, this thing is slow as ♥♥♥♥, feels slower than my broom. Walked into the Great Hall and it was like I was back at basic training in the Chow Hall, silent as ♥♥♥♥. Took like 1 minute for sounds to start playing, but it was still kinda quiet. Walking through Hogwarts feels very lonely, there is barely enough volume with the chatter so it feels like no one is talking, when I spawn a Hippogryph or Graphorn out of my bag and onto school grounds, there is no reaction. Nobody cares that an extremely massive and rare magical beast just appeared out of nowhere, and that I'm riding it. There is barely any quips when you walk around about stuff you did. It'll sometimes randomly pop into conversation for quests where they're like, ""You're the kid who killed the troll right?"". It doesn't feel like you accomplished anything when I play or that you are celebrated for the deeds you chose to do."

The game itself had its potential and perhaps if it had been more diversed (not in racial way) e.g. with Quidditch and Broom racing, I would have enjoyed it more.Anyway, it's a must-play for all HP fans and it worth playing at least once.Cats <3"
3860,Knight,https://steamcommunity.com/id/strider999999/,3,,0,70.1,February,12,"1,044",0,1,"Really impressive early game and pretty satisfying combat but the further in you get the more it seems it was rushed out the gate far too early. The expansive map has less depth than a Genshin impact clone, the main story and especially its ending was really unimpressive. The Sallow storyline was easily the peak of the game, with many of the other stories being fairly low stakes and inconsequential to the point it feels like it was written by someone else entirely. Many of the games collectibles only lead to mediocre cosmetic rewards. The biggest sin this game commits is that your actions have absolutely zero consequences. I tried to play the game as ""evil"" as I possibly could and it just didn't matter, I still woke up the next day a normal hogwarts student, being celebrated for all my heroic achievements and none of it really mattered at all."

I was concerned when I heard about this title that it would just be a half-hearted attempt at a mediocre game for a bit of a cash grab from many of the Harry Potter fans. I am pleased to say that's it's not only better than I'd imagined but is one of the best games I've played in years. There doesn't seem to be many bugs at all and my only recommendation is to get the gear slot upgrades as quickly as possible. I don't want to spoil anything and so I won't list how to get them (sorry), but when you progress the story you will have challenges that unlock more gear slots and this will save you TONS of trips to go and sell, or from destroying gear and ultimately wasting money."

3864,Savrox,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Savrox/,3,1,1,55.1,February,11,720,0,1,"As a Harry Potter Fan it was an instant buy for me. But was it worth it?Story: Around 15 hours in i have to say the story is decent. Nothing spectacular, no hiccups either. You start in as a 5th Year at Hogwarts and master almost every Spell immediately. The lessons are quite short and i wished they were a bit longer. I would've enjoyed if the game lets you start in 1st Year and you would've learned some of the spells via time and year skips with funny or iconic events or classes. You just feel like you got there and own this place.Sidequests are alright. Just a few Ubisoft-type sidequests. Most of them are alright, some are longer and much more detailled.World: The world is spectacular! It's amazing to deepdive into this world of Wizardry and phantastic beasts. The world is packed with collectibles all around the lore of places e.g. Hogwarts, Hogsmeade etc.On top of that, you gain upgrades and new equipment via challenges and collectibles. In addition you can loot equipment. Furthermore you can explore the world on top of your broom or favorite mount, solve riddles, finds hidden tombs, rescue magical creatures from poachers and clear bandit camps. The music completes this experience. All in all nothing's really new, but no upsets either. The game reminded me several times of Witcher 3 or similar games. Nothing really wrong with that. It still identifies as it's own world, it's own story and it's own experience.Performance: Pre-Release i heard a few things and was sceptical. I've got i mid PC and it runs on medium settings at 60fps and thats what you get. It's not beautiful, not ugly either. Playable to say the least. Framedrops are quite rare, every once half an hour.""The Topic"": Well, i'am tired about all the cancellation ♥♥♥♥. Her statements are wrong, everbody knows this. But this doesn't make the world she build years back less loveable or enjoyable. The game itself is gorgeous, was build by a team that loves this Franchise and is worth to be played. That's it, nothing more to be said!"

3869,Axeploseph,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Axeploseph/,1,1,1,69.5,March,14,"1,445",0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy: Digital Deluxe Edition 4I loved growing up with the Harry Potter books and movies. The previews had me hyped, and it was the first video game I was able to convince my wife who doesn't game to play along with me (she didn't want to play but wanted to watch me play through which she did).Preordered on Steam, full price: $69.99As soon as the 72 hour early access window started. Only a little more to do before the true ending is unlocked as of posting this review.Wow, a lifetime of buying most things gaming on the cheap, on sale, last-gen, second-hand and bundled. I have picked and chose a few times to buy triple a games full price, and even fewer times I've preordered a triple a game. Despite the controversy surrounding the game, this time, I chose correctly.Attending Hogwarts in an open world RPG was truly surreal and I gladly rode the nostalgia wave. The main story was enjoyable and fresh as it took place far before Harry, Ron, and Hermione got there. There were three relationship quest lines that were well done. The puzzles were fun too, solvable and with decent variation. There were even a few unexpected twists along the way.I had two characters in this game. A Gryffindor (save file with my wife) who beat the final boss at level 31 and a Ravenclaw I played as on my Steam Deck who is currently level 11 (this game was pleasant to play on the Steam Deck on recommended settings). I found myself not enjoying the game as much when I would try to start knocking out all the collect-a-thons (*cough* Demiguises *cough*) and side quests scattered throughout the land. As an ex-achievement hunter, I was getting frustrated and I started to see through the nostalgia. A lot of this extra stuff is not for me. So, we carried on with the rest of the story, defeated the final boss and now found we needed to be level 34 to get the true ending of the game.As it stands, I have 55% of my field guide completed for my Gryffindor character. I have not made up my mind yet as to how much of the extra stuff I'm going to go for but my wife and I do want the true ending, so we need a few more levels. My wife and I were sorely disappointed this game did not feature more activities/features that would make the experience of being a Hogwarts student (not just being at Hogwarts) more immersive. They could've done minigames, more classes, relationships in school, pranks, wizards chess, Quidditch (with all the yearly sports game releases, we desperately need a new Quidditch game!), etc. Make us sneak around at night to avoid getting into trouble and not just for a few quests. At night we could pick the lock of rooms with professors inside and we wouldn't get in trouble.Games I would consider to be in my All-Time top 10 (I don't currently have a list) include the Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt and Red Dead Redemption II. Both have amazing stories and worlds you would want to spend countless hours getting lost in and side questing. Hogwarts Legacy is so beautiful and immersive, but it feels less like a vast open world with so much to do and more like a very beautiful walking simulator. Of course you do far more than a walking simulator but that content isn't where this game shines, it shines in the accurate portrayal of the world so many grew up dreaming of, Hogwarts, Hogsmeade and the surrounding areas. IMO this is a great game that has a stellar nostalgia filter. I think, once we get the true ending, I'll be done with this game and maybe revisit it again when my kids are older. Or, ya know, I'll complete the field guide and achievement hunt, I don't know yet.If you buy the game, turn off Show Hud Tracking Icons and the minimap (and subtitles). Your field guide will help you follow your quest objectives and you will experience far more immersion.We beat the final boss and only need to gain a few more levels to unlock the final quest of the main story. After that, will we 100% the game? Undecided as of right now.Yes, I had a blast being a student at Hogwarts and would be delighted to return again in future installments if there are any. But please have Quidditch this time! (Better yet, make a new dedicated Quidditch game!)Me: Finally got to the final boss, zoned in and ready for an epic battle.My Wife: Honey, look out, the cat.Me: Cat? There are no cat's in this fight.My Cat: *clicks my pc's power button*Haha, I loaded back in and was outside the boss room with battle music going on and unable to reenter so I had to reload an autosave that was thankfully right before the final fight."

Its perfectly playable, but does shift between 45-90 fps for me with ultra settings / raytracing off.

I'm quite impressed with the magic system and combat - it all feels great.  And the details and world feel downright magical.  I really hope they continue to develop DLC for this game as I would be delighted for more."
3879,Neurion,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaybounty/,3,,1,32.8,February,11,330,0,1,"20 hours in so far. I can say that the game is definitely fun!Pros:- The map is much larger than I expected.- Exploring the world (Especially from the air) is excellent.- The combat is very fluid and satisfying. - The world feels alive.- The graphics are gorgeous.- Flying feels amazing on K&M (I've heard flight on a controller is bad, though I've not experienced that myself).- The beast mechanics are awesome.- Growing your own ingredients and brewing your own potions feels immersive.Cons:- The game can lag in some areas quite badly despite my PC being of a high standard.- You can't look up or down for some reason when flying.- Interaction with NPCs outside of quests is virtually non existent.- NPCs are very forgettable and don't have a lot of depth to them. - You can encounter a lot of invisible walls when trying to climb in places that you feel like you should be able to climb. - While you can occasionally choose a positive or negative response in dialogue, it feels very much on rails how your character behaves and reacts. Verdict:Overall, I am definitely glad that I bought the game. However, the lack of dialogue options will make for a very repetitive replay should you want to play again in the future. There definitely needs to be patches to sort out the performance and bugs, but they're to be expected at this stage. They 100% need to add the ability to look up and down when flying, I can't understand why that isn't a thing when moving the mouse up or down doesn't affect anything else... It makes it very difficult to tell what's beneath you. I'm usually one to utilize stealth over combat, however the combat in this game is too fun to ignore. If you're a Wizarding World fan, then I'd definitely recommend it. However, if you're looking for a deep RPG with lots of choices and stuff, then it won't be for you. Hopefully the game will improve with patches and DLC."

The thing that completely ruins the experience however is the performance. This for some reason is a heavily debated fact, but in my opinion the PC version of this game is horribly optimized. Some people will be able to play the game without any issues, some will experience crazy stutters and crazy fluctuating framerates (this is what is happening in my case) and some people will not even be able to start the game as it crashes on the seizure warning at the start. Modders have release hotfixes that help a little with these issues, but the fact remains that this game should not have released in this state. With how big and content packed games are these days, it's understandable for there to be some glitche/bugs here and there, but these issues make the game practically unplayable for people experiencing them (which seems to be the vast majority of people even if some people would tell you otherwise.) If you really want to play this game, please either buy the game on PS5 or XBOX OR wait for patches to be released that fix theses issues or they will ruin your experience.Update 1 : Performance has been slowly but steadily increasing thanks to patches, but not everything is perfect still, especially Hogsmeade. I still wouldn't recommend buying the game full price yet, but the game is getting closer to being genuinely enjoyable without many issues."

The developers are relying too much on fillers, like finding over one thousand collectibles or repetitive puzzles and side quests.Loot and items are pretty much pointless. Things like brooms and wands do not make any difference. Got a legendary clothing piece? It will be replaced in a minute by a green level item and inventory management becomes tedious.After a while the game just felt like a chore.Don't be fooled by the amount of hours Steam displays. Getting 100% in-game and 42/45 achievements took about 67 hours, but it was not fun.Now I will have to force myself through it and replay part of the game three more times to get the last achievements.The performance in general was barely acceptable. Average fps was about 90 to 70-ish but would often drop into the 30's, even with DLSS (which games should not rely on to make up for lack of optimization).Walking around, especially in Hogwarts would stutter a lot.My computer is far above the recommended specs: CPU: Intel i9-9900K 5,2 GHz sustained on all cores -HTGPU: Evga RTX 3080 ti FTW3 Ultra 12GBRAM: Corsair Dominator 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 16/18/18/36 3200 MHzSSD: Samsung 970 EVO Plus M.2 500GBMonitor: Lenovo Legion Y27gq-20 1440p 165HzIn the end I would just say it is sadly a wasted potential and absolutely not worth full price."

Starting with the story, story is the weakest part of this game, and the best part of the story is related to Sebastian quest line which is not the main mission of the game. Visuals are 10/10 and the best part of the game. RPG elements are very weak and they feel forced in. World is big and empty, there is nothing to do except flying over the map and admiring the view. There is no sense of discovery. School  is very underwhelming. This could be a ""Bully"" type of game, however, you dont do anything remarkable with the classes. All of them are cut scenes and you barely do anything related to that said class. This is the biggest pet peeve for me.Overall this game was very hyped and the scores were not really deserved.

The absolute best-case scenario is that you get an okay-ish clothing style or some cosmetics for your room of requirement, but 90% of the time it's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scarf that you immediately sell.The ONLY thing that increases the combat difficulty is the number of opponents. The combat itself with different combinations of spells is fun and satisfying, but I am not kidding, moving up the tournament table in dueling club simply adds more enemies.Also, enemy variability is poor. Approximately 1 hour in you've encountered all of them.The story is meh. Actions and dialogues seldom make sense, and if they do, they are boring.But the worst thing of all...Freaking ALOHOMORAI cannot comprehend how a team of developers, grown-up respected people, would think that adding this lockpicking mechanic would improve anything at all. It is easy, but time consuming for every lock. And there are a lot of them!And you don't improve, nothing changes with any lock, you just twist two circles until the lock starts moving. No skill required, just angelic patience."

Normal Difficulty, low settings, as a Ravenclaw.The story is actually engaging if you let it it be, but it can also be easy to just say ""not interested"" which is an argument for both good and bad. Overall 8/10 on the story.The gameplay (take away the game optimisation for now)is incredible and I think its what we've been asking for. What I will say m&k controls are all over so just go ahead and start rebinding those keys asap. Back to the optimisation GOD IT IS DOG S**T, I meet the min requirements so I played on low everything and it ran like s**t sometimes, but I also know others running a high spec PC on medium settings also getting janky gameplay. Hopefully this gets fixed with the weeks to come. 7/10 (would be 1-2 more if the optimisation was there)The lore and landmarks are accurate and its so easy to get lost in the world of Harry Potter. Game of the year contender easily! I will be looking out for DLC in the future (Tri-Wizard Tournement DLC????? just food for thought) Big cons of the game are; no wizard chess, no quidditch, no real reason to use the common room and finally no free use of polyjuice potion or choice to become an animangus. The whole thing surrounding the Room of Requirement is honestly a really enjoyable concept and doesn't feel like a chore.There is massive amount of potential with what they released with the base game for future updates and DLCs so I really hope they don't abandon it.

Just imagine a Skyrim without all the side quests / parallel plots, just the Main Quest, thats Hogwarts Legacy. 15 hours played and I don't think I will launch this game again, I get bored at the thought.  Performance is okay at launch, some drops but nothing too bad for my pc (12600k, 32gb, rtx 3070, 1080p screen), and that usually gets fixed within a few weeks of the launch so I wouldn't worry about it. The game is pretty, not beautiful like RDR2, but pretty. Combat is enjoyable (I play M+K). Flying feels pointless without Quidditch (yep, no Quidditch). The plot is meh (at least from what I've played, I did not finish the game, stopped just after finishing the first trial), and from what I've seen there is no side quests (of the kind that actually adds and enriches the plot), just optional tasks (ex. dodge 10 times, kill 5 spiders, collect 10 scrolls, that kind of stuff) the closest that I saw was  maybe there are more side ""quests"" like this, but even so it still would not be enough, not by a long shot. I must disclose that I'm not a big fan of Harry Potter (the most powerful and villainous Dark Wizard of at least the century, who wields the most powerful wand that ever existed, can't conquer a school, really???), but I do enjoy a good RPG, and unfortunately this is not it.  And for those who played the Dragon Age Series, seems like there is way more interesting stuff to do at the Circles than at Hogwarts, where mages are free, weird huh? If I were a mage I would 100% choose to be beaten to death by templars instead of being bored to death at (this game's) Hogwarts.I wish I could refund this.EDIT: Got the refund, yay."

They do not have any impact on the ending of the game. Meaning their worthless.The ending is none existent, with a trivial boss fight, and no pay off to your character or the wizarding lore. Likewise Hogwarts itself is hollow with no real secrets. Unlike even Prisoner of Askaban by EA which released more then 10 years ago- which has more secrets and hidden pathways. Classes themselves are time skips with the exception of the first 3, which the devs built. It is clear this game needed another 2-3 years to be completed, as 60-70% of the story occurs in the first 15 hours, the rest is filler and fetch quests.Likewise. the performance is questionable, i had to install two mods of nexus to fix the frame rate on this .game.  This game is a solid 5/10. It has a story- albeit bad- it has gameplay, but none of it is unique in any capacity, it has bosses [all can be one shot by a single spell], and there is no progression.

Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911."

Everything on low with dlss only gives 8 fps in hogsmeade.At this point, the games performance is absolutely horrible, there are weird things at play between the GPU, memory, and CPU.  I have been enjoying the game, I was skeptical but it does a good enough job and I will be finishing it for sure. I have: CPU:  R7-5800xMemory: 32 GB (3600)GPU: 3080-Tistorage: Samsung 970 Evo Plus.

Before Hogwarts:2k Ultra + Ultra raytracing: 50-60 fps 2k Ultra + Ultra raytracing + DLSS quality: around 85 fps2k Ultra + ultra raytracing + DLSS balanced: just over 100 fps. After Hogwarts:The 3080-TI runs at 12GB VRAM always, i have dropped settings down to low and it still uses that much memory. On top of that, running at 2k ultra + ray tracing can use as much as 17 GB system memory on top of the VRAM. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As hardware unboxed pointed out, the CPU never reaches more than 55% for any given thread and uses roughly 15-40% CPU depending on DLSS level, no DLSS is lower CPU usage. I have encountered areas where I run at 50 FPS and the CPU is using 20% and the GPU is at 65% usage, this is typically with some sort of DLSS active. The setting I personally use at the moment to play which can roughly maintain 40fps or higher, but can dip while loading a new zone occasionally.Effects quality: UltraMaterial quality: High Fog quality: MediumSky quality: MediumFoliage quality: MediumPost processing: Low         (any works as I don't use depth of field or such effects)Shadows: UltraTextures: Medium            (can't run Hogwarts any higher, outside Hogwarts ultra)View distance: Ultra         (dropping setting  did not increase any fps)Population: Ultra              (dropping setting  did not increase any fps)Ray tracing: All, Ultra       (I think it adds to the game, definitely didn't put in effort to make non-ray tracing look good)DLSS: balanced               (can put on quality at times, other times frames still under 20 on quality). I hope this helps make the game playable if no drivers or patches fix these issues. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The good: -Lighting and atmosphere-Combat (tricky to master)-Tutorial: I hate tutorials, but they made it in such a way its a side thought and not the focus.-Systems, whether looting, challenges, and collectibles are implemented well. The bad: -Optimization: as noted above-Textures: not the best looking game for textures at all even with ultra (maybe performance patch will allow better processing),- Only 2 voice actors, even though you can switch tone, it does not sound natural. -Choices don't seem to matter, the following dialogue will set things straight. I have been enjoying my time playing the game, the difficulty on normal is pretty average, I will be finishing the game.

The gameplay itself is great, it's got plenty of things for you to do other than just the main story line. There are alot of collectibles, puzzles, side quests, and things for you to discover in the open world. The music is fantastic. The combat is amazing, your spells feel substantial as your fighting against other wizards or monsters. There are different spell builds you can use to change up the combat, and potions are just as important as spells when it comes to boss fights. You really need to plan your builds based on what your about to fight. I have seen others complain about the graphics being last gen and those people are just wrong. The game looks fantastic and the scale of the world feels just right. The story is great along with all the other quests in the game.If your undecided about the game, take it from me and plenty of other people. Buy it, the game is fantastic.

Yes, everyone and their momma is saying its the greatest game ever and how amazing it is etc etc etc but that is severely inflated combined with nostalgia based biased, popular opinion and newness altogether. Don't get me wrong, it is a good game but waiting for future DLC and expansions to greatly flesh out this game is essential, and not paying 60$ for it.. This game is very lackluster. Yes it has amazing graphics (only if you have a top notch system), yes the combat does feel good...but that's it. Nothing special here. The story is OK but this game is missing all the essential required to make a decent game, RPG, or Harry Potter genre in general. It's like the made Hogwarts and Hogsmeade and they computer generated the rest and populated with 5 different tasks. Which is Merlin Trials, Demiguise Moons, popping balloons, fighting the same 4 enemies or kidnapping the same 5 animals. That's it. That's all you get. Some stupid side missions with dialogue that makes no sense, a bunch of puzzles.The armor is system is level based, so once you upgrade and spend all your kidnapped beast parts on piece you'll find another piece of armor one point higher. All loot in the game is cosmets or armorNo commerce system active at all. Money is only used to buy quest items, 3 broom upgrades or potions/ingredients tables.Crafting systems has a good start to making your own potions and ingreds but that's itYou can't get a broom until about 1/4 done with the game and a flying beast 2/4.There isn't any RPG or open world dynamics to the game. No dynamic events or storytelling, characters have 2 lines each excepted those in side missions. No consequences for actions, no commerce, non-linear gameplay that severely holds your hands. All the stuff that makes up a decent open world or rpg game is missing. Can't influence the world whatsoever with choices. There are no factions to choose from. Plot holes galore in the entire arc of the story and game. Repetitive everything. Those 5 things I listed are about the only things to do on the map except see the sites and the Merlin Trials are the annoying puzzles and there around 30-50 of them. Demiguise moons is just an object to ecollect to unlock 3 different levels of the alohomora spell, all which unlock a chest that unlocks a door to unlock a chest to unlock a door etc etc. And the greatest loot you will find is a piece of cosmetic.NO QUIDDITCH. Like I said, they forgot to add the rest of the game it seems. You can tell they said F it and quit making the game at Hogwarts just to make release. Maybe if they had spent another year or so we would have a true open world RPG Harry Potter game. For now we just have a puzzle game. It does the scratch the itch for the first 10 hours or so, by all means spend your money if you want but I suggest waiting for the actual game and for it to be cheaper."
3920,Meep,https://steamcommunity.com/id/meep77799/,8,,1,115.9,February,13,168,0,1,"I challenged myself by playing on the hard difficulty setting and was impressed by the depth of the main story and side quests. I spent a total of 73 hours exploring this incredible world and I'm happy to say that there is still so much left for me to discover. More than 70% of the map's contents remain unseen by me. Just a friendly reminder, my review includes my personal perspective and opinions, and I promise it won't contain any spoilers. Hogwarts Legacy is a wonderful adventure-RPG game that offers a well-balanced mix of action and adventure set within the wizarding world. Although I hadn't watched or read Harry Potter prior to playing the game, the developers do an excellent job of providing enough explanation for players to enjoy the game without prior knowledge. The game intrigued me enough to watch the first two Harry Potter films, which I found to be a good prelude to the game. However, I'm confident that even if I had only watched two films, I wouldn't have had any trouble diving into the game. The game provides a comprehensive explanation for players to understand and play the game. The story in this game is beautifully crafted, and the characters are incredibly well-written with dynamic personalities. The motion capture and voice acting bring the characters to life, making it easy for players to form emotional connections with them. I found myself truly caring about each character I encountered and was fully invested in even the side quests. The attention to detail in character development is truly remarkable. If you're a fan of the wizarding world, this game is an ideal choice for you to further explore this magical universe. The game takes players on a journey not only through Hogwarts but also beyond, offering a comprehensive look at the wizarding world and all its wonders. The protagonist in this game is customizable, allowing players to choose their appearance from a selection of provided options. While the customization options for facial features like eye size and nose size are limited, players can choose between two voices, male and female, and adjust the tone. The protagonist is a talented 10-12 year old child starting in the 5th grade, and players can shape their personality to some extent through the limited choice options provided. Although the customization options may not be extensive, I found them to be sufficient for my personal enjoyment of the game. The game features a massive open world map, with seamless interactive content (excluding a few dungeons). I can't even estimate the amount of time it would take to fully explore and complete all the content. There are exciting puzzles and secrets scattered throughout the world that will keep players engaged. If you're a fan of adventure games with a touch of mystery, this game will be perfect for you. The puzzles are not overly challenging, but they offer just enough entertainment value to keep you engaged and exploring. And let me tell you, there's a LOT of content to discover. The combat system in this game is one of its highlights. I played on hard difficulty and it took me 70+ hours to complete the main story and a few side quests. The challenge is not to be taken lightly, and you need to stay focused on your enemies' movements at all times. On hard mode, you have to always be aware of being surrounded and outnumbered, and match the right spells to the right barriers. It's not possible to block all attacks, so you need to mix dodging and deflecting properly. I allocated my trait points for a single-target focus, and I think it was the right choice for the hard difficulty, especially for the endgame. The hard difficulty requires you to use crowd control spells, such as binding, stun, slow, and floating, to control your enemies' movements and take them down one by one with accurate deflecting and evading. Although gear and DPS can make the difficulty easier to some extent, they won't solve the core problem. You'll still die in 2-3 hits and the enemies won't get damaged unless you use spells correctly. That's why I loved the well-balanced and engaging difficulty of this game. I have high praise for the developers who put so much effort into creating this combat system. It was one of the best I've ever played. Almost everything I liked about this game, but I need to bring up two points of concern.  The first is regarding the issue of violence. The protagonist is a 10-12-year-old child, and it's quite disturbing to see them killing adult enemies in the game. It's not easy to deal with the fact that I had to kill more than a thousand people in this game as a child character. Also, the protagonist's dialogue after each murder was not appropriate, making it seem like taking someone's life is justifiable for any reason. I believe that the subject of murder should be treated with more care and sensitivity, rather than just being portrayed as a normal occurrence in a game. It would have been better if the enemies were just stunned and the player had the option to spare their lives or leave them with minimum injury. I hope this issue can be addressed in the future. I do not support promoting violence in any form. The other issue is that the game's optimization issue. I was playing the game during its three-day exclusive early access with the deluxe edition and understand that developers are working to fix any issues. However, with a required 2-3 frames accuracy for a successful deflection, I struggled with the inputs due to a lack of framerate, which caused the perfect window to be challenging to hit. I hope that this issue can be resolved soon. The game features a high-quality story with dynamic characters and emotionally rich motion capture and great voice acting. The protagonist can be customized to a certain extent, but with a bit limited options. The game takes place in a vast open world filled with interactive content, puzzles, and secrets to uncover. The combat system is well-designed and provides a challenging experience, but there is a concern about the depiction of violence as the protagonist is a child killing adult enemies. It was disturbing to me, as it shows the protagonist taking the lives of others with little regard and making light of such a serious matter. I personally wish there was no murder in the game and that the enemies could be stunned rather than killed, and I wish there was a choice to not kill in the game. Additionally, there are some optimization issues with the framerate that may impact gameplay. Overall, the game is enjoyable but could benefit from improved handling of the depiction of violence and optimization.Although there are some concerns about the depiction of violence in the game, I still highly recommend it. My overall verdict is 10 out of 10, and I believe it has the potential to be a game of the year, or even a game of the decade that people will remember and enjoy for a long time."

The best way i can describe it is : it's a huge pile of hot garbage.Past the initial ""wow"" of the scenery, there's nothing. Nothing at all.Sure the first couple of hours in the castle do a good job at immersing you in the world of Hogwart.In the end, it only make you fall from higher ground when you realize there's nothing more to it than that.All characters you will encounter (including the main one : you)  are without substance. They as as basic as the most basic of b******.Nobody's ever angry, mad, or sad. They are not believable and therefore I cannot force myself to give a flying duck about anything they are telling me.I find myself skipping every dialogue line after a while because they are all the same boring and flaccid sh**.It doesn't matter anyway because I don't actually need to know anything that have been said. My character will literally tell me word for word everything i have to do. If you start playing this expecting to solve riddles, take on challenges, make important choices or even remotely use any conscious  part of your brain, prepare to be let down.You will get through most of the game pressing either space or the action key. Every single time you end up in front of a situation that requires you to find the right spell to solve, you character will spell it out loud for you.I could keep going for a while about everything that is wrong with Hogwart Legacy but it basicaly is resumed to one sentence : this game as no soul."

I'm the type of person who manual saves just to be sure and still had all my files corrupted, only four hours in. I cant trust the game to not do the same thing again so I guess for now I will have to wait for a patch to come out that fixes it or go through the customer support of warner bros to request a refund.also, the frame drops are still terrible, way worse then what Elden Ring had going on when it dropped, and I might not have the beefiest graphics card (RTX 3050) but for around half my playtime the textures and pop-in the game were so terrible it was more reminiscent of a playstation 2 game than a new gen game (which is apparently another bug).

The first couple hours I was just dumbfounded being in the world of Harry Potter and exploring the castle. That wore off pretty quickly after I left the castle. Once you get to Hogsmeade you expect to be in Victorian England in the late 1800s, The characters in the story make it feel more like you're in West Hollywood in 2023 and the immersion quickly fades. Which is when the game has to stand on it's gameplay and content or lack there of.There is a ton of long drawn out dialogue, for the story you're going to need to be traveling 10 to 15 minutes by broom to go and defeat 3 enemies to pick something up. Then you'll need to fly 10 to 15 minutes back to drop it off. The combat is fun but there just isn't enough of it. You're forced to go to classes to learn spells and get fetch quest items. Sadly, it's just a boring game with a ton of fluff. If you're a huge Harry Potter fan pick it up when its $15-20 USD and play it then but there just isn't enough from a gaming perspective to pay full price for this."
3938,Light Yagami,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RafaeruSukaru/,4,,1,57.5,February,11,675,0,1,"Generally: 9/10By far the best game in the Harry Potter universe. According to the savegame data, I currently have about 20 hours and am absolutely positive about the game. I was suspicious at first of how the fighting will be and if the world will feel alive, now I have no worries! Everywhere Npc walk around and talk to each other or do something. It's really fun to hear the conversations of the npc.Battle: 8/10The fighting feels surprisingly powerful and is a lot of fun. Beyond the story, you have opportunities to expand your strength and you can feel that, just awesome! There are also enough enemy types.Open World: 10/10Freely exploreable without restrictions! Just nice. I have also rarely experienced games in which you can enter almost every house. It feels very satisfying when not walking into a ""blocked door"". The world is beautiful and if it had been sold as a walking simulator I would have spent my money well. It's just a great world of this Harry Potter.Fly: 9/10I tell this point independently. Everyone would probably grab a broom and fly around. It's just as cool in the game as soon as you can fly for the first time, when you've had your first flying lessons, a great key moment for the feeling.There are also animals that you can fly with, but I haven't got that far yet, I'm very excited!Quests/Story: 8/10I've come quite a long way and I have to say the story is super understandable and fun to follow. I think it's great that the introduction to Hogwarts has been implemented with lessons, so you really feel like a student.Game mechanics: 9/10I'm absolutely thrilled! There is so much to collect, unlock, puzzle. I had high hopes before release and they were easily exceeded. I'm not saying too much just let yourself be surprised.In total: 9/10Certainly the best Harry Potter game we will have for several years. Of course I also love the old games from back then, but this implementation is simply clean. There should be something for every fan and I'm so happy that a studio has managed to create a good license implementation. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS!Future wishes?Quidditch! ... pls"

At first its an exciting new world to explore, but you quickly realize there isn't much there. Soulless interactions with NPCs for random quest, repetitive combat. You don't exist in the world. You aren't a student at Hogwarts. You don't live the life of a student, the joy and fun of the early movies could have easily been added into the game. It very much feels like it was designed about 12 years ago and just released. The jarring cuts to a fixed dialog cut scene for every character interaction is very last/last last gen feeling.

3948,Karthadon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/karthadon/,1,,1,38.0,March,30,356,0,1,"This game is highly enjoyable- but only for one playthrough. Choices DO NOT matter in this game. Regardless of what action you make, the ending is the same. The only difference is that some characters (side characters usually) won't like you. Which doesn't matter. Because you never have to interact with them again after completing their quest.When I first started playing the game, I thought ""Oh, I'll play through it again to get the evil ending"". Yeah, well, the evil ending has no different outcome bar the fact that you made a different choice.Another thing, is the paid content. There is a single DLC that unlocks: A single outfit and a mount. The outfit, in my opinion, doesn't look too great. That, and the mount is slower than your broom. Not worth it.That all being said, game is still fun. Would recommend it.

3960,Pharalis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/giulia-pharalis/,1,,1,279.6,March,28,180,0,1,"Revelio, revelio, revelio, reve... The game is brimming with nostalgic references to the movies and books, and it’s clear that the developers poured their heart and soul into the details of Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and the surrounding world. The various side quests, collectibles, customization options, and captivating combat make Hogwarts Legacy a game that can appeal to all, despite your history (if any) with the franchise.There is something here for everyone to enjoy, as the combat, exploration, and open world of the Harry Potter universe make for a stunning adventure.Hogwarts Legacy does a flawless job of making the player feel as if they truly are a student attending Hogwarts, as nearly every nook and cranny of the castle is brimming with whimsical mysteries just begging to be explored. The sheer attention given to the details of the Wizarding World in Hogwarts Legacy are mind-blowing. While exploring the castle, you’ll encounter everything from paintings that move and talk, suits of armor that salute you as you walk by, shifting staircases, books that rearrange themselves on shelves, ghosts causing mischief, and much more.Additionally, it’s clear that numerous references to the Harry Potter books and movies have been included for the delightful nostalgia of fans of the franchise. For example, when you encounter a Hippogriff, you’ll go through the same process of bowing and becoming familiar as Harry did in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Similarly, you’ll encounter the screaming Mandrakes in Herbology and have to pot them just like Harry did in The Chamber of Secrets.The references also do not end at scenes from the books and movies. The game’s soundtrack is perfect, fitting the whimsical adventure of the game, and this will be appreciated by all fans—old and new. But if you’re a dedicated Potter fan and you listen closely, many of the game’s tracks include riffs from the songs we’ve been adoring from the movies since we were young.You will never feel like you’re wandering around Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and the surrounding areas with nothing to do. In Hogwarts alone, you’ll encounter puzzle doors, statues that require spells to activate their secrets, puzzle mirrors, and numerous locked doors and chests that contain cool new items. There are also students and teachers all over the castle, ready to ask for your help in treasure hunts, collecting items, dueling, and more.Activities aren’t restricted to the castle, of course. Spend time completing the Merlin Trials out in the wild to expand your inventory space, fight enemies and find new loot in the Forbidden Forest, or simply explore caves you come across during your travels. You can also collect ingredients and Beasts while you’re out exploring the world, which will allow you to return to Hogwarts to make potions to aid with combat or to tame and breed magical beasts.To ensure that there’s something for everyone, the game also includes the task of retrieving all of the 150 hidden Field Guide pages for the collectors out there. Those who love to decorate and customize can spend their hours decorating the Room of Requirement, your personal workspace throughout the game.To truly top off the full Hogwarts experience, you must attend numerous classes throughout the story. These classes include Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potions, Charms, Herbology, Flying, Divination, and Transfiguration. Classes are essential for unlocking new spells and learning how to do new activities such as planting or crafting potions. What makes the classes particularly great is that you won’t just be sitting there listening to a lecture, you’ll be performing activities as you learn. Classes ensure that you will find yourself fully immersed in the life of a student.While the extraordinary atmosphere of the Wizarding World exceeds expectations, the challenging and entertaining combat is far more shocking. By the trailers, I wasn’t necessarily convinced that combat would be a primary facet of enjoyment in this game. Yet on the contrary, the variation of spells in your arsenal combined with how the enemy defenses are constructed make for an absolute blast and a real challenge.There is no breezing through the combat by button-mashing one spell in Hogwarts Legacy. As you go through the game, you’ll unlock different types of spells, and the game will force you to use a variety of them in combat. Enemies will often have different colored shields, and you’ll need to use a spell of the corresponding type to break the shields before you can do damage. Additionally, you’ll need to stay alert, as you must frequently dodge or block, depending on the attacks coming at you.The fact that you can have up to four sets of spells with four spells in each set takes some getting used to. You’ll need to remember which spells you put into which slots, and that’s arguably the most challenging part about combat in Hogwarts Legacy. Once you’ve adjusted to this and can switch between spells easily, you’ll have a blast taking down Poachers, Spiders, Trolls, and more.It’s well established that exploration in Hogwarts Legacy is heavily encouraged with the game’s astonishing visuals and boundless activities, but the plot leaves much to be desired. In truth, the plot is only so glaringly mediocre because the rest of the game is exceptional. You start the game as a fifth-year transfer student, and the back story of that never really gets explained.Otherwise, the story is a relatively cliché trope of “main character has special mysterious power that no one else has and must discover its secrets.” The secondary plot deals with a Goblin Rebellion and a group of evil wizards whose motivations aren’t revealed until further into the game. The story is interesting enough to hold one’s attention under normal circumstances, but it’s difficult to avoid feeling like you want to breeze through the story to get back to the good stuff.Luckily, unlike the lackluster plot, the characters in Hogwarts Legacy are inviting, diverse, and interesting. Some of the main characters include Sebastian Sallow, a mischievous and loyal Slytherin; Poppy Sweet, a sweet and caring Hufflepuff; Natasi Onai, a strong and justice-seeking Gryffindor; Amit Thakkar, an astronomy-loving Ravenclaw.These characters, among many others, have interesting quirks, backstories, and personalities. Additionally, the diversity among the roster of characters was refreshing and made for a far more interesting cast.Whether you’re a long-time fan or not, one of the strangest aspects of Hogwarts Legacy is the lack of consequences for your actions. Though it can be fun and humorous in ways to go about killing people completely unrestricted, it’s… bizarre. You’re a fifth-year student who can go around blasting people into oblivion, yet the most you’ll get as a consequence is a grumble or two from other characters who see you do it. It’s hard to feel like Hogwarts Legacy is a totally immersive experience when this aspect is so dramatically unrealistic.Answering questions or performing an activity correctly in class could have earned you points.At the end of the day, the lack of a morality system draws away from the immersion."

For all of us who have wanted to step through the hallowed halls of Hogwarts and have our very own wizarding journey we can finally experience that, and for this being the first wizarding world game of this caliber I am pleasantly surprised! Yes, the game has its issues, but all games do. And the issues in this game don't really take away from the overall experience. 10/10 recommended, can't wait for the sequels to this and the chance to see how the series grows from here!"

3996,MONOTON,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mirco165/,1,,0,32.9,March,25,153,0,1,"The game is decent at best.Gameplay (especially combat) is quite interensting and fresh, but gets repetive quite quickly. Every boss fight essentially follows the same pattern, hit something with the appropriate color of spell to get the Bosses shield down so you can damage him and repeat.The story in my opinion is pretty bad and very predictable. It has so many logical flaws that make the game seem very ""childish"" if that makes sense. I honestly enjoyed Sebastians side-plot way more than the actual main story. Exploring isnt really worth it either as you just get Cosmetics or Gear that has slightly better stats than the gear you had before and you dont really feel any improvement. All of the Collectibles also become repetitive so quickly that I stopped bothering halway through the Game (Vaults or Merlin Trials especially).The ""Base Building"" aspect of this game aka The Room of Requirement is ok, but also not really that useful. I pretty much only went there to brew potions and gather resources for said potions. I didnt really bother with the whole beast aspect of the room as it felt quite unpolished and unnecessarily grindy. It almost feels like a phone idle game honestly.Dont get me wrong, the game did some stuff pretty well, flying through the map and killing chains of enemys with one spell is very satisfying, plus the addition of a ""Transmorg"" system is much appreciated and should be put into more games. But its honestly not worth full price.You might enjoy this if you are a big Harry Potter fan, but im not and as a game it was quite dissapointing."

Even on this setting it will occasionally pause whilst changing from one part of the menu area to another. Is it unplayable? No. Is it annoying? Oh yes! Don't buy the game until it's been patched/optimised. I've tried all the suggestion on Google but no difference.

From the beautiful environment, to the many activities you can do. Rarely do I play a game where I gawk at the environment as much as I do here, looking at the moving paintings, at the random books flying around and just interacting with any object which gives a prompt like for example drinking tea, cutting a tree with shears, eating cake, throwing rocks in a pond and etc.That level of interactivity reminded me of one of my favorite games which is Duke Nukem 3D.Also, the main story is very solid, it had me hooked from the get go. The characters all seem very likable and relatable. I have yet to meet any obnoxious or annoying character.The only problems which I had with the game are very minor. On occasion an NPC would T-pose or I would get a minor stutter in some parts of the castle or in some places outside. I tried lowering graphics to try and resolve it but it does not help. But those are really small problems which to be honest can be ignored.Overall the game is easily a 10 out of 10, must play experience in my opinion."

No plot at all (or if you think 3 identical missions is a plot), 1 side character with charisma, no choice in decision making that can impact the development of any event. This game is a pure abuse of the world of Harry Potter created by the author without any actual ""game"" behind it. 95% of the functions you have in the game are not needed AT ALL. But you will need to loot 100+ identical ""pig tails"" in order TO GET NEW MAIN QUEST BECAUSE IT IS LEVEL RESTRICTED. It looks good first 10 hours because you expect something interesting to happen. It will not. Or it will if you play another game. -10/10 don't buy this if you played a computer game with better plot than Pacman ever before."

However, the gameplay can feel a bit muddled, as if it's not sure whether it wants to be a grand and sweeping RPG or a focused, action-packed adventure <Revelio!>.It's as if the game is trying to find its place in the world, much like a young witch or wizard trying to navigate the treacherous halls of Hogwarts. While the spell-casting mechanics are undeniably satisfying, and the characters are charming and endearing, the experience can feel a tad disjointed at times <Revelio!>.Despite its flaws, I still found myself captivated by the world of Hogwarts Legacy. It may not be the next great wizarding adventure, but it's still a delightful romp through a fantastical realm that is sure to please any fan of the magical arts <Revelio!>.In short, if you're looking for a charming and whimsical adventure, then look no further than Hogwarts Legacy <Revelio!>."

Hogwarts itself is intricately crafted, minor details have been graced with thorough work. Though I am sad to say that when it comes to everything outside of Hogwarts the opposite is the case. The gameplay in the (so called) open world is disappointing to say the least. If I was asked to whom I would recommend giving this game a try it would be a very selective group of people and it being the following: people that have not played many video games in the past that always loved Harry Potter. Most other groups of players will most definitely be disappointed by either the combat mechanics being too uninspired or the open-world being unnecessary in itself. When it comes to the graphical side of the game it surely delivers better than on any points formerly discussed, but still when taking into account the eye-candyness-factor of ""Hogwarts Legacy"" it underdelivers to a certain extent. Just for the idea of the game I would grant it a pass, especially because I am of the opinion that there is not enough well-crafted video game content for the potterverse. Of course it scores badly when being compared to real classics but standing on its own it is not the worst game I have ever played and some people might still actually enjoy it. Just keep in mind to be cautious before buying the game out of pure construed accredited potential (like I did).Given the last few paragraphs I will recommend this game as I only have the option to either recommend it or the opposite."

Purely in terms of a solo player game, it is decent - a good way to pass time. But you'll probably like it a lot more if you have read Harry Potter (preferably more than once).Ended the game at 94% completion (good enough for me) - here is what I suggest- Do side quests before going for main mission, as the main story does not have too many missions and can feel rushed/underwhelming if you don't go for side quests.- Side quests are generally fun and have a decent enough storyline of their own.- Explore the map and do small events like Bandit camps, etc. Even they are fun."

I never once thought the opposing villains were evil or strong.  I could not bring myself to finish the game as it was too boring.

I enjoyed every bit of it from exploring the wonderful open world to doing side quests. If you are aiming for 100% I recommend doing side quests while you have the chance between main quests so it does not get boring after you complete the main quest.The graphics of this game is beautiful sometimes making you stop playing and enjoy the scene, maybe the Hogwarts express train passing by on the bridge.The gameplay of the game is really good and i enjoyed every bit of it making it one of the best games I have played in a while.The music of the game makes you feel like you are a part of the game, its just beautiful!!I have a 3070TI and an AMD 9 5900x and i ran the game at around 120 fps in ultra settings.I have played the game on max difficulty from the beginning without making the use of a ancient magic cast on an enemy. Learning spell combos will make your experience better and will help you defeat your enemies more efficient.Some grind is needed to upgrade your gear to make your spells stronger, getting ingredients to make potions is sometimes required for quests and to help you out during combat but is not something that is necessary.The story of the quest is very very good and well made. I will not give any spoilers but I am sure that even if you are not a harry potter fan you will enjoy the story of this game.I have a total of 47 hours playing the game which includes completing the main quest and almost finishing every other thing in the game, after the main quest its really just hop in game and have a relaxing and fun time completing the rest of the puzzles, side quests and collections.At the current price I think that it is worth it, you have no rush of playing this game I would wait for a sale.During my time of playing the game I do not think that I had any bugs, if I had they were small bugs that required me to save the game and load the save which fixed it.---{ Graphics }---☐ You forget what reality is☑ Beautiful☐ Good☐ Decent☐ Bad☐ Don‘t look too long at it☐ MS-DOS---{ Gameplay }---☑ Very good☐ Good☐ It's just gameplay☐ Mehh☐ Watch paint dry instead☐ Just don't---{ Audio }---☐ Eargasm☑ Very good☐ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ I'm now deaf---{ Audience }---☑ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☐ Grandma---{ PC Requirements }---☐ Check if you can run paint☐ Potato☑ Decent☐ Fast☐ Rich boi☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{ Difficulty }---☐ Just press 'W'☐ Easy☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Significant brain usage☐ Difficult☐ Dark Souls---{ Grind }---☐ Nothing to grind☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks☑ Isn't necessary to progress☐ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ You'll need a second life for grinding---{ Story }---☐ No Story☐ Some lore☐ Average☐ Good☑ Lovely☐ It'll replace your life---{ Game Time }---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☑ Average☐ Long☐ To infinity and beyond---{ Price }---☐ It's free!☑ Worth the price☐ If it's on sale☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your money---{ Bugs }---☑ Never heard of☐ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ ARK: Survival Evolved☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs---{ ? / 10 }---☐ 1☐ 2☐ 3☐ 4☐ 5☐ 6☐ 7☐ 8☐ 9☑ 10"

House choice doesnt matter, points dont matter, very tedious ""challenges"".

The attention to detail is quite noteworthy, and it successfully creates a world that engrosses players in an unforgettable experience. From the intricate architecture of the Hogwarts castle to the lush surroundings of the Forbidden Forest, the graphics alone make this game an indispensable choice for enthusiasts of the Harry Potter universe.In addition, the game's offerings go beyond its visually impressive presentation. The story is deeply immersive, taking players on an enthralling journey through the wizarding world. As a student at Hogwarts, players get to partake in the delights and challenges of being a young wizard in training. The game's narrative is replete with unpredictable twists and turns, and the choices players make have substantial consequences that impact the direction of the story.Moreover, the game offers an exceptional return on investment. With its expansive open-world environment and a myriad of quests, the game guarantees countless hours of entertainment for a reasonable price. The discernible effort and time invested by the developers in creating an enjoyable and affordable game are evident, and the result is a game that delivers in both respects.All things considered, I strongly recommend Hogwarts Legacy to any enthusiasts of the Harry Potter universe. The game's impressive graphical quality, immersive storytelling, and remarkable value for money make it an essential choice for anyone seeking to experience the wizarding world in an entirely novel way."
4078,Adeed,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adeed/,1,,1,45.8,March,18,369,0,1,"A good game that is somewhat hindered by its open world structure and its lackluster optimization on PC.====It is amazing how avalanche adapted the world into the game, many small details are included, especially with Hogwarts and its many secrets and jaw dropping spectacles. However the game fell short in populating the open world with meaningful activities that I stopped exploring after a while and beelined the main and side stories. I think the game would have benefitted more if it is mostly contained at Hogwarts and reserve the open world as small to medium sized instances you can visit during the story.I am not a Potterhead by any means, the last movie I've watched from the franchise was goblet of fire. However I find the story here quite interesting, albeit with a rushed pacing towards the end. I really wished that the player's choices matters more but the game is surprisingly linear in that aspect, with only few of your choices matter and it does not change much in the grand scheme of the plot.It's combat is the highlight for me, waving your wands and choosing spells that is effective on certain enemies feels exhilarating, combined with beautiful animation work it is simply a joy to both play and watch. It actually has a little bit of that character action DNA in it, making you able to launch an enemy and juggle them with multitude of spell barrage. Iterating this system more with a less restricting movement, more impactful spell variety, and a better spell changing UX will make this amazing.The worst part of the game for me is the optimization. The game stutters heavily on PC, even when testing at the lowest settings on 1080P using an RTX 3060TI, I find the game chugs and stutters especially at Hogwarts and Hogsmead, as well as during travel using a broom. I find it a bit unacceptable that Gotham Knights in its arguably worst launch still manage to keep a stutter free experience even when cruising in the open world. Yes the framerate is abysmal but the stutter in the game makes it more annoying than a 30 fps cap.Overall while it is not a school sandbox like Rockstar's Bully like I hoped it would be, I find myself enjoying Hogwarts Legacy throughout 35+ hours of playtime. I find that it's better to get the game in consoles if you could over the PC version, and if you do get the PC version get several mods that can help you with the performance."

It's the world many have dreamed of come to life.As with most open world games, there is some 'jank' but nothing ""unforgivable.""

Did somebody build a treasure chest for a scarf???- You rescue animals by kidnapping them, yeah! Let's liberate all the animals. WTF?- Why are there timers for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ planting tables? Is this a mobile game?- Why did they implement a lockbreak minigame a la skyrim when I've just learned a magic spell to do this? Such a weird choice. The potion making is fully automatic via magic which I don't know a spell for. But the thing I do know a spell for requires manual intervention via minigame...???I'm going to finish the main quest but that's about it. It's a nice set, nice visuals, nice audio.

Of course there are a lot of optimization issues, and the game could have more content and the story could have more branches, but it's a very solid product and there are no elements that seem out of place (except maybe a bugged voice belonging to one of the side characters) . The graphics, animations and sound design are great and very consistent, voice actors who portrayed main characters are amazing. The only thing I'd like to see in the sequels is a morality system like in the old Bioware games."
4119,angeliquej0422,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199471417494/,1,,1,41.5,March,16,13,0,1,"Honestly playing HL has been so fun. I have had issues with it crashing but other than that it has been a great experience. The game looks really pretty and runs really well. The puzzles in the game aren't that challenging but that's not really a problem for me. The side quest are really fun and don't feel like a bad part of the game (note I chose Slytherin so this may vary between houses). I enjoy flying (even though I am awful at it) and the controls of it, it seems to guide very easily. The battles with enemies is also really good, they usually don't feel to easy or to hard. I am glad that there is always something to do, so far, rather it's main quest or side quests. Getting around the map can be a little annoying as they do have some no fly zones. So when I was doing a Merlin trial I was having some issues getting to it. The fast travel system helps A BUNCH when trying to get around. So I definitely suggest getting those done so you can use them later. I really suggest playing this game if you like exploring and collecting objects a lot in games. HL has a lot to offer when it comes to objects to collect. 9.5/10 simply because of the crashing issues."

First impression was WOW, because details, graphics, art everything was extremely cool, and eventually you were in hogwarts, and hogsmade , and it was really awesome. But The main story was really Meh. The character got really overpowered in short time, and the game got boring, The enemies were really repetitive and it also got me bored. There should be a level limitation on some tasks for the character not to get overpowered. Also it would be cool to have variety in enemies, and tasks."

The story was excellent along with three great relationship lines and an additional storyline with a professor and a house elf. There is an abundance of side quests, allowing you to interact with many many different hogwarts students and villagers from every single hamlet. Treasure maps, battle arenas, merlin trials, the exploration is infinite, and there is so much to do. And wow, returning to Hogwarts after spending hours away was magical, something no game I've ever played has provided. Hogwarts is done perfectly, and just the map of the castle itself is ridiculously big. Main Story will take you about 30 hours. If you do Main and Sides it will probably be 50 hours. Exploration and completition of all achievements and etc can raise your playtime to 100 hours without a doubt. Super long, super fun. Just excellent. Really wishing for a DLC. 11/10. One of the greatest games I've ever played and the best game of the decade so far."

In one hand it is really cool to get not awful game in HP universe. It is great to see some details of Hogwarts and magic stuff in it. It is interesting to explore and read about some lore details.On the other hand outside of Hogwarts it is extremely tedious. The rest of open world is too repetitive and not interesting to explore with the same encounters and puzzles all over the world. And for me it was that turned me away from completing the game. Also the story is really bland and shallow, so I actually was absolutely not invested in it. Nice try, especially at the start, but really weak continuation."
4131,Nilin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nilin7/,1,,1,36.6,March,15,40,0,1,"Making this review right after completing main storyGame time was about 30 hours which included the main story, some exploring and about 3/4 of the side quests. There's still a lot to do in this game. You might be able to sink another 20 or so hours on top of that if you are going for 100%Imo the game was worth the money. Story is decent, combat is good, but most importantly the world they have built is enormous and truly amazing. Few bugs here and there, but nothing major. Most of which have been patched already.A must buy for any Harry Potter fan. They have been doing HP games for years but this is finally the game where you truly get to be part of the world."

It is an immersive, open-world action RPG set in the Wizarding World, where you can create your own witch or wizard, attend classes, explore Hogwarts and beyond, and fight against dark forces.

Definitely recommend giving it a play through"

I like using raytracing, because I paid for a GPU that is supposed to be good at Raytracing (RTX 3090), so I always play all my games with RT on because I think it's cool and generally looks pretty good (CP2077). But the level of graphical anomalies in this game with RT on, which I thought were artifacts of the poor RT implementation, or launching the game too early essentially making all early release buyers just beta testers... the amount of nearly game-breaking issues is disappointing. I just had my first hard crash, which actually crashed Windows and restarted my whole PC, and this crash finally made me switch off RT in this game. Most of the time the issues don't cause a crash, they just look terrible. Now, it runs much better, but it's disappointing how bad RT is and how good it COULD be. The game deserves RT. Purchasers who paid full retail price should get RT. Please fix devs. Recommending because the game itself is great and there are some REALLY cool aspects to it... but the graphics in some areas are just terrible and the overall poor optimization/performance on high end hardware like I've got is... disappointing. This game is almost perfect, just needs better flying  mechanics/Quidditch, better graphics and optimization, and a better reason why the story can't include Harry Potter universe characters and has to have no-name (or distant relatives) characters unrelated to any of the books. Fix that and the game is perfect in my opinion."

There is some variation between missions depending on the wizard house you're sorted in to, and I believe there might be a couple of different endings based upon some choices made, but I can't confirm that.Ignoring the controversy surrounding this game and juding it solely on it's own merits, it's was an anjoyble experience.

I only experienced a few bugs while playing, but none that couldn’t be fixed by shutting down the game and starting it again (PHEW). The only thing I found a  bit annoying about the game, was that I found the girl characters voices too robotic, it was more off-putting  than Ignatia Wildsmith’s “You can’t imagine how inconvenient travel was before I invented Floo powder” (which they nerfed btw so don’t worry)If you are a HP fan, go buy it, even if you are not :P"

4172,Carlos,https://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Little_Giant/,2,,0,24.7,March,14,409,0,1,"If you love Harry Potter than in the first few hours you'll love the game, but after that the game starts to get really boring. The bosses that you go up against aren't hard but just have so much health that it's a chore to do them. You're in a room against a giant enemy with so much health and most of your spells don't do to much to them. The other enemies that you go up against are fun to fight at first but then every fight after the first few hours is so boring. They slowly give you more spells as you play to try and make the fights a little different as you play but they all pretty much do the same thing to the enemies.The inventory system is just a pain to deal with. You have a very limited sized inventory for any gear that you get. You can however go and increase the size by going out into the world and doing these little puzzles. Depending on which upgrade you're on will determine how many of these puzzles you need to do to get the upgrade. They really aren't hard or even fun but there are just so many of them and they're all over the map. On one hand I would love to get more inventory space but on the other I don't want to spend a few hours flying around doing them all. Even when I happen to run across one I can't be bothered to do anymore after the first two upgrades. You're given so much gear that you fill up your inventory all the time so you better go sell all your gear before you do anything especially if you loot every chest you fine. You can change the appearance of your gear in your inventory which is really nice.From what I've played the story is fine but nothing amazing. There are lots of side quests you can do out in the world but they're honestly so boring and the rewards are terrible that I stopped doing them. It might just be the pace that I was going but even 24+ hours in and I still don't have all of the spells. The quests to get the spells aren't very fun either so it becomes a chore to do. Outside of Hogwarts or Hogsmeade the world just feels so empty. You do have small random towns that don't offer much expect a place to sell your gear and maybe a side quest or two that you won't want to do. Oh and I can't forget about all the gear you can find there that you probably won't use and just sell immediately. It is very fun to go and fly around and explore at first but then you really notice how boring it is after a few minutes.The performance is just terrible. Even after downloading mods to help with it, it's still really bad. The framerate is all over the place from 90+ dropping down to below 30. They said there would be an update when the game launched that helps improve the performance but that update seemed to do nothing for me. Just on the performance alone I would not recommend this game to anyone. Even as a big Harry Potter fan I can't recommend this game to anyone. If you really love Harry Potter and still want to get this game then I would say to wait for it to be at least 75% off before you consider it."

However I've played tons of games in my life and can confirm that this is an incredible game. It is definitely in my top 3 games ever played. And here is why:Let me start with the graphics: yes it is a GPU demanding game. I have a RTX 2080 and have to play on the 'high' settings for maintaining 100 fps. Besides from that and from the fps drops, the game graphics are incredible. Hogwarts castle is completely modeled, the world is big enough to keep exploring for hours and every interaction has a voice over! I have NEVER seen a game of this size where every interaction has voice over, it is truly insane.The gameplay is good. The combat is difficult in the beginning, and near the endgame you will be a little more powered up so it becomes a little easy. While progressing, the game adds more and more features you can access, f.e. more spells, new doors to unlock, new characters, new traits, more cosmetics, new beast features and much more. It amazes me every time you discover a new feature of the game. They have put a lot of work into the game before releasing it.Overall awesome game that everyone needs to try, even if you are not a huge Harry Potter fan. I have  a lot of friends playing the game who are not necessarily big HP fans, and THEY LOVE IT."

You can really tell a lot of love has gone into the game, particularly in the castle itself.Combat feels smooth, and enjoyable.Characters and the story are interesting, though at times a little cliche.I'd recommend this for anyone who loved the books growing up, and would want to just explore a magical world.There are a few negatives.  The world is huge, but a lot of the hamlets feel a little empty.  Its more about finding secrets and unlocking doors for collection chests rather than new quests and stories becoming available in new areas. Once I unlocked the map the tutorial told me that having visited hamlets I'd unlock quests once they became available, so I travelled the entire map, unlocking all the areas, and then was really only offered about three quests over the entire game that popped up outside of Hogwarts itself, which was a little disappointing.  It was also strange to me that only 3/4 houses were represented in major side quests/friendship arcs. The three that occur are great stories, and I enjoyed them, but it just felt as though the game was unfinished.Lastly, there seem to be no consequences for negative choices in dialogue, or using forbidden curses in front of professors.  Felt a bit off, but making poachers scream in agony felt good, so I accepted it.These negatives, wouldn't stop me recommending the game, however, I'd say, if you're not a fan of puzzles and exploration you'll probably struggle with this game.  A huge portion of the game involves using your spells to solve puzzles.  From a completionist standpoint, there is a LOT to find.  I had to use a spreadsheet to work out what I was missing. However, a good thing is, you can't miss anything.  Even post game you can go back and find anything you've missed.  To conclude, its a beautiful game, the world is amazing, you really can just take your time, getting lost in the world with its magical details.  I cared about the characters and enjoyed the story.  I would 100% recommend it, and I really enjoyed my time playing."

My wife really loves the Harry Potter universe and lore and this is my kiddos first experience with it. They have had a great time playing so far. The story is great and my family really enjoyed creating their perfect avatar character for the Harry Potter universe. It's an interactive event they can do with each other. We turn on co-pilot controlling with several Xbox controllers so they can take control of the same character based on the difficulty of whatever part of the mission they are on. So my young daughters get to participate running around and making character decisions while my wife gets to enjoy completing the tougher aspects of the missions. It's a win win across the board for the family. We're running on a pretty high end custom gaming rig I built middle of last year and it's been flawless and beautiful in terms of graphical quality. We're running it on a 77"" flagship OLED that we use as a home theater PC and gaming setup. It would be real neat if they opened up some of the other aspects of the universe over time with more game development. But as it stands I'm quite happy with the purchase. My family has been having a great time playing so far."

The real controversy of this game should have been how horribly optimized it is. During the second half of the game it crashed constantly, maybe once every thirty minutes. The ""recommended specs"" is a complete joke. Even after turning down the graphics settings significantly and lowering the resolution substantially (which can only be done in your OS settings for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason), the game still chugs and becomes completely unplayable in some areas during the winter. In between my playthrough of this game, I made a substantial upgrade to the specs of my computer, but it made absolutely no difference in how this game ran, it's just that bad. Devs and publishers need to be held accountable for selling a barely working product.The game itself is just Far Cry 3, just like every other overbudget AAA game ever made over the past decade. Gear scores, Enemy outposts, a tedious checklist of collectables, crafting, copy pasted environments and puzzles, meaningless sidequests and every other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hallmark of this type of game rears its ugly head. It opens on a fairly good note, almost promising a Bully styled school adventure with minigames acting as magic lessons, a fun cast of characters and after school activities like an unsanctioned dueling club. The facade quickly crumbles away as assignments quickly turn into a checklist of chores and you're shuffled into a dozen or so identical hamlets as the story progresses. The music is uninteresting, the world outside of Hogwarts is bland, and combat against the same 4 types of enemies quickly becomes stale as soon as you learn to combo a handful of spells.You shouldn't feel obligated to like this game just because people on Twitter threw a tantrum over it. It's the same unfinished, boring open world slop the likes of Ubisoft has been trying to spoonfeed you for the past decade. I don't even particularly like Harry Potter, all I wanted was an entertaining magic themed video game and all I got was another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Far Cry.3.5/10. If the game functioned, it would probably be at about a 5 at the best of times. Get it in a few years when it's on sale if you're a diehard potterhead, otherwise ignore."

On my first play through I tried to get the collectors achievement only to be stopped by a common bug that prevents getting an item (literally 1 item away from 100%) after 70ish hours.

If I could request a refund at this point, I would.Unless you have the patience to deal with the myriad of issues, I suggest waiting until the game is more stable.UPDATE: Finally got the collectors achieve, only to find yet another bug preventing collecting all treasure vaults - and on top of that, if you submit a bug report, the devs will simply close it out if it doesn't get enough ""votes""...

The game has quite good graphics at medium settings which is already taxing my pc, tried high settings but lagged when turning the camera too quickly or too many effects (note: my pc is ryzen 5 3600, gtx 1660 ti, and with 16 gb of RAM). Not really recommended if you want to see high graphics but with not too strong pc as it would lag quite a bit (or it might just crash your pc. Maybe).The gameplay is overall fun with the spell mechanics being quite easy to understand and use. The world is huge with many point of interest that you could explore since it is an open world game. Quests and learning new spells has been fun and looking forward to unlocking new ones. The tutorial for the game is progressive as you unlock more features as you go on your adventure which is great, I rather like this than being bombarded by tons of information at once.For now that is how much I have had the pleasure to experience in the game.

I will be the best Poacher of all!+ Important characters have their own uniqueness, Sebastian is an example of the golden boy of HL. It's interesting to follow their character developments.+ Poppy the best girl- Sometimes the execution of the story is a bit strange, such as learning Avada Kedavra in times of mourning. ""What, why now?"" like that.- Exploration kinda unrewarding when you find a treasure box in caves, you only get a low rarity equipment, so it's just disappointing.- Man, Ravenclaw students sucks. They appear happily cheering when we win the House Cup, I was like ""Who are you all?!"" except Amit.- Frame drops or stuttering still happens even though it's a high end setup, yeah it can be fixed by devs but I don't know when.Overall, a very fun game!

Can't wait to see what else the developers have in store for us."

The environments are amazing and capture that fantastical personality, the Hogwarts school inter-connectivity of it's layout is impressive. The easter eggs they've crammed into every hidden and not so hidden corner is a delight to find too.The story also has me interested and I enjoy the pacing of the game where it allows for me to be daring about exploring and progressing at my own pace, with ever expanding options as I carry on. I look forward to more from this studio and in this line of games of Legacy as it has really captured the fantasy world of Harry Potter in a way that no other game really has before it. I also appreciate that they've set this first game of what I expect to be quite a few well in the past for Hogwarts, to allow us to adventure without feeling like we're stumbling into the original Harry Potter plot.I look forward to where this studio takes the idea from here, and would love to see how they may approach when modern day meets the fantasy of Hogwarts if they can press forward with their own expansive writing to the universe provided."

It looks and acts like a triple A' game. It is not a big studio that pushed this as an early access release  with a bunch of bugs. It runs pretty smoothly, here and there some fps lag, but a lot cleaner, more open world, more small detailes and easter eggs they did not need to put in but did in order for the world to come to life then the big studios this and last year. Very well done, A+ game. Again, way better than what some large buinsess companys are throwing out. this is a finished product already that's fun to play without a pay wall."
4220,64m3r,https://steamcommunity.com/id/niktr/,1,,1,81.9,March,12,52,0,1,"-Graphics are pretty great, although RayTracing is very glitchy on certain cards and doesn't work most of the time. The character models don't really interact with the lighting in the world which gives off this sort of Flat look to everything animated.BUT that said the world looks pretty amazing and you will stop to look at certain views, rooms and decorations within the game.On maximum settings, when everything works as it should, I'd give this a 9/10 for graphics-Sound design is one of this game's strong points. The spells, the soundtrack, the voice acting... pretty much all of it is about as good as you'd expect. No complaints from me. 10/10-Gameplay is fun overall. Plenty of side quests, collectibles, challenges, secrets and main quests to keep you entertained. I'd compare the gameplay with RPG games like Elder Scrolls or Fallout or Witcher. While the map isn't Big as those games, there's still a LOT of things to do even after the several hours of main quests.The game also has a Transmog system allowing you to change the appearance of your equipment using items you sold or discarded. So don't worry about looking like a Clown when you wear your strongest gear.And for you lazy walkers... there's also a teleport/fast travel system for pretty much every location, but I don't recommend using it since you might miss out on a lot of side quests or collectibles.Combat is pretty satisfying too, though sometimes it can be too easy, but I think that's my fault for doing too many side objectives.If you're a completionist, clear your schedule for the next week or more. 10/10-General nitpicks/complaints: *Raytracing is broken as well as character shading -2 in graphics score*Inventory only has 20 slots in TOTAL, while your character has 6 equipment slots. So that gives you about 3 items in total you can Keep per slot. If you think 3 items per slot sounds ridiculous, you're right. I have no idea what the developers were thinking. I'm 100% sure not a single one of the developers play tested this game for QoL. -1 points in gameplay score for a VERY important gameplay system in an RPG game.*I've also heard the game suffers from performance issues on certain hardware, but with my RTX 3060 I had no issues playing this on High to Epic. Although I settled for High due to FPS drops in open world combat.I can't comment on this issue personally so I won't deduct any points.*No Morality system. You would think... that making bad decisions, being a bully, or using cursed magic might make your a villain. Nope. This game doesn't care what you do in the slightest. You can extort students for money, you can cast Avada Kedavra, you can steal items... With no consequences other than a few NPCs looking at you funny.The Main quest and other quests will still have the exact same outcomes.This is a +/- situation. Some people will be disappointed, some people will be relieved. While I think it's very BORING that the game has no morality, at the same time I like that you can use Curses and earn money faster without the game punishing you.-Overall Score: 8.6/10, until they fix certain things.Edit: 20 hours into the game now... The devs did add the option to increase your inventory size, however you have to do certain Challenges, most of which you're not equipped for until later in the game. As such I've edited my -2 score to -1 instead.Also I would like to note that even after 20 hours of playing... I'm not even 25% done. I see no end in sight. This game is forever. Send Help."

The side-quest storylines are amazing, and you feel a sense of fulfillment when finishing them, despite the fact you never get to interact with that NPC again afterwords.But...The storyline is shaky at best, boring at semi-best, and tedious as hell at worst.  None of it really makes sense when you actually look at it for longer than it takes to skip all the extraneous dialogue and nothing is actually ever explained. Why is your character just now going to school for magic when it's increasingly obvious they have a pretty strong grasp on magic and the wizarding world?  Why does Ranrok, who needs someone with the ability to control/harness the 'ancient magic', suddenly not care about your character when he gets a diary telling him where the repository is?  Why didn't they just tell Isidora why she needed to stop instead of ""no, that's...that could be bad, oooo you gotta stop but we won't tell you exactly why""?  How does 'ancient magic' even work, and if it's so powerful why is no one other than Ranrok/Rookwood actively seeking our character out?  The ending is rushed, or feels that way at least, and nothing you did ever mattered other than gaining you house points (me and those five other Slytherin's were excited for that whole half-minute cutscene, though).  Evil, neutral, good -no ending you get matters because you're still the best student ever for saving the school despite what you did even though no one knows what you did except you and those missing friends of yours.The world, both inside and out of Hogwarts, is devoid of life.  You can't interact with anyone or anything outside of quests/lessons, so you can't connect with any of the characters they really want you to care about.  Not that it really matters if you care about them, really, because the moment you finish their questline, they vanish from the school unless they're needed for another cutscene.  I would genuinely love this game if it had more personality to it.  Let us interact with the world.  Give us the ability to do something other than quests and lessons and collectable hunts people only complete to 100% the game.  Maybe some interactions with fellow students or village residents -small minigames or interactions that break the monotony of the gameplay and let us have the chance to care about these characters, especially ones that we're supposed to be best friends with, apparently.  Let us have fun with the world, y'know?  Maybe even give us the ability to interact with our creatures/mounts, too.They've set up a lot for this game's future, but for now, it's not worth the time unless you want some mindless gaming in a world dominated by fetch-quests and collectables.Also, be best to get some mods to shut up the Floo lady, your character, and Deeks because you will legit hate hearing the same two lines over and over any time you do something or go near that NPC.  And maybe that one that lets you skip the Merlin Trials cutscenes."
4228,Pr0fEssOR,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039806338/,1,,1,44.7,March,11,77,0,1,"When I first saw the reveals back in 2022, I vividly remember telling myself - This looks too good to be true, this is  levels of marketing. I have to clarify, what amazed me the most about the reveals was the way the world looked and felt. It looked like living in one of the movies. The previous attempts to virtualize this world, while I agree were limited by the technology of their times, paled in comparison. This is a game we did not know we wanted. Fast forward to 2023, and I am choosing to skirt around all the JKR controversies, I got my hands on a copy, and promptly devoured what was on offer. Here is my attempt to quantify my experience.Hogwarts is alive. No other form of media has managed to drive this home as succinctly. The musical portraits, the secrets, the corridors, the staircases, I could go on. One might even call it justified to get the game just to be able to walk around inside Hogwarts, if one were so inclined (in other words a Potterhead).The rest of the world  alive, but it is not RDR2 immersive. While flying around the open world is exciting the first few times, the world does not draw you in. You are not hoodwinked into believing that you are part of the world. It feels synthetic.Hogwarts lessons here I come! The lessons, although scripted, were a welcome addition. Some of the assignments felt like a grind, but that is something I can forgive, since that is how you unlock new spells. The professors were well voice acted and felt memorable, mostly. You starting as a fifth year does mar the immersion a bit, but it is quickly forgotten. I came to cherish this experience as a student, eager to learn magic (something which Harry was never too interested in, to my utter disappointment).The combat is enjoyable, and felt snappy and rewarding. The spells effects and the combinations were an utter joy to experience and explore.Maybe my recent foray into BoTW has spoilt me, but the mechanics of Hogwarts Legacy just don't meld. There are cracks. There are grinds. There are meaningless mechanics. The whole Demiguise moon grind to upgrade Alohamora, to get more meaningless gear as loot, which you will just end up selling is a prime example. This mechanic did not need to exist, just as the meaningless lockpick minigame - they are wizards for Merlin's sake! Gear level and classes are almost meaningless, you will probably just stick with the highest class because it offers the most upgradability - regardless of the level of the gear. The room of requirement garden and petting zoo mechanics are also lacklustre and seem to lack any consequence.I will not go into too much detail here, for obvious reasons. I will say, though, that the overall story is serviceable, and enough to keep you occupied. A few of the side quests, in particular, are better than the main storyline. Also, to people complaining about the story, I would just like to draw your attention to the ."

As an open world Harry Potter game, I think it looks and feels great. I love the small interactions the student NPCs and Ghost NPCs have as I'm exploring the castle. I love how the castle is fully fleshed out and I can explore beyond Hogsmeade. The combat can be kind of a handful w/ shuffling through the spell sets, but I think it's fun overall. But, there are aspects of the exploration/challenges that are lacking and seemingly redundant. Why do I need to do another 20 of the same puzzle to get the last 5 extra inventory slots that won't really make much of a difference at that point in the game? I also don't feel there's enough incentive (achievements/rewards-wise) to complete some of the challenges. And why do I have 3 choices of mounts when there's pretty much nothing outside of the story quests that I'll need them? (Except for the flying broomstick, I suppose)And near the end of the game (main story quest while also completing the major side story quests), I noticed there was still a decent amount of unexplored areas of the map. Whether it's due to my laziness of not doing every single little side quest that comes my way or I've somehow missed on something important, is another story - but it made me wonder why all this space was here in the first place. Who knows, they might add some additional content that'll make it seem more worthwhile.*tiny spoiler* After unlocking Alohomora III, I didn't feel like gathering the rest of the demiguise statues. And I was kind of hoping that going up to Alohomora II or III would have a more complicated puzzle, but it was the same thing. And some of the rewards at higher tiered locks didn't really seem worth it. Also, there's pretty much nothing to spend your money on once you've pretty much maxed out your gear. Not that I should expect a student would need to spend 30k galleons on anything, but still.Overall, if you just purely enjoy the world of Harry Potter and want to live out some of the things you've seen in the movies or read in the books, I think you'll like it. If you're the type of gamer who's used to having Skryim-levels of never-ending questing, then the game might feel a bit ""meh"" to you."

That being said most things don't scale well late game and you will barely have an opportunity to use it.The quick travel system is convenient however you'll quickly want to murder the inventor thereof. The different challenges throughout the game, merlin trial, caves, cairns, balloons. They all are interesting and seem a bit novel at least the first few times you do them. By the time you get to the end of the game you just want it to be over.So it's a great game if you predominantly stick to the main quest and some side quests that interest you. You can do everything but pace yourself it can get tedious after a while."
4261,Chimpo,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198377566748/,1,,1,64.9,March,10,373,0,1,"This is a fairly average game in kind of the Ubisoft open-world style. What makes the game worth your time is the world and atmosphere. I'm not a huge Potterhead so I'm not tapped into all the lore but the one area that stands out to me is just the mystery of the magic world the game takes place in. The combat, the puzzles, the story, and the open world activities are all pretty standard. Having said that, there's something magical about running around the castle casting Revelio every 10 seconds and finding all the secrets of the castle or just zooming around the open world on your broom.Worth going through the story, raising some magical beasts, and exploring the open world but you will find a lot of the open world activities get bland pretty quickly."

The combat is a lot of fun, the world is well detailed, beautiful, and has a ton of side quests/activities to do. Now that's not to say the game is perfect, it does lack RPG elements, and it overall could have used more content;  but regardless of the cons, this game is a 10/10 in my book. It is the first game in a very long time in which I took the time to 100% and obtain every single achievement. When I finished the game I was genuinely sad it was over, the only other games that have made me feel this way are Elden RIng and The Witcher 3. I cannot wait to come back to this game a year from now with (hopefully) DLC, the PS5 exclusive shop/quest, and the tons of mods which will be fully fleshed out by then. Worth full price!"

If you like magic and puzzle solving along with some great storylines and interactive questing this is the game for you!  There are so many different side quests and every one of them is an adventure in itself.  The hours of exploration and adventure go above and beyond.  It gripped me from the start and continues to give me more with every new discovery I make.  I never want this game to come to an end it's so good.  Thank You Warner Bros for making my dreams of becoming a HufflePuff come true.  Hands down best game of the year right here!!! Best part is there are 4 houses to choose from to represent in Hogwarts Legacy and they each have their own storyline and quests.  When you finish with one house you can start again with a new character giving you hours upon hours of gameplay.  Warning....this game is addictive!

Took my time and felt the atmosphere was great and gameplay very good.Let's get over the downside first, because it's short: the game is not optimized well and has performance dips. Used to be very big during the first week of the game, but now it's better.This game draws you in and makes you take your time and enjoy the scenery, the castle, the magic. It has great atmosphere and looks absolutely amazing (apart from some character faces and mimic, but it's not bad either).You can take your time and explore, you can do main quests, you can do side quests, it's quite well put together and the quests don't feel tedious. I haven't felt like I did any kind of grind in the game.Fighting isn't clunky and the spell casting looks very good. There are many things to collect in the game so my advice is just take your time and enjoy."

Ability to customise spell layout is a huge improvement over the old movie games. Many throwbacks are fun little inserts from those old games (yes you can cast flipendo, and horklumps) that make reminiscent players smile, without being stupidly shoehorned in. This game takes the books, movies, and culture and makes it playable. I've gotten many more hours because my wife insists on family sharing so I pop offline.If you're not hugely into harry potter, it's fairly immersive but I don't know how great the story will grab you. Also tons of cutscenes so your 2 hour return window might be tight. Decent 3rd person shooter vibes, great music, and Fable-esque dry wit made this game just perfect for me."

There is still hope, love and light, and choices that we make every single day that can make a difference. We can choose to be strong, brave, united."" - Prof. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian DumbledoreFor me, as someone who grew up with Harry Potter, this game was something I could have only dreamed of. I played a few of  the old Harry Potter games, but this game is certainly a force to be reckoned with. The gameplay and combat is very smooth and engaging and I'm actually kind of sad that I seem to have exhausted everything this game has to offer.The worldbuilding is phenomenal and it really feels as if you are indeed a Hogwarts student exploring ancient ruins, going to Hogsmeade for a butterbeer or attending Defence Against the Dark Arts. I think it was a fantastic idea to play as your own character, in a time far away from Harry Potter. This game however did still capture the magical spirit of the wizarding world perfectly. Some of the quests really made me laugh out loud. It was like being transported back in time to when I read the books for the first time...There were some minor bugs, but thankfully no game-breaking bugs for me. Also, some riddles were a little bit repetitive, but I can look past that, because I've had over 100 hours of fun playing this game.Thank you so much for making this game, Avalanche!Revelio.

4313,Zombie Cutter,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970098980/,1,,1,97.7,March,8,357,0,1,"Quite possibly the best open world RPG I have ever played. I have over 50 hours now I believe and I dont think I am even halfway through the story because I love just exploring the world. I am also not a huge harry potter fan, so that should tell you how great this game is on its own merits. The world is huge and full of stuff to explore and find. The combat is very fun and satisfying, and combines the best features of some systems from other games. If you have played Arkham or Spider man, this will feel a bit familiar. It isn't a copy and paste of those systems, it takes the best parts, adds cool stuff, and really perfects it in my opinion.If you are a Harry Potter fan this is a must buy. If you aren't, I still think it's a must just for the quality game that it is. So many ""AAA"" games are rushed, published unfinished, and are shameless cash grabs. This one reminds of the good old days when game devs did it for the love of making something great, believing that a quality product would in turn bring the profits. Incredibly well done."

The game was made by fans for the fans. You can really feel the love put into Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. The rest of the world doesn't have anything wrong with it at all, but the real point of the game is for the Castle. The story is decent. The characters are OK. There's only a few amazing characters in my opinion and they seem to be the general public's favorite as well (Sebastian, Ominous, Poppy, and Prof Fig).

The magic and whimsy is palpable and the sheer attention to detail that the devs put into the design of the school itself is nothing short of a labor of love. Some of my best moments in the game were literally just encountering a location and realizing ""Oh my god! This is the EXACT spot that so-and-so did such-and-such from the movie/book!""The game truly brings the wizarding world to life and it was such a thrill and a pleasure to experience the little things we dreamed of growing up: Wizard duels, flying a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ broom!, exploring the forbidden forest, learning spells etc.The only true letdowns for me were A) No quidditch :'( and B) Being railroaded (which I get why) into being the classic cut & dry hero (I really wanted my proper dark wizard experience). All of these things, however, were forgiven by just the absolute excellence of the rest of the game. Downloading the mouse controls mod for the broom turned flying into my favorite pastime; no joke I could do that for hours...♥♥♥♥ is cash.Put your politics on the backburner friends and just enjoy the magic this game offers.

Alot of the negative reviews are either from people who hate harry potter, or they are members of the lettuce gorganzola bacon tomato+. Combat is exactly how it should be for a wizarding world game and is implemented great. World exploration is also A+ the map is large but not so large that youre just running around empty spaces for hours on end, the map is very dense with things to do. Graphics are also good, not GOW, or LOU level but i think the game looks great, espeically with all the magical effects. There is also just alot to do in the game and it all feels natural. Whether you want to customize your own space, play a psudo pokemon collector, partake in races, classes, or challenges from class mates, to flying around on your broom or mount, solving puzzles for hidden treasure, or honing your combat skills clearing bandit/enemy camps. Theres something here for everyoneThe visuals are stunning and the gameplay is challenging. I'd recommend this one for anyone even slightly into gaming and fantasy themes.

The Hogwarts school is beautiful and a joy to explore, but the open world is what you'd expect from other such games - boring and repetitive. The same Merlin trials/one room dungeons copy/pasted a hundred times to fill the map. I think they've done a pretty good job with the combat. You can make use of an arsenal of popular spells to combo juggle your enemies with. The protego parry system is also responsive and straight forward. The story felt okay, nothing groundbreaking. I wish they'd had the time to develop some of the other side characters more. The magical beast collecting is a nice side activity, but didn't really grab me as it felt pointless after I acquired most of the materials for upgrades.Unfortunately, there are still some performance issues plaguing the game. Hogsmeade is a stuttery mess, some parts of Hogwarts too. The open world is smooth though. I recommend the game as it's a solid action adventure experience, but temper your expectations a bit before you play."

The game is pretty amazing, you can tell a huge effort was made to recreate Hogwarts in the most precise way possible. Everything is where it should be, and the references to the original saga always put a smile on my face. The only thing that seems off is the magnitude of the events and how goblins are depicted as evil, ghost-like, monsters. Imho it is a bit too much to fit into the HP storyline."

No risk taken on the quest design, with a very classic story line.•Pros : ✓A rich and well detailed game (specifically Hogwarts).✓The game makes you feel like you are both discovering Hogwarts, the dark forest, Hogsmead, the highlands... All the places you love should be there...✓Except maybe for Diagonalley but Hogsmead makes you kind of forget that.✓Flying around with a (full upgraded) broomstick is definitely enjoyable (considering adding some cool moves should've been great, maybe ?).✓No EA ""get to the top of a tower to reveal the map"". Juste fly around and enjoy!✓Casting all sorts of spells is cool.✓You feel like you're home even though the story is knew.✓Peeves is backCons :×Optimisation (PC)×Collect things, all the time×The quest are way too guided : you don't even have to think about a riddle. Just follow the pin on the screen and cast random spells. If it doesn't help : Revelio! And if it still doesn't help, wait 20s for a character to litterally speak the solution outloud.× ""Revelio!"" All the time, and you can't run while casting, cause your character needs to focus ? (you don't).×Mid game is getting boring as the game mecanics are at this point a bit repetitive (learn spell in a sec, find some items, gaze at the stars, Merlin's games...)×Fights are way too easy, don't bother using stealth unless it's specifically asked. A spell equals a button, no matter the complexity of it.×Once you've seen a castle, you've seen it all.×Our ennemies are spiders. We get it.×Mandatory getting-off-the-broomstick in certain parts of the map for... some reason?×The lack of character developpement throughout the story. What about a Fable-like design ? A dark wizard with a dark aura should've been great!×The enthousiasm of the character is SO boring (IMO). ×No Quidditch, but I get it, the game is already hudge (but you should do it. Do it please ?)Overall, I really enjoy the game. We can imagine how hard was the task to make the HP universe into a game that all the fans were expecting, and more. So well done, and thank you for make us live the HP expérience in a new way!"

The map is the best aspect of the game. The gameplay although fun at the start begins to get a bit dry later in the game. The boss fights were very disappointing, they reused boss fights too many times. The story was good and the characters were intriguing. My biggest gripe with the game was easily the level locking of story quests. I personally wanted to do side quests after completing the story but the game forces you to do otherwise. Id finish a quest and then have to grind to be high enough for the next. I should be able to play at my own pace. Overall I think Hogwarts legacy makes a bold statement that there can indeed be a good Harry Potter game. 7.5/10 Very Good"

Despite what  people might say about the goblin uprising, once you have even an ounce of context, it makes sense. It doesn't feel like we're some Mean-German-Mustache-Man beating down the rebellion. Moreso, we're putting an end to a mis-guided goblin corrupted by magic he had no way of truly understanding.With that said, here is my pro/con list to break it down.Great storyFantastic representationStrong replayabilityInteresting NPC'sAmazing score and sound effectsLasting choicesBoth heart warming and heart wrenching scenesHave to play on low graphics (with my 1080TI)Still experience some lag going through doorsShaders sometimes take fifteen minutes to loadLow optimizationLots of clothing clips"

The open world action RPG formula has gotten a bit stale over the years, but I didn't feel that at all with this game considering how enjoyable the combat was and how well they filled the game world with NPC interactions.  I found myself waiting to open up combat in certain dungeons to let goblins finish conversations and avoiding fast travel within Hogwarts to run into new ambient NPC events. The broom/fast travel system made it so the normal tedium found in open world exploration wasn't a bother.  My only critique (minor gripe) is that even playing as a dark mage, your character's verbal responses and social interactions still had you as a boiler-plate lawful good protagonist for the most part.  After murdering the 300th ashwinder by spreading curse magic  among their friends and family and turning their paramour into an exploding barrel to kill them with, the ""wow they'll never believe I took out an ashwinder"" statement was a little out of place.  Or the ""Hogsmeade is just lovely"" as I'm buying ingredients for more death piranha plants to genocide poachers. Hopefully game 2 (which seems inevitable at this point) fleshes out the choice and morality systems a bit."
4369,War Criminal Joseph Kony,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CatchException/,1,,1,82.5,March,7,256,0,1,"In 82.5 hours I've 100% completed this game. Is it worth the money in my opinion? Yes. If you enjoy a open world game where there are main quests that you can focus on with side quests around almost every corner then you'll love this game. I wish the broom was faster, after the amount of time and effort you put in to upgrade it I would have like to seen more of a speed increase. I don't expect to go from one corner of the map to the other in 2 seconds but at least feel like I'm zooming fast through the various mountainous areas. The game does a good job of guiding you through what you need to do without being too hand holdy. The difficulties are set up perfect for a wide range of players. Casual gamers can enjoy normal, hard core gamers will enjoy hard and for non-gamers who love the franchise and want to live the harry potter universe experience they can play on an adventure difficulty which turns the game into a almost sit back and relax game making the combat encounters much easier.All I can say in regards to improvements required.... WE NEED QUIDDITCH! Either make a spin off game like the PS2 Harry Potter Quidditch World Cup or add it via a DLC. Either way if implemented right I'm willing to pay £30-50 for it!"

I would go as far to say this is probably the most, if not the most, detail visually I have ever seen in a game.-The music has some really high points. They do a good job of making it feel like Harry Potter without copy and pasting the original score.-The combat is actually pretty solid and a lot better than expected. There is a certain style to it and there are small nuances that I was not expecting from this game. -The story is a pro and con. On the pro side it has some really good moments that feel very Harry Potter. which makes it jarring when a voice line or absurd writing drags you over to con territory. -Gotta catch em all. Save animals from Poachers by Poachin....I mean saving them to keep in your own personal farm. Cons:-Some really lame dated RPG elements. Though the challenges at least hands out rewards for doing some of this.  (collect all the useless things, kill an arbitrary amount of generic enemies, delivery all the packages)-Voice acting can be all over the place.-Side quests range from pretty interesting to so bad its hard to believe they are in the same game.-no quidditch-inventory limited without any reason to be (tents are bigger on the inside, why not my pockets)-The story again is a pro and a con. The logic in the writing is maddeningly bad at times. there are times when I am asking why we are doing something one way when the game itself already solved this problem. Or we overlook very simple solutions that could be found by doing the most basic of research or asking a professor.Overall, I will say, I am still surprised at how good this game is. Though, there are some glaring issues that keep it from being an amazing game. What is wild to me is that I have never had a game that has hit such highs while simultaneously being so bad or boring at moments. Like I can go from encountering a dragon to immediately completing a landing pad. There are also things that have great potential that are reduced to simple shells of a idea (treasure vaults). Meanwhile I can pass a snowman who vanishes like magic before me. All while riding a thestral. The games is probably the closest thing to riding a roller coaster I have ever played haha"
4387,DG Zintho9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zintho9/,1,,1,66.4,March,6,326,0,1,"To sum up the experience, this game has a disappointing lack of content but what is there is good enough to warrant a play through. Potter fans will love getting to explore the setting, those not invested may find the experience lacking.7/10 - Good experience, only really something special for the people who already love HP. It took me around 47 hours to 100% a character, including getting the achievements for doing one of everything for several tasks. This feels fairly weak when weighed against how much time I spent on a 100% run of Witcher 3. Compared to other AAA titles that follow the same formula, there is little attention paid to the activities you can take part in outside the main story line. There are a myriad of different mini games that could have been included in the game that would have allowed a broader experience (Gobstones, Quidditch, Wizard Chess, Trading Cards, etc). The lockpicking activity is overall pointless and only acts to interrupt the gameplay, the same sentiment is shared with the sections of the game where you need to slowly crawl under something or are forced to watch a cutscene after completing a treasure vault / Merlin Trial. I found no real benefit to the beast breeding system, you have enough money from selling all the gear you pick up to purchase anything of value. The inclusion of Hippogriffs and Graphorns as mounts was lukewarm and had no real purpose outside of the singular quests they were associated with. The lack of skill based activities, such as a fleshed out potion making system that promotes following a recipe, maybe similar to how Cook, Serve, Delicious! handles cooking, instead of just only being able to wait for a timer to tick down was disappointing. The lack of a morality system severely reduces the repeatability of the game. The treasure vault locations were mainly dead content that added nothing to the experience, they should have severely cut the number of those present and actually worked to create unique puzzles that took more than thirty seconds to solve while drastically increasing the rewards given. The final cutscene for the house cup was just awful, five people jumping around in a circle while the actual tables of the great hall were completely empty. There seemed to be a lot of attention put into the Room of Requirement, but I never was in it longer than it took to grab all my Mallowsweet and Wiggenweld potions or complete what ever quest had me talk to Deek. The VA performances were good for the main dialogue, but the shouts used for the broom trials were pretty terrible. The quality for some of the audio files also seemed to be fairly questionable. The lack of choice when it came to the PC's VA was disappointing, I would have enjoyed to see maybe three different options that would allow for unique dialogue or interactions. The combat system was fun enough, but even on the hardest difficulty you get to the point where you can kill a troll in three hits without using AK. The music scoring was very good, no complaints on that front. The castle itself is populated wonderfully, I really enjoyed seeing the ambient interactions that the NPCs would have and exploring all the different secrets it held. The sidequests were engaging, I'd say more than the main quests. The graphics are done wonderfully, the facial animations are a bit on the stiff side, but the environments are well crafted.Did I enjoy my playthrough? Yes. Will I be playing it again? No, unless some new content is released."
4388,Jimmy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Azmael/,1,,1,81.9,March,6,978,0,1,Hogwarts Legacy perfectly captures the charm and magic of the wizarding world we grew up with from the books as kids.It is a love letter to the franchise.Just walking around the school gave me goosebumps! And the game itself is an awesome and very fun RPG.I was wondering how they would handle combat but it is fun and engaging. Sort of lite childfriendly version of Souls combat.Im deep into the story and i must say it is interesting and once again it just captures that wizard vibe so so so well.The world building is fantastic!If you are a Harry Potter fan this game is a must. Dont even buy on sale get it full price lets support the studio so that they can make an even better sequel.
4389,Willard,https://steamcommunity.com/id/secxwillard/,2,,1,44.9,March,6,123,0,1,Solid 8/10Open world is very pretty and there is a lot to explore.Can get repetitive at times with the same enemies and such.

Exceeded my expectations for sure!Pros:- Some great missions!- Hogwarts itself is a joy to explore, so big you can get lost, but that added to the immersion for me.- Mostly good voice acting, especially from the main characters.- Combat system is well-designed and really satisfying.- The Room of Requirement is awesome!- Broom flying is awesome!- Clothing system is one of the best I've seen!- I love the field guide pages!- The animal mechanics are well done.- Graphics are great!- Has a LOT of potential for great DLCs!Cons:- Lacks interesting and difficult missions/side quests. Most side quests are repetitive.- Too much unnecessary dialogue.- Disappointed that there is no Quidditch, hoping it will at least be a DLC.- Character creation system is not good. And the voice pitching feature is just sad.- Friendship mechanic could be improved to add more depth to relationships.- Most characters are kind of dry.- Main story is a bit boring.- Decisions made throughout the game don't seem to have an impact on the overall outcome.- Boss battles aren't particularly memorable or challenging.- Not really any consequences for things like: going into the Forbidden Forest, Getting caught out of bed at night, and so on. Which I thought would have added to the immersion.- Terribly optimized for PC. Even has stuttering on high end PCs."

The biggest flaw is that it does not make you feel that Hogwarts is your new home..  it just a place, finish the crap and move on..  Room of requirement just makes it worse as it separates you from it.  Maybe if things were better planned out and you were locked in castle for longer with decent quests that would lead you and make you connect with your house and professors.. instead of  few cut scenes for classes Still game is good  and quite similar in design to recycled AC series."

World design and graphics are definitely the strengths of this game. World looks breathtaking, and there is a decent amount of things to do. Rarely ran into a structure that didn't either have a purpose or loot. Only downsides of this game are the performance and, too an extent, variety in combat. There is one boss in the game that is entirely unique; however, most of the bosses don't require much innovation to defeat. Performance is the other downside. Computer comes with a 1060 3GB and 7th Gen Intel Core i7-7700. Game runs fine at lowest settings, but stutters at anything higher."

If you are a hardcore gamer who's experienced a myriad of RPGs and games like Witcher 3, RDR 2, Persona 5 Royal, this game's open world will feel empty, boring and annoying at how many filler activities there are. The open world aspect is basically a Ubisot game with Harry Potter skin over it. Nevertheless, Hogwarts itself is ASTONISHING, so so good. The combat, despite getting stale pretty quick, is pretty fun. All in all, a solid game, especially for a first attempt. Now that they nailed down hogwarts, they can improve from here and make a masterpiece of a game for HP fans and a great game in general. Looking forward to it."

So much beauty so much details for the environment. Excellent job developers, excellent job artists !! Best $50 I have ever spent !!PS : I started this game with my cheap PC with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spec, I could not do any battle without freezing every spell casted despite all low settings...so I built a whole new PC only, only for this game. Now I can play it nicely without any lag, its worth every penny haha.Please make the sequel, take your time, I dont care if its 5 years or 7 years. I'll wait :DOr you could create a TV series with Ominis Gaunt as the main character. Imagine the abused child who was tortured by his parents to force him to cast Crucio/Avada Kedavra, he is starved and beaten everyday and finally he was fed up, he finally casted the spell but ended up killing his father/mother/siblings etc. Then get shunned because of it despite not his fault, locked inside the dungeon, starved, worse than Harry's life in Dursley's house. Until one day the letter from Hogwarts came and invited him to attend school, he was freed and happy, although there are several students in Hogwarts bullied him because of his blindness, he found his best friend Sebastian and having the best time of his life. But then he found the nice aunt (who is the only family member actually loved him, died in the Scriptorium) So much potential for this story."
4419,antegria,https://steamcommunity.com/id/antegria/,1,1,1,45.1,March,5,34,0,1,"It was great to finally come home to Hogwarts. This game revives your best childhood memories, creates new ones and has great potential for memes production. It also managed to gather fun and enjoyable community around the game. There are some things that united us all, no doubt:1) Yes, Slytherin along with Ravenclow and Hufflepuff hold great parties. Yes, Gryffindor, your attendance is very much questionable.2) Ignatia haunts me every day. Yes, I am always up to something and yes, I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE HOW INCONVENIENT TRAVEL WAS BEFORE SHE INVENTED FLOO POWDER. Jesus Christ.3) Oh, the joy it brings to save those fantastic beasts from poachers. I very much enjoyed becoming a better poacher myself, stealing beasts from their natural habitats, putting them into my fake vivariums and holding them against their will for feathers and stuff. They are fed and protected though, no worries.Despite all the cool stuff that was in the game, the main story seemed a bit short. The house you choose or being assigned to doesn't affect the gameplay that much (apart from possible additional side quests). You cannot fully embrace being a part of a particular house. Different brooms and cosmetics does not affect the way you fly. Same goes for wands.I would appreciate more quests with interesting lines and choices, as it was with Sebastian. For me, it was one of the best lines in the game so far.Nevertheless, all of those puzzles, chests and secrets will keep you entertained (personal no for Merlin trials, tho). Great way to spend time in Hogwarts and well, see you on the next party, don't forget your potions and herbs my young wizards."

It is quite pleasing to fly around the Hogwarts and surrounding area.2) Combat: Although it could be improved, in general, combat is quite fun. Playing at hard difficulty reduces the reaction time you could have between enemy attacks. It can be quite satisfying as you improve your skills.Let's talk about the the thinks I strongly disliked about this game.1) Quests and Main Story line: It is simply BORING. The main premise is cheesy at best and the story line is very linear.2) Dialogues: There are mostly two options. One ""kind"" and one ""rude"". In most cases there is no ""in between"". The dialogues are very robotic, and some of them are full of cringe.3) Toxic inclusiveness: This is the general trend in the world nowadays. Some Netflix shows, Ring of Power TV series, etc. For the sake of being inclusive of various cultures of the world, producers bastardise the original contents. In this game, this was done relentlessly and I do not see the sincerity of this decision. It simply makes me facepalm every 5 minutes.4) No Logic: I annihilated foes with Avada Kedavra while accompanied with others. There was absolutely no effect to my characters relationship with them. WTF! Not even a dialogue after the fight? Cheesus...Please do yourself a favour and do not pay the full price for this game."

4443,AnnieIsOk,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033738760/,1,,0,49.7,March,5,189,3,1,"oh my...While the developers definitely showed a love for the HP universe and tried to include as much detail as possible, I simply cannot recommend the game because of its game design. Lets start with the good stuff:The good:- The game is extremely faithful to the source material- it tries to beinclusive: the player is able to create a character to his/her/their liking, there even is a transgender character in game, you have some missions with. I like, how they handled the character of Sirona even though I'd love to have had more missions with her.- the background-NPCs have animations and dialogue, which gives them life and increases immersion. Between students getting angry letters from their parents, getting caught and reprimanded by teachers and funny pieces of dialogue hinting at mistakes or magic fails, the devs showed a lot of love towards those background-characters that otherwise are ignored by players. I found myself stopping to watch and listen to them quite a few times. I really enjoyed that.- Extremely beautiful open world. The general design of waterfalls, small villages and abandoned castles feels fitting and like a realistic environmentThe ""meh"" (the not-so-good):- I have played the game in german and, sadly, the quality of the voice acting sometimes is lacking. Sometimes the voices almost feel mechanical as opposed to the words they are actually expressing. - In game, you can actually select your own house. This, of course, poses the question on how to approach the fact of the players house, but only a few dialogue lines by Sebastian Sallow really mention your house. In all other cases the devs gloss over the fact more or less elegantly. To me, it was very disheartening to have the final celebration and being awarded the winning house points only to have the final game dialogue go ""100 points to THE HOUSE"". - Generally, I would have loved to have a fixed name for my character, so he could've been mentioned by name. A lot of times it feels quite impersonal to be called 'the new one' 'your friend' and so on.- speaking of house points: In the potter-verse house points never were really thought through and have always been a point of ridicule. Why the developers then decided to have teachers give us house points with undisclosed amounts is a mystery to me. They'd easily get away with ""50 points for x"" without really breaking something. Currently they just say ""points to x"". It just feels weird.- In the beginning, I hoped to interact more with side characters. For example the player needs to find some marbles for a ravenclaw girl, so I hoped to be able to play with her after the quest. Nope, no can do. You cannot really talk to them anymore, so interacting with them is pointless.- some spells: A few of the spells we only use like 2-3 times in game. Why implement a spell like reparo if there is almost nothing to repair around, exept for a few pseudo cinematics?The bad:- Hogsmeade: I really really hate that town. Not for its beautiful and detailed streets and shops, but for the simple fact that I cannot do what we all wanted to do: Assemble my friends and visit the three broomsticks for butterbeer and Honeydukes for sweets, buy something funny at Zonko's. Instead our character walzes in everywhere just takes a randomly placed mug or muffin and chomps down on it like a caveman (or -woman). It is such a shame that we cannot meet there with our friends, even after the game concluded.  - the inventory system, sellers and money: Honestly, game mechanics like this should be forbidden under threat of prison time. The player can get new gear by opening up chests and loot drops by enemies. However, the slots for clothing (which improves our stats) are very limited. So limited in fact, that I ran out of space before even having access to hogsmeade and its vendors. So, with no other option, you start to sift through your gear in front of chests, in an attempt to weed out bad gear and destroy it to make room for new. Destroying gear does not give anything back however and the content of chests always is randomized. The values of that gear in fact are so randomized, that quite often i got gear that my level was too low for, but the stats of the gear were way worse than what I had. So, after a while, you'll find yourself visiting hogsmeade practically after every encounter, as your inventory is way too small, to sell the gear. Yes, one can expand the inventory by solving merlin's puzzles of which there are 95 in game, but still the game could've done with less merlin and more inventory. Collecting loot and selling it is very important, as you need a ton of money to advance in quests and expand your crafting room. I still dont get why it was necessary to hide those things behind a literal grind-wall. Merlins puzzles are really easy and repetetive btw.- the equipment system: You can equip things in your face, on your head, wear gloves, scarves, cloaks and outfits. You can even decide on a specific look. so why is it bad? Because you cannot lock in your desired look and everytime you try to optimize your gear to get better stats, you need to change your look back. The game throws A LOT of gear at you and you will change your gear often in order to always be protected the best. After a while it really is annoying to always change it back. This could've been fixed so easily, why did none of the play-testers notice that?- Too many collectibles, puzzles and so on: The large world holds a lot of collectibles and challenges. 95 merlins puzzles, 33 demiguise statues, broom challenges, caves, enemy encampments.. To get 100% in this game would take about 90 hours of grinding every region. This is way too much and, in my opinion really walks the line of being abusive to the player.- The world is too big. There, I said it. You can cross the world on your mount if you want, but be prepared to mind-numbingly fly in one direction for more than 5 Minutes. Combined with the head-ache inducing amount of collectibles and explorer-content, it really takes a lot of time to see everything. You really need the floo network, like the kind Ms. Wildsmith is very kindly reminding us, everytime we use it. Thanks to this lady's quibs it really is torture to travel.- Ignatia Wildsmith: Extra point because her dialogue quibs are so horribly annoying, modders rushed to release a mod to combat this annoying torture-by-chatter. You can get it on NexusMods.- game logic, stealing: In a quest to find gear to wear or sell, you will break in almost everywhere. Somehow this is normal, even if you break in someones cellar during a quest, there are no consequences at all. The NPCs just will stare at you, else nothing happens.- game logic, poachers and saving: The poacher quest line is a major part of the game, in which we set out to save the poor animals from their evil hands. Yet, in the same line we are given poacher gear and are told to ""save"" the animals... by kidnapping them from their habitat locations (spawn points) and trapping them inside the room of requirement in hogwarts, where we force feed them, breed them and clean them via spell, so they produce resources for us. So basically we save them from exploitation by kidnapping and exploiting them? And all characters in game know this and are not only fine with it, they advocate for it, even those who should advocate for the animals to live in a free natural environment. That's prime logic- the story: God it feels so forced. I think having the character be older was a good decision, but it comes with no rewards other than unlocking the next part of the story. The Character is a very special guy, who can see old magic and the story suggests he is on his way to unlock a lot of might. In order to prove his character he is sent to multiple boss fights (only one of which is unique). After each section, the player is shown memories in a pensieve, that are there to show the responsibility that comes with it (1/x)"

This is a game made for those who love Harry Potter. It fulfills that promise. For those who came here for a groundbreaking story, a magical combat system, you are not getting that. Most of that is an afterthought, The story is very stereotypical, you can see the plot coming a mile away. The threat is very underplayed and the antagonist is not very threatening, nothing feels at stake, and you are the typical protagonist chosen by fate for an obvious purpose. The combat is nothing groundbreaking, but it is satisfying. One thing that does shine is not only the open world but also its characters. They FEEL developed, except for the antagonists. You actively understand their struggles, joys, what they stand for in life, and their emotions(the last one is underplayed by the game's lack of face capture). Overall, the game is fun. Side quests take 5 to 10 minutes to complete and don't feel like as much of a chore. If you want a good Harry Potter game, this is it. Get it. It is worth it. As a harry potter fan, I give it an 8.5 out of 10. But core gamers may give it a 7 out of 10."

The game promises to have stunning visuals, with detailed environments and character models that truly capture the magic and wonder of the Wizarding World. The game also promises to have a rich and immersive story-line, with a wide range of quests and activities to explore and delivers on it positively.It offers players a range of customization options, allowing them to tailor the game's graphics and performance to their individual preferences. This means that players can adjust settings such as resolution, graphics quality, and control schemes to optimize their game-play experience and ensure that they are fully immersed in the world of Hogwarts.The game also need a bit of polish here and a bit of optimization there with some bug fixes.The only need from players' side would be the missing Quidditch game. I would like to formally request WB to release a DLC for the same."

4453,jukuRi™,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jukuri3/,2,,1,56.8,March,5,272,0,1,"It's a good game, but still far from perfect. I think the best thing about the game is clearly the HP universe. The attention to detail, including a lot of amazing animations especially inside the castle, is the real tidbit of the game. But as soon as you leave the castle and Hogsmeade, you can clearly see that the world just acts as a scenery and doesn't feel as alive as in other open world games. Still, the game simply looks awesome and was, at least on my PC, running without any bugs or FPS drops. The other big thing of the game are the fighting mechanics. Using various combinations of spells feels very powerful, especially as soon as you unlock the unforgivable curses. But apart from that has the game unfortunately a lot of flaws: - Main story not that catching but okay- Side quests are very very boring and uninspired except for a few (they feel more like ""we have to implement stereotype xyz in order not to offend anymore, what can we do with these characters?"")- Dialogues in general are extremely poorly written and destroy the immersion in a lot of scenes. Everyone is just so f*cking nice to everyone all the, it's ridiculous and doesn't feel natural at all - Loading screens to enter caverns, dungeons etc. - Way too many collectibles (especially Merlin Trials and chests)- Repetitive enemies (mostly spiders and other wizards)- Often moments that are intended to feel epic can't really create this feelingThe game still was worth playing and I hope there will be HL2 which fixes many flaws of part 1"

4490,Sir Ranger,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GlitchedLeaf/,1,,1,64.7,March,4,83,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is an amazing single-player open world game in which you will be the protagonist of a completely new story in the wizarding world. You will fight against a goblin uprising and wield an ancient form of powerful magic which you will learn more about through out your mission.The game has really surprised me, you can actually feel as if you really where a student in Hogwarts. You will learn new skills and spells from your teachers, whom they all have interesting backgrounds. You will also be able to visit iconic places from the books/movies and interact with them.This game will give you around 50 hours of complete fun and immersion while you fight for the future of the wizarding world and explore all that it has to offer. The music and ambience are incredible and the combat system is really fun, letting you combine some of the most popular and well-known spells and curses to defeat your opponents. Most of the side quest also have interesting stories and even some of them will prove your morale as you debate on what's right and what's wrong to achieve your goals. The open world feels alive and really invites you to explore, the graphics are amazing and the soundtrack really slap much of the time, specially when you're flying with your mount over the magical landscape.Right now I've only found two main problems with the game.-The first one is that the game will force you to 100% it if you want to ""finish it"": The final mission, which is sort of a prologue mission after you finished the main story, requires you to have completed all challenges, all missions, found all missing pages throughout the world, etc. Which can be very annoying if you don't have the patience for that.-Second problem: Although I mentioned that some missions will make you make moral decisions, these hardly affect the story, if not at all. Those who wanted to play with different moral alignments, try to see how their actions would impact the world and see the opinion that the people would have towards them, will be a bit disillusioned to see that you can only play as ""the good guy"". It doesn't matter whether you are a lawful good student trying it's best to help everyone or if you extort and bully them and proceed to start blasting the unforgivable curses to everything that moves; the story will be the same with no noticeable changes.Overall, it is an amazing game worth playing and it will give you hours of genuine fun. But don't expect to find too much complexity on any aspect of the gameplay or the story."

If you enjoyed the original games, books, or films, or even just a cozy game I HIGHLY recommend Hogwarts Legacy. I am most impressed by the design of the world with the accuracy to the franchise and the beautiful graphics, I also can't get over the Room of Requirement! The Room of Requirement has to be one of my favorite aspects of the customization, there are hidden surprises and customization factors you can earn through quests and exploration; it's like a serotonin feeder. Don't get me started on all of the vivariums and beasts you can collect. On top of all of these beautiful base features we can thank the Modding community for additional shaders and many other things to bring more life to the world. However unfortunately, there are some downsides to the game, none deal breaking in my opinion.  While this isn't meant to turn you away from the enjoyment of the game play or purchasing it is worth mentioning the cons. Considering this game is in the early stages I don't doubt the Developers will make due of the communities collective constructive criticism. The first major take away a lot of players including myself were disappointed by was the lack of involvement of Ravenclaw in personalized story side quests, lack of house events, and no Quidditch. Adding in possible future DLCs would be an amazing opportunity. Minor things I noticed was the lack of interactivity with Npcs and non magical animals. As a take away I think for how well the game is so early on from release I am very pleased and fully enjoyed the narrative."

Magical feels overused but that's exactly what this game is. There is so, so many magical things and details from which you can see how much love went into this. I've finished the main story now, played almost a 100 hours and I still keep gasping and tearing up at every corner. This game made me laugh, cry and everything in between. I'm not a completionist but this game makes me want to complete every single thing just so that I discover all of the astonishing details to the environment and the characters. I'm someone who skips through dialogues in games because it's hardly ever interesting or well written and I haven't skipped a single sentence here. I hate combat that counts on your reflexes because I have anxiety but this game made the difficulty so well balanced I actually enjoy being able to react.But my absolute favourite and by far the most unexpected game mechanics is the room of requirement and the ability to decorate so much space. As someone with hundreds of hours in Sims 4 spent mostly building houses, I have to tell you that I cried every time the room expanded and gave me more space. Honestly, it's even a bit overwhelming and I begged it to stop but I guess it knows what's in my heart.Do I have things I wish the game had? Absolutely. Do I still think it's the best, most intricate and most magical game I've ever played? You bet. The amount of gameplay and the size of the world makes up for any details I would've welcomed but I do hope we'll get some future content because I want to continue living in this world. Though to be honest, I'll continue to do just that even without the content. Still so much space to decorate, so many sunsets and sunrises to see and gasp at and so many cats to pet!TL;DR: This game made me laugh at all the little details and cry literal tears over some others. 10/10 would cry again. Also, they kind of had me at petting the cats."

The choices you make determine your outcome, the combat is flawless in my opinion, and the exploration is top tier. My only grievances are that some of the puzzles feel a little too easy, but all in all I think the game is very fun and enjoyable. As well as some of the visuals of the castle and the lake don't line up with the books / movies, but that is a very small detail.

No matter what you buy, you are supporting some sort of unethical practice. So by their own logic, these people shouldn't buy anything at all. In the end, they are just hypocrites who like to hold others to impossibly high ethical standards that they themselves don't follow."""

I do not in its current state recommend the game. If we're talking story, graphics, exploration, world building, voice acting, combat, I would 100% recommend it. So do not take it as the game is bad in anyway. It's amazing.My beef is with the performance. I had pretty much finnished game besides the last quest, which takes you to the credits. Celebrating your year at Hogwarts. I came back now after multiple updates & the game ran even worse. Big memory leaks, big fps drops & stutters. I have a pc well equipped to run in Ultra, but even on High am i getting problems. Which is known issue amongst all players & many youtubers who have done deep dives in to what the best options are. I'm just tired off triple A games always having ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance on release. I would suggest coming back in a year & checking up on it. Like a video ""Hogwarts in 2024"" & see the current status."

After the consideration when my friend had begun to play, I decided it was the right thing to do. I hadn't given myself proper retail therapy for a long time, and as the HP franchise is something I did grow up with but drifted away from, this was the perfect opportunity. The game is great! It's very simple in its story and reminds me of how games used to be. Not necessarily stale or linear, but enough so that you can easily follow along while still stopping to do side quests or to look for collectibles. The characters are quite memorable, and although Sebastian seems to have more of a spotlight, many of the other characters make up for it in personality. My favourite character is Ominis. The graphics are stunning, and even with a now outdated laptop, still runs quite well as the game streams its content in a way I'm not used to. Bugs happen, but that's the norm these days. The developers are working quickly on updates and seem very connected to the community, which is a great privilege considering the controversy surrounding the series. If you plan to play this game due to the controversy and wonder if it's worth it, I do recommend this game. Even if you expect it to not be the best, you may still find yourself having a bit of fun."

Great game for a young audience being introduced into the wizarding world, however I believe the real target audience are gamers in there 30s that grew up with it.My first play through was on Hard and the game was still relatively unchallenging, if you go to sleep and you don't dream of Revelio did you even explore?I do believe the game should have more content, as you do not really get a common room or house experience. Since house points do not matter an you receive almost all of your quests outside the common room. Think I only went there 3 times.New Game + into another House would be nice so you do not have to recollect everything. Seeing as you will beat the game before you collect half of it. Great game for what it is, but severely lack luster when you start to pull it apart. Also, not worth the pre-order I was level 20 before I got my mount and to that part of the game."

The breadth of the world beyond just Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, the varieties of main and side quests, the balance of mini games, and the character building of some side characters.

Lots of addictive fun and interesting lore-full activities to immerse players into the wizarding world that made up the Hogwarts stories. For all who have an interest in the fable, magic, animals, and more, Id say this game is worth playing. As I played, I enjoyed the characters in each encounter, The enemies had a bit of uniqueness that kept me on my toes, the animals in the game were fantastic as expected, and the world was expansive enough to give the feeling of full open world exploration despite the game play being a narrative. The potential for this game is in its dialogue options, Unique approach to specific targets when casting, resets on loot chests, expanse on world exploration, and class/task interactivity. (Replay-ability also)All in all, I am glad I didnt wait to play this game, and in spite of the above mentioned potentials, I enjoyed the game thoroughly. Im sure players with a general interest, will enjoy the game too."

Let's face it, it's good, very good even. The sensations of the game are good, the vibe is there, and the whole world is pretty and feel indeed ""magic"".Now, this is the skeleton of the game, and it could hold a great game, but let's face it, when we take a look at the meat, we clearly see that it's more fat than actual meat.The game resolves around ""collecting"" stuff. Let's face it, the story isn't that great and all missions together would make for quite a short game, so the game is more on the stuff to find, and this is where the issue lies. There are around 1500+ stuff to gather. Yep, you read it correctly, and it's not stuff that you collect by the dozen, it's stuff that you have to handpick one by one. They are divided in several categories (chest, pages, etc etc) but in the end it's always the same stuff, go somewhere, potentially use a spell, collect, rince & repeat. And where at the beginning it's nice, to gather stuff around, when you reach a certain milestone it's an horrible chore.And those collectibles unlock very underwhelming stuff. You have vanity stuff which is nice, and combat stuff. And there are small stuff that make the combat unenjoyable also, the system around spells is good but the UI is at times a bit clunky, which make the game really hard on hard, but a bit easy on normal, rendering useless the whole plants/potions/gear.I'm always a bit bewildered by the idea that asking gamers to do again and again the same stuff feels like a good gameplay mechanic.You add to that that the performance of the game is really subpar, and all in all the joy of the experience is really short lived, and although it is a good experience, it could have used some trimming to pack it up in a more rounded experience."

It is also lore friendly. It has a good longevity (I beat it 100% in ~100h on hard difficulty with all collectibles). However, the game is far from perfect and not exempt of issues.- Secondary quests that are not companions one or treasure maps are very forgettable fetch quests.- No quidditch mini game, it's a shame for a game set in the Harry Potter universe.- It is barely an RPG game, more like an open world action game, quests are very linear, with meaningless choices. Weak NPCs interactivities. Also, there is no morality system. This leads to poor replayability.- Itemization is among the worst I have seen in a game like this, just random gear with random stats, nothing exciting.- Some activities are too repetitive like Merlin's tasks.- Game is missing some QOL improvements, in exemples, transmogrification only applies to items and not gear slots, no separate keybinds for utility spells or mounts.- Performances are bad, with stuttering and frames dropping (Spec : AMD 2700X, 32 GB RAM, NVIDIA RTX 2070, Samsung M.2 860 EVO).- It is very easy, even in the hardest difficulty. Once you perfect the timing to dodge, you have won the game.- Some translation issues in the French version of the game, albeit very minor.All in all, it is still a good game, especially if you're fan of the license, and I had great times with it but it isn't stellar."

O mundo é gigante, e cheio de lugares a serem explorados. Mas ele custa 250 reais.250 reais em um jogo que em 40h foi possivel terminar todas as quests principais e secundarias, e boa parte dos eventos repetitivos e massantes que tem ao longo do mapa. Uma historia onde, apesar de você poder fazer escolhas menores ao longo do jogo, pouco elas afetarão o final dele, ja que tal final é simplesmente decidido pelo jogador entre duas escolhas, na ultima quest. Apesar da historia interessante (mesmo tendo seus problemas), tanto da principal, quanto das sidelines (Te amo Sebastian), não existe uma grande possibilidade de escolhas, e isso me deixa desconfortavel, ainda mais tendo o The Witcher 3 como base para um jogo mundo aberto com enredos lineares, mas bifurcaveis. A imersão é muito boa, e isso se faz pelos efeitos sonoros, graficos, e animações de alta qualidade. Dizem que é todo jogo que um fã de Harry Potter gostaria de ter jogado, e sinceramente, talvez seja verdade mesmo. Mas ele não vale 250 reais.Vale a pena jogar, mas se quiser jogar, a Empress ja crackeou. Não me arrependi de ter comprado por ser um grande fã da franquia. Mas comprar o jogo sem ser esse grande fã, vejo como um desperdicio de grana. Com um preço mais acessivel, recomendaria de cara com certeza, não somente para os fãs da franquia, mas para todos aqueles que gostam de jogos mundo aberto. Mas 250 reais é simplesmente salgado demais para o HL."

Even if you're not it's a solid game to play with tonnes to do, and a massive map to explore. Although admittedly, some collectable objectives are a little boring after a while, there is PLENTY of them though so feel free to sink into that if you're a completionist!Honestly though its got a really engaging combat system in my opinion, especially with the easy to master spell combos, which add to the satisfaction of depulsing someone off of a cliff for a fitting killing blow. As someone who normally button mashes on Mortal Kombat instead of learning combos, that's saying something. I've had a thoroughly great time with it, the Story was great, not perfect and felt kind of rushed at the end, however the characters are good and are very likeable from my point of view, even when they're stubborn and do stupid things. i wont name names. Performance is a bit of on issue on higher settings, with frame drops and stuttering, especially around and inside the castle, at least until you've fully loaded in the area, it gets better after a while but you still get them occasionally to a lesser extent. Still i managed to get solid highs of 110 fps exploring with lows of 70-80 during heavy combat scenes on medium settings 1080p with a OC Kaby lake i5 and 3060, the game still looks beautiful on low settings however! Still. It is a great game, well worth AAA price and it will give you many hours of fun if this kind of Singleplayer RPG is your thing... Especially if you love or even like Harry Potter!"

The wizarding world of Harry Potter has a very special place in my heart and this game did a great job with keeping the magic and wonder of the series, while also adding its own spin and lore on the tale so many of us grew up to love. the developers should be proud and i wait for more DLC very eagerly."

4569,Glitchbyte,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997529422/,1,,1,113.8,March,2,192,0,1,"I can barely stand writing this because I just want to get back in the game!I LOVE it.  Its a polished, creative, GAME.  Lots of stuff to do.  Main quests, side quests, pages to collect, 8 million Merlin Trials, treasure caves, potion brewing, plant growing, combat trials, etc etc etc....  and just the sheer fun of exploration!  The quests have nice little story lines and great voice acting. The controls are intuitive and make things fun instead of frustrating.  The combat is wonderfully fun....  Pulling enemies toward you and igniting them with flame.... Wonderful.  OH!  And I could beat wolves out of their fur for hours and not get tired of how their pelts howl when i loot their skins.      When you think it can't get better you learn flight, get mounts and get your own customizable room.  Now, you know I can't stand divisive narratives being pushed in games.....  This game gets the all clear from me.  There are a minority of NPC characters who are LGBTQ, in the 1800s no less, but it doesn't bother me because the story isn't about forcing someone's identity and sexual lifestyle down your throat and trying to destroy you if you misgender.  Their identity comes about naturally as you encounter them in the story, for example, when one refers to her wife, or where one has a deeper voice than you'd expect.   Its not announced in a pride rally with dongs being flung around children while demonizing Christians or white western men.  What a breath of fresh air to see my fellow human beings from different lifestyles being portrayed as just people instead of mentally fragile activists hellbent on sewing discord.  Thus, the story stays focused on the story, and in no way grooms or marginalizes one segment of the population!  Mostly, the game is GREAT at immersion.  Why has it taken THIS long to have a good game come out?  My character looks like the Invoker from DOTA2, I'm having a blast playing through Hogwarts as the one and only Kael'thas Sunstrider.  I've said enough, the game is great, not some cheap release like Cyberpunk full of bugs and woke story.   This game is pure, polished entertainment."

Starts off magically charming and seemingly challenging due to limit initial capability, intresting because there is loads to do and discover -be it in a somewhat predictable model for an open world game- to develop your wizardy skills, great environment due to the amazing world the game is set in, some time getting used to the best combat mechanics, ...but it's so amazingly stuck in its seemingly limited concept and developmentthere are an amzing 4 (?) different layouts for treasure caves with all of maximum 3 possibilities to open them - repeat 50+ timesEvery beast is captured in the same way, put in the same place and cared for in the same way, every spell is unlocked by doing challenges no sane school teacher would give you, every enemy camp is the same and nearly every ""boss battle"" is the sameThere are all of 6 possibly solutions to a Merlin trial - repeat 70 times-; where on the 50th time your character is still spitting the same line as on the 2nd; ""Could it be? :o A MERLIN TRIAL?! :O""Bringing me to the repeated dialogues -non stop- from start to finish, the character, the NPCs, the enemies, ...collect 40+ different broom handles you never see, 100+ decorations for a room you don't care much about apart from its functionality, but only 9 potions and 13 animals (really, what student can't do this in a year?), and 26 spells to learn sounds like a lot but it REALLY isn'tEvery wand is the same -just reskins-, every broom is the same -simply reskins-, every mount is the same -is it still okay to be a reskin?-Conversations with NPCs usually give an average of 2,3 options, the obvious decent one and the teenage rebellion/rude one, with the occasional extra, outcome never seems to matter whatsoeverKind of fitting with the ridiculously straight line in the game and the flaw in questline challenge""WE HAVE AN INEXPLICABLE THING FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS/MONTH/DAY IN THIS AREA WHERE EVERYONE IS A WIZARD"" / ""I AM WITCH FOR 30 YEARS BUT I CANT BEAT BAD SPIDER"" / ""I WORRY FOR PERSON BUT AM SISSY AND SO I SEND A RANDOM MINOR TO CHECK"" ...so now your 'special late freshman student specific tool' takes you straight to the thing we can't find and you have a chance to 'solve' it in 2 minutes - rinse and repeat 100 times for nearly every side quest and even some of the main questsI understand being a -fresh- student at a school brings it's limitations, but really?The guidance in the game is also to the point where they kind of WANT you to go for high completionREVELIO, walk walk walk, REVELIO, walk walk, REVELIO, walk, REVELIO, wa, REVELIO RELEVIO RELAOOIVA REVOOLVERIO - everything in the world is discoverable and predictable with just the R button. you can't miss a damn thing or fail solving or discovering anything without it.THIS SPECIFIC TOWN HAS 7 SECRETS IN IT, THAT BUILDING HAS 3 FOR YOU TO 'DISCOVER' AND THAT PLACE YOU FLEW OVER HAS A SECRET BANDIT CAMP/ ANIMAL NEST THAT NOBODY HAS FOUND IN A YEAR. ALSO HERE'S ANOTHER SKIN AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND MORE AND BLUE CAPE AND THE RED BAND IS NOW 1 CM TO THE LEFT AND MORE SKIN REWARDScontent for the sake of content, did you completely run out of things to reward a WIZARD with after 3 minutes of brainstorming?Also ♥♥♥♥♥♥, if you want to keep getting 'talent points' to at least change something about the gameplay or to make certain spells remotely, you HAVE to do all of these things over and over and over and overThe first 10 hours are logically somewhat of an introduction and gradual evolution, but the learning curve just stops and the game actually gets easier because you do more and more damage without the environment evolving or getting more challenging.I could keep going and going and goingand yeetingabout so many more things, but in short and good graphics aside, this game would have been amazing 10 years ago, great 5 years ago, but to me in todays age is simply below average for a 60 euro game -yet sweetly nostalgic due to its environment- at this point. I will finish it for that good reason alone, but it's way too straightlined, WAY too guided, and WAYWAY too repetitiveIf this is the challenge of becoming a student at hogwarts, it would be embarrassing to say it took you 6 years to complete or to even be a wizard. Do better."

If you wanted to choose to be evil, I wish that was an option instead of every dialogue choice having the same result. There is currently a bug for one of the minor side quests that is still not fixed ""Take the Biscuit"" and that is resulting in me not having 100% for the game yet.

4579,uwurawr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GribGfx/,1,,1,30.3,March,2,90,0,1,"While there is a lot of negatives to the game, I like it. The game is baby food but it's fun baby food.  Negatives:It has a lot of dumb collectibles and some are gated until later on in the story. Also a lot of repetitive puzzles. Countless amounts of them. UI is terrible. Animation for everything and when you press 'I' to skip the the menu book to head straight into your inventory I want to be able to press 'Esc' and not have to go through the stupid book. The map is also over done. Floo lady needs to shut it. The first 6 hours of the game feels like the worlds longest tutorial. There had to have been a better control scheme for spell casting on mouse and keyboard. I had to use nvidia vsync for a stable fps. RT is incredibly unoptimized, one moment I'll have 60 fps and in the next moment in the same room I'll have 20 fps. This tends to happen without RT but only infrequently. You also can't sleep or sit anywhere. The only way to pass time is to go into map and press 'F'. The gear slot limit is just annoying. You can increase it by doing puzzles scattered across the world. I'd rather if the limit just hadn't existed to begin with so I could sell my gear when I wanted to, not when I had to. Positives:The world is engaging. I feel like I am in the world. Even if I can't make the choices I'd want to make if it was a real RPG. Story is decently engaging. It's pretty. The seasons changing is cool. The Talents are actually useful and there isn't a silly amount of them. Room of Requirement is very cool. Defeating enemies for cosmetics and traits are nice bonuses. There's a lot of additional content to do and work on outside of the main story that isn't just puzzles and collectibles."

They will be able to experience everything they have always dreamed of. Beautiful to look at and with an atmosphere that only a few other games can achieve, you will always find yourself progressing through its systems and unlocking new things at a steady and well-crafted pace. But if you are looking for a complete package comprised of choices and freedom for the player, you won’t find it here. This is a wonderful adventure if you are willing to accept the limitations of the setting.Let’s get one thing out of the way first. If you are a fan of Harry Potter’s universe, buy this game now. You probably did already, and you are now having the time of your life playing it. Enjoy, it really is awesome. Good. Now, for the players that, like me, don’t know much about Wizarding World and its characters, and are wondering if this might be a good game, this review is for you.Hogwarts Legacy is a very good game, with sky-high production values, fun combat, and tons of secrets to discover and puzzles to solve. The game starts with one of the best, if not the best, opening in the history of videogames. It can create a sense of magic and awe that no other game can achieve. It will make you want to continue playing just to see if the magic stays with it or if it fades away. Personalizing your character, your outfit, your spell sets, even your wand, and your flying broom are all truly wonderful moments this game delivers; the atmosphere that the setting, the music, and the graphical art can create, make everything more astonishing than you could ever imagine. Add a combat system that it’s very fun to mess with, thanks to the different spells, and you will have an almost-complete package that could become a classic. Keep in mind that if you are looking for a true RPG, you won’t find it here. Your character will have no class, they are mostly a pre-determined hero with a pre-determined path. They will have no alignment, and this speaks volumes of the general tone of the game. Every dialogue is very polite and there are few choices within them. Sure, you can be a d**k with other people. Sometimes you will have the choice of a “bad” response during dialogues, but you will always sound like a very well-educated d**k.A beautiful-looking game that runs well on most computers. Shaders pre-compilation is present and the game didn’t suffer from any stuttering issues during my playthrough. Could have been better optimized though, the performance hit when enabling Ray Tracing doesn’t justify turning it on. It is mostly CPU-limited, so framerates will vary depending on your system. It has all the latest tech, DLSS, Ray Tracing, and Nvidia Reflex. All in all, it’s a great technical marvel.This game is catered towards a very specific type of player, you are controlling a character of young age during your adventures after all, and of young age is the main type of NPCs you will deal with. So, whilst the main quest is always fun and entertaining, side quests are pretty boring and do not have branching paths to them. Even the world outside Hogwarts, with its enemies and dungeons, never feels dangerous. And even though there are quite a few things to discover in the open world, few of them are engaging and appealing. Things are mostly locked by default too, waiting for you to reach a certain point in the main quest or that you have the necessary coins/resources to unlock them. Want a new flying broom when the game finally unlocks it for you? You have to pay for it. Want to explore a dungeon that you have just discovered? You have to unlock the quest connected to that dungeon. You need consumables to unlock puzzles in the open world, or coins to purchase that one missing ingredient to create the potion needed to complete a quest. You need coins to do almost everything. And if you stick to the main quest, you will not have much in your pockets; I reached a point playing the game where I decided to discover all the puzzles and secrets within Hogwarts’ premises because it seemed the most fun thing to do since I didn’t have enough coins to do anything else. The incredible, fantastic sense of magic experienced at the beginning of the game had faded away. I had grown tired of the long, overly-polite conversations with other NPCs and bored of completing meaningless side quests.This is not a game with mature themes, be warned. It’s a game that will entertain you with tons of things to unlock and discover about the world of Harry Potter. And everything connected with that saga, you will probably find it here. If that one is the experience you are looking for, you will adore this game. Just don’t come looking for something more.Dear reader, please be informed that this game is the subject of a lot of controversies, due to the fact that JK Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter franchise, is actively pushing, in her position as a wealthy and famous individual, for legislation that will hurt trans people. Please make some research and judge for yourself if you are willing to buy this product or not."

Even if you want to you couldn´t be the Bad person or reject Quests. The Game forces you at some Points to make some stupid Question puzzle from classmates. The Levellock for Quests or even to End the Game is stupid and artificifial playtimestretching. I needed 4 Hours of pointless Grinding to End the Year after beating the Final fight. I was annoyed as hell. -The Controlls are an absolute Overload, but okay´ish, but not realy intuitive-the Character seems to have just 4 to 5 Voicelines and repeating them every encounter->your Character as well and it can be annoying as hell too-Cutscenes arent skipable at some points what annoys me too-Levellock for Spells, Missions and Stuff...not nice...would like to play the Game in my Way, without being forced to reach a certain levelover all it was an OKAY-Experience, but i need to say that i almost deinstalled the Game before being able to End it, because of those Levelcaps...Hope many others could ejoy it more, but if you have no Problem with my Cons...Give it a tryAs a Potterhead i think it would be a great Experience!Edit: More Accio-Duells would be Great...those where fun, but way to less possibilities to play them"

The story is predictable, most character is very hard to get attached to, what the game has to offer, you've seen it thousands of times in this genre, nothing extraordinary, but it kinda works. The game sadly also have a lot of wasted potential from quidditch to school attendance, it really feels like you're just playing a rando wizard, who happens to be allowed set foot on schoolgrounds and nothing more, so there is definitely room for growth in the sequel.And I must take a note of the ABC+ stuff as well, because thats how it is nowadays. For all of those who worried, there isn't terribly much of that stuff in the game, but unfortunately all of it sticks out like a sore thumb. It is painfully obvious that all of that ♥♥♥♥ is in the game only because of the people who choosed to boycott the game.

4638,クリス,https://steamcommunity.com/id/chris23kevin/,1,,1,143.2,February,28,32,0,1,"When this game was officially announced I was very hyped about it. However I went through a roller coaster of emotions with it leading up to its release. When I found out this game was being developed by an app games studio I was a bit hesitant to pre-order but was willing to give it a chance anyway. Then Gotham Knights came out and it was an utter disappointment. Event though it was not made by the same studio it was still a WB game and it was the deciding factor on me not going through with the pre-order for this game.A week after its release I decided to give it a shot because I was hearing a lot of good reviews. I'm not one to spoil things for myself so I went in not knowing or expecting anything other than it was not a disappointment like Gotham Knights was. And to my surprise this game ended up being one of my favorite games to date. I have over 100 hours on it already on my second play through. I work from home and have a lot of free time while at work and this game has definitely made my days go by way quicker.I will start off by saying that this game is not perfect, it does have its issues just like any other game. BUT MAN IS IT FUN! If I had to compare it I would say this game is a mix of Jedi: Fallen Order mixed with Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Two of my all time favorite games. The combat is fresh and feels polished. The story is sort of a copy paste of other stuff we've already seen but I'll give it a pass. The side quests and the lore deep within the game is what matters here anyway.While playing this game you can really tell the developers are huge Harry Potter fans. From the lore to locations and everything else in between you are always grinning as you walk thru the halls of Hogwarts. That is if you're a Harry Potter fan. Overall I would rate this game a solid 9/10 taking one point away for the generic main story and minor quality of life issues. Extra tip: Go ahead and get sorted and build your wand on their website so you have a more personal experience in game. Enjoy!"
4639,Doragon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/doragonsg/,1,,1,86.6,February,28,61,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is a good game for anyone who enjoys exploration and combat in their RPGs. The other features (e.g., economics, herbology, potion brewing) are passable but a bit mediocre, but in no way detracts from the experience if you're primarily here as someone who either read or watched the Harry Potter series and want to immerse yourself in the universe. Turn off your brain and let your inner kid run wild, it's a great experience. If you're trying to 100% the game, there are many things that are hidden away; use a guide for it."

4658,xemsyt,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054426252/,1,,1,107.3,February,28,238,0,1,"TLDR: 8/10 - Great game but full of missed opportunities. A sequel could easily be a masterpiece if they build off of this.Highly unorganized review- In terms of feels -- a genuine trip back to Hogwarts for weirdo millennials like myself.- Hogwarts school simulator aspect was well worth it, very exciting finding secret rooms/ locations form the books/films. The fact that your choice of house has little impact on the game is pretty disappointing. Would have loved to see a 'house points' system that could lock/unlock certain areas and change the environment depending on who's winning at that particular moment. Would have really helped with replayability as well (as there's not much of that to be found here)- Combat gameplay is pretty good, far better than I was expecting. Overall pretty fun/complex enough- Story was fine, nothing amazing here but we didn't really need it to be amazing- Music, Wonderful. Very John Williams-esque while still sounding unique to itself.- Customization pretty good. The value of the ability to change appearance of gear without affecting stats should not be understated.- The largest negative for me -- npc student characters aren't nearly as memorable as they could have been, they almost exclusively interact with the player and no one else. The game sets you up to have 3 or 4 ""friends"" but it it feels too much like just a vehicle for side quests. It would have elevated the game to masterpiece levels if there was more character interaction/choice and consequence in this area. The ability to make friends or enemies of different students on different playthroughs would also have boosted replayability to ridiculous heights.-Broom/creature flying = fun. Lack of Quidditch = disappointing-Fantastic beasts system was fun, but a little much. It was at this point that I realized the game is getting stretched a little too thin.- Room of Requirement was good, but underutilized in terms of immersive options (see nitpick #2)- Puzzle system was a bit of a letdown. Merlin trials are all relatively easy and too numerous. This could have been a real Breath of the Wild type thing, but was instead very mediocre. The Depulso puzzle rooms were good, but there are only a couple of those. - Lacks a moral system but feels like it was intended to have one. There is no consequence for being 'evil' and the 'evil' dialogue options still feel like you're a relatively nice person. --- Allowing for more roleplayability in this area could have greatly benefited the game. You have very little choice in the type of character you play as. I would have liked to have had the option to ignore caring about pets for example. Obviously this type of system this would have taken a huge amnt of more work to implement, but that's kind of the point of this entire review. If this was a 'normal' game it would easily be a 10/10, but the expectations here, unfair or not, were much greater than that of a normal sized AAA game. It is for this reason that a sequel building off of this could easily be a masterpiece.Nitpicks1) Would have liked a buildup/cool-down for basic cast attack to make it a tad more challenging2) You can't sleep in beds, sit in chairs, etc. Pointless? yes. Immersive? (in an already well build immersive setting) yes. Little things like this go a long way imo.3) Can't fly a broom through/ take off from certain areas for seemingly no reason.4) Lockpick minigame is extremely simple (and also makes no sense, as you're casting a spell) removing it completely would be a +5) breaking in to steal money and clothes from everyone's houses was a weird way to build that system. Would have preferred a more immersive system in that regard.6) Witcher 1 cutscene style dialogue was annoying. Would have liked something more modern where time continues around you and the camera stays in your perspective.7) FOV too low for comfort. Also can't zoom the 3rd person camera back as much as I would have liked.8) Almost not a nitpick. Revelio pages could have probably been implemented a little better. (i.e. not having to cast revelio every 5 seconds) I get the scavenger hunt thing, but you just get fatigued after a while knowing that you're probably missing pages if you're not spamming it.9) Don't really care about bugs/glitches too much as none of them are game breaking and they'll probably be patched eventually. but some oversights (particularly character lines when you enter/exit Hogsmeade (acts like you're entering even when you are leaving) are quite annoying.The End. (I probably missed some things)"

4679,Kobie-XIV,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057345576/,1,,1,24.5,February,27,135,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy 9/10 SCORE FANTASTIC GAME.In almost every way, this is the Harry Potter RPG I’ve always wanted to play.Like many, I’ve been waiting for a truly excellent Harry Potter game since I was in the third grade. In that time, we’ve gotten some respectable LEGO Potter games, an underwhelming EA Sports Quidditch game for some reason, and even suffered through the fevered nightmare that is Harry Potter Kinect. But none of these has come close to fulfilling that fantasy of receiving a Hogwarts admission letter that opens the door to a secret world. With Hogwarts Legacy, I’m happy to say that we finally got a Harry Potter game that captures some of that magic. Its open world map absolutely nails the vibe of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it has spellcasting combat that’s stupefyingly good,The characters that inhabit it are charming and unforgettable, and it is positively brimming with countless diversions to soak up dozens of hours of your time. It may not be the most impressive technical achievement and it is certainly cursed with a lack of enemy variety, but none of Hogwarts Legacy’sissues can cast a Descendo charm on this triumphant visit to the Wizarding World.Right in line with most Harry Potter tales before it, Legacy’s plot has more holes than a fishnet stocking and sorta just expects you to accept that its magical world makes no sense. This mystical third-person action-adventure RPG begins with you transferring to Hogwarts as a fifth-year witch or wizard (for unexplained reasons) to do everything from attending classes to fighting giant spiders with a magical stick to flying around on a hippogriff. The fantastic character creator has plenty of options for you to craft your ideal witch or wizard (apart from a fairly limited voice selection), and as soon as you do they’ll immediately become entangled in a conflict between the Wizarding World and an evil goblin. On top of that, because being in a secret society of wizards is apparently not exciting enough, you soon discover that you’ve got some freaky super-charged magical abilities that allow you to do extra cool stuff that also isn’t really explained.If you’re like me, you wont roll your eyes during moments when you’re introduced to 100 years’ worth of dead characters lecturing you from paintings about the importance of some stuff that happened a long time ago and how you have to save the world or whatever.For you none lore hounds once that’s over with Legacy mostly redeems itself with a fantastic cast of non-painting characters that help boil things down into a not-too-convoluted good-guys-versus-bad-guys conflict that ends up being an enjoyable tale, even if it's not particularly profound or original.Most characters are memorable and instantly endearing.“The characters you’ll spend most of your time with are the classmates who will befriend you on campus, accompany you on certain quests, and help you hone your abilities as a magic user. Most are memorable and instantly endearing, like Sebastian the cocky and morally pliable Slytherin, or Natsai the clever and unflappable Gryffindor, and spending time with them and improving your social links through their relationship questlines made my stay at Hogwarts all the more enjoyable.Concerning J.K. RowlingThe elephant in the room with Hogwarts Legacy is Harry Potter’s creator, J.K. Rowling, whose comments about things I do not pretend to understand I reviewed the game as a fan of the series of films and books and a persons opinions have no bearing on me as a person or the studio who made the game who include people of all backgrounds.Expectedly, I even found myself looking forward to hanging out with my professors, whether it was my main man Professor Fig, who serves as both something of a mentor and as a sidekick, or the wise-cracking charms teacher Professor Ronen, who made me love him mostly by making fun of me. Each of these characters feels like an indispensable piece of the school, and you can find them wandering the halls doing their thing and choose to spend time with your favorites. It’s a huge and important part of the Hogwarts fantasy that Legacy just knocks out of the park.The world is packed with nearly everything I wanted in a Potter game BUT NO QUIDDITCH.“Even better, though, is the world itself, which is just packed with nearly everything I wanted in a Potter game and more. You’ll find yourself exploring Hogwarts’ stone-cobbled halls and secret passageways, flying around the Forbidden Forest on a broomstick, and exploring dark caves lit only by the glow of your Lumos spell. The developers at Avalanche have so brilliantly captured the look and feel of the Wizarding World that I was amazed at just being there, no matter what trivial errand they had me wrapped up in.That immersion can occasionally be broken by Legacy’s dicey performance, though, which suffered from just about every issue that makes the performance review team cry during my my buddies time playing on PlayStation 5. Those greatest hits include frame rates had inconsistency, weird issues where the lighting switches from too dark to too bright, aggressive pop-in while moving around the map quickly, and more. There’s even this weird thing where every door in Hogwarts has a brief loading screen.It’s understandable since there’s so much packed into this beast of an adventure, but the PS5’s promises of the death of loading screens haven’t quite been lived up to here as it’s clearly struggling to keep up with the spell craft and whimsy of the Wizarding World I would play one a system that can handle the game and for me that was PC but some are limited by the console of choice you play on and some pre-Patch issue are now fixed such as theBeyond the performance issues people have on console, Legacy is also a fairly good of an adventure in general. You’ll probably fall through the map a time or two, or see a character or object get caught in the environment but these days that is expected on console and I for one do not want to see the game on PS4 and XB1 as they are 10 year old consoles.I didn’t encounter anything game-breaking or so common that you’ll likely want to curse its name, but things like this do happen enough to be an irritation I played on PC on a 4090 i9 CPU and have no issues all settings on MAX.Combat is fantastic, challenging, and utterly captivating.“As someone who finds the wand-whipping combat in the movies fairly dull, I was very concerned about Hogwart Legacy’s ability to keep my attention after slinging spells for dozens of hours, but I can admit when I’m wrong – the combat is fantastic, challenging, and utterly captivating. There’s a lot more to it than shooting balls of light out of a stick! Instead, the trick is in dodging and countering enemy attacks while pulling off creative combos. For example, you can pull enemies towards you with Accio, light them on fire with the close-range Incendio, then blow them away with the explosive Bombarda spell. Chaining together abilities to make your opponents look like complete fools never stops being amusing, especially as you unlock talent tree perks that enhance your skills with modifiers that make your elemental spells fork to nearby enemies or transform into AoE attacks.VerdictIn nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG I’ve always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. It’s certainly weighed down by technical issues on console and a lack luster main story for people who ignore side quests and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldn’t come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me."

4685,aliragh1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198165485275/,1,,0,153.7,February,27,34,0,0,"Okay so first off i bought this game on recommendation.I was told it was so much fun and addictive, the open world is huge and beautiful and filled with all kinds of stuff to do.I was told it would be challenging and it would take a lot of time to finish the game.My biggest worry was that i would't find it challenging as i have had this problem with multiple games lately.So i bought it and started to play on the hardest difficulty i could choose from and was pleasantly surprised by the looks of the game which were as said absolutely beautiful.I enjoyed the first hour or 2 just roaming the castle and searching for hidden spots and secrets and possible minigames.As soon as i got outside of the first few hours having finished the castle and the Hogsmead quests i was now free to roam the world and my amazement turned to boredom sadly.The games combat is addictive for sure and fun at start, you get to equip 16 spells of your choise at anytime granted that you have unlocked and learned those spells first and you have unlocked additional spell bars of which you are given 1 at start and 3 more through playing the game.  Each bar has 4 slots you can equip spells onto and there are numerous combinations you can try on your foes that each in their own right have numerous different outcomes and cinamatics.But that combat gets very boring very fast, mainly because it's just not challenging at all.Every enemy you encounter is very predictable and you can pretty much see them preparing to attack you for 2 sec or so, so using the defend charm or just rolling out of danger makes you pretty much invulnerable( beat the first boss, some giant stone statue that was standing in the center of the room all the time stomping his foot predictably, already at lvl 27 found every possible type of enemy also the infamous types on the worldmap, beat everything with little to no  effort and am seemingly unable to die)btw i was already at almost lvl20 just by opening chests and finding hidden and floating pages, but whatever i guess that's just how they decided to make the game function.The open world is beautiful to a certain degree, some places are absolutely amazing to roam through like the castle itself and the forbidden forest, but aside of those few areas the rest is pretty generic, very bland and empty with just grass, hills, flowers and roaming wildlife and i don't know what big means to other ppl but imo the world is not big at all and it makes itself  look even smaller because of the flying mechanic(you can literally fly from 1 end of the map all the way to the other end in less than 5 min)The map is scattered with small caves and very easy ''i guess you could call them puzzles'' to solve with various type of rewards given, mostly tho about 90% of the rewards are shirts, shoes, hats or gloves that in my case are almost always worse that what im already wearing and nothing more than just meaningless fodder to sell.These caves are easy to find even without the use of a minimap, the puzzles to open them are ridiculously childish and the size of them is insanely small and in almost all of them you find a single chest with some random meaningless clothing.Of all the things i was told only 1 imo seemed to be true to a degree, which is that the game does have it's beauty.Other than that it's childishly easy in every way ( combat, enemies, puzzles, exploration, challenges)The world is small, lineair and filled with the same puzzles and caves and ruins everywhere so looking at it like that, there really is not much to do at all unless you consider doing the same thing in 100 different locations as being ''something else to do''During playtime i kept getting bored all the time which resulted in me just watching tv or doing something else while still running the game, that to me is a sign of a boring and unchallenging game that is unable to keep me focused on it.There is a lot in this game that is just meaningless fodder designed to just fill up the lack of depth and gaming imagination, things like all the different kind of wand handles, the pets you can save and the 1 million chests with 1 million shirts stuffed in them that all of these things actually add nothing to your character or your story.At a certain point this game just playes like a giant scavenger hunt and that in it's own right can get pretty addictive untill you realise that what you are scavenging is the same as what you already own.Sadly i paid for this game and am now obligated to finish it to at least get the most out of my money, but the hardest thing about this game is actually nothing in the game itself but rather to keep the urge to play.Can not recommend this to actual gamers and the funny thing is those that recommended the game to me are all now either done with it and moved on to different games or just dropped it because their vieuw of it being a great game has also changed and they are unable to force themselves to keep playing"

Players will be able to explore the Hogwarts castle and surrounding areas, interact with characters from the Wizarding World, and cast spells using an advanced magic system. The game promises to provide players with a deep and engaging experience that will allow them to create their own Hogwarts story.Another strength of the game is its attention to detail and authenticity. The game's developers have worked closely with Warner Bros. and J.K. Rowling to ensure that the game remains faithful to the world of Harry Potter while also introducing new elements and characters. The game's visuals and sound design are also top-notch, creating an immersive atmosphere that will transport players to the Wizarding World.However, as with any game, there may be some potential weaknesses that could impact the player experience. For example, the game may have a steep learning curve for players who are not familiar with role-playing games or complex magic systems. Additionally, the game's release date has been delayed several times, which may lead to frustration or disappointment for eager fans.Overall, ""Hogwarts Legacy"" has the potential to be a highly immersive and engaging video game that will appeal to both fans of the Harry Potter series and gamers in general. With its attention to detail, authentic world-building, and open-world gameplay, the game promises to deliver a unique and unforgettable experience for players."

The story isnt anything remarkable. It serves its purpose and thats pretty much it. I must admit however that the pacing is on point. Never did I feel like the game tried rushing anything or extending certain things. It all makes sense in the context of what the story is and thats a big bonus. I will also say that the ending to the game added a couple plus points for me. It had me care for what happened in a moment where I was approaching an apathetic state towards the story. Gameplay is good in some areas and bad in others. The spells are majestic and its amazing what they managed to do. On the other hand, fights are way to easy, especially bosses. They literally have 4-5 moves at most and dont do anything worth of note. I wouldnt mind this that much if most bosses werent Damage Sponges and it took ages to kill them and these fights turned into bore fests more often than not. I get that the combat is more rhythm oriented and its a ""puzzle"" as youre going to be forced to use different spell combinations to battle enemies but its still worth a mention as something that irked me.The world is beautiful, Hogwarts is as amazing as youve ever seen it. You can explore any part of it, sneak through every crevace fly over any tower etc. Its a Potterheads dream. Aside from Hogwarts I had a difficult time caring for any of the other environments but they were also serviceably done so there isnt much to say here. As an ending note I must say I didnt really understand all the praise for the open world of the game. Sure its beautiful but aside from that its kinda repetitive in what it can offer you. A gaggle of enemies here, a gaggle of a different species of enemies here, merlin trial, ancient magic spot repeat. There really isnt anything there to keep you at the edge of your seat while you explore the world it all just devolves into a collectathon wether that be merlin trials, astronomy tables or just enemy kills. Its all just collectibles from doing a certain task X amount of times."

It is by no means perfect - there are only a few potions you can brew and plants you can grow for such a vast context, your own backstory as the main character is nonexistent, you can be polite or rude to side characters but it has zero effect on the outcome of their quests or stories, enemies get a bit repetitive, gear is basically throwaway, 'unforgivable' curses can be thrown about with zero consequence.  All this being said, the game is incredibly fun to play and the 'semi' open world is rich with things to discover.  Combat is fun and fulfilling though power creep does come up later in game.  There are TONS of collectibles, many secrets, the world itself does feel alive and fun to explore.  Hogwarts alone can take hours and hours to explore and unravel its secrets.  Spells are utilized throughout the open world not just in combat but in puzzles and once you unlock them all you can use them in a variety of ways to get where you need to go.  The room of requirement is ridiculously customizable and you can spend hours there taking care of magical beasts (that you first go out and capture), brewing potions, growing plants, and just changing the decorations.  A solid addition to the wizarding world overall, 10/10 the game delivers."

It is a truew openworld and graceful  in its introductory to the world, and mechanics of travel. However there are alot of game elements that can't be interacted with,  that would make you feel more part of the world in other RPGs like being able to sit, that lets you feel and be part of the world. and interacting with other NPCs and have them react. Over all love it just not sure how much replay value as their isn't a morality system or large efects the player can have on the world and how it treats the player"
4729,Jäns,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tristler/,1,,1,81.1,February,27,332,0,1,If you liked any of the movies you gonna like this game. Really good open world game and great atmosphere. When the devs get rid of the technical Issues then I can easily recommend it. Only tip without spoilers is: play the story quests.. they unlock the whole game and i made the mistake to instantly get into the world and explored everything at the beginning and after playing the story quests i had to revisit the whole world again.

The Challenges you need to do during the game from 0 to 100% completion is very tedious and repetitive - it would be very hard to get to lvl 40 before you finish the main as the main driver of exp is challenges.  Having to redo your cosmetic gear when you're doing constant upgrades until endgame sucks. Some small bugs here and there (fell through a building once).

4747,NaClholic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NaClholic/,1,,1,41.3,February,27,98,0,1,"- By  was a pleasant surprise that had a lot more to it then I had originally thought I was going to get out of it. While the ""learning in class"" aspect that was sold as a concept by the game is there, it is lacking in the depth I would have liked to see from the game. While I understand having an entire class of learning about the lore of the world you inhabit would be  time consuming and boring, it would have been nice to have a short excerpt of something to sell the idea rather than just a cut-scene of happy go lucky kids learning. The story was engaging and you never stray too far from it at any point and the progression to go along with it fit the narrative well. While I wish there was more creative solutions to taking care of enemies rather than the simple loop of combat and avoiding them, the combat was actually a league far above what I thought was capable with a single-player action game based around magic. The movements and animations are well made and snappy as well as all the spells you learn having some use to initiate a combo on any foe you come across. This game is also perfect for those that love to be rewarded for taking their time to explore and be rewarded  with countless puzzles, prizes, and unique interactions all across the castle and landscape, not letting more than a few yards feel like unused space and taking full advantage of the resources and world that has been built by the giants before them. All in all a whopping 8.5/10 and good buy on or off sale for a relaxing third-person experience you can come home from work to."

This is the first AAA game I've played since probably RDR2 that seems like it was released as a finished product. Bugs were few, benchmarking happened when I booted it up and it runs great on the PC, and it just had a noticeable lack of jank that I found refreshing. On top of that, the game is actually good. I do believe a lot of the choices that are made are kind of there as an illusion, but the interactions and the story so far are good enough when they play out that I don't really mind. The castle is huge, the surrounding areas are beautiful, and the little montages of the students attending classes really made it feel like the first times I watched the movies. Really captured the vibe of attending Hogwarts. Music is good, it's immersive, and the combat is flashy while also being difficult enough that learning enemy weaknesses and spell combos are worth it. Skill trees could be a bit more fleshed out, but are far from bad how they currently stand. Haven't even done the Room of Requirement stuff really yet, and haven't been catching animals, so still some aspects of the game that will be completely new. Loving it so far, 8.5/10."
4749,Clarissa,https://steamcommunity.com/id/citeen/,1,,1,44.8,February,27,54,0,1,"A review from a person who has finished the whole game!Pros:- Really nice storyline that is well written and comes full circle at the end. The companion sidequests also add a lot to the overall story as well.- Really detailed and immersive world. Exploring every nook and cranny of the castle itself and surrounding areas is very satisfying. I love the seasonal changes as well and it makes me want to explore certain areas again to see what they look like with these changes.- Combat is satisfying and challenging.- The puzzles are complex, varied, and really fun. I love the gameplay of figuring out what spells you should use in order to solve themCons:- Would benefit from a morality system, it really breaks immersion with no consequences of using the Unforgiveables. It would've been really cool to make them OP but have them damage your relationships- Flying controls are very janky on PC and non-intuitive. You can make it slightly better by changing keybinds, but would've been a lot better if they had it in-built with mouse control.---Overall a really great game with a really great story that I would recommend. I think some of the negative reviews come from huge HP fans who had really high hopes, which is understandable. It's not revolutionary or anything like that, it's just really good for what it is - a fun, action combat RPG"

Your character talks not always as you would wished he/she might have talked. So there are some restrictions to make. The exploration is fun. To fly with your broom over everything and discover new areas...it's fun. Unfortunatly the emersion isn't the best. To much loading screens. And the quests are finished too abruptly. I could oversee this little flaws. And it is criticism on high level. So all in all, I can recomend it. But it isn't a 10 out of 10. More a 8 out of 10."

The game seems to offer a story with an interesting plot, an immersive open world with lots of activities, enough exploration and surprises to have fun with, as well as a combat system that can be very intense. What I like the most is the flow of the game though as most of the said activities can be found in modern MMO titles but the way the game utilizes and combines them with the main story does not bore me at all!!With the aforementioned highlights considered, If you are a Harry Potter fan, plain and simple, just buy it."

The amount of minute details from the books (and films) they were able to cram into this game is truly a joy to behold. During development, this game received a lot of criticism for pushing back the release date. After exploring the world they have created, especially Hogwarts Castle itself, this game feels like it benefited from those push backs. As I found more and more of the small details and little embellishments hidden throughout, I got the feeling that as they worked through what they were behind on, they simultaneously elaborated on the world, and went above and FAR beyond.

4765,illi,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067366719/,1,,1,58.5,February,26,385,0,1,"A fairly solid game that gets infinitely better if you are a Harry Potter fan, because the best thing about it is being in the wizarding world and Hogwarts. If you are not a fan, I imagine it might be hit or miss. The open world is quite vast and not limited to Hogwarts and close areas - I was honestly quite shocked when I saw the size of the map. You get your broom to fly around fairly early so I imagine it had to be huge to make it feel big enough for it. It is full of points of interest that give you stuff to do there, most of it however I felt was uninspired and mostly the typical open world ""map puke"" padding. I understand they needed wider world to make some quests and not making all center just around Hogwarts, but on the other hand I'd bu quite OK to just have Hogwarts, Hogsmead, Forbidden Forest and surrounding areas accessible and still think of it as big enough.Main story is.... okay. For me the side quests were the stars, especially those centered around my classmates and which I'd call ""main side quests"". There are your filler side quests there too, but the questlines where you develop friendships with other Hogwarts students, alongside the ""quests"" that simulate classes to learn new spells are very well done and simulate the Hogwarts feeling perfectly.Talking of spells: there. Is. So. Many! And it's great balance too - some from books, some from movies and there is even Flipendo for those who remember the now ancient Harry Potter movie tie-in games. While it gets difficult to juggle all of them as time wents on and your arsenal broadens, the combat is overall really good and each enemy has specific combo you should use on them to exploit their weaknesses. Combat was one of the great surprises for me as I never really imagined it being so good.All in all, this is a good pick for anyone that loves open world games RPGs (though theRPG elements are on light side) and don't mind the now typical open world design of ""lets puke points of interest with almost coppied challenges all over the place"". But it's an absolute must for any Potterhead out there purely for the cheer joy of wandering Hogwarts."

Hogwarts environment is really well done, but I don't want to play a game just for its eye candy. Other than the way Hogwarts looks the game is thoroughly non-engaging. The story is bland and not immersive, the side quests are as well. Too many repeating side activities. Like the Merlin puzzles, which become more of a chore than a challenge. There are no consequences to anything you do as a player, which kills all replay-ability. The ""choices"" are not true choices as they change nothing. The gear system is abysmal and pointless.Some final words on the main story: Honestly, if the focus of the game was attending classes (where my performance in that class actually mattered) and exploring/doing quests in my spare time this game would be 10x more interesting. Especially because the combat system is quite good. But as it is, once you reach mid-game you are basically a teenage wizard demi-god dispatching whole groups of dark wizards and goblins like its nothing (played on hard btw). And then the story just peters out. My character trained less than Rey and somehow feels stronger than she was....Environment and aesthetic: 10/10Actual gameplay: 4/10"

Like multiple times the character tells you - go talk to him if so and so and you just simply can't. as well as over students deserved more screen time?

Glad I played it but will not be completing to 100% there just isn't enough variance to it to keep you interested, I mean come on throughout the entire game there's approx 6 enemy types that's it, goblins, darkwizards, spiders, trolls, inferi and dugbogs and once you learn the mechanics of each of them they become very very easy to defeat, troll especially take a bit of time to defeat just due to their huge health but mechanically very simple to do. Overall it was just a bit meh by the end. ps. dialogue also becomes very tired after a while and you will find yourself skipping through a lot of the drivvle dialogue you're constantly forced to sit through."
4783,kenbcn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tseus/,1,,1,121.2,February,26,165,0,1,"Amazing! A lot of fun. Every aspect of the game has been put through a lot of thought and effort.  Everything you do feels rewarding and satisfying. It's relaxing but at the same time there is a lot to do and plenty of features. So far the story is wonderful, the characters are great. The animation and voice are fantastic, the writing incredible, the combat is so much fun! When I see that my progress (my percentage of completion) goes up I feel sad because I don't want the game to end. Don't download this game if it ever gets cracked, this guys they really deserve to get paid for this wonderful job. I don't think it matters if you are a HP fan or not, this game will please anyone who loves magic, fantasy, adventure, quests, crafting, levelling/skills, loot, good story, writing, animation, writing, amazing graphics, very good controls and more. It's also very intuitive. At the beginning you might feel like ""wow, there is a lot of stuff going on!"", but you quickly learn everything. In short, worth every penny, amazing game, go get it!.(A couple hours later in the game)I just keep getting amazed by the amount of detail in this game! Every object, every action, environment, conversation, character... I can't believe how well done this is. I am totally submerged in this world. I NEVER leave reviews, I don't know if I am just lazy or what, but this time, I just can't help but to share how it feels to play this game. This totally needs to go on my top 3 games of all time, I just don't know which one to remove...DA3, The Witcher 3 or Skyrim...(Quite a few more hours later...)OK., I did find something that drives me insane and don't like. First, beware that I am not a pro, so maybe this is part of the problem. So...FLYING with a broom: the WORST controls ever. I find it so difficult to move around and the controls aren't right. Instead of using a right click to point and move towards a direction, you have to use half your keyboard to make a turn. It's frustrating. Still love the game though."

4797,Californ1a,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Californ1a/,1,,1,101.5,February,26,"3,014",0,1,"Solid game, very much worth playing, though the gameplay was not quite as in-depth as it could have been. The story and quests felt like they took a backseat to exploration and combat. If you're into exploring, then it's great, and the castle is like a huge maze to try to learn the layout. However, outside the castle, there's a lot of running around the map doing various tasks that aren't part of any quest and end up just feeling like busy work to complete the field guild (and even quite a lot of tasks that aren't tracked in the field guide but are needed for achievements anyway).The combat is probably the best part, learning which spells to use and figuring out what combos work well together is a lot of fun. Main issue with the combat is with the keyboard controls - the game limits you to having only 4 spells active at a time, and unlocking separate bars for different spells rather than allowing you to bind each spell to a key individually, so you'll be swapping between bars pretty often or will want to set up a macro to swap bar, fire a different spell, then swap back on a single key. It's also very easy to find overpowered combos that can potentially make the game feel too easy, but it's a singleplayer game so if you want to go all-out, then it does have that ability.On quests, the main story is very short; if you ignore sidequests and don't explore the castle much then you'll finish very quickly. Even if you include sidequests, it is very lacking in the number of quests compared to other open-world rpgs. There's less than 100 total quests, including both main and side. Compare that with something like Skyrim, where even just the unmarked/miscellaneous quests far outnumber HL's total. Counting only the marked quests in Skyrim is around 250-350, depending which DLCs are included or not. There's a couple of small ""unmarked quests"" in HL, but most of them are just giving an npc a potion.One of my main complaints is that the world doesn't feel as lively or immersive as it could have been. There are random npc events where npcs will talk to each other and such, but they're very static - the same random events will always happen in the same locations and none of the npcs really move around very much aside from a few that can spawn on roads between hamlets, or combat enemies. You can't even see any students sleeping in the dorms at night, all the beds are empty and the school grounds are also just empty at night, as if the students just disappear. All the shopkeepers are stood static as well, they never close their shop at night or go to sleep, they don't even walk around inside the shop. Most the npc events around the castle are pretty good, you'll stand there and listen to them chat early on, but after a few hours you'll have seen most if not all of the random npc events already so they get stale quick because they never really move around to do events in different areas.My second main complaint is with the entire southern half of the map, it just feels entirely underutilized. There's only a small amount of main quests that go down to the south, but it feels like they could have had their quest areas moved somewhere up north. Same with the couple sidequests that are in the southern half, they feel like they could have easily been placed somewhere up north. Then, without the few quests down there, the southern half primarily just feels like a way to pad out more ""busy work"" field guide tasks. It feels like the southern half really needed some large unique landmark area in it, similar to hogwarts or hogsmeade, but instead it just feels like an area used to dump extra bandit camps and merlin trials.Also on the immersion front, and tying into the combat, there aren't a lot of different enemy types, especially bosses with unique attacks. The vast majority of enemies are spiders, goblins, or human, with a few trolls. It doesn't take very long to learn all their attack patterns and how to best deal with each of them. By the time you get to the part of the story that goes to the southern half of the map, you've probably already fought nearly every enemy type. The southern half of the map could have expanded the enemy roster to include more unique types and different attack patterns.There are changing seasons, but only during the main story. Once you finish the main story, you're stuck in 1 season. You never get to see the Halloween or Christmas decorations, or any of the snowy landscapes, ever again, without starting a new save.I really like the cosmetic system where every piece of gear you obtain, even after you sell or destroy it, can be used as a cosmetic override for the gear you're actually wearing. This really helps discourage hoarding gear, though I did have a few instances during a couple dungeons where my gear slots still filled up and I had to destroy some gear so I could keep collecting chests before the end of the dungeon. There's also a small annoyance with cosmetics that'll probably get ironed out at some point, but whenever you equip new gear, you have to go back in and set the cosmetic override again; it doesn't just globally apply the cosmetic on top of all gear, it's individual.Overall, there's a lot to explore, especially around the castle. If you're into the lore, there's a lot to read about all the various setpieces throughout the castle. It's a lot of fun to fly around on a broom, land in a bandit camp, and do some spell combos. If you just do the main story, sidequests, and some of the field guide, it's definitely a good game, but it does get really tedious when completing the field guide and achievements; there's a lot of extra stuff that just felt like padding for what should have been more quests or other content. I enjoyed it, though it definitely devolved into a collect-a-thon near the end."
4798,Cleptomania,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cleptomania_v1/,2,,0,56.2,February,26,16,0,1,"This game is not really good. There are tremendous technical issues, causing random lag that makes the game almost unplayable at times on my system(Running an Intel I7-9th gen, an RTX 3080, an SSD and 16gb Ram). Besides that, the story is rather mediocre at best, especially considering that there are no consequences. Only two or three choices change some outcomes, and most of these are very minor at best, giving the game very little replay value. The mechanics are very well done, but the game just lacks too much of the wizarding world. The Open World, after you have completed the story, is relatively emtpy and boring, which I find really sad, considering what could have been done with it.That being said, Potterheads will still love it. And if you are a big fan of the world, like me, this game might be for you. BUT: Don't expect too much. And be prepared to make some compromises.All of this is of course excluding the numerous controversies sorrounding the game and people behind it, though I don't believe this is the right place for anyone to get into those."

4816,ParticuLarry,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997391231/,1,,0,46.0,February,26,186,0,1,"First I had huge troubles with the game. Constant laggs, clipping through the game world when the assets wouldn't load. Traversing Hogwarts and Hogsmead was the worst. I fixed it by upgrading my RAM to 64 GB since no other fix fixed anything. Neat.It finally didn't lagg anymore. So I was finally able to play the game as it was intended. No hard feelings, let's just go into it unbiased.What awaited me were boring ""riddles"" and dumb fetch quests for the biggest part of the game. Especially annoying were the Demiguise which you could only try to find at night. I had to use a guide for that, because gathering them upgrades your alohomora. If you don't want to waste your time backtracking all the time, of course you NEED to have it on max. So finding enough demiguise was actually extremely important, and speedrunning through hogwarts and hogsmead to get enough of them was extremely stressful. This was the most annoying part of the game imho.The ancient magic quests were also boring since you can just broom broom and do it easily.The astronomy challenges were - again - locked behind the day/night cycle, so there's no way I'm doing that again. The demiguise stressed me out enough already.The itemization is extremely dumb. Exploring doesn't make sense since you'll just find green garbage that clutters your inventory quickly even if you finished enough Merlin trials to have a decently sized inventory. That also means you have to sell your stuff all the time, especially so before you start quest lines. Again, this is boring, since at some point you have far too much money anyway.You also can't just configure a look and keep it all the time. No, whenever you get an upgraded item you need to change it if you want to keep the look you decided on. If you don't do that you'll walk around like a clown all the time, which breaks the immersion easily. And since changing it in early game with every upgrade was so annoying, at some point you stop caring and just accept that you're a clown. Another system the fun was sucked out of because you had to engage with it all the time. Now to the good parts.The story is really good. The supporting cast is likable and unique enough. The quests of Sebastian, Poppy and Natty fit well to the overall story with each having their own arch enemy. It's all tied together neatly, and this part is actually worth praising.The game's strength regarding gameplay were definitely the caves. The parts where you couldn't just fly past all enemies and actually had a good experience of exploration. There were also a few parts I didn't like, but for 99% of the time, I greatly enjoyed the big caves. Too bad there aren't more in the game.I also enjoyed the music, especially when riding a beast. Final thoughts:I think I would've enjoyed the game more if you couldn't just take your broom right from the start and bypass any content, any scenery, any fight just like that. It allows you to just skip most of the content without having to walk ever again. The exploration part falls really flat, since the highlights are marked on the map and these ""highlights"" not actually being highlights. They're mostly boring filler content.And this is probably my biggest gripe for the game: You have so many things to fetch. Be it pages, demiguise, merlin trials, astronomy alters, beasts for materials... It's just the same over and over again. And the worst part is that collecting all this stuff is extremely important for you to gain levels, so you can equip better stuff and become stronger. This notion of: ""you HAVE to go and collect everything"" is just not fun for me. It comes down mostly to grinding, but not in the fun part, since it's all the same over and over again, as I stated earlier.Same goes for the enemies btw. You have like 4 different enemy types and that's what you'll have to fight against for 90% of the game. There are minor variations with shields in different colors, and some enemies being too big to be lifted, but for the most part it looks and feels all the same.Additional info: I played through the game on hard mode and I was bored most of the time. At some point I just wanted to finish the story at least. Sebastians story was what kept me going. Was it worth it? Yeah. But I could've just watched the cutscenes on youtube. No need to actually spend 60 bucks on that."

Set 100s of years in the past, the majority of book cannon doesn't exist.  This gives fans of the world a fresh experience of the universe and I am excited to play it over at least 2 more times and I haven't even finished my first play through.  I would recommend this game to everyone regardless who they are.  Hogwarts is just good clean fun.  The game allows you to play in a whole host of different ways, which is why I stated earlier I plan to complete it 2 more times, at least.  If you are on the fence, get off it and get the game.  If you like fantasy, if you like spying, stealth, steamrolling, crafting systems, farming, exploring, 100% completing, racing, speed running, puzzles, and more this game has it all and you can definitely find an area that keeps you playing and lose track of time.

4836,Katzro,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BatKatz/,1,1,1,54.3,February,25,"1,904",0,1,"So, to start, let me establish that I am not much of a Harry Potter fan. I only ever saw the first movie after the franchise initially ""got big"", and never had much interest in anything else, aside from one of the games, I think one based on the first movie, but it was more of a puzzle platformer type deal than anything else.That being said - this game is AWESOME.I'm not a professional reviewer so I'm not going to pretend I know about technicalities...The game looks gorgeous, and the soundtrack does what it's supposed to do, supporting appropriate moods at the appropriate times. The world building itself is amazing; it's rare that a game can just almost instantly grab me, but Hogwarts Legacy did.The combat system is relatively simplistic, but it still manages to be fun. I can see side-quests and puzzles and the like maybe getting a little bit repetitive, but that tends to happen with every game if you play enough of it, as for the main story - it manages to keep me engaged, and I'm only speaking for myself here so....yeah - story's good too.There are, however, two things that I am rather disappointed about:1. There is no Quidditch. I'm sure I don't need to elaborate on why there should be! Perhaps in a piece of DLC, or even better, a sequel.2. After unlocking more spell slots in your talents, the game does a bit of a poor job actually communicating to the player that those slots can be used; maybe I'm a little slow, but in my opinion having the ""Forbidden"" sign mark the slots first and foremost conveys the message: ""This is not usable!"" and not the message: ""Please slot your spell here!"" Since I've talked about the 2 things that I most disliked, I think I should mention the two things I like the most:1. The transmog (gear appearance change) system is very simple and efficient, and I think pretty much all RPGs should try to use a version of it going forward.2. Hogwarts castle itself is absolutely beautiful. Everything from the scale, to the design, to the ambiance works perfectly to create a location where you just...want to be, really, for as long as possible.Lastly, there's talk of a multitude of issues with the PC version. Since buying the game, the only real problem I've been having is some stuttering, usually when initially loading into the game, and I've had one crash to desktop, after trying to reload the same checkpoint a number of times in quick succession...I THINK getting a bit more ram would solve the stuttering issue for me. As for bugs...a couple times when loading into another location (like an underwater cave, for example) I had issues with the camera, as it would get stuck at a certain angle, and not move no matter what, making it impossible for me to actually see my character anymore - weird...but reloading the game fixed it.Aside from that, I've had no issues running the game on the best detail level.All in all, this game is a great game. Whether you want to wait for a sale or not is up to you, but I do not regret paying full price for it.I'll see you in class...Also, Ravenclaws rule! Change my mind."
4837,pavel1269,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pavel1269/,1,,1,78.9,February,25,"1,268",0,1,"Pretty good game.Not a fan of HP? Easy 7/10 as a solid game with 40-ish hours of content to do most of the stuff.Fan of HP? Combat from previews looked boring but i could not be more wrong. It is the best combat system i ever played. Not too punishing and hard and not left button spam either just feels like a perfect balance. To add a nice touch, over the course off a game you unlock bunch of spells and some spells are just better against some enemies.World is very good. Hogwarts and surrounding are amazing. The farthest locations not so much but fine. You can upgrade and enchant your gear. Materials for it are plenty available so no need to hoard and never use it. Upgrade whatever as its super easy to get more materials again. There is an alchemy with few potions with plenty of materials easily available. Most game systems feel very polished and well integrated.Generally as you loot better gear you want to wear the best currently available item which will make you look like a creepy person worshiping lizard people. After i received a comment that i should not look like Indiana Jones but a student, turns out there is perfect transmog system to eliminate this entirely. You choose what you want to look like and even hide equipped item altogether. You will be able to choose a lot of any item you had or unlocked.Story is ok. What about decisions? You are The hero, deal with it. Did not bother me just bear that in mind.edit: Fixed by latest patch.Few quality of life changes i'd live to see are:- Transmog should retain after gear change.- After a few Merlin trials the animation is really tiresome.- Alahomora for 50th time is really boring. Fast unlock after 10th time of respective level?Oh and the professor you work most with is straight out Regis from Witcher 3, wizard, sure not a vampire, change my mind."

The combat is like dancing, and very in depth and detailed. The castle is everything you will have wanted it to be, and your story... while feeling semi guilded at this time,  ;eaves room for you to be who you want to be. My mindset has been a lesson from Albus Dumbledoor in the books. (keep your friends close, and grow with them, they will be all your got.) the game give your the option to keep secretes or who to entrust with them, keep your allies close. YOU CAN PET THE CATSso far maybe 2% thru the store based on my field guild. So i also would say I think its worth the cost. 11 hours in and its barely opening up so far."
4840,Inquietus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Inquietus/,1,,0,135.1,February,25,268,0,1,"I don't usually review games so keep this in mind. I love the game i think its amazing in every way except 1 massive flaw. The game is unplayable unless you are either super lucky or have a really powerful pc. That flaw is Denuvo, and it literally kills fps on most computers. Massive fps loses by 20fps with it tanking at random down to 10fps on a laptop with a 2080super 16gigs ram ddr4 3200ghz with a i7cpu at 1080p and on my desktop with  EVGA FTW3 3090TI, intel core 13k cpu, 32gb ddr5 6200ghz ram, on a SSD at 1080p i go from 190fps down to 120fps at random with harder spikes sometimes bringing me down as low as 30fps. Thats not including loading inbetween moving through areas. Meanwhile ps5 can run the game in graphics mode at perfect 60fps and they do not use denuvo. So Unless they remove denuvo i cant honeslty say but this game. That being said gameplay wise this game is on point with lore, with content, with combat, with customization. its what ive always wanted as a fan of this world.There are a few things that need improvements like loot, and a few other small things. The game does baby you alot but after a while it becomes unnoticeable. The map size and content is massive. There is so much to see and do. The combat is simple but fun and a challenge in hard mode. the story is amazing so far and the side quests are all fun and unique. There are no weapon mods or types only gear changes. There is a upgrade system but it seems a little too sub par. The fashion system is pretty massive but it could do with more styles. I really wish you could wear a cape and robe. Over all the gameplay is a solid 10/10 from me because after all those little issues its so easy to get lost in the game. Before you know it youve spent 4 hours and you still are not even close to being done. I love the game. But again until denuvo gets removed the game has a 50/50 chance of not being able to run on your pc. Denuvo might also be causing a massive memory leak. Additionally you cant play offline because of Denuvo dont even try youll lose your progress trust me ive been there and it screwed me. Also could do with a hell of alot more gear slots or less gear but more vendors, or an ability to break down gear to use for the gear you want to level. But again just the little things. Buy at your own risk."

The controls are intuitive and easy to learn, allowing players to explore the vast and detailed world with ease. The combat system is also satisfying, with a range of spells and abilities that make each encounter feel unique and exciting.The graphics in Hogwarts Legacy are decent, with intricate details that bring the world of Harry Potter to life.

It is a standard action-adventure game, very reminiscent of the gameplay loop and B-card story of games like Infamous... this would be a solid 8/10 in the Xbox 360 and PS3 eras, but it feels very archaic now. I imagine most players of the game were about 10 years old when those games came out, so that also adds to the overhype, through nostalgia, when they see a new game that has the same old features and flaws from that generation.At times, the story feels like you're living out your own Harry Potter adventure. But the writing is so straightfoward, much of the time, that it feels more like it was written by George Lucas than J.K. Rowling. Superfans of the Star Wars Prequel trilogy will feel right at home with the game's story of mild angst and blatantly obvious controversy, as well as eye-roll-inducing allusions to real world issues. Characters are sometimes well written, but suddenly they'll go flat and their motivation becomes ""I must defeat X by myself, but everyone treats me like I'm fifteen!"" This happens with multiple characters. Additionally, the one shifts heavily from being very childish and not taking things far enough, to becoming almost overly dark; basically, it's tone deaf. The gameplay is mostly dull from beginning to end. The spells don't feel particularly impactful, and the forbidden ones don't illicit the dread or brutality they're described as in the books. The fighting is a ranged variation of the other Warner Brothers games, such as Batman Arkham and Shadows of Mordor, except it's even simpler than the rock paper scissors gameplay in those. It's easy to the point that two or tree usable items will get you through most fights on the hardest difficulty. There are some fights that overcome the game's inherent simplicity by simply adding a lot more enemies, which is still easily thwarted by drinking a damage immunity potion and dropping a couple cabbages on the ground. Even if you don't use items, the gameplay loop is just cycling skills while parry or dodging every second. The place HL shines, oddly enough, is a decorating minigame that's very intuitive to use. I don't usually care to decorate in any video game, but it feels so nice in this one that I can't help but do it for up to thirty minutes at a time.The setting is the game's best feature. It lacks the granduer of any of the areas described in the books or seen in the movies, though. The dining hall looks tiny, as well as many other areas that I won't say which return from the series. Most of the detail seems to have gone into the more distant hallways of the school and the Slytherin areas. For as many assets are in the game, and there are quite a few, many are copy-pasted next to each other, completely breaking immersion. Even in areas which are particular references to the books/movies or which are supposed to be specific in-game character spaces, repeating assets are present, insuring that few of the spaces feel like real places. It feels more like the developers made themselves a little ""we tried"" cake and clumsily placed it in nearly every room.Someone in lead development for HL got it into their head that kids just really like caves. As such, the game is a long series of cave delving corridors between a few missions that take place in the castle or villages, and, rarely, the forest (unless it's a forest cave!). You fight your way through a half-dozen spiders per room, twist down some backrooms-like empty corridors with nothing in it but a new hat and a ""puzzle"" that consists of pushing one button. Still, some of this cave delving feels like you're doing something dangerous and forbidden, but only toward the beginning of this fairly long game. Laughably, characters will sometimes enter a slightly larger area of the game and then ""ooh"" and ""aah"" about how beautiful the cave is, despite the room having few discernibly different features from the rest of the cave.The open world is particularly atrocious. Most of the ""puzzles"" here consist of walking/flying into things, delving more virtually identical caves (some of which are totally empty besides a box with an item), picking up and moving an object, or left-clicking up to nine objects with your wand. If you're bent on completing this open world's objectives, likely so that you can unlock more carry space for selling the tons of useless clothes the caves give you, you're going to sit through about 64 animations of a leafy gazebo spawning... someone in development thought that was a necessary thing to make you watch. Puzzles outside the open world, primarily in the castle, are easy. Like all these Warner Brothers games, there's a detective mode that essentially solves all the puzzles for you. It's not an optional cheaty feature either, you have to use this mode to solve puzzles, or you're going to be wondering around for ages looking for a motionless gray moth on a gray wall. There's a ""code cracking"" puzzle that has a single digit cipher, so that once you figure it out, you're going to be running around the castle doing basic addition about 20 times; how exciting.There's a lot of bugs. Performance is hit or miss; one day it'll be fine, the next it'll be all frame tanks. Lots of quest, objective, item, and mission breaking bugs that will see you restarting missions or waiting in hopes that an objective will fix itself. I ran into a game breaking bug within the first 12 minutes of the game; although, not any since. But I have had frequent issues where an objective wouldn't update or an item would disappear. There's also a lot of physics hijinx if you bother to hang around populated areas, like a kid suddenly deciding to levitate into a bicycle pose and then no-clips through three houses. Or you'll look behind you and there's potion ingredients you picked off the ground a while ago following you.In general, Hogwarts Legacy is pretty mid-tier title compared to games of the past, but in an economy where the singleplayer game is nearly dead, it might as well be a 10/10. Yet, I think the medium of games deserves better than this paint by numbers style of development. The medium of stories about witches and wizards also has a lot better representation already available than this title.  It lacks gameplay and feature diversity quite a bit. But it's impossible not to recommend, because it's one of the only triple-A video games released in the last four years."
4895,GoncaloNL,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198272643142/,1,,1,60.0,February,25,73,0,1,"Starting with the best that the game has to offer, Hogwarts castle, it is extremely well done and detailed, one of the best structures I have ever experienced in a game, it is large and complex, with a lot of density and verticality, exploring it is something quite “delicious”, has a lot of variety in artistic terms and still comes with a relative amount of puzzles, iconic items from that universe and several surprises in general. In addition to the castle, the game has another central point beside from the world itself, which is Hogsmeade, it is also very well characterized and presented, despite not being large or complex, it is a region with several easter eggs and points of interest equally iconic.Continuing on the exploration and moving on to the entire region beyond the castle and Hogsmeade, it all conforms to the art direction established by these two points of interest. The map is big enough and with a lot of things to do, it has merlin trials, enemy camps, caves, small villages with secondary quests and so on... still, even with a reasonable variation of things to do (with each one of those things to have its own variety), after completing 30%-40% of this world and having already experienced almost all of these activities, the game falls into that “syndrome” of repetition of most open world games, with a large amount of icons polluting the screen and consequently taking away that feeling of natural exploration, as we already know exactly the type of activity without even getting close to them. After a certain point, completing the map becomes ""homework"", with virtually negligible loot to collect.The game also has a system of seasons, which changes the look of the map quite a bit, it is a good artistic detail that makes exploring the map a little more interesting. But what makes navigating the map delightful is its gameplay.The gameplay is very fluid, both on land and mainly in the air. Flying with the broom is simply phenomenal, invoking it is a very quick process, being able to activate it almost any time, including from the water. You can still upgrade it to increase speed and acceleration, basically the broom and its navigation is one of the main factors for the game to work.Combat is impressively well done and satisfying, it's kind of a beefier version of the Batman games. When you have a lot of enemies on the screen can get a little boring, yet with the amount of spells, potions and plants to use in battle, it makes this one of the highlights of the game.The game's bosses are a bit tedious, with few variations of their moveset, and sometimes the lock in becomes a problem, as it is not possible to adjust the aim when it is activated, when there is a boss + enemies, we lose the notion from where are we taking or giving damage.The first missions of the game have a very tutorial “tenor”, the problem is that this same line continues for about 3h-4h, and we only have access to another dungeon and the broom, 4h-6h after the start. Many of the missions involve going to point A just for an npc to give us a little information so that we can go to point B, this turns out to be tedious because the game almost shelters us to constantly use fast-travel. Another annoying thing related to the missions is the level lock, forcing the player to do secondary things.The game's story isn't bad, but it's forgettable in my opinion, I couldn't connect with most of the characters and I found the whole main context a little generic, in addition, our actions don't seem to have significant consequences. Some details are not very logical and the classic “we have no time to lose, let's do this now” also happens here, however, it is an open world game and it leaves the option of going to do other things and returning to that quest hours later. The highest point in terms of the narrative turns out to be Sebastian's questline, which we have some good decisions to make.In terms of puzzles related to the main missions (and some secondary ones), even if none are very challenging, the character doesn't shut up for 1 second, giving non-stop tips on what to do, which isn't very cohesive taking into account most of the Castle's puzzles.The game has a lot of loadings and cuts, which ends up taking away some of the immersion. It has a cut to enter and exit the dialogs, these that have occasional sound problems, sometimes the sound comes out good, sometimes it has a giant echo and others it is louder or quieter.There is also a problem with lighting, whenever we walk through a door from inside to outside ""we get a flashbang"" right in our face.Another slightly annoying thing is the repetition of small dialogues by the character when he sees or interacts with some elements of the world, which happens all the time."

I'm a bad person.  Don't care.  Been called a lot worse by people I actually care about.  Go pound sand.Not a Potter fan, but I am really liking this game.  If you enjoy open world, crafting and/or fantasy RPGs, this is your game.  Bought extra copies for a friend and my daughter-in-law, both of whom are Potter fans.  They are loving it as well.I have had no issues at all.  No bugs,  No graphics problems using a 3070 card.  In fact, my buddy, who uses a 2000 series NVidia card, is playing this with no issues.  Beautiful graphics, lots of side quests and tons of customizable cosmetics.  After the long parade of bitter disappointments, particularly Fallout 76, it is refreshing to get a game that is excellent on launch, not in some future date.  It is about time."

Map not enormous by any means but is decent size with a lot of stuff to distract you. Crafting and planting I like too, doesn't require too many different ingredients for people who just want to be a wizard and not act like they have to play like its a survival game, good job for not making the crafting system like that. Not any moral/honor system which i like because you can go be a crazy wizard and npc wont judge you for it. fell through map once and only one crash with 20 hrs gameplay, not bad."

The fact that you can explore on your own in this magically created world is top-notch. You do have to realize that the main quests will give you spells and mounts pretty late in the game. Which is not something I expected. So don't feel bad going through the main quest line faster than you might think you should.

4913,Rytoxz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rytoxz/,2,1,1,55.1,February,24,"1,320",1,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is undeniably excellent and a genuine must-play if you’re at all a fan of the Wizarding World. Getting your first wand, flying around on a broom, or simply taking in the Hogwarts grounds is truly breathtaking. It is however an imperfect game: great gameplay, average story; amazing open world, excessive busywork tasks; interesting characters, not enough development of them. This review contains mild spoilers.StoryThe introduction for the game is wonderful showcasing the magical setting and setting up the premise nicely. The pace does however slow down by quite a bit over the next few hours, yet you never feel bored as there are constantly new things to discover via quests, characters, or just general exploration. This is a storyline where you have a special ability that others don’t, and there are multiple times throughout the game where you must suspend your disbelief that a simple 5th year Hogwarts student is doing all this. The characters you meet – three of which have developed side stories – are likeable, but many characters just don’t have much of an impact in the game or you don’t spend enough time with them. Aside from that, the story is somewhat predictable but good enough to keep you engaged for the time it might take you to play through it all.ExplorationOnce the initial tutorial and introduction parts are complete, you basically have complete freedom to roam the open world. Hogwarts castle is unequivocally one of the best video game locations ever made, with nearly every room open for exploration and incredible depth to each area. Many hours in, I was still being amazed that there were new locations to find, and I was always eager to explore them just to see what the level designers had created or to find more collectibles. The grounds around Hogwarts are also nice to traverse, though the open world looks visually quite similar with not too much variation past just “green hills”. There is a coastal part of the map in the bottom-right which feels a bit different, but in general (and as expected really) it’s all just highlands. Hogsmeade is a great town to visit truly highlighting the magic of the setting and adding depth to the world with almost every building being openable. Many doors throughout the game are however locked behind a levelled lockpicking skill. This was a frustrating design decision as you had to collect statues throughout the game – some of which were locked behind lockpicking doors – before you could level up your lockpicking stat. This acted as a huge barrier to exploration progression, and I felt this was a low point for the general pace of the game. Otherwise, whether it be sneaking, walking, running, flying, or constant “revelio-ing” around the world, I thoroughly enjoyed just exploring and not feeling like every area was a pointless copy and pasted zone of collectibles. My only negative really is the sheer number of tasks: 95 Merlin trials became too much, and I think if they just slightly toned this down it would feel less oppressive.GameplayAside from the numerous main quests and side quests – including things like broom flying challenges or puzzle rooms, the game is made-up of a collectibles and challenge system that rewards progression via cosmetic unlocks, armor traits, or building items. I have 100% completion in the game, and due to how I was playing focussing on the collectibles, it was only at the very end of the game where I needed to look some stuff up to finish my collections. It doesn’t really feel like a chore, and the rewards are nice – though I do wish they were just auto-claimed. A portion of the meta game is around the Room of Requirement (which just kept expanding much to my amazement) where you have very good customisation and build options, as well as rooms to store, feed, breed, and play with the animals you can nab. There are also traits which act as a skill tree and when I saw a whole part dedicated to the dark arts I knew what I would be spending my points on. Otherwise, the game has a fairly simple gear system with the usual Destiny-esque rarities and power level, but it also has transmog so you can keep gear and looks separate – though I wish the transmog was slot based and not item-based as you are constantly having to re-apply your looks when you change gear. There’s enough depth to keep you interested but it’s also accessible enough for anyone to play.CombatI was very worried leading up to launch that the combat would feel shallow, but it is surprisingly good. I played on controller, though I feel keyboard and mouse is probably the better call here. You have (once unlocked) four sets of skills that you can slot four spells into each – in general 16 total equipped spells is fine but you will occasionally need to switch some stuff out. Combat has some tactics to it: you need to match spell colors to break shields, you need to dodge or parry at the right time based on the attack type, and you need to use certain spells against some enemies. You never feel overwhelmed, but I think a lot of that is down to the very easy difficulty of the game – even on “hard”. The auto-targeting is generous but not too annoying, and being able to lock-on to targets and dodge independently is appreciated. When you start to combo skills in late-game – especially unforgivable curses and ancient magic – combat gets even more engaging and still feels fair based on enemy numbers and types; of which there are a good amount of unique enemies with different abilities and combat styles. I really enjoyed combat in this game, and only in a few cases did it feel like enemies were bullet sponges. The few boss fights the game had were also decent with the final boss being something that did impress me despite being quite simple.Graphics and PerformanceGraphically I don’t think the game looks insane, but it definitely looks very good. The most impressive thing is the minute detail in locations with lots of small items that adds to the scenery. Characters are also fine, and lip-syncing is okay. I played at 1440p ultra with DLSS 2.5.1 quality on a system with an i7-13700K and RTX 3080. Whilst I would say that general performance was good, the game is very VRAM heavy (especially with raytracing) and even with my setup it’s just on the edge of being fully playable; do not be afraid to turn down texture resolution. Rushing around in Hogwarts could also lead to some occasional stutters (even on my NVMe) as the game has simply zero loading screens and streams in areas as you move – be somewhat thoughtful to the engine. Settings wise, it has a good number of options to configure and generally seems to scale well across graphics presets. OverallI really liked this game, but then I also like Harry Potter. With the marvel of the world aside, I do still think it holds up as a fully playable and enjoyable, completely offline, MTX-free video game. It is rare that we get a release that is generally bug-free, well optimised, and not excessively monetised (do NOT buy the deluxe pack). Hogwarts Legacy has broken Steam records, sale records, and despite controversies has cemented itself as being a GOTY contender. Good work Avalanche Software and I hope there will be DLC or a sequel in the future."

I still have not returned Marianne Moffett her Albino Diricawl.And Sebastian, i feel sorry for sending you to AskabanI think this game needs a sequel.I feel the students (and my elf!) could be more interactive, but who knows, when the AI's get smarter, we can  drink butterbeer with friends in Hogsmeade and have conversations about broomsticks illegal potions etc..Talking about potions, i think we there should have been an option to experiment with ingredients and have our kettles explode etc....I think the castle has more hidden rooms than we know about.

(bonus: the whole ""transmog"" thing is really annoying to switch back to once you get new gear.)- houses mean.. nothing. i've watched gameplays and it's all the same.- the main story is mediocre, it's not bad but it's there.however, strong points are:- the combat, it's very satisfying and in general just good.- exploration- side quests, honestly found them more fun to do than the main story- graphics look very nice, especially hogwarts and hogsmeadeget it if you want a good adventure, i personally don't like harry potter at all but the game is pretty good."

For every dollar paid, I need to play 1 hour and it didn't rendered what I expected. After 27 hours in game, I finished the principal quest and the 3 majors secondary quests. Needless to say I also collected all the creatures, did my share of side quests but 27 hours? I'm a bit disappointed. I can't give a good review because the game was way too short for me to enjoy completely the money I put in it. Still a beautiful game but I wouldn't recommend it if you expect to play it as much as RDR3 or other open worlds .

Not worth full price, get with a 50% discount and drop it once you're bored with it. Performs like crap too.This game must be one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. On the surface it is great: huge beautiful world, a lot of abilities, and an insane amount of side activities. But aside from quite competent combat, stunning looks and an incredible score, it doesn't really offer much.The characters are bland, the story is boring and side activities are... well openworld side activities, you get the drill. There are only a couple of side quests that are kinda curious, and that's about it. Worldbuilding was bad in the source material, but they did absolutely nothing about it. It sucks here as well. Don't expect rules to be consistent or world to be coherent.I should also mention that this game is how you not make a diverse character cast. They are so uninspired that only things you end up kinda recognise them for are their accents. It ends up being a mockery of racial stereotypes. I never cared about diversity in videogames, but somehow this game has managed to rub even me the wrong way. Ask someone who's into politics about how offensive some of the themes in the game. They will tell you about it better than I ever will.Oh, and padding, so much padding. This game WANTS you to spend dozens of hours playing it, so you get $60 worth of gameplay. Honestly? Not worth it. Every Assassin's Creed game I've played had more going for it than this... thing.Oh, and the performance is incredibly inconsistent. It was fluctuating between 15 and over 60 fps throughout the game, and setting everything to lowest possible value did not really help."

That was more of a fascination for my kids at the time :)I didn't even consider buying this game until a day or so before it released. I'm glad I did.Referring to the visuals in this game as great graphics is not really telling you anything. What it delivers, graphically, is art. Everywhere you go, be that in Hogwarts grounds or out in the world beyond, if you stop for a moment and just look around, you'll see or witness something new. I've been playing on/off for around 30 hrs and still loving the quantity and variety of assets in this wonderful game.The gameplay and controls are really intuitive to pick up. I'm typically your classic mouse/keyboard player in most other games of this genre, but for this title, I feel just as comfortable using the gamepad. The story is very well scripted as you'd expect for a AAA release. The main story and side missions work quite well in tandem, so you can't simply rush the story to complete it, then do all the sides as some are intergral to the main story.  This is all on the premise you're there as a student and you have classes to attend, in between extra-curricular mayhem :DAll in a great experience so far and would say if you're on the fence because its a ""potter"" game, ignore that thought. Worth the money & hands down prettiest game in my collection so far."

That's it (yeah they come in reskin variations - but for such a high fantasy setting this is really disapointing).Lots of physic/logic based puzzles. Got the same vibes as from more open world-ish lego games (if you ever played one of those).Exploring Hogwards is fun - focus on development definitvly went there - the outside world is way less interesting.Story is okay, Voice acting too.Fun for 30-40hrs.Won't have much replayability though as this is one of those RPGs where non of your choices matters anyway and is just for fluff.IMHO not worth 60 bugs."
4961,rivi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rivi_btw/,1,,1,68.5,February,24,270,0,1,"Probably one of the best games I have played. It is so rich with lore, with every single corridor in Hogwarts offering something — from talking paintings, to puzzles, to NPC dialogue, to fun activities, to seeing a suit of armour get so annoyed at his humming colleague, he progressively turns from grunting, to arm punching, to wielding his axe and turning him into crumpled tin. It's full of things to do. I get lost in finishing collectables because they are fun to do and offer rewards. Simply explore, open chests, finish a puzzle, and you earn more EXP than smashing your way through a camp of goblins with an armoured troll to contend with. The Room of Requirement is fantastic to decorate, ever expanding. Breeding monsters is just so much fun. YOU GET TO PET THEM. Feed them. Brush them. Races on the back of a broom are fun, side quests are interesting. The makers of this game have gone above and beyond with their attention to detail, and flatly, I am 50+ hours in right now, no where near finished with so much to do, it's a joy to slap it on and swish about with my wand, being Hufflepuff as my childhood deserves. For me, it's a 10/10. One of my favourite games and one I'll treasure forever."
4962,Anargo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Anargo/,1,,1,73.5,February,24,251,0,1,"tl;dr; 9/10 - do not regret buying and playingPositives: 1. Lots of content.2. The open-world you'd expect from a decent single-player game with many travel systems in place to make getting around simple and fast.3. Experienced almost no bugs (none game breaking)4. A fun combat system with many hidden features to do large amounts of damage (either chunking a large amount of health if not 1-shotting them).Negatives: 1. Linear gearing and talent system makes for a experience that will be quite redundant thus hurting replayability. You get enough talents to learn most but not all talents which is a little vexing. Later on in the game you can modify your gear with a trait to empower an ability or group of abilities... this makes it better but still too linear... imo2. Puzzles seemingly are too simple. I understand some should be easy, but I would hope that there was at least a few challenging ones. Perhaps I haven't encountered them yet?"

Found the hype to be unwanted and certainly aimed at a very young demographic. When the developers released footage of the game, again I had little to no interest in it due to my previous experience with the franchise. #how wrong was I. The games very very good, great main story line and side quest chains, exceptional open world with seasonal changes as story progression occurs. Array of enemies to defeat with named sub bosses located around the map. Hidden areas and secrets to find. Overall a very enjoyable experience, regardless whether you are interested in the subject matter or not.My only gripes are the hidden base you received which you can upgrade gear or create loot box style gear and profession items. It just felt like this wasn't thought through well enough and legendary gear is so easily dropped by chests it felt unrewarding when receiving them. This whole area could of done with a better induction into the main game as it felt like a secondary thought to make filler and can almost be skipped if it wasn't for a main quest tie in. Great game, enjoyed every moment. Would recommend."

4985,Nain,https://steamcommunity.com/id/notdodgyatallmyfriend/,1,,1,54.4,February,23,211,0,1,The best way to describe this game would be bad / boring gameplay & story carried by the fact it's Harry Potter.One of the biggest issues with this game is the lack of variation with all the houses and main characters where it's the exact same gameplay regardless of changes. The custom naming feature also seems like a cop out by the developers to ensure people don't hate the main character. The game also falls for the same trope the movies and books take where it's almost exclusively the Gryffindor and Slytherin good versus bad trope with little or no inclusion of the other houses. Most of the open world is repetitive with no development over the course of the game and the map is strangely split in two with no explanation why the last part of the game basically only occurs on the second half. Despite what people keep saying I had no issues with running this game with zero crashes throughout the entire playthrough and pretty consistent FPS. The price of this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the stupid €10 extra to play the game early and it feels like there's going to be load of stupid €15 DLCs added in the future. Also ♥♥♥♥ J.K Rowling the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ is a terrible person so far up her own ass she'll never change.

The cons out of the way first~cons:-The main story is exciting, but it is shallow. It had a lot of potential, getting me on the edge of my seat in some moments but the ending is completely predictable. Also, your decisions dont matter much and the path is clearly scripted other than your choice to learn the unforgivable curses-Buggy controls (but you get the hang of it eventually)-we need a companion system, that would make the side quests and challenges 1000% more interesting and immersivepros:There are so many but I shall only list a few as I am high whilst writing this-completely true to the actual wizarding lore-you finally get to choose your house instead of being a boring gryffindor-the world map is huge and so so SO BEAUTIFUL-THE GRAPHICS MWAH-interesting characters"

You can tell there was a lot of love put into the game based on the attention to detail alone. There is so much content and it's all fun! I've never had so much fun playing another game for HOURS in one sitting. I have to tear myself away from it every time. I'm really impressed with it, especially in the world we're in now, where it seems just about every game is created for the profits and not for the passion. There are currently some bugs and glitches, but they're nothing compared to most games released these days and they can be patched out.

There are so many things to do and explore. Calling it a masterpiece of a game doesn't even do it justice."
5020,nanO.bytez,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nanO-bytez/,1,,1,114.8,February,23,649,0,1,"It's an exceptionally rare occurrence for me to finish a long game. I usually lose interest somewhere in the latter half of a game which most often can be attributed to issues with pacing.Hogwarts Legacy made me want to explore every nook and cranny of its world and uncover its secrets. It made me fall in love with the world of Harry Potter all over again in a way that no other entry to the Wizarding World since the original movies and books managed to do.Where Fantastic Beasts was a shameless scheme to push merchandise this game truly feels like a labour of love.There are problems - most of which are related to the main character and their lack of personality. This isn't a Commander Shepard or Geralt of Rivia but rather a They / Them [Enter House Name Here] who often comes across as rather bland in dialogues which is a problem of voiced nameless protagonists all throughout gaming.Limiting the player's choice during character creation and the sorting ceremony probably would have benefited the story. Yes, you can play as your ideal witch or wizard but that breadth of choice came at the cost of depth. No one ever uses the name of the main character which makes conversations feel a little awkward at times and they are exclusively referred to using the gender neutral they / them while the ability to choose join any of the four Hogwarts Houses means the relationship between the MC and the other students, including the three deeper ""friendships"" that can be formed remain incredibly shallow to the very end.Other than the MC there really isn't anything major for me to criticize. I didn't even have the huge performance issues that so many have reported despite my PC getting a little old in the tooth at this point.One more thing I will say however is that both navigating the world and combat feel a lot better using a controller rather than mouse and keyboard. This isn't to say that you can't play with mouse and keyboard, just that the UI was clearly designed for controllers. Trust me on this as someone who generally vastly prefers mouse and keyboard; just use an old 360 controller or whatever else old broom you can dig out of the closet. This game does not require mouse precision To conclude I can happily recommend the game. Already it's a personal contender for GOTY and it's not even March yet. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that this is probably one of the most captivating games I have played in my life. I haven't really touched any other game for almost three weeks. Most games can't retain my attention for more than a couple of days at a time."

I played it with the attitude that it's an action adventure. There's a few minor choices you get to make but nothing that really changes up the story in any substantial way. There are no moral consequences other than maybe you can anger NPCs if you don't give them the quest items, and theyll grumble at you in passing.   You get gear but after a while I was just selecting the gear with the best stats and changing the appearance to the same outfit for the whole game.  good though. You get to romp around the wizard world and go adventuring. Combat is good, especially the kinetic stuff. I felt like I was playing force unleashed using those abilities. The dark arts are really powerful too.  No, there isn't any story consequence for using them. if you're a fan of harry potter and the movies and stuff youll probably spend hours in the castle, it's like an indoor city and I'm always getting lost if I don't have the tracking dots on the map."

Skyrim, ESO, Valheim, and even Elden Ring, despite never playing a Souls game in my entire life, are the recents. I thrive off watching the achievements pop up, the closer to 100% I get, the more precious dopamine pumps through my veins. I'm 32 hours in to this gem of a game with tons more to go but I keep getting lost, getting distracted, getting *immersed* in this world. I haven't even touched the south half of the map. I'm looking forward to whatever is coming my way in the next 32 hours and then some. Despite the controversy, Avalanche did a fantastic job with this game and I commend them for it. Try it or don't, but I fully believe you'll be missing out on an experience that transcends the author of HP, and is exactly what the industry needed for 2023. An example has been set."

Broom flying feels amazing, main story is awesome and features various characters that aren't all likeable but are at least interesting if not. Side quests are a mixed bag of enjoyable ones with interesting story tidbits and typical rpg fetch quests. Exploring feels really good and there are lots of cool areas to explore over a decent sized map. Combat is fun and intuitive and crafting your own build with your choice of spells and talents feels rewarding. Endgame combat is not balanced especially with the cursed spells but is still fun and you feel like a powerful force of nature in the wizarding world.Overall this is a solid RPG with a great story and fun exploration.

5047,Karvlok,https://steamcommunity.com/id/karvlok/,1,,1,84.0,February,23,269,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is the single player RPG gamers have wanted for a very long time. There is a lot of depth to the storyline, it's not a sandbox to get bored of and yet it's not a railroad track with amusing set pieces to glance at on the way by. Love, passion and dedication went into the programming, writing and overall development of this game and you can breathe it in with every NPC interaction and visual blast of magic and thundering crash of a troll's club in the ground so close to your feet that your anus puckers.Given what I have and haven't done, I believe I could have finished the main storyline in about 30 hours, but I kept having too much fun exploring and seeking out colectibles and challenges (which is a rarity for me anymore). 80 hours with only 10 achievements and about 10 hours of scrounging left to do to collect everything and make sure my primary save is fully prepped for DLC is awesome and I cannot describe how much I truly think anyone would find at least 1 thing to fall in love with about this game, if not far more than that.● well fleshed out and interesting NPCs with convincing and human dialogue● engaging main story and optional quests● well designed combat with speed, accuracy and challenge● good balance between predictable enemies you can strategize for in fights and enough diversity to keep things interesting● giant map with lots of areas to explore● good customisation options● may get you in trouble with tumblerinas and twatterflies for streaming/playing● clipping issues that sometimes cause enemies and loot to spawn or fall through graphics● quests can be slow to update● still has some rendering issues during new area loads and cutscenes● may get you in trouble with tumblerinas and twatterflies for streaming/playing"

5058,foob,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198107096866/,1,,1,64.8,February,23,102,0,1,"OBS: Minor spoilers ahead. Personally, I would divide the game's main story into 4 quarters. The first half of the story was phenomenal. There was not a second I was bored. Constantly exploring hogwarts and its secrets. Doing main story mission revolving around going to classes, learning spells and interacting with other students. You could easily spend hours getting lost, as I did. However, around the third quarter is where things, (for me), start to go downhill. In my opinion, It may be the ratio of main quests to side quests. With so many side missions accessible at this time, the major objectives almost feel diluted. (Depending on how you play.)Contrarily, the fourth quarter is when things start to get interesting again. Avada Kadavra is taught to you during this quarter, and despite what everyone else says, it is actually ""fun"" to use. Paired with crucio it makes one hell of a combo. I did encounter a handfull of visual bugs: - The facial expression of an npc after a conversation would lack any form of emotion. As the face would transfom from talkative to being stern.  - Articles of clothing not being where they are supposed to be. This would normally be the robe glitching.  - The player model glitching. For exemple, the hands would stretch in a linear pattern towards a singular point when performing swift dash.  - Weird lighting on the snidget eggs. They would appear to have a square pattern repeating itself on the top half of the eggs.   - Both the save symbol and the field guide displayed the same type of bug. The lighting on the field guide's  ""main-page"" has the symbol of the animal of your corresponding house. (I think). This lighting would glitch out and in a square outline, randomly display bits and pieces of this lighting. Although it was now very distorted. The save symbol would behave in a similar fashion.Furthermore, throughout the game I also experienced significant performance drops. Overall I would rate this 8.5 / 10."

Sebastian's questline was my favourite.Gameplay, Music, Worldbuilding, Graphics, and Lore, everything has been nailed here. The story is the only weaker part about the game but it is still a respectable 8/10 for me. Overall, the game is a 9.5/10 from me. They couldn't have done it better except the story. Definitely worth playing since it made me feel my money was well spent."

Which is great because she's not really a gamer and there's not a lot of games we can play together. There's enough exploration, mini games and side stuff for her to enjoy and I enjoy the combat. I'm used to games like dark souls and bloodborne so the combat is a bit easy by comparison but It's fun enough to keep me interested and wanting more. On that note I wish there were more combat opportunities. They seem a bit sparse. And you're given so many spells and items to aid in combat but I rarely use most of them because it's pretty easy to succeed with just parrying and basic attacks. It's also pretty fun just watching my girlfriend play and enjoy the world. The devs did a great job making a beautiful Hogwarts world and I'd recommend this game to any Harry Potter fans that like rpgs."
5067,TitsOfWar,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TitsOfWar/,1,,1,62.0,February,22,210,0,1,"After over 50 hours of gameplay, and starting 3 different characters, I can confirm that Hogwarts legacy does indeed make you A WIZZZZZARRRRRDD!!!!Firstly, this game isn't as much an RPG as it would like to think. While the game succeeds in giving the illusion of choice, dialogue decisions shape your character more than anything in the plot. I was a little disappointed by this, but honestly i soon forgot about it because i still got to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WIZARD!!!!! The story starts off really strong, with amazing visuals, puzzles and intriguing dialogue. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, the story starts to fall off more and more, becoming predictable, filled with lazy dialogue, and lower quality visuals with less climactic moments. It also feels as if it concludes too quickly compared to the almost 10 hour intro tutorial filled with scripted events. I'd rate the story around 7/10, filled with some amazing moments, and some that fall very short. The voice acting is phenomenal, and the male character sounds like daniel radcliffe, so coming from the movies into this felt like the perfect transition.The world of Hogwarts legacy is filled with tons of easter eggs and magical details. The world feels full and alive, aside from your inability to directly interact with students unless scripted.  It's thoroughly fun and immersive to just fly around, search building , caves, and complete side quests for every tidbit of story or cool animations.The gameplay is simple yet complicated. It's an easily accessible entry for new gamers while still providing more than enough for the hardcore gamer to sink their teeth into. It constantly progresses as you unlock new spells and talents, keeping combat fresh and allowing you to create your own destructive spell combos. The game lets you go full Fantastic beasts, capturing creatures, breading and building environments for them to play in, it's like a little animal crossing in hogwarts. The mounts are so very fun, although initially tricky to control. I'd spend ages gliding around instead of fast travelling, because it's just that fun and immersive.Overall, this was one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've ever had. Were the story given a bit more time, it would sit among the likes of games like Arkham City and Spiderman ps4, but as a Wizard sim, it succeeds in every way. 8.5/10- You're a wizard!!!!"
5068,Panophobia,https://steamcommunity.com/id/panophobia_gaming/,1,,1,93.9,February,22,179,0,1,"The combat is really fun in this game. They managed to make the wand combat of the Wizarding World fun, fast paced and cinematic looking. The spells are lore friendly and fun to use, and you can make some pretty interesting combos and really satisfiying fatalities. The blood and stuff is censored, but the way you can execute enemies, is way worse then Avada Kedavra. So the name of the game should be, Mortal Combast XVII: The Legacy of Hogwarts instead.The main issue here is the amount of spell slots. You have to constantly change between spell sets, for the 4 avalible hotkeys you get, and you do not get enough spell sets, to use all spells, so you have to rearrange them constantly. This is extremly annoying, epsecially on PC. It would not have been much effort, to make a PC UI, but obvioulsy they favor the console players.The game world especially the Hogwarts Castle itself is filled with side quests, puzzles, secrets lot of opportunities to learn about the Wizarding World lore and stuff to explore. It makes the time you spend in the game world rewarding and fun.Sadly this can't be said about the enemies. There are only a limited types of enemies, which makes combat encounters, boring and repetitive after a while.The Room of Requirements basebuilding and creature collecting is a really great thing. Though it feels like, there are a lot of stuff, that they cut from it. So right now, it only exists as a timesink and ingredient farming place.The game looks amazing. The detail of the game world, especially the design of the Hogwarts castle shows how much care the team did in designing and building it up. They even payed attention to stuff on the designs, that only lore nerds and history nerds would find.Th music, the enviromental sounds are just exceptional. They also found great voice actors for even some background characters expect... well you know who. That charaters voice actor sounds so bore with his role, like they just dragged in a junior dev to a studio, before he drank his morning coffe to record some lines.The game has a godd story. Bit short, choosen one MC story. Fun to play trough, but what it misses is provided us by other parts of the experience.The side stories are also nice, but nothing extremly great about them.The biggest problem here, in my opinion, is that we do not experience much from the school life. No school events, and only a few classes. I did not expect a school life simulator, since i payed attention to what the devs promised, but still expected a bit more.Sadly, this is where the game falls flat. Most characters are just 1D personalities, and we do not spend much time with them, to actually know them better, like how we do that in other games.This is one of the big negatives to the game.The NPC-s are really static in the game. And at night they just disappear. If you look around, beds are empty, NPC-s are nowhere to be found. I expected more, since even Skyrim, 12 years ago, was able to make NPC-s do stuff and have some daily schedules.There is not much. No big decisions and only 1 quest difference between the different houses.Hoigwarts Legacy managed to live up fro a hype and become and amazing game. It has it's issues, there are a lot of parts where you can feel they cut content, and you can feel some level of caution in every part, thanks to the idiotic twitter boycott. But other than that, as i already said it is an amazing game, especially to a Harry Potter fan."

Flying feels great and can be used in most outdoor areas. Looks great, even on lower settings. Good (but not perfect) transmog system.On the negative, the voice acting for several characters, including the male protagonist is terrible! Very flat, sometimes has a weird tinny noise as if it was recorded on an iPhone and the male protagonist sounds far too much like Daniel Radcliff! The exploration can get repetitive, as can the diaglog lines that go off when you get near a place or item. Like a lot of open world games, there is tonnes of things to do but there are only about ten things which are repeated over and over.Overall, a 7/10."

5086,Decree,https://steamcommunity.com/id/_Decree/,1,,1,78.0,February,22,438,0,1,"TL;DR: Amazing immersive game, if you like a fantasy world setting then you should play it, even if you're not a fan of HP stuff.Great game, lots of good things done right and that's why I'm leaving a positive review. However, I'm gonna focus and start with the cons:- The game has a huge FPS drops and stuttering (I'm using a high end GPU) in some parts of the world, this started to be noticeable during the winter season so it might have been the reason, also the game crashed twice on me, but it has an auto save so not a big deal.- Second issue is, a lot of the mechanics and animations in this game get repetitive over time, like picking locks and doing Merlin puzzles was nice for a while but having to wait for the animation every single time is tiring and boring, and yes a large part of this was felt when I was 100%ing the game but I felt this way earlier too.- Another mechanic that felt useless literally the second you get it is potion making, you never run out of potions and never need to use them at all, same with the plants. - Speaking of useless mechanics, even money/coins gets obsolete at like mid to late game which makes you not really being rewarded for exploring and picking up armor to sell.- SELLING GEAR SEPARATELY every single time is tedious af, and you can only carry 20 at a time while wearing 6 pieces of those, so you gotta take a turn to the shop every time and sell one by one... Please add the option to sell them all, it will make it much better, especially when you're doing a good job by not displaying the currently used gear. And yes I know you can increase it to 40 by endgame but that's still nothing, in fact 40 should be the starting capacity if not more.- Game is waaaay too easy, but I guess this is to be expected.- Enemy variety leaves much to be desired.- For some reason, you can't pause the cutscenes which is annoying since sometimes I have to. Anyway, it might seem that I'm just whining since I'm only focusing on negatives, but that's not the case, I really enjoyed the game a lot, exploring Hogwarts and Hogsmeade for the first time was such a joy and a fun experience, flying is well done, the characters are fun to listen to and the dialogue is good, most of the quests and lore are cool and it made me read a lot even tho I'm not a lore guy.Overall, definitely play this game."

The combat is fluid and and feels fairly natural and also provides a few combination spells that can deal out a large amount of damage once you learn them. You are not pinned down on what school you choose but it is still enjoyable to give the sorting hat an honest set of answers to see where you stand in the wizarding world of Hogwarts. The map is actually a decent size.If you're not much of an explorer at heart this game might seem tedious at times.One small complaint i did have was that each school was very cordial with each other and had no sense of rivalry between each house making it seem more competitive.All in all worth the money.

First off, I am not a die hard Potterhead, never read the books, but loved every movie they made.  If you are a HP fan of either the books or movies, I think you will easily get lost in this game. The devs really caught the magic(no pun intended) of the universe JKR created. I only encountered 2 or 3 bugs in over 200 hours of gp, and it ran really good on my Nvidia GTX 1650 card with most settings on high some on ultra. I got so sucked into game from the opening sequence and never looked back, played the game to the end while being in house Slytherin, and when I finished, I started a new game immediately, House Gryffindor, and did not get bored.      The magic combat is great, learning how to use the different spells to break down defensed and then go on the attack made it feel like you were in the movie fighting against other wizards and witches. The room of requirement was awesome and how it changes based off of what you require was totally unexpected. I normally dont ever go after collectibles in games because I always felt it was just a waste and all you got was some stupid achievement that did nothing for you in game. This was the first game where I actually chased after the challenges because you were rewarded with either gear or upgrades. As you fly around on your broom, you are always getting side tracked onto something else. The customization of your character was pretty cool, if you dont like the way a more powerful piece of gear looks, you can keep the appearance of a piece of gear that you like instead. Seeing all the strange creatures and how they tie into the story line added to the ambiance of the world.      Now for some negative remarks but not much, I was disappointed that there was not some type of morality meter, so that if you go down the path of a dark wizard, it should have affected the story line with consequences. The customization of your character, again was great but it was a little too much too fast, I think the better gear should have been more rare. Also, I wish there were larger encampments in the open world with more enemies just because I liked the combat.  I know there seems to be a lot of negative reviews on the discussion page, but if you didnt fall for the hype trap and you go into as a Harry Potter fan, I think you will love the game. I have to give this game a 10/10 for the simple fact that I actually started a new game right after finishing it the first time and played it right to the end again."

This is a really good light dark-soul style of combat and exploration, and I love it. There are mods to remove alot of things I dont agree with in the game *cough* Sirona *cough*, which is fantastic. And the Ascendio mod makes my fps 100+ with max settings now. So its definetely managable with some effort. Looking forward to see what else this game has in store.In all honestly, its probably the better game release I have seen in years, but that is thanks to alot of these week 1 mods, so grats to the modders for that.

The combat is flashy but not very deep and the side content is mostly just collectables.My major gripes with the game are this, 1 the rewards for many of the chests are awful randomly generated (i.e you find a special looking chest in a dungeon off the beaten path only to find some gloves) 2 none of the characters are compelling the writing just feels weak for me. the 3rd reason is the magic you are given control of is so basic it hurts what happened to the fire snakes and what not."

If you like games like Witcher III Wild Hunt, Horizon 0 Dawn or Red DEad Redemption 2 - you will feel like home here. If you like Harry Potter Universe and skillful games - this one is for you too. You can go through using some simple spells but if you want to delve into switching cast sets and queueing combos - you're gonna enjoy it. I really recommend the game so easy to spend lots of time in. Just learn some tips for a start (for example to push main story until... minor spoilers). So decide if you want to maximize the output because there are clever ways to make the game a lot easier and enjoyable. Just prioritising certain tasks. Good luck have fun! <3"

A good chunk of the exploration quests seem to be focused around puzzles and that's not really my jam. I don't particularly care for the dialog either. The NPCs seem pretty long winded in their conversations. The game is lacking in moral choices too, as i feel there isn't a lot of nuance in perspective and that may just be a limitation of having a voiced player character. Granted I sunk about 10 hours into the game to try it and In that time I wasn't impressed by any of the quests or NPCsI think the strongest point that the game has is in its exploration and combat. It's legitimately cool to fly around the castle on a broom and find hidden secrets around Hogwarts. The combat feels pretty awesome especially once you unlock new spells but it feels like they're drip fed to you and in the 10 hours I played there just wasn't enough duels to satisfy that need. Honestly I feel like Hogwarts Legacy is most like a Legend of Zelda type game and It's just not my cup of tea."

Cons:-Runs a bit rough, but has gotten a little better with the patches. -Main Story is less interesting than character storylines, but still not bad. -The amount of collectibles on the map is a little too much for my taste and some (achievement relevant) tasks are not tracked on the map. (Take this with a grain of salt, as I tend to miss stuff if it isn't in my face)All in all I rate it 9/10, fantastic game."

5166,kjjkjh,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zebith/,1,,0,22.6,February,22,189,0,1,"If you like Hogwarts and the Harry Potter universe this game is worth playing and you'll enjoy it but if you're not playing it for the Harry Potter universe and just as a magic open world exploration story based game it's pretty bland in my opinion. Nothing offensive and bad just super mid and doesn't really bother to do anything new or innovative. The main story is fine (from what I've played) and the side quests are normally just go here and pickup 5 gumbleflumps or something then give it to the person or you can just choose to not give it back as some like half assed attempt at allowing you to be evil or something. I leaned towards not giving the stuff back because it was at least slightly more interesting than it being a barebones mmorpg fetch quest. Again this quest design isn't bad per say but super bland and uninspired.I chose to play on Hard and the combat is ridiculously easy. You have a dodge which pretty much works against anything and a block spell which only works against some attacks and allows you to follow up with a stun. The combat boils down to having damaging spells on 1,2,3,4 so you dodge left click 4 times and then press 1,2,3,4 dodge and repeat. Against non-tanky enemies you have spells that allow you to push, pull and generally manipulate enemies in various ways but it's kinda worthless when you get an indicator that tells you when to dodge so controlling your enemies and environment isn't important since you have spider sense and can see attacks coming from all directions constantly. Sometimes enemies will have shield but its just a colour matching game then back to pressing damage abilities. I actually think playing on a easier difficulty would be more fun since all hard does is make enemies super tanky and just extends fights with no extra challenge. Lastly, you have an ancient magic bar which lets you do a big attack that insta kills weaker enemies and massively damages stronger ones. Credit where credit is due I do like the animations on these attacks because it actually feels like your casting strong spells and not pew pew pew spells. I also think the developers have done well adapting what they could into a game because ranged magic is hard to make fun and the Harry Potter world was never written with a game in mind so adapting the magic system I imagine was a challenge for the developers.Overall, I think Hogwarts Legacy is worth playing if you're a Harry Potter fan but if you're not wait till a sale because I cannot recommend it at full price."
5167,Swash,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MAN1T0R/,1,,1,81.1,February,22,51,0,1,"This is the first triple-A game I've liked on release in years and surpassed my expectation. CoD, OW2, Fallout 76, BF2, the futuristic dystopia that shall not be named; They were all a bug-filled bag of empty promises on launch and some of them still are. They've set the bar so low, this game seems almost godlike.The game is pretty much Witcher 3 with simpler mechanics. Keep in mind throughout this review, I have played thus far on hard difficulty. I only use healing with bosses or new enemies. I loved The Witcher 3, but was never able to finish it. The time investment required for researching hunts was always more than my attention span could take...eventually. This game doesn't have that problem. As soon as you run into an enemy a guide will update and you can view it if you're struggling. I advise taking on every new enemy blind and seeing what happens.The combat is fun and you can get creative with it. It's like Assassin's creed if there was never a skill ceiling. You have a plethora of spells, you can have 4 queued at a time and simply switch to a new 4 (4 total groups) like switching a weapon in a shooter. There is a crazy amount of combination attack potential for a most different combinations of spells. It's a lot of fun figuring out new combinations, or if you want take some they teach you and use them the entire game.The part of this game I probably like most is how fleshed out everything is. Every task you're introduced to feels like it contributes to your overall success in the game. I practiced dueling and flying over and over because it was tricky at first, and I could have gotten in by just spamming but that route felt like I'd be cheating myself the rest of the game. The game has tons of content and all that I've found so far are an enriching experience, no throwaway or filler quest. Everything is meant to be fun and not just take up time. As soon as you start to get bored of one mechanic on task type the game seems to offer you plenty else to do. I played this game for several hours this weekend and didn't get bored one time. This game makes me feel like I have a lot of control over my own experience via my skill despite having a guided story (with some variations).Now at this point, I feel a should mention some faults I've found. None of these take away from the game they are just adjustments I believe could improve the game. The first thing I noticed is the pacing was odd for me. I found it difficult to balance when I should be doing Main Quest and when I should be doing Side Quest. You unlock spells, mechanics, and items as you play both. I found myself wishing I had gotten a spell before heading into a mission to pull off fun combos with the enemy. Maybe the developers could add a hint section with the quest for what spells might come in handy.This game peeks the imagination in most components, but I do think the dialogue could use more options. As of now, you are limited to mainly Good, evil, and sometimes extort. I would really like the addition of a to make a joke, flirt, or remain silent. Some options to develop my character for the RP element.This game is very politically correct. They have several nationalities and are LGTBQ influenced. I find it can be a bit rough on immersion. No random sample would be this rounded in the ways people choose to categorize each other. I also think they made it very black and white, which has the opposite effect. It's like being able to walk up on the street to someone, share one sentence, and being able to confirm that person is an asexual Nigerian. I feel like they are pushing stereotypes in an effort to normalize prejudice. This could be a much more subtle experience If handled more delicately. Maybe have some interactions with a character first before they blirt out all this personal information I'm not concerned with. How does your nationality or sexuality help me collect flowers for my potion? Why does my character care? Most prejudice in this world seems to be about species or blood ties. Another small thing is I and many others missed the mechanic at first; where you could change the appearance of your items to other items you've collected. I thought the game was forcing me to dress based on what I found for at least an hour. Maybe draw more attention to this at the beginning of the game. Another addition I'd recommend is the ability to equip and save custom clothing sets. I like to change my characters clothes based on where I am and it can be time consuming after a while.Lastly, the biggest fault I've found in this game is the audible hints. If you struggle even a little on a puzzle your character will automatically throw you a hint. If you take too long he will actually just tell you the answer. I actually turn my dialogue off when I'm solving puzzles so my character doesn't solve it for more. I enjoy challenging puzzles. Don't give me hints or tell me the answer unless I ask otherwise you just ruined that puzzle. You waste my time and yours If I don't get an opportunity to figure it out for myself and learn from the experience. The time before hints are nearly immediate and the hints go on repeat until the solution dialogue comes up. It would be nice to have the option to turn this off so I don't have to mute myself. The entire game is built around honing skills, don't leave puzzling out.In conclusion, the game looks great, plays great, is fun, has tons of content, and is well worth the money."
5168,Arncil,https://steamcommunity.com/id/arncil/,1,,1,83.5,February,22,307,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is an exciting action-adventure game set in the magical world of Harry Potter. The game offers an immersive experience that allows players to explore the vast Hogwarts Castle, interact with various characters, and participate in thrilling quests.The characters in the game are well developed and add depth to the storyline, which is both engaging and entertaining. I found myself invested in the plot and eagerly anticipating the next chapter of the adventure.Unfortunately, the game was plagued with numerous bugs and glitches that detracted from the overall experience. It was clear that the game was not adequately tested, and many issues could have been avoided with more thorough optimization.Despite enjoying the game, the frustration of encountering so many bugs took away from my enjoyment. In particular, I was disappointed that I could not obtain the Collector's Edition achievement due to a bug that prevented me from completing a particular quest.Overall, I believe that Hogwarts Legacy has the potential to be an excellent game, but it was released prematurely without adequate testing and optimization. Despite its flaws, the game's engaging characters and storyline make it worth playing for fans of the Harry Potter universe."
5169,Sicsen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sics6n/,1,,1,114.1,February,22,172,0,1,"As a trans guy, I've been loving this game. I'm honestly mortified by the way some people in the LGBT community are attacking others about playing this game, and it makes me embarrassed and ashamed to be lumped in with them.Let people play what they want to play. To the people saying that the game is actively causing harm to trans people... relax. I don't need people to protest on my behalf, especially in such a toxic way. This game is literally just pennies to JK Rowling. There are Harry Potter theme parks, for Christ's sake! If the woman never got another dime again, she'd still be set for life. Where is this energy when it comes to the countless big brands with unethical practices? Coke is the leading polluter of the environment, Nike has been charged with employing underage labor, Amazon workers hardly even get bathroom breaks... the list goes on. And yet they all stay in business because there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. So, sending death threats to people who just want to play this game is absurd.Controversy aside, I've been loving the game. Sure, I don't agree with JK Rowling's beliefs, but Harry Potter was my childhood. I grew up reading all the books and watching all the movies, constantly imagining what it would be like to go to Hogwarts. This game is my childhood dream come true. It's honestly way better than I had hoped, and I'm already looking forward to future DLC or maybe even a sequel. It's a shame that JK Rowling ended up being an intolerable wench, but you can't deny that the Harry Potter world is majestic, and the game does a great job of showing it."

If you love harry potter and games like red dead redemption, You will enjoy Hogwarts Legacy.Graphics: 9/10 sometimes shadows are glitchy and ugly on moving plants.gameplay: 8/10 tons of puzzles, lots to do, fun combat with tons of spells, but can get repetative.story: 10/10 feels like watching a prequel to the philosopher's stone. excellent voice acting.summary: If you've been dissapointed by the lackluster releases that plague us as gamers lately, this will be a  breath of fresh air."
5174,Zalda,https://steamcommunity.com/id/myeevee/,1,,1,32.4,February,21,200,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy, a visually stunning game that captures the magic of the wizarding world, is an impressive display of artistry. The art team deserves big kudos for the stunning visuals that make the game look beyond beautiful. From the intricately designed Hogwarts Castle to the spellbinding environments, the attention to detail is phenomenal.However, the same cannot be said about the game's storyline, which falls short of expectations. It lacks depth and fails to engage the player. The missions are repetitive, offering little variety, and the side missions are lackluster, seemingly thrown in for the sake of being there without providing any real challenge.Despite the game's shortcomings, it is undeniable that the art and music teams have done a fantastic job in creating a captivating world. The music, composed by a team of skilled musicians, perfectly complements the visuals and adds to the immersive experience.In conclusion, Hogwarts Legacy is a game that looks beautiful but lacks substance. While the art team has done an excellent job in creating a visually stunning world, the repetitive missions and uninspiring storyline are a letdown. Nonetheless, fans of the wizarding world will still enjoy the experience of exploring Hogwarts and interacting with the magical creatures that inhabit it."

If you ignore the annoying performance problems in the beginning (but thats's basically every big PC game these days). The gameplay is great but tbh for me thats everything.. Once you have seen the world a bit it get very boring. Don't get me wrong there's a lot to do but everything just isn't it for me. The NPC's are boring the cutscenes are annoyingly long and too much talking. I disliked almost every 'side'  story except sebastians story and even that one got annoying some times.So no I do not recommend the game. Unless you are playing just for the combat wich is very good.

5185,Taylorrae,https://steamcommunity.com/id/danicataylor/,1,,1,43.3,February,21,85,0,1,"For me, there's not much else to say apart from that this game is pretty fun to play and I think that's enough for most of the Harry Potter fans out there that have an interest in this game as there's not enough decent Harry Potter and wizard games out there in general anyways.There are a few areas that I think the game strongly lacks in such as mob variety. The mob variety in this game is very, very bad. The game would feel a lot more exciting if there were different mobs (not just different versions of the same mob that essentially all do the same thing) and random bosses to fight around the map when you go exploring because at the end of it you're still fighting the same mobs you fought when you started the game. I know that Elden Ring is not really comparable to Hogwarts Legacy but I do think of Elden Ring, Sekiro and basically the entire Dark Souls series as a prime example of a game having great mob variety.In my opinion, I believe that the story was okay, the quests were good and Sebastian's questline was great but the plot almost fell flat at the end and felt like it got lost somewhere. I won't spoil anything but I will say that I wish that they tried to make some things make more sense because it felt like some of the things that happened, happened ""just because"" or they happened because they didn't know how to tie the end together. It was very ""meh"" for me but maybe I just didn't understand that part very well.The gearing system felt quite boring and it feels like you don't really need to change your gear that much since mobs and bosses don't feel that difficult, even on hard mode. There was probably one boss where it felt like the gear did matter and it did make things easier but most of the time, you just have to be good at dodging and reflecting attacks but with that said the gear appearances and the outfits you can make are truly unique and, again, aesthetically pleasing. This game, for sure, does not fail at appearances.Character creation in the game was great but there's a few things that I wish to be fixed and it's the character's voice pitch. It seems that if you move the slider anywhere that's not the default pitch, they sound like a robot. Siri, for that matter but that's definitely not the end of the world. The character's facial animations seem a bit stiff depending on what face you choose when you're creating your character (a few faces go quite well with the facial expressions), I mean, the animations are not bad at all but I feel like they could be improved. Perhaps a mod will be brought out to improve these two things.Hopefully they keep adding new things and plan to make DLCs and expansions in the future because this game and the world that it's set in has so much more potential and it definitely has the ability to be greater than what it is right now.Overall, I did enjoy playing the game and the combat, for me, felt pretty good, the interactions between spells was good and it's definitely a unique playing experience fighting with a wand and flying about on broomsticks and mythical creatures, exploring the world which is, again, aesthetically pleasing to look at- really pretty world. It's probably one of the best wizard combat games out there right now and the graphics are absolutely amazing, the castle is breathtaking and the moving / talking paintings are just great to see whilst you're exploring the grounds.In short, good game but could do with adding to the mob variety. Hopeful that they will release new content through updates, DLCs and other expansions."

And the world you traverse in has a lot of stuff to do in it and lots of puzzles, though it can get a little repetitive.The story itself is.. alright. Though lacks a bit of an emotional investment in my opinion. The things that happen never really feels like it has much of a personal effect on your character, other than sensations of wonder which are aplenty. If you expect to go on an emotional journey such as in games like Last of Us, Red dead redemption 1/2 and God of War, you will get disappointed.There are one or two features they tease us about in-game but never gives us, which feels a little disappointing. I can understand they probably ran out of time/budget for it, but still...Is the game worth it, even at full price? Yes I would definitely say so. Though you might want a powerful computer."

Would like a tone more towards the movies and books.Caves/Open world areas are VERY shallow.Would like to see some power-up/enhancement based on what we choose at the end of the game and NPC dialogue changes based on what we choose.Eventually get tired of hearing the overly PG happy response.

(In the weeks before release, I was not very patient, but can you blame me?) That being said, I absolutely ADORE the game. The main story line is a little bland, but picked up interest towards the end (for me at least.) However I found love in the side missions and the companions that you get from each house (Sebastian, Poppy, Nat and Amit.) The game has several bugs and things that DESPERATELY need to be fixed. There's a quest to rescue a beast and I cannot unlock the cage since I cleared the camp beforehand and unlocked it, not knowing it would break the quest and rendering it impossible to complete. Other than the little things, I highly recommend and would purchase DLC or a second game happily. BUT ONLY IF THERE'S MORE OMINIS GAUNT <3"

5200,Sinlash,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050557722/,1,,1,99.9,February,21,70,0,1,"So after 90 hours and 100% completion here is my review. Hogwarts legacy does an unbelievable job at creating a breath taking world to explore, so many small details added to hogwarts/hogsmeade really makes this a great game to explore for anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter world. Flight with brooms and combat feels very smooth on mouse and keyboard is actually very enjoyable. Placing exploration, combat and flying aside what is wrong with the game? It feels like you are playing a movie with D list actors, the main story line does nothing to draw you in or make you really care about anyone or anything that is happening, I found myself zoning out more often than not at the INSANE amount of useless dialogue and cut scenes. The voice acting is very bland no emotion is truely shown and most of the time you just feel very disconnected to what is happening around you, I found that cut scenes with other students in normal robes and looking like a student should were just made into funny cut scenes for myself when i;m running around with glowing robes of my house on with a mask and dark arts gloves. There is no draw back at all to using unforgivable curses, it feels more like ""do I want to make this game easier?"" rather than I really shouldn't use these. Key spells to help you explore come very far into the game if you dont just focus the main quests, alohamora, flight, unforgivable curses come so late into the game that you just want to rip your hair out as you focus nothing but main quests. There is no quiditch, house points are pointless and the room of requirements is nice but the final upgrade is more of a headache then a help since you have your room setup then its all messed up with the next expanion. Things I'd say need to be worked on or added:Quiditch, faster spell accruing, Sell all function, better voice acting an a rewrite on the dialogue, interactable environment (let us sleep in our common room, sit on chairs, eat food ect), better spaced room of requirements (Give us a new room rather than extending the second one), Can we get more than just the 1 phoenix please? OCD is a thing and this angers it. Max 4 beasts is annoying and 12 slots is too few. The idle chatter you hear from students is so so so bad, two people standing/sitting next to each other having 2 completely different convos and if Deek tells me to proud of how many potions ive made imma turn hogwarts into a firing range.Things done well: World graphics are breath taking, the accuracy of Hogwarts and Hogsmead is great. Combat feels smooth and on Very Hard has just the right amount of difficulty. Flight feels great (on broom, would be better if you added free look). Side quests were decent. Immersion was a solid 6 out of 10 (again add sleeping eating sitting and better idle chatter.)Over all rating: 6.5 out of 10, this could easily be 7.5 or even 8.5 with voice acting and a story that didnt make me either laugh or want to fall asleep at how poorly it was. Is this worth a buy? Id say 100% if you're a potter fan maybe if not save your money, and I would wait till the game goes on sale. 30-40$ range."

Here are my bullet points for this game : The Good : -The story is decent ( although very linear with no choice at all , except for 1 option at the very end ) , -side quests are mostly standard stuff but they are disguised well enough to not get boring and on top of that they usually force you to explore locations where you can find interesting stuff so its all good -the side characters are very nice and their stories very fun to go through especially for Sebastian , -combat is good with all the spells and combos that you can do as you unlock more spells  and on top of that add the plants and pots and you can have varied enough combat sequences that it doesnt get boring -nostalgia is strong with this one , exploring the castle and hogsmeade along with the rest of the world is great The bad :-As is standard procedure apparently with games in recent years , tech issues are there , especially realated to graphics , for some reason when the game launched it was decent but after the day 1 patch it got much worse al least for me , so unless you have a NASA computer , expect some loading on the castle doors , some texture popins and stuff like that , if you can't deal with it , i would say wait for maybe  a month of 2 untill they stabilize this thing -Spell slots bars are not enough , since we are playing on steam all of us are on PCs here so i was hoping they would port the game in such a way that we get access to all the slots all the time not having to go through 4 different spells tabs with 4 slots on each , which by the way is still not enough , since by mid game you have way more that those bars can cover , especially if you consider the non-combat oriented ones , like lumos and the ones for beast taming modifying the room of requirement. At least for the room and beast care spells they should have a dedicated bar that pops up the moment you enter the room and is active only in there so we dont have to waste time slotting them every time we go in."

However in many ways it seems to all be pretty surface level. Dialogue choices and player agency is shallow at best and linear at worst. With no morality system, the game does not offer you the chance to truly fit into the role you decide for yourself in this RPG, and all play throughs will inevitably lead you down the same path, with very slight variation between the houses. The game functions as a pseudo wizard simulator without the depth needed to truly immerse yourself.That being said, I still think the game is fantastic and I still find myself coming back it regularly, and in my opinion if you're a fan of the series, well worth the price of admission. Hoping to see additional content added in the future, and a fix to the drops in FPS despite the running the bench marks for my PC."
5231,Dinkeist,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198089685189/,1,,1,87.9,February,21,45,0,1,"For me the first 10-20 hours of the game were the best. After that the game becomes tedious and repetitive. I guess the writer went the easy way with the script, but still they should made a darker or a deeper approach to each character development. The vibes this game gave me were unique at the beginning, especially if you somewhat saw the movies or read the books. The music keeps the game going, but like I mentioned before, after the initial hours it turns repetitive. But still fine though.Overall it is a good game, with many stuff to improve. But as a starting point for future open-world saga games it has a lot of potential. The ingredients are there; they just need to have a better acknowledgement of mission creation, dungeons/in-game rewards (treasures/chest) and script to improve substantially the work done here.Note: It´s incredible, how the studio gave an exclusive mission to PlayStation users that almost seems like a DLC, most vanilla secondary missions are plain and boring."

No spoilers, though. Also to note, I play on the PC., you don't just activate four at a time and are stuck with those four for the duration of an entire combat or mission. Lots of quality of life aspects make the game more enjoyable - like you can mount your broom from being in a lake or while in combat, and you can 'teleport' while on your broom and it'll keep you on your broom when it loads you into the next place. Loads to explore, tons of puzzles, lots of reasons/space to go back to previous places to explore more. You can   immediately and anything you get is on the table for being transmogged to immediately - and it's free. Getting money isn't arduous, buying/selling prices seem fair. You can quickly start growing your own potions, plants (combat and ingredients) and they take a reasonable amount of time (simplest potion takes 15 seconds, longest plant takes 15 minutes). There's a variety of ways to upgrade your gear and moves to hone in on your play style. Combat  are very forgiving - the automatic saves are *very* frequent. Almost never hard stuck in combat. There's one exception to this and it's very fair - you know what you're getting into - but even then it'll give back your potions and such. It also gives you kind of a ""1 HP"" moment to pop a potion before you die - no one shots. Furthermore, on death, you don't lose gear, upgrades, exp, etc. Other  are relatable, have their niches, and their story lines/quests/adventures feel productive. Not always the most rewarding in terms of gear or gold, but to be fair I'm a bit over leveled because I enjoyed exploring early so much.  itself is engaging and well thought out, the player character is ""unique"" but doesn't feel necessarily op. Lots of easter egg-like details for those who were into the books and movies and then some more who are into trivia, of course. I've never played a game or watched a movie where I was privy to those details and it's very exciting and rewarding.As far as the controversy surrounding it, I think the developers did a phenomenal job with . You have immigrants, different accents, backgrounds, family makeups, values, and a trans character who does play a decent role in the story. Normally I'm apprehensive of a game or movie pushing these ideas too hard, but none of these aspects seem forced - they just make the game more lively and characters dynamic.It's also  pretty,  wise. Lots of details and scenery and the seasons do change! There's also a space for you to customize for yourself. ^^ I wish there was more of a consequence for doing so. Some people on reddit have suggested a  system, which I think would be great.Because the game is so pretty, a way to take screenshots without your character in the way would be nice. Or if we could get our characters to pose in said shots/interact with the environment (like sitting down)?Recently, and I'm a good way into the game (with so, so much more to do still) I've been having some fps drops and freezing, mostly while in Hogwarts. Wasn't an issue until very recent, but I know some people were having this problem before. It resolves itself quickly, but until then it's nigh unplayable. Sometimes dodging feels finicky but with the 1HP grace and combat deaths being forgiving, this can be frustrating but negligible.I wish you could sell more - like stated above, inventory is very, very generous. I make my own potions and plants, however it'd be a nice to be able to sell them as well - ingredients and/or final products. Money isn't  hard to come by, but it'd be nice option."

I've been reading the Harry Potter books since the first one came out and I was around 4 years old. I saw the movies in theaters, even if I didn't like the later ones as much. When I was 11, I waited for my Hogwarts letter and I was (obviously) disappointed, even if I didn't really believe it was coming. I didn't wait for this game to come out, because I didn't want to have hype or anything affect my experience with it. I was not disappointed. Playing this game gives me a chance to live the story I always wanted to write in the Harry Potter universe, even if it takes place a while before Harry got there. I'm a huge fan of collectibles and puzzles, and I love that they fit so seamlessly into a world that already has things like ""fast travel"" (floo powder) and secret passage ways. Most of the game so far I've spent just exploring the world of Hogwarts (and beyond), just like I've always wanted to! It's also been an amazing way to escape reality, as we all so often need nowadays. I guess if any of this sounds good to you, then you should give this game a try. I'm really happy I did."

Whole game feels like a very long although generally fun tutorial, where at end of doing all that slog to get the spells you need to get into all areas and do everything, there's no longer anything much to do with all those spells you just learned.Mobs don't give xp (only challenges to kill x amount of mobs do, which once completed = no more xp from killing), chests don't respawn, so game world ends up feeling emptier and more useless than in Witcher 3 or CP 2077 etc.There's zero replayability by making a further character, everything will be exactly the same and that means doing a long slog to get viable only to end up with the empty and used up game world.So entertaining for 70 hours then it's uninstall time."

The castle is very accurate and amazing to see in the wizarding world around it. Price tag was a bit steep but defo worth all the work the company put into making this piece of art.

It's just not engaging at all and after 10 hours this game turned into something I had to force myself to play.Other things that I just cant stand are:Combat doesnt feel good, there is also no way to make it challenging.Voice acting isnt good.Controls for your flying mount are about as bad as they can be.This game is okay."

At the same time, all the many things you do not know because they are so boring give you FOMO symptoms.In the end, I just play slowly and more to complete the game then anything else.

5338,Mr.RainbowFluffUnicorn,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198301297552/,1,,1,80.6,February,20,676,0,1,"PROS- They really did Hogwarts justice with all the details and fun facts all around the place, that really made me feel like I attended a real magical school- As for gameplay, it's like any other open-world RPG, nothing revolutionary, but it's just as good as the others, so if you like the genre, you will probably enjoy this game too- I really like the variety of discoveries you can make in the world, and even within them, there are different ways to solve them without being told how to, so it gives the feeling of using your spells experimentally to see what works- It's a really nice and easy spellcasting system that allows the player to learn a variety of spells and still being able to use them fairly easily!CONS- I would have loved there to be more sidequests, and in them, more sidequests with some degree of sillyness. Since it is in the wizarding world, I think there should have been more ""my potion went wrong, and now my kneecaps are jelly, can you go out and find this plant that is the antidote?"" or helping Peeves prank some first-years. There were maybe 2 silly quests and the rest were mostly combat oriented- I would have loved there to be more kinds of potions, plants, and beasts (without even having gameplay effects), like brewing a potion that gives the player character blue skin, or big ears or whatever. Or walking around and coming across Gillyweed, and then getting a revelio page about the plants properties or what it's used for, just to learn a lot about the wizarding world and the objects therein, and to get a feeling of all the sillyness that takes place, because magic IS silly- I had hoped that the going-to-classes thing was about going to a lot of classes in game, and then evolving the characters skills in those particular subjects, and not having time to go to all classes, therefore carefully choosing which subjects to be extra good at (again giving a feel of actually going to a wizarding school, because only Hermione Granger is good at everything), of course the basics in every subject would be necessary to complete the game, and I think that part is very well executed, including the way to learn new spellsConclusionI enjoyed the game very much, it is well made and fun and it's a very beautiful open world, but I do think there are missed opportunities for making it feel more magical and experimenting, which would distinguish it from any other open-world RPG and really make it a game about the wizarding world."
5339,Hellschild,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198146024771/,1,,1,35.4,February,20,91,0,1,"This game is quite good as a Harry Potter fan and as a game in general. While the game hasn't been so split about your choices in the world as some people would have seemed to like, there are still choices to be made in how you respond to people in the game. It's by no means a perfect game, but it's quite good. As far as the graphical issues that people have been complaining about, check the date of their reviews, I had similar stuttering and frame drops that were fixed by a driver update that was released shortly after the game dropped. Otherwise, some of the best things about this game are: - Combat feels smooth and engaging, although for me the difficulty on normal could be a smidge more challenging at times as prolonged combat can become a bit slow as I wait for cooldowns, but is easily changed by upping the difficulty.- The soundtrack and the audio is beautiful and well done, feeling right at home in the wizarding world but unique from the Harry Potter series.- The little touches are nice to see, while a more reactionary NPC system would have been appreciated as well, the attention to detail in the world and the various references you can uncover are really nice for someone like me who enjoys exploring and finding those details. - The transmog system is a joy to see in a game like this where gear matters, being able to keep my character as in theme as I so choose is really nice to see, giving options for those who want immersion and those who want a more unique look.- Account linking to the wizarding world is a nice feature as well to be able to have all the things that for me have become apart of the version of me that I envision in the wizarding world, although it would be nice to be able to choose to test again for a house or my wand if I wanted to try and get different results.All in all, a good game, worth the money and to see what updates they'll give us in the future. Just ignore the hasty reviewers that didn't allow time and consideration for any day 1 patches or post launch hotfixes. My only real gripe is the inclusion of a system specific questline and I hope dearly that it becomes available to the rest of us, WITHOUT having to pay more for it."

5348,AssassinZX,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199351212402/,2,,0,48.1,February,20,11,0,0,"Pretty game but formulaic and repetitive - 6/10 overall rating. It doesn't feel like a satisfying RPG because they focused too much on cosmetic appearances and personalization features instead of taking the time to put substance behind the quests, especially the side quests feel hollow and repetitive. This game has been designed to look good on the outside but on the inside its lacking the charm and soul of actual top tier RPG/fantasy game that it should have and that should have been possible with all the world building and lore that Rowling has written. Definitely not worth the full price, wait for it to go on sale for less than half of the original price.Edit: Also wanted to update that I had no issues with performance at all and it ran smoothly without any major issues, I'm surprised at all these reports of crashes and stuttering which never was an issue for me. Running a RTX 3080 16GB laptop, Ryzen 5800H, Windows 11, connected to an LG C2 - running it at at 4K 120 fps with DLSS set to quality. Also I look forward to a player created mod where you can kill NPCs and other students with Avada Kedavra, cause this game could use a lot more violence, the PC is too goody too shoes for my personal taste even when picking the ""bad"" choices hah."

This may be an unpopular option but I don't want this game to be multiplayer i'd rather the team work on a few expansion packs or something like that maybe fill the rest of the map out.

5357,Thermal,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theonlythermal/,1,,1,39.3,February,20,185,0,1,"This one is a bit of a mixed bag for me. It's not one of my favorites, but it's a very solid game in its own right. Also I give immediate points to anything based on a big property that isn't owned by Disney, so +10 for that.So to start off with, I read all the Harry Potter books and saw all the movies when I was young. I was never a huge fan of the property, mainly because it was clear that JK Rowling had no idea about the concept of Chekhov's gun (time turners, felix felicis, etc.) That being said, I know all about the Harry Potter universe, and this game did an amazing job staying in the universe. There are subtleties in the quests and open world that are perfect tie-ins to the books and movies without shoving them in your face and just saying ""Remember Harry Potter?"". If you like the Harry Potter universe, you will love this game. Now onto the game itself, it's a puzzle collect-a-thon, but one of the better ones at that. The world is incredibly open and interesting to explore with good graphics that make it fun to go where you need and complete a puzzle to get the collectable. The puzzles did a great job staying engaging throughout the entire game, which was surprising given the vastness of it. I ran into only a couple bugs, nothing game breaking or even annoying. The facial animation is some of the most consistent I have seen in any video game. You could see emotion and it gave a depth to the characters that I really liked. The movement felt good, but what was spectacular was the flying mechanics on the broom and flying mounts. I swear, it felt like a flying simulator at some points. My frame rate and graphics seemed to increase even though I could see a great distance across the map. Overall incredibly smooth.Another sometimes overlooked thing in puzzle games or games in general is the camera angle and movement, but it always seemed like I was easily able to look at what I wanted and focus at who I wanted to cast a spell at. This game did an amazing job not making you feel like the camera is another enemy. Now what I dislike:The tone of the game is so incredibly mismatched it's bizarre. At certain points it is one of the most morbid games I have ever played, and then there's puns and the whimsical music and cute creatures running around. It was baffling to me. There's certain morbid aspects about the Harry Potter book, but generally it keeps a lighthearted tone. In this game, there's dragons eating people in front of you, the professors are talking about plants gouging a man's eyes out, you literally watch the light go out in someone's eyes close up in a cut scene, and even besides all that, literally almost every quest revolves around or involves death.Contrasting that, there's the music. It was frustrating to listen to, not because the music is bad, but simply because the entire time I was wishing it was the classic John Williams score. It is very close and they did a great job emulating the spirit of the original, but at the same time that makes the tone even more weird. I don't like listening to cheerful bells when there's someone trying to kill me and I am trying to kill them back.I mentioned there are puns as well. The first couple were okay, I thought ""huh that's kinda strange, there was a pile of human remains back there, but the pun was moderately okay"" and I chuckled to myself. And then there were like 20 more. I swear there are like 25 bad puns in the dialogue of the main story. They were all terrible and further confused me about how I was supposed to feel. This is the worst part of the game by far. Get that out of here. A lot of them were on Sebastian's questline too, so while his sister was dying you were joking around with him. I really felt nothing for him in particular other than annoyance. Most of the voice acting is good, and some of it was even great, but if I'd have known that the pitch shifting of the main character would be so blatant, I would have left it at default. It was distracting and made the possibly good voice acting of the main character terrible. Also, Simon Pegg. I love that guy, I was so excited to hear that he was in the game. Unfortunately, his character's voice was the worst. He was trying really hard to have a character but it was so clear that he had no context behind his lines because the ones that were supposed to be comedic were delivered flatly and the 'snide jokes' felt more derogatory. The whole quest where the player becomes his character is probably the worst because of this and, again, the fact that it felt lighthearted in an otherwise dour game. The combat isn't great. I'm not sure how I would fix it other than allowing more than 4 spells in one bar, but it felt restrictive. I got a headache from the monochromatic level. They wanted a unique art style, but something about it was very wrong because I got a literal, physical headache. Epileptics beware.Lastly, the final few lines of dialogue are a huge slap in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ face. Throughout the whole game there wasn't really any exploration of morals even though there was clearly the setup for it with the whole goblins v wizards fracas, which is fine because it's a video game based on a young adult book series. But then at the end of the game having one of the main characters the story has developed completely change his personality and views based on one piece of unsubstantiated evidence is just utter garbage. Completely take out that last cutscene where the player talks to Sebastian and it would be much more consistent, and not feel heavy-handed.Worth playing, but probably won't be remembered with the greats."
5358,SRBias,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198179810045/,1,,1,9.3,February,20,247,0,1,"PC gaming is not what it used to be. Gamers had to beg for the scraps of console players, and major third-party releases either came in an unplayable form or not at all. I honestly thought for the longest time in the Playstation 2 and original Xbox era that PC gaming would eventually die off. I don’t know how, but something shifted in the landscape and now everything under the sun comes to PC. While that may be glorious, and much appreciated, a disturbing trend has arisen. Most major titles today launch day and date with their console counterpart, the problem is they lack optimization and land at our feet a broken mess.   Pc gaming saw a major boom even when the graphic card market was out of control. Throw the Steam Deck into the equation, no matter your opinion on it. And the PC market is massive. More and more people are joining the ranks every day, So the question is, why do companies with their major releases let these games out in such a state? There is no reason for the stutter, frame drops, or crashing. It is unfathomable that these studios don’t have people testing this software before shipping it to the public.   I had to change ini files, and add a dll to my computer (A 5900x, and a 3090 RTX) just to keep this at a stable framerate, and minimize stuttering. That is unacceptable because Hogwarts Legacy is a wonderful game. Probably one of the best single-player RPG experiences in a long time.   Now keep in mind Hogwarts is made for a broad audience, this isn’t a game where your choices change the entire aspect of the story, and no it doesn’t have endless depth. What it does have is an extremely high production value, and a fun factor to boot. I spent countless hours zooming around on my broom finding secrets and exploring the countryside. I was finding something new upon entering every room in the school itself. The combat was very pick-up and play-friendly and I had a blast slinging spells at wolves, spiders, and poachers.   The tale it weaves kept me hooked and guessing as to where this was going to all end up. It also never overstayed its welcome. I never had the “Oh man I need this to end.” feeling that seems to haunt the back third of these types of games.   The glaring concern someone should have with this game is that Warner Brothers KNEW this was going to be a massive hit. Millions of people were going to buy this across all three platforms. There is no reason this shouldn’t have been given more care. It’s as if companies ask their employees if the console version is ready to go and when they answer yes they force them to ship.   “But what about the PC version? It is unoptimized.”   “Screw it put it out, we’ll patch it after release.”   How many times is this going to happen? The scary part about that mentality is that gamers are having to tighten their belts due to the current economic climate and when a game doesn’t sell a lot of publishers just abandon it. So it’s a crap shoot if this stuff ever gets fixed. I’m sure this will get a performance update but why do this to the consumer?   Should you buy it? If you have the knowledge to go tinkering. Then absolutely it is one of the funniest times you can have. If not, stay away until the day it is given the tender loving care it deserves.   It’s a real shame too."

We are finally able to attend Hogwarts as a student which has been a life long dream fro many. The main quest and side quest are also very interesting and fun.

5369,pykir,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pykir/,1,,1,38.9,February,20,188,0,1,"I'll leave a positive review but I have very mixed feelings about this game.First of all, if you are not a fan of Harry Potter world you probably won't enjoy this game as much as you think you could. In my opinion this game for someone without the knowladge about the lore can look like a bit of mess at the begging. That being said this game relies on the books and movies quite heavily but yet distance itself from it as much as it can (in my opinion).Talking about story... well I dont want to spoil anything so i'll say that it's just not the best. One of the side quest have better plot than the main one but at the same time all of the others side mission feel so blant and shallow that i just dropped them after first line of dialogue. The ending of the main story is also pretty disappointing with very obvious choices that in the end don't matter at all.Graphics are phenomenal, Hogwart is simply beautiful and also very detailed. Hogsmeade is very alive and also nicely done. Other locations feelt very generic to me, like if you showed me a screenshot of a dungon from this game i would have a hard time to say in which game i've already seen it.Also talking about dungeons and map for me it felt empty and it was filled with ubi style filler content like bandit camps, treasure chest or monster nests like in Witcher. It didn't really have the ""magic"" that it could be filled with.The main problem of this game was for me very weird facial expressions and overall animations. They feel very unrealistic and in a game that aims for realistic look it feels to be badly done or just left to be done on the last moment without second thought. I would compare it to Horizon Zero Dawn in this category, if you ever played HZD you know what i'm talking about."

There are hundreds of things to do if you don't want to play the main quests right away for example tons of little puzzles and challenges to do. Overall for a game that I expected to focus on a ""movie"" aspect, they blew me away with how much violence and things there are to do in the game and you aren't stuck watching cutscenes for 20 mins. Overall i give this game a solid 10/10 and i'm not even a quarter of the way done with it. I can officially say i have joined the shadow wizard money gang and we do indeed love casting spells!"

If textures and polygonality give the flower of the contemporary without overdoing it and without surpassing other productions of recent times (read, e.g., elden ring, assassin's creed valhalla, etc.) the attention to detail of an epic and magical Nordic world, a little bit inside history and a little bit fantasy, of the 1800s is truly spectacular. In the allure of a rich and compelling adventure, well supported by a splendid story line and a framework of fine graphic effects, technical aspect and gameplay, worthy of the best works of the genre, are also absolutely to be considered. A world and a story that harkens back to the harry potter saga but can thrill anyone and not necessarily just fans of anything that conforms to that kind of fantasy. Splendor!!!"

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

This will probably be the case for the majority of people playing this game and it does a fantastic job of catering to the people who ARE going to play it regardless while also offering a great experience for people who might have very little knowledge of Harry Potter games with the ability to learn about all kinds of lore. Booting up the game was super exciting (troubleshooting the performance issues ruined that), it started off incredibly strong and I was immediately invested.Exploring this iteration of Hogwarts was absolutely incredible, so much to find and do, I was having an absolute ball. Then came the next 2/3 of the game and oh boy, the childlike wonder started to wear off like Barty Crouch Jr's Polyjuice potion, gradually and in a very uncomfortable manner.I'm gonna rip the band-aid off straight away and go through the bad stuff so I can finish on the high note that I overall think this game deserves. The story was meh. I think the dialogue is what ruined it the most. In quests and side-quests, your character and the various side-characters are just repeating the same things over and over in slightly different ways as you progress through the story-lines. I appreciate the commitment to deviate from the existing Potterverse lore by introducing this theme of ancient magic and overall it definitely works but a lot of plot points just had me kinda watching the cut-scenes and spamming through dialogue like ""yeah? okay?"". Does the plot make sense? sure. Is it engaging and interesting? No. I often felt like I was trapped in dialogue cut-scenes pressing whatever answer I wanted and ending up with the exact same result which begs the question, why even give me the choice of answering in an evil manner or a good manner if I'm just going to be the hero anyway? This game stuffs SO MUCH CONTENT in but they didn't even bother to make some sort of reputation system or a slightly branching darker story-line which makes the option to choose what you do only align with what you believe and not what your character believes. You can be horrible and sarcastic to a side-quest character and then just do what they say anyway but ask for more stuff at the end, it just feels really under-utilised. Either make it a system or don't bother giving the choices.Speaking of choices, as I alluded to before there's so much stuff in the game. There is TOO MUCH stuff in this game, to the point where it's overwhelming and a chore. The map is huge, it is absolutely vast and it did not need to be that big considering you just fast travel everywhere anyway because you have to bounce between the overworld, Hogwarts and Hogsmeade so frequently for fetch side quests. Growing the plants and brewing potions, needing the spells and tomes, seeds, recipes, it's so much stuff that is just chucked at you through a side quest-line 1/3 of the way in. It should've been explained earlier on and brought through much more gradually so you could get to grips with doing one thing then learn the other thing and juggle them a bit better. It felt like I just should not bother brewing potions because I had to go grind money, buy the spellcraft, grind materials, brew the potion. It's just so tedious. I really did not bother doing that stuff and I get that it's just a preference but they could have made it a bit cheaper to buy the potions for people who'd rather just get through the game without having to do all that stuff. A minor issue would be the lack of response when you use unforgivable curses. It just kind of gets glossed over after the laughable quest where you learn Avada Kedavra. I literally laughed when the character, after EVERYTHING that just happened to him was like ""So you wanna learn to kill people too?"" and just teaches you the spell, for which there are no consequences for using.The engine is phenomenal. The developers really put the time in to make a system that is easy to pick up and you can play around with all sorts of spell combos and the game does not hold your hand to work out the puzzles, most of which just need a bit of common sense to work around. It really is a COMPLETE game (irregardless of my complaints about the scale of it) and I hope we get another one because with a bit of polish, the next one can be even better.Looks incredible. Even on low settings, the game looks amazing. It has a lot of performance issues yes, I was changing settings almost every time I played but that could definitely be my system and the game was not horribly glitchy. I had a few particle effect and audio problems but honestly, I'm never gonna sit here and say a game should have no bugs because it's always gonna happen and if they're minor, I just ignore or restart the game or wait for them to fix themselves which they often do. Irregardless, it always looked great and the atmosphere of the game was just incredible.Of course I'm biased towards a positive review because this is THE Harry Potter game, it's what I always dreamed of playing while I was playing the old EA games on Playstation. Yeah I have a lot of gripes with it but I feel like I have to give credit where it's due because although the execution is a little bit clumsy, you can really feel the effort put into the game, I really enjoyed playing it and even when I wasn't having fun, I'd take a little break and come back to it and I'm having fun again in no time. I want to try and 100% this and I may amend my review after that if I discover I was just playing it wrong or whatever but I feel like I've been more than fair.If you're a Potter fan, you will enjoy this game, it's fantastic. But depending on your tolerance for what I mentioned in the bad section, you might have to grit your teeth through some of it"

Fantastic setting that provides players the opportunity to finally getting as close as you're gonna get to being a Hogwarts student and experience life as a witch or wizard. But as far as RPG games go, it's incredibly weak, boring, and unoriginal. The passion from the devs is evident, but it falls flat when you consider it's just another game with choices that have absolutely no impact on the outcome of the story, unnecessary and monotonous dialogue, needlessly large map, and senseless quests and activities that only serve as filler content.The PC version is poorly optimized. I have a decent enough rig (3070, i7-11800H, 16GB RAM, 2TB SSD) on which this game shouldn't have trouble running, but the stuttering and framerate drops are ridiculous regardless of the settings I change or use. Hardly does the game ever run at a consistent 60fps. I understand that under 60 for many is playable but I personally hate it. We live in a world where the industry-standard is 60fps and has been for years. Call me spoiled, I don't care, but I shouldn't have to resort to fiddling with settings going as far as to significantly reducing the visual experience because the devs did a ♥♥♥♥ job at optimization."

5452,InfinityTriceps,https://steamcommunity.com/id/InfinityTriceps/,1,,1,64.8,February,20,102,0,1,"The game is not bad at all, however as much as I tried to LOVE the game, after having 50hrs on steam (says 37h on my save) on hardest difficulty, and almost 100% completed, I couldn't go above the: ""the game is okay"" feeling...Like every game, this one has it's negatives and positives. I'll start with the negatives:- Firstly, the developers stated that there will be from 30-35 hours if gameplay. I did not find this to be true.With A LOT of exploring, looking for fast travel points, field guide pages, and doing a hefty amount of side missions, it took me 23h to finish the story. I imagine i will need 5-10h to 100% the game.- The story is okay, nothing special having the whole Harry Potter universe in mind, but it covers up some of the plot holes from the movie.- The final boss was tedious in my opinion. Not saying it needs to be complex, but it didn't feel like it had any variety, just one simple gimmick.- Exploration is fun, HOWEVER, if you are looking to 100% the game, exploring anything outside Hogwarts can and will get boring. The scene of empty fields with some ruined castles here and there will make you just go to the map and mark where you need to go next, just so you can finish the area.- Having to do the same Merlin trials over and over again gets old real fast. - I found myself using one outfit, because other outfits felt goofy and out of place for a student.- I wish the game made you attend classes so you feel more like a student, but I do realize that developers immediately said that that's not the direction they want to go.- Finally, you can be a total jerk in the game, but for the most part, your decisions don't feel like they influence anything in the game that much, apart from few exceptions.-----Now before I continue with the positives, I just wan't to point out that this is just my opinion and what seems boring to me might be something good in someone else's eyes.-----The positives:- I LOVED exploring Hogwarts! Finding new rooms and spontaneously doing something random because I felt like it, felt being in one of the movies, especially when coming across some recognizable rooms and areas.- One of my favorite things about the game was learning and using spells. I couldn't wait for a new quest with a new spell at the bottom to pop up. I wish there were more spells, but I realize it would be overwhelming to choose which one too put in the spell selection and use.- Very fun using different spell combos.- Flying is very fun for me, also waiting for the upgrades, however, the races could've been better by being more intense and having actual npc's there- Connecting the quiz to the game was a great idea, and I recommend doing it for the immersion.So overall, the game is not bad, but not mind-blowing amazing either... I'm at the point where I feel like i'm forcing my self to 100% the game, just to justify giving 60 euros for it, which isn't a small amount of money.I do not regret preordering the game, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't mind waiting for the discount.Again, just my opinion, someone might feel about the game differently.As a HP fan, and someone who's been playing games for a long long time, it saddens me that (for me) it's not THAT impressive."

I mean, a LOT of things- If you like the franchise it will be a dream coming true- A LOT of collectables (if you like it, it's good)- You can get really OP if you explore a lot, which makes the game really easy even on hard mode (I killed last boss with 3ish skills). The world does scale with your level, but that isn't enough since you can have a lot of side progression like - Main Story is cliché (well, it's harry potter after all, it works tho). I liked the  more than the main story haha- The enemies are the same everywhere- Some things related to the unforgivable curses doesn't make sense: you can use them in front of all the professors without any consequences- Your choices don't really affect anything for the most part - Technical issues on pc.

I love to explore any open world game I play to seek out hidden areas or secret passage ways and this game certainly delivers on that! There are so many different aspects of this game to explore! I certainly think I can get at least a solid 100 hours of enjoyment out of this game or more as there are so many puzzles - which I find are just challenging enough to keep you at it for a while - and areas to utilise like the quiditch pitch and the other mini games that are spread out around Hogwarts. The only thing that would make this better is if there was a separate online world where you could explore, solve puzzles and fight other wizards with your friends.

In terms of music, the soundtrack for this game is amazing, and really gives a lot to the atmosphere of the game, in addition to a lot of classical pieces being included whilst venturing around the Hogwarts castle.If there is one thing that I could truly fault the game with beyond some performance issues, is the facial expressions of some of the characters throughout the game. It can be often confusing and hilarious to see a character being full blown upset, and then it gets to the end of their 'scene' and the facial expression just defaults back to blank. It really takes away from the feeling, and immersion within the world, and could have done with a bit of refinement to make this better.Overall though, I would highly recommend this to anyone, and for a AAA game of recent times has shown how lax other developers have become when it comes to releasing new games when a smaller/lesser known company like Avalance can release a mostly polished game, this is enjoyable the whole way through.10/10"

If you JUST want to experience the main story, maybe buy it on discount.a bit lack luster on RPG elements. would say its more of an action-rpg that lets you ""live"" its story, not so much shape your own. for example: no consequences really for decisions and stuff. replayability is also low due to this. house is just an ""accent"" to the game - doesn't really define anything. i hope we will get dlcs with a focus on story telling and questlines. because that is what the game did really well imo and could've used more of to make it more memorable. regarding performance:was able to run it with an 8 year old system and a 970. which honestly.. had no buisness in running that game. played for 40h until my upgrade to a 3060 was possible. finished the game on that, ran decently enough on 60fps :)"

I've grinded every multiplayer game under the sun since then though. Somehow this game has captured me in ways that I've forgotten about. There's a few things I wish they did better. The progression from a no-name wizard to a Hogwarts student could've been better. You're inserted as a 5th year which really takes away from the wonder and world-building in my opinion. I wish there were ways to speed up repeatability, beginner quests kinda stink doing them more than once. Just wish there were more unique questlines for each House.

Better than Magical Beasts and on-par with Harry Potter. Should have been its own movie as it made you feel like you were in the magical world we all love. What a ride..Graphics: Nothing amazing, but had a great tone and ambiance about it. Combined with the fantastic musical score it really added to the immersion of the Harry Potter world.Gameplay: Was a really unique experience with some minor flaws but nothing that can't be improved upon in the future. I would liken it to Assassins Creed: Odyssey. The open world, the numerous quests and side adventures really made you feel like you could do what you want when you want all in the setting of Harry Potter.Combat: This is almost my favorite part about the game (behind the story line). It really allows you to play the style you want and exploring different ways to kill your enemies is endlessly satisfying.

It's one of the best realized translations of a fantasy world into a game I think I've ever seen. It's really an incredible game in terms of quality.If you had a positive experience with Harry Potter in your youth I hope you experience the immense whimsy I did as you walk through the wildly diverse, expertly crafted, and seemingly endless smorgasbord of discoverables in hogwarts - or when gliding in and out of the canopy of the gorgeously spooky forbidden forest.The story is fine, but nothing mind blowing. There's a loooot of stuff, and most of that stuff is pretty shallow. I think I've seen ""wide and shallow"" as a decent explanation of most of the content. I enjoyed the combat thoroughly and, despite not having a massive pool of enemies, I never grew tired of my opponents.I mean, forgive the pun, it's a magical ~50 hours of fun.If you don't like Harry Potter, or fantastic beasts, it's probably a pass."

There is a lot to enjoy here but there is just enough issues that I can't recommend it. If you have a really strong computer and want to explore hogwarts then it might be worth it. But even with a high end pc you'll likely encounter some performance issues. For reference I'm running a nvidia 3060 and on all low graphical settings there is lots of stuttering and textures take ages to fully render. Enemy variation is fairly boring, most of the locations outside of the school and hogsmead just feel generic. Most every tunnel, spider nest, mongrel lair, bandit camp, goblin camp all feel the same as every other location of their type. If you're looking for 100% completion then expect hours of walking around aimlessly casting revelio hundreds of times just to pick up around 200 field guide pages, or spend hours walking around at night to find demiguise statues. They promise a lot with this game, but its a lot of the same. I know I just ripped into the game for a lot, but once they make some fixes to the performance I'd say this would be a pretty solid game with some interesting mechanics and story. My only other gripe is that they have a lot of characters who you maybe do a side quest or two with, and then they don't matter at all."

I've never really cared for the Harry Potter franchise so when I bought it, I wasnt expecting to care too much about the story. The story had other plans. I found myself captivated by the story and the unique characters. Combat can be a bit stale at times but there are plenty of spells to choose from. There are a ton of different collectibles to get and puzzles to solve. Overall, this is one of the better games i've played recently. There are a few problems that need solving on PC. I ran into some pretty heinous frame drops a few times and i managed to glitch and inadvertently soft-lock the game a few times(Saving and reloading fixed it). This game is a solid 9/10.

Its very beautiful and there is a lot to explore and do in the game. But there are several issues with it.1) The game is heavily front loaded. The first day I got the game, I reached level 20 pretty quickly and outpaced the story level for the game. In the week following, I have only reached level 33. Level only really effects the gear you can equip, but at least to me it makes the pacing seem really poor.2) The consequences to the choices you make are nothing more than surface level. Cast an Unforgivable Curse in front of a teacher? You get scolded. Disagree with an NPC? Well they will get mad at you for your choices, but we can't stop the story so they will still give you the next quest. There are ways to cut off stories and quests, but that is by not doing the quests before a time skip."

But so far, it's basically the game I waited my whole childhood to play. I'm loving the mechanics, the scenery is beautiful and full of nostalgia, the characters are interesting and well-written, the story is keeping me on the edge of the seat. As a minority, I feel well-represented and find that I can identify with some of the main cast for once too, which is pretty nice. You can tell the developers put their heart and soul into this - cannot recommend enough."
5550,Tyl*,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kelphumin/,1,,1,79.6,February,19,300,0,1,"This review comes from the perspective of someone whoa) not only grew up with the Wizardarding World, but grew up  with itandb) is a super harsh - PC race master race only - game critique.Personally I generally prefer more colorful, vivid, fantastical styles and dislike things the more it goes towards ""realism"".With that said, it's ok für the franchise I believe, but for some reason I find the characters seem to be off a different ""quality"" than the creatures or the world. Like someone pasted a low res picture on a 4k wallpaper or something - can't really pinpoint why I get that feeling.The same kind of non-cohesiveness I've observed in all kinds of animations. While combat animations seemed fine, all other character animations - especially expressions are rather horrible and cheap. Meanwhile all these little details, of moving objects and ghosts and what not, (that have no ""use"" but are just for world building) were really super good.First the Music: I am a person that can be moved by animations and music. Wizarding World fans will recognize all the music, as they are altered versions of movie soundtracks. I like them very much!The Audio design was ok, tho one combat effect when having a certain trait active gets super loud somehow.As I had to play it in english (see UI Section), I only know those VO. It was terrible. Not only the Voice Acting (which ofc not only VA but also voice directors etc are involved), but also the script.A lot of lines are said waaay too often (for example Floo Teleporting woman, or Revelion, cuz one (or me) lit. spams this all the time. Even my stream audience got tired of it. [More on this in UI section]I can assure everyone, I have a more than enough machine to play this game on max settings (which is btw also recommended to me) and I also usually had NO problems at all playing on it. But usually at around 4h playtime, it started to have SEVERE input lag (sometimes a key Input would only play out 3-4min later!). Something like that is an absolute no go, and it made it feel scammy, especially if it was interfering with the early access.Horrible. I super appreciate that there is such detailed Key Mapping, but sadly it makes no sense in some parts, and is brilliant in others. The UI as well as controls make it an obvious console game, which I super hate. While it is a better port than most of the games - it also doesn't make it good. I hate how console games are unable to have menus and windows open and overlaid everywhere. And the always the same repeating, non cancelable animations (for example opening Map) doesn't make it less annoying.Examples of these are: Flying - it is super clunky and unintuitive. There are lit. preset Keys that let's one set mouse up/down movement as a key! But why is it not set like that for flying? Also the key behavior from broom and flying mounts are different, even though it uses the same set of key settings.There are ""Treasure Maps"" we have to figure out, but we are unable to ♥♥♥♥♥ having them side by side with the map.Based on Steam Languages, there are some Audio Languages available and even more UI languages. But they areOnly changeable through steam itself, rather than the gameNot separated by UI and AudioWhich is a super huge nogo for me. I prefer playing my games in English, but have different VO, but that was not possible.It was also not possible to adjust Volume individually (by characters for example) and weirdly the characters voice lines did not count as ""voice"". So turning down voices was only for dialogues. Aka it was all a super mess.Again attributing to mostly it being a console game: A lot of things had to be done individually, there was no option for bulk actions (such as selling, buying, destroying, upgrading etc) and again common for console games, loooots of clicks necessary to do the ""UI gameplay"" (for example upgrading gear is UI gameplay) or get to certain menus.Aside from all the controls and UI shiz, the actual game system and mechanics are actually quite nice and varied. There is a lot of stuff to do, which is not only combat (like in a lot of games). But again I have to deduct points heavily. While there are a lot of different things, it feels like all the things are there only on a basic level. As if all was a prototype, not fleshed out or refined or anything.For example:There is swimming, but it's barely used and nothing special. Might as well not be there.It's ""open world"" but there are a lot of instances and also things like ""jumping over"" and ""climbing"" and even flying, are only possible where it is intended to be. So feels more like a weird hybrid of non open world and open world (depending on the definition). It's quite frustrating to sometimes be able to do something, and doing the same thing in another location doesn't work. And then one gets stuck on the third thing, by not trying the same thing again, because this is where one actually has to use that thing. It all seems super arbitrary.There is catching creatures and breeding, but the babies don't ever grow up.There is flying, but no quidditch.There are classes, but only based on quest, no ""School System"" (like for example some Dating Sims do it, to learn and improve skills)All the things seem to be in baby shoes and have so much potential and I could mention a million things on how the feats could be extended and improved upon.That said I have to give a huge plus point. I am someone who tries to avoid action combat games (specifically RPG) due to finding their combat boring usually. This is the first and only game EVER so far with action combat, in which I've really enjoyed the combat! (I also include the sneaky stuff in this)The story is super generic and superficial in my opinion. One gets just thrown into the ""you are the chosen one, even if u blacken a little bit, u are still the good one vs the bad guys - final boss fight"" also the known harry Potter Formula of ""Everyone who is some kind of adult/father/guardian figure is dead/dies""I prolly dislike every single character except for Sebastian. I don't know what it is, most of them seem annoying, those who aren't are boring and just… not likable to me.The details of Hogwarts are amazing and the world is also pretty (tho super plain repetitive, but I blame the setting/location for that). But the world is waaay to empty. No matter if day or night, Hogwarts or not. All seems empty. There seem to be more animals and ""enemy"" humans than NPC everywhere.All in all the most interesting part out of all of it, except for getting to explore hogwarts a bit, to me, was prolly the slight touching of the ""Blackening"" topic and also ""morally gray"" areas (such as using dark arts for the right things etc)But the same as with the Mechanics, one can see here clearly, that it seems superficial and unrefined all over. Which I find sad.With that said, I in fact do have a mile long list of complaints of this game and I realize a lot of it are things others might not be bothered by. I recommend this game to those who:like playing RPGlike RPG but are looking for a refreshing combat style and more variety in activities (more than combat and story)are into Wizarding World"

In many ways this feels like an adventure game with RPG elements with conversation choices doing little to affect anything beyond the 'in-passing' comments made by NPCs.I would like to see a morality system introduced in future instalments.

This game is a true work of art that transports you to the magical world of Harry Potter like never before. The level of detail and love that the developers put into crafting this world is absurd. The castle is massive and incredibly faithful to the original, and exploring it never gets old. The world outside of the castle is even more expansive, with different villages and hidden secrets that you can discover at every turn. I never felt forced to explore, but I was always encouraged to do so.The gameplay is fantastic, combat is satisfying and the spells you can use are varied and fun to experiment with. It would have been nice if there were more enemy types, but each one has its own unique weakness that you can exploit. There's not much customization when it comes to your character, but the gear you can equip is well-designed and can be augmented for specific situations.The story is intriguing and the sense of urgency is balanced perfectly with the need to explore and master ancient magic. The sidequests are also a lot of fun, and the game introduces collectibles and puzzles at a good pace. The game also has other great features like flying, a customizable Room of Requirement, and the ability to catch your own beasts."

I found most of the story just okay, it was enough to keep me playing but if you were to follow the main story as a top priority you would find that there isn't a lot of fights to be had.The side content was mainly just fetch quests that would have you going from A to B releasing peoples pets from poachers, the relationship side quest that have you going to the same character to get quest were a little more in depth and were only a bit more enjoyable as they had more combat encounters, one relationship quest line giving you the unforgivable curses was nice and also very handy for blazing through combat if it were to ever get to hard. Getting the 100% was by far the worst thing I could have gone for as you had to complete the collection which got very boring very quickly and half the time having to google where the last item is that you need or the final side quest that you found out was a note from a cave you completed near the start of the game and didn't show on the map because it was underground. The puzzles in some of the caves and the ones in hogwarts were very fun and had you thinking a lot to get some of them done, at least I did because I'm a smooth brain.TLDR; A good game to play because the combat is really engaging, story is there but dont expect to be completely captivated by it. One shotting bosses with avada was fun but took away from the challenge."

At the moment I have about 76 hours in and I have 3 main quests left and I'm loving every minute of it. Only cons I have with it so far is:- Performance still needs to TLC- No Quidditch- No online co-op- Would love more options for customizing characters face - Allow the ability to lock the mini-map so that it stays with North being on top10/10 aside from those minor things."

The combat is very pretty, but lacks challenge beyond trying to gain a higher combo which is fine. The main complaint is the stuttering which is just unbelievable at times.

The talent points and flying class had me doing flips HAHAAA, it does get easier to combat as you play if you keep practicing, it took me a second to get good at it but if you develop techniques and practice, it won't be so hard. Using potions and plants is also good practice, and it makes for more effective gameplay. I still have so much to explore, but I also like that if you sell an item of clothing, you can still switch your character's appearance to that, because you can use what you have found.

The way that the game slowly builds your character through the main story is well paced and doesn't over-power you instantly. You actually have to play the game and explore if you want to get better spells/gear etc. Graphics are phenomenal, best I've seen in a while this year so far (apart from the NPCs).The only drawbacks are that the game doesn't utilise the GPU, sometimes crashes (for me, a lot during launching the game), and needs to be run on high-spec systems installed onto an SSD to be run properly.After some optimisation and other patches to fix FPS issues, it's easy to look past the ugly.

That's usually how it goes with open world games for me! Anyways, this game is pretty great. Surprisingly deep combat, huge map to explore, and there's little lore tidbits scattered throughout the world that really help to deepen the Wizarding World and immerse you in it. So far the story is really intriguing and the characters within are interesting enough to actually care for them a bit. The world is georgeous!That said, I do wish the enemy diversity was a bit deeper, and that the keybindings for the combat a bit more complex - being limited to four spells with the controller and having to switch ""pages"" on the directional pad is a bit cumbersome. I'd prefer if I could use the left trigger as an alternate spellbinding key as well. I have yet to play with a MKB setup (I prefer controller for these types of games). I'm also having a helluva time getting the game to perform at a constant framerate right now, with major stutters being very common. It may have something to do with the fact that I'm only running 16GB of RAM, and the RAM usage is constantly at 100% when running this game - I believe you need well and above that amount to run it properly, so might be time for me to drop in a couple more GBs worth.A solid game so far, and I'm very happy to NOT have to resort to a cheap ""pay to win"" mobile game for some Harry Potter gaming excellence."

There's your character saying ""There's trouble brewing and I'm without my friends"" and NPCs saying you should ""come pick them up if you need help"", which hints for a trashed companion system.That said, the game is still a knockout, I cannot imagine how good this game will be in around 2 years when modders perfect all the rough edges it has, it's going to be such an amazing experience.But like every game, in Brazil, it costs R$ 99999999999,99 like every game that's launched recently.

5669,Sleepless Owl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HerrOwl/,1,,0,33.7,February,18,105,0,1,"Let me start off by saying that the reason I cannot recommend that anyone buys this game right now is to do with techincal issues, not the game itself.I believe that if you enjoy the harry potter universe, this game is 100% for you. If you however have no connection to this universe then you should probably stay away because without that, the game is very mid. The combat is great and amazingly fun but occurs a bit too rarely and even on hard is not that challenging. The side quests are a mixed bag. Sometimes you follow a treasure map, sometimes its ""find x amount of y item"". I personally enjoy the dialog, and the dialog options for your character are very reminiciant of the witcher 3 style of dialog. Youre character drives the story with the others largely by themselves but you have the ability to imprint a personality on them through minor choices (perhaps there are larger choices that I am not aware of yet, but enough said with ""its like the witcher 3""). I think the characters are well written, fun and  interesting to interact with, and fill the world quite nicely. The game world is beautiful if you can get it to run at that setting (more on that in a moment), and the overall design is actually really pretty and conveys a magical feeling really well. The animations for combat do the same. All the spells feel powerful or cool to cast. Heres is the reason I cannot recommend the game: My PC exceeds the recommended specs by a lot. I am running this game with a radeon rx 6700 xt and a ryzen 5 processor. This should be more than enough to run this game on high, if not ultra quality settings and my rig can do that for many other games of similar calibar (elden ring comes to mind, which I can run the highest settings while getting over 100 fps). This game is so poorly optimized for PC that my rig struggles to run the game on medium settings without stuttering frequently. This is the main problem and I assume that this will be fixed in the near future, and once it is, this is an okay game. But as of right now (and from what I am seeing in other reviews, many people share this sentiment or are having similar issues) this stuttering even on medium settings has a signifcant impact on the game and I cannot imagine that you can even properly run the game on the minimum graphical settings with the specs they recommend on the steam page. If you have a $3000 PC, youre probably good to go, but anything less than $2k and youre not running it at any decent graphical quality, if at all.There are also lesser issues such as lighting bugs (but how much something like that bothers you is ultimately up to you).As it stands at the moment, this is a pathetic effort at a port and it's sad to see so many people being okay with having ♥♥♥♥ on a plate served to them."

The controls for flying are bad tho... like really bad, but it only slightly matters to the game/story so it's ok I guess.  If you are just going from point a to b or sightseeing its fine.

Everything looks gorgeous, lots of details to behold and generally a beautiful game. The combat mechanics are great, I really love learning new spells and every spell has it's own use and benefits in certain situations. One thing I like the most is how this game makes sure that you stick around and just explore and lets you find about certain things by yourself.You can explore almost ""everywhere"" and ""anywhere"" you come across or see in the map.The riddles and puzzles are great, lets say some of them may take a minute or two to figure out.I love the customization, though the hairs could do some work but overall, great customization.

Nothing too sensational when it comes to questing nor the main storyline, but entertaining enough.Grind is very satisfying and brings you goodies after you collect stuff.I am still to finish some of the collections, but overall I've done close to 90%.I do think some balancing should be done around the end game area, as not a lot of adventuring/exploring is given by the game itself. It's all up to you. You can fly through it and deal with the main quests or force yourself to go on foot and explore. I think some tweaking can be done there to include more side quests next to the main ones to introduce this area properly and explore through it.I'm thron between 7 and 8 outta 10 here.BUT due to the game looking really crispy and running really smoothly on release day without any issues - I'll give it 8/10."

Detail orientated (whispering spells when in stealth mode) and exquisite scenery. There is so much to do and new areas to explore. The PC version has its hiccups but nothing that ruins the overall experience. The one complaint I have is the flying mechanics. For open world its fine but when completing flying trials where you have to be more precise, its a nightmare. I use an Xbox one remote where you use one joystick to fly up or down and the other joystick for left and right steering. Even playing with the controller and camera sensitivity/acceleration settings, I still have problems with missing targeted rings etc. That is my biggest gripe. Everything else 10/10. Can't wait for DLC content!"

You will quickly lose yourself in the game,  the music, the story, the open world and everything else. Now the game still has room for improvements some of which I figure will be added and addressed in future updates and  DLC/Expansions. Like  more spells locations and so on the possibilities are nearly endless. Now a few cons. Controls, you only get 3rd person over right shoulder view/control of your character. adding a first person viewing and controlling option would only add to the game. Furthermore better controls and handling of flying would be a better but the controls  feels clumsy and clunky.  so in closing, a solid 9 out of 10, So get it and settle in for an adventure (WARNING-PLAYERS MAY EXPERIENCE LOSS OF TIME AND GET  URGE TO PUT ON HARRY POTTER GLASSES AND WIZARDS GARMENTS AND NERD OUT) Enjoy"

A Potterhead’s wet dream made manifest.- Varied and satisfying combat system that constantly opens up new opportunities as you learn more spells, and stays fresh, engaging in the long run.- Excellent customization possibilities, featuring a myriad of cosmetics and skins, other than your very own customizable ‘base’ to furnish by hand at leisure.- Exciting progression that portrays your growth as a wizard (or witch) rather well, giving you new tools and utilities to access previously-locked content and areas.- Solid roster of side characters; most of them are likable / unique enough, and incredibly, their writing isn’t complete garbage - kudos to that.- Excessively repetitive open-world activities in the long run, that create bloat and annoyance for those who want to complete all side activities.- Combat balance issues with potions, ‘healing spam’ and unforgivable curses: especially when upgraded they prove overpowered and make most fights quite too easy.- Most named foes and quest bosses (but not all) are just normal enemies on steroids, that don’t vary in mechanics and don’t have unique behaviors.- Some inconsistencies with lore and character behavior. Example: if you use unforgivable curses in public or during quests (with witnesses), nobody will give a damn.- Underwhelming finale that doesn’t really reflect the importance of what you accomplished, and doesn’t give any detail about how your actions influenced other characters afterwards.🟨 Bugs & Issues🔧 Specs- Significant frame-drops inside Hogwarts when transitioning between different sections, and also in specific places throughout the castle, regardless of settings.- In some cases, fall damage doesn’t register on enemies.- 3900X- 2080Ti- 32GB RAM- SSD- 1440pContent & Replay Value:It took me 82 hours to complete Hogwarts Legacy, taking considerable extra time to clear all optional content and find around 90% of collectibles / secrets on Hard difficulty. I don’t see a reason to replay the game once finished, except achievement hunting, as the content is linear.Is it worth buying?Yes, especially if you’re a fan of the saga. This amount of content and quality are more than fair for the proposed 60€ price, expected from an AAA release.Verdict: GoodRating Chart HereBy far the best game ever made based on this franchise, but not a masterpiece by any means. Fans of the series will almost certainly like it, but it’s still drawn back by its issues.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews  & WritingHogwarts Legacy takes place in the iconic Wizarding World setting created by J.K. Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s.The main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.Exploration, Collectibles & SecretsThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles.Most dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long  System & BossesMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects.Combat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.Quests, Minigames & ChallengesQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure.Challenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort."

Fortunately that hasn't happened here. I also deeply resent games that are frustrating or 'fake' the experience that you're getting. That too, doesn't happen here.You succeed or fail, based on your merits. If you do stupid things, the game tends to be quite forgiving, even at normal difficulty, but if you really use your brains, respond quickly and properly, combat is truly engaging.The environment is very well done and exudes that Harry Potter atmosphere, everywhere. Consequently, I have to say that this game has lived up to my expectations. Gameplay, sound design, animations, performance, story, all are of pretty high pedigree. This is one of those games I can play for hours and not 'grind', but explore while also getting better at the core mechanics all the time. And that's a great experience."

There are areas around the over-world that feel directly ripped from the movies! (a few that immediately comes to mind is the lake in the forbidden forest where harry casts his patronus, and the snake on the taps in moaning myrtles bathroom).Positives: - Casting spells is fun, I love how fluid it all seems- Gorgeous over-world that feels alive and very atmospheric depending on location- Side quests don't feel tedious even in the end game- Love the little quips from foes depending on what you've been up to both in and out of the main story- The map for the over-world works really well with the 3D design, little landmarks here and there make it easy to get to grips where to go- I love eavesdropping on foes before engaging in combat, the goblin banter is hilarious- there isn't much of a grind. I haven't found that I've been under-levelled at any point in the game- an absolutely amazing soundtrack, really adds to the whole experienceNegatives:- The 3D map of Hogwarts is too simplistic, it works for the over-world, but not so much here. Too many times I've aimed for a certain room when hunting down the field guide pages, and wound up in the ass end of nowhere- Unfortunately my game has been buggier than most. Astronomy tables randomly work (have double checked if its night), collection counter fails to update reliably, I've had NPCs and items fall halfway through the floor, and my character has also fallen through the floor in Hogwarts after running through a door a little too fast. All in all it hasn't really ruined game play, but after so many instances, it is noticeable. (though i wont argue with the eyeball chests bugging out and letting me loot twice!) ;)- the sound balancing is a bit off, one example i can think of is that characters tend to get drowned out by the floo network ladyWishes:- For a castle as big as Hogwarts, we would really benefit from a floor by floor map for ease of exploration- It would be nice to see the full outfit when previewing in the clothing store - for the completionists out there, a little check mark for outfits already obtained in the stores, animals already bred, and for enemies killed with ancient magic would go a long way. Pretty much just extra tracking for anything that might have an achievement connected to it would be lovely- To be blunt, I have a rather lousy memory. Numerous times I've switched to the wrong hotbar mid fight for that one spell. Increasing the visible spells to 8 even if you drop the overall no. of bars down to 2 would be great (though that might just be a me thing)"

I find reviews to be more useful to me when they point out what was less than ideal/not enjoyable, so that I may decide if I can live with those shortcomings.Review:The game requires you to open and close various menus in order to do many things. For example, when you equip a new piece of gear and change it's cosmetic view, after equipping that said piece of gear, you need to go back to the inventory menu and enter to change it's cosmetic instead of allowing you to change it's cosmetic directly through the slot menu. Or in order to upgrade your gear, you need to select the item, enter one menu to upgrade your stats, and then you need to again select the same item and enter the other menu to add attributes, instead of just allowing you to select the item, have one button to increase stats, and another to add attributes, without deselecting the item itself.There are not enough quests in the game to make you reach max level, meaning you are forced to do Merlin Trials, Pop Balloons, etc, in order to get to max level. There is no optional boss/challenge that promotes you to level up and gear up, a challenge for higher levels. The max level is there just as a ""complete checkmark"" on your To-Do list without any additional incentive.Ever since you start the game and you see the spell list, everyone eyes their locked spells, specially the Unforgivable Curses. But in my experience, by the time you unlock them, you don't get anything out of them. They are not as powerful/useful as you thought they would be, with the exception of the Crucio curse.It personally annoyed me that the game the Revelio spell, which is a spell that allows you to find things, ""dings"" when it reveals field pages inside of a lock you cannot open at that moment. You have no way of knowing if that field page is inside the locked door, or somewhere you missed a spot. Unless you have the capacity to enter a place, the game should not ""ding"" in such situations.Finally, this might not be true when you read this review, due to patches, but the volume in this game was completely out of sync. Story Cinematics had their own volume, ignoring my volume controls. Gameplay Cinematics had certain sounds muffled like grunts or screams, while others, like blasts and explosions are sometimes very loud or very quiet. Sometimes the music would just end and you would be playing in silence. Also, you would be receiving owl messages as you finish a quest and are listening to the end dialogue between the characters, meaning you would be hearing the owl message and the quest dialogue at the same time. I believe those things will get fixed in the future."

Almost every fight/search/gather feels the same .- Your spells don`t rly change , you don`t ""learn"" nothing from using them , swish - swash congrats you know the spell , no matter if you use it 1000 times or 1~3 its still the same , so RPG elements are out of the door .- Story - absent , like meybe 10-15 minute read , or 5 minute narrate. Totally shallow.- Choices .. oh boy ,... NONE ! (ok , right you can choose to learn/use the unforgettables but NOTHING CHANGES ! ) , you can be a bastard , or a goody two shoes but in the end every quest has the  same end , every cut-scene , just the voice-over is different in it and that`s that - Probably close to 0 , or worse , replay value , i started new game in different house , 30 min         in i was bored AF .Conclusion:    The price tag for such an experience is too much .It's just not worth it .

But after playing it, and expecting not too much, I can safely say this is one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had, especially in a single player game.The world design, graphics, puzzles, story, voice acting, music all gets a 10/10, this game is a fantastic game. Obviously no game is the perfect masterpiece, and my only negative things to say would be PC optimisation, lack of originality in cosmetics, lack of interaction between NPCs, objects, food, non interactive buildings while in the vivariums and lack of customisation in room of requirement.But! These do not at all take away from the game, story or fun you can have in this amazing world. I was absolutely surprised by the insane amount of detail everywhere, the staircase creating itself as you walk up it in hogwarts, the puzzles that lead to secret rooms, being able to fly almost everywhere. When the game runs without lagging, it is so smooth, magical and breath taking."

I really love the world, it's gorgeous and you can explore anywhere you want. Don't really pay attention to the music, but it compliment the game atmosphere perfectly. The combat is really good. I never play a bad character on a game before, but here since they give us the option to use the 3 unforgivable curses I just couldn't resist. It's basically like other WB's game, attack and parry with combos, but the spells and the flourish when casting it makes it special. Now the story is the weakest part of the game in my opinion. They don't really show the bad guys nor tell what is their motivation behind why they are doing what they are doing. It's a shame really, and could be more flashed out more. The side quest with other Hogwarts student are more engaging and interesting. What I'm disappointed at is that it feels like they kinda push an agenda for LGBT. If you play it you'll know what I'm talking about. Where I come from, this kind of ♥♥♥♥ is whack, and take me out of an authentic 19th century wizarding world experience.Overall very good game and you should play it8.5/10P.S Don't shy away from the dark arts, it one of the reason this game is so good"

Using unforgivable curses are foreshadowed the entire game as UNFORGIVING and yet I can cast all three of them in succession and avada kadavra 5 people at once in front of teachers and they'll compliment me for my achievement....Your actions don't have consequences, you can either be overly nice or a ♥♥♥♥ to people and no matter how much of a ♥♥♥♥ you are people will end up adoring you. That's the entire evil/good part of the game.The voice acting is at points so horrendous that I ended up not really caring for all the sidequests anymore.There are WAY TOO MANY puzzles that don't feel worth doing and are just repetitive chores.There are no new spells made for this game, there is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ quidditch (NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ QUIDDITCH??!?!?! REALLY?!?), there is no morality system, there are only a few plants and potions to craft. The main story is just a same old ''chosen one'' story and doesn't really do anything to stand out. Overall the game just seems to not live up to it's potential and feels like the developers just tried to play it as safe as possible....Despite all of this (and forcing myself through the last 3 main quests of the game) I still manage to enjoy the game, nothing beats flying around on a broom or managing to chain avada kadavra to multiple enemies at once. Playing the game just keeps reminding me of all the potential the game had and that makes me sad."

Avalanche Software has done it — the comfort, the nostalgia, the freshness, the thrill — everything in Hogwarts Legacy emulsifies together to create a celebration of what the Wizarding World is and what the fans have always dreamed of. This is by far the best Wizarding World video game to ever come out and stands with a select few games that prove more is more.A MASTERPIECE GAME.A MUST BUY GAME THIS YEAR.A DREAM COME TRUE GAME.THE GOTY OF THIS YEAR!One of the  best RPG games of all time.Hogwarts Legacy is a phenomenal game that has a lot of great “somethings for everyone.”"

It's beautiful, combat is so much fun (various difficulty levels if you find it too easy or too hard), flying is fantastic, spells work really well, the story is marvelous. They mostly did a great job with fabrics (EXCEPT for capes. I don't like how those move at all. Stick with coats). There are characters I honestly care about who have stories I care about. No, not everyone is like that. And it's subjective. The world is MUCH bigger than I expected. I just expected Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. It's WAY beyond those two. There's a few things I'm sad about: Houses don't really matter in some regards, such as not having to use your bed to go to bed or advance time to night or day (which could have been done in ADDITION to being able to just use the map); There aren't really any morality issues if you use evil spells on another student in front of people (or if you break into someone's house in front of the entire town). But those are mostly minor and could be changed with a patch if they wish to go that route. There is so MUCH to do and explore. I've barely touched on things. Yes, you WILL get to mess with plants. Yes, you WILL get to deal with magical creatures. They do a pretty good job on touching on all the subjects.CON: I run after centaurs shouting ""BE MY FRIEND!"" and they ignore me ;_; I'll hug a puffskein insteadOf note, I run this game on medium settings. Even that tends to make my office area and computer pretty hot. And I'm not on an ancient machine. It is VERY demanding. But even on lower settings, it's absolutely beautiful."

After getting the game, I was very impress on the world and roaming around Hogwarts. The castle is created really beautifully and get to explore the whole castle really which is fantastic. The story of Hogwarts Legacy is good enough of a plot as a student starting at the 5th year that needs to catch up for beginning late while discovering the special ancient magic the main character is gifted with. There is also plenty of side story or relationship story (not in a romantic way kinda sadly) where we do quest from other fellow classmates of Hogwarts with some like Sebastian and Poppy having more story quest that are also at the main quest. I pre-odored the game with the 3 day early access and had bad performance issues playing the game all throughout my gameplay most of the time. Patches will mostly will fix that issue but besides that including the dialogue character saying the word Merlin plenty of times, I really enjoyed the game and exploring the world that really feels like I am exploring the school of Hogwarts which the developers did a fantastic job."

There's so much to do to keep the competitionist entertained for a good while (me, I am the completitionist). And the combat system is fun and engaging, keeping you somewhat in the zone when you need to use different schools of spells. While I wish the main story was waaaaaaay longer and more intricate, I'm still satisfied with the ending and how I got to play it all out.Moral of the dumb story:recommended for the hogwarts fan, not for the person looking for an open world with amazing graphics and story."

You can eavesdrop on classmates and enemies to get context clues, and side missions and extra conversations with professors and colleagues bring me to a world I've personally never been in before and never cared about till now.I tested it on easy, normal, and hard, and the combat is really fun in all 3. I tried to test the random dialogue ticks your character does when trying to figure out something. I think it happens no matter what but I'm not 100% sure. If it does, I do wish we as the player were trusted to figure out the puzzles, but on my time spent in hard mode, I didn't think to pay attention to see if that dialogue happened. I personally wish there were levels to the mini games. I read a LOT of people that were happy the lock mechanic is the same for all 3 levels but I feel it's tedious BECAUSE it's the same.

I am not interested in Harry Potter much at all, but the game isn't the books or movies.The mechanics, the atmospherics and especially the combat feel very satisfying and immersive. Story leading is pretty good, though some events and ""friendships"" you make are sudden, seemingly out of nowhere, and very fast-tracked.The story in itself is good. It is engaging from the beginning, it shows you a mystery that you want to solve and learn where the clues lead. You live a life of a student of magic and, while attending classes part is very hand-waved, it still feels as if you actually -are- a student. The only strong criticism I may have is that the game doesn't care about whether you're a morally good or bad person. It doesn't punish or reward you for choosing either path, or even for using forbidden magic. Some NPC next to which you use an Unforgivable Curse may comment ""You shouldn't use Dark Magic!"" but that's about it. However, I think the story is meant to be linear- it's meant to be like a book or a movie you're watching. In this way, the game does it well.Overall, kudos to all developers of this game!"

Boy was i wrong.Its a GREAT RPG in a Hogwarts world. The combat, visuals, sound, environment is all amazing! The story and puzzles are satisfying and you can feel the world and the magic as you play and explore. BUT! Im not going to go on about how good it as that's most reviews here. MY ONE GRIPE WITH THIS is you cant be evil. Like imagine a 2nd play through. The elder magic has 2 sides where some try to turn you evil. Be a student and hide amongst the sheep. Sabotage, legit take over the Hogwarts world. New quests for the new found evil. Once unleashing the full potential of the dark arts go full Anakin Skywalker mode and raid the Hogwarts castle fighting the other students and the professors with an army of undead and other dark wizards and witches. The potential it could have would be amazing! Please bring something like this as a DLC10/10 for a f***ing great game0/10 cant go Anakin Skywalker mode on stupid Hufflepuff younglings"

The game really has it all from specializing in different forms of combat (herbology, potions, stealth, ect.) to tons of open world challenges to a great supporting cast of characters. The story so far as been so so, but I'm more playing for all the mysteries to solve in this beautiful world as well as the incredibly crisp combat.

However, your choices don't really matter and most of the time you are forced into the story direction. So I really wouldn't say this game is open-world or an RPG since the story is linear and the world is mostly locked until you complete the 10-hour tutorial. I'm pretty disappointed because they decided to go with a no-name main character and could have made this a wonderful experience! Instead, you're forced into your quest line and your decisions seem unimportant. It's like why not just have it be Harry Potter if the whole story-line is already going to be decided for you? I love Harry Potter and tried enjoying this game, but it just feels like I'm being pushed along a singular track and not rewarded for exploration unless it exploration in the form of a quest I've been Given.The times I did explore the map I was met with ""Dungeons"" that looked like they had potential only to be disappointed with a singular chest of loot and no story or enemies.I'll probably pick this up this summer to see if it's worth it, but doubt it. The structure of the game is just boring."

This is the only game I will probably finish all collectibles without pushing myself. Puzzles in castle are very well made and addicting. Combat is fun and absolutely not boring or way too easy. Side quests are full, rich, diverse and way better than main story. After getting my broom I was baffled how insanely large and full the world is. Music and sound effects are perfect, graphics is to this day the best I saw so far. This is the Red Dead Redemption 2 detailing and world quality. I almost never sprint in castle, only walk and enjoy every single corner thoroughly. Oh and there are like 0 bugs.But enough of praising. Personally I really hate main story levels, those shiny, boring zero interaction corridors full of same enemies and crappy puzzles reminds me of some of those boring corridors in God of War, that you just can't wait to finally get the hell out.

You will make friends along your journey who will accompany you through thick and thin. With a limitless open world experience, this game is definitly worth trying. Here is my rating for some of the game aspects:8.5 - Gameplay: Occasionnally can be tricky to maneuver due to the flexibility of the open world aspect and combat view, but this flexibility is also a nice addition and makes combat smooth and quick.7.5 - Storytelling: The game feels like it depends on storytelling. The score is lower due to this. It can be difficult to find a balance in these sorts of games, between doing immersive story quests, and exploring quietly in the open world. 10 - Graphics : This is a very competitive game in terms of graphics. With a good setup, this game looks amazing, even at medium settings. 10 - Inclusivity/Variety: WB Games's mission was for everyone to feel welcomed and at home in this magical world. And I think they did so in style. With trans representative characters, to a lesbian married couple. I feel very satisfied with the amount of subtle inclusivity in this game.7.5 - Audio: I wish there was more ambiance music or just a constant, more upbeat music to make exploring more fun and captivating. 9 - Continuity: Although one is not able to continue the story once it is finished, with one save, it is possible to try out different house choices outcomes using whole different saves, to experience Hogwarts Legacy at its fullest."

5869,Didn't I Do It For You?,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cawcaw2352/,1,,0,38.2,February,18,164,0,1,"[Mostly Spoiler Free]This is probably the best Wizarding World game to have come out in a long time, which I'd definitely give it points for considering the last one I can remember is Lego Harry Potter. It sticks really well to the source material except for a couple things for game play reasons and the castle is amazing, but I can't recommend this game. The world is big, but when you go exploring it feels like it's pointlessly big. I'd find a cave, get ready to explore it, walk down 2 flights of stares only to find a dead end with a chest that has a pair of glasses in it that you're just going to sell. Most of the non-quest caves are like this except a few that have a puzzle that can instantly be solved by using the ""Revelio"" charm. It doesn't feel rewarding to go into these caves and explore.Your choices DO NOT MATTER at all, for a game that advertises about becoming the wizard you want to be it gives you very little wiggle room on the type of person you can become. If you're rude, nobody treats you differently. If you're nice, nobody treats you differently. In the end everybody treats you the same. The only choice that matters a little is what house you get sorted into because one or two side quests are different based on your house. There are no consequences at all for knowing the unforgivable curses, and your character remains acting like a nice proper little British boy while knowing how to use a curse that tortures people in horrific pain that requires malicious intent to cast.Here's something I can compliment though, the combat is pretty good. The spells are based on cool downs so you juggle the spells you have and it forces you to be creative with the way you fight, it also lets you interact with the environment while you're in combat in some areas.  The dark arts are especially fun, but once you learn them you just B-line to all of the spells that are considered ""curses"" to the game and become overpowered real quick, making any of the challenge that was once in the combat immediately vanish. Which would be fine if people cared about the unforgivable curses, but nobody bats an eye except for one off voice lines from followers. The story is okay, but I can't get into it without spoiling events so all I can really say is that I wish there were more choices to explore YOUR character and how they'd turn out in the end, but you stay one-note and so does every one else. I can't get invested into the characters because all they do is just serve roles to keep the plot going, you don't learn much about them. The side quests are way better than the main story, especially Sebastian Sallow's questline.There's not a lot of beasts, and you only find beasts for upgrade materials for your armor. You don't have to explore to find the beasts either, you get every single beast from quests (except one but it's super easy to get because it's every where.) Unless you're going for the breeding achievement where you breed them all you don't have to go out of your way to find them.Finally there's a huge lack in student activities, you barely spend any time in the classes or doing school activities. There's no quidditch, you do maybe one or two duels in the school and all of the classes are a five second cutscene that has no interaction at all. This game has a lot of potential to be great, it should've stayed in the works for just a little longer and had more polish."

And it's Hogwarts with all of its mysteries and intrighi and possibilities and secret paths and its dark past. You look around you, amazed. And there's even the rest of the map: Hogsmeade, the Forbidden Forest, the woods, all the little villages, the dungeons.The castle looks and feel alive, for real. You can go ANYWHERE. Through every door, in every room, on every step. You can really explore Hogwarts like never before, you see more of the school than in all of the movies and the old games put together. It's incredible, for real. Heartwarming.This is what I was going to tell you before things changed, or rather, before they never did.When you experience the combat system for the first time it feels okay. Not great, not that bad. There's the Souls roll and the ""Arkham"" parry. There are many spells to use in combat, but the truth is that they're all just one spell per type, with different visual effects (so 4/5 actual spells). You can either ""enjoy"" the combat system just pressing buttons, or trying to create useful combos, but you have to trust me on this: it's gonna bore you in some hour, no matter what.After I beat the main quest I switched the difficulty to the Story mode to get the fights over quickly. There are ability trees sort of, but I didn't even put every point I got to unlock the upgrades, I just got 6/7 things that could actually get handy, and never levelled up anything else. I didn't even started 2 of the 5 ability trees.The quest system is a bit like Fable. You go 'round town and you hear somebody saying something like: ""Where is my Kitty? I can't find her."" and see the NPC with the quest icon on it, so you go there and talk, and you get the oldest stupidest quests that a game could ever give you.When I started the game I was happy for, finally, not being Harry Potter. But that's a lie, you are Harry Potter. You are the chosen one, you can see things others can't. Your magic is stronger than anybody's. You and you only can defeat ""sto cazzo"" and finally bring peace to the yadda yadda yadda. Every single NPC will constantly tell you how special you are and how unbelievably you did something. Oh, and they gonna talk to you like you're an absolute idiot ofc, 'cause this is a game for children, right? (Except is not, the majority of players is between 20 and 30. The first movie got released in 2001).The whole time in your first hours you look around you with heart shaped eyes, you can't think anything other than: ""Wow! Will I be able to do that later?"" and ""What if I could do it? Maybe I will at some point, or after the end! Yeah, for sure""Things like: ""Maybe when I'll find this, it will unlock the possibility to do that""; ""Maybe I can't reach that point 'cause I don't have a [...] ..I will surely get there later, probably after [...].""Oh, and what if there is sea life? Can I see the giant octopus that lives in the lake?There will be the Room of Requirements? Will I be able to access it?There will be the Chamber of the Secrets? Will I be able to open it? There will be the basilisk? If I stay quiet, pressed against a wall, will I be able to hear some slither noise?The game is full of wonderies with extreme possibilities, with dungeons and puzzles and easter eggs and animals and plants and potions and ingredients and consumables and gears and skins. Yeah. But you know what?The answers are: no.You will never be able to do that.You will never reach that.You will never ""solve"" the thing that's a mystery, because there's nothing to solve. There's no mystery at all.The dungeons? One dungeon repeated over and over and over again.The puzzles? One puzzle repeated over and over AND OVER again.Gears/skins? One model with different materials and colours, and some ""minor"" ones that you're never gonna use except for the memes.And do you know what you do with all the animals, and all the plants and all the ingredients?The game it's just: ""Well you know, collect them all.""""Why is that?"" You may ask.""So you can brag about being able to reach 100% in the statistics""""Oh. Don't I need them for anything else?""""Ofc not! Now go and mak'em yours, tiger! You got this!""That's it.And this is true for every single icon on the map.It's Ubisoft. It's Assassin's Creed (the new ones), it's Far Cry. It's a map cleaner simulator. You got a big map with HUNDREDS of icons and, you know, just go there and ungrey them, unlock the icons on the map. Come on, collect them all.This is not real content, this is not quality, it's solely quantity. And it's without variants, it's without that something that pushes you to explore and unfold every inch of the map for completism.When you see one dungeon, one quest and one meter of the out-of-Hogwarts map, trust me, you've seen it all. That is the entire game right there.There is no Chamber of the Secrets.There is no mysterious, mythological creatures that lurks under the surface of the water (there's no underwater either, you can only swim in 2D).No snakes behind walls.Nothing to hope, to speculate.This is not a ""realistic"" simulation of what an actual magical world like the Harry Potter one could and should be.There is no THAT magic in the game.There is no RPG elements, there is no choice making. Oh wait, I haven't talked about this yet. Fine:The game makes you choose from various (two, it's always two) lines of dialog when someone asks you a question. Ok, but even in the main quest, in the MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS of the MAIN QUEST, your choices are totally, completely, irrelevant. I'm not exaggerating this at all, I swear. The game wants you to think that you can have different stories, different endings maybe. At least SOMETHING, ANY THING different based on your lines of dialogue. LIKE EVERY OTHER SINGLE F*CKING GAME FFSDoesn't work here. No no. No matter. The game it's literally: ""Yeah, ok, I know you said that, but you know what? Who cares? That's just your opinion. The story goes like this.""Maybe you made a choice and wanted to kill someone? I mean, the game itself gave you the possibility. You killed the man, the game goes like: ""Well... I know you thought you just killed him, you literally picked the option ""I'll kill him myself"" but to be totally honest... you didn't kill him. Sike. Sorry but you know... the story could not go in the direction we wanted if you actually did, so... He's alive! Have a nice day!""WHY THE F*CK DO YOU MAKE ME CHOOSE THEN?! DIO CANEYou really get immediately tired of this sh*t.You get tired of the animations, you get tired of the caves, you get tired of the literal three enemies, you get tired of your character's voice (that's even fn bugged if you change the pitch from the default one), you get tired of the one meter map copied and pasted for kilometers, you get tired of the fn broomstick, you get tired of the clunky and annoying and uselessly complex spells input system, tired of the combat system. Really, everything becomes just tedious in the end. And I'm saying all of this with 40 hours. 40 HOURS!!! Not 4000. Look at my other game times to get a comparison.I was screaming at start. I said, with tears in my eyes: ""Fable. The new Fable"".I was falling in love... And maybe I did at some point, maybe I fell.And as always in love, I fell not for the real person, but for my own vision of it, for my desire of what it could have been.But there is no such beauty, there's only disappointment.We all trust the illusion of love.But no matter how tender, how exquisite.A lie will remain a lie.In the end, as you all know, love can only lead to one thing.Pain.Go play Dark Souls, kids."

The world is huge, the graphics are spectacular, the fighting mechanics are perfect, the gameplay has variety, and the voice acting is superb - it has continued to check all of the boxes for me.With that being said, this may be the best game I’ve ever played in my entire life and I cannot believe that I am saying that. Not only do I see hardly any flaws (except pc performance), but this game just continues to get better with each quest completed, each spell unlocked, and each new item looted. It’s spectacular and I honestly don’t know what to say - it just gives you that feeling very few games can give.Overall: 10/10 - my new favorite game of all-timeEdit:After beating the game, I was pretty underwhelmed by the main story and definitely cringed out by the ending. In most cases, this would cause me to really drop my rating for the game, but somehow this game is still a 10/10 for me. Perfect mechanics,beautiful graphics, and an awesome recreation of hogwarts.

Pros:Combat is simple, but very satisfying and visualy represented extremely well.Alot of puzzles.Visual world design can only be described as magical, in some places it feels like you are in a Harry potter film.Story is interesting enough to keep you engaged in it.Cons:Combat gets repetive fast, when you unlock all spells, you will prety much fight all fights the same way.Puzzles are fun, but some of them are repeated way to many times specialy the merlin trial ones.Item visual design is awful without transmoging you apperance you will look in most cases like a mad clown.Game performance is not the greatest alot of stuttering and some visual glitches.The game offers a good story, satisfying combat and visualy stunning world, completing all story qeusts, sideqeusts and full world exploration gives you around 55-60 hours of gameplay (depending on how well you solve puzzles it might be much faster). Game is no dout a contender for GOTY and lets hope expansions or dlc's with more content will follow."

This has to be the best launched game in a long time. Many games are released broken (Cough ..... Cough...Wild Hearts) but Hogwarts Legacy had some very minor issues and already most of them have actually been fixed. Moving forward the game itself;Graphics are stunning and the representation of the franchise is fantastic. Combat is very fun (Sometimes hard) but none the less once you have it down and the combos you can perform makes you feel like a bad*** Other mechanics are a absolute joy to the game from flying, beast capping even farming items. My only one issue with the game and its not even that bad its more funny if anything, is that the attention to detail, even small things are great (The rain drops on the clothes during wet weather is insane) however you go into water you are bone dry like what haha :P"

5889,Mido_Elprince,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mido_elprince/,2,,1,57.3,February,18,356,0,1,"In my personal opinion, I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and believe that it fulfills everything I have ever wanted in a Harry Potter game. The story is well-written, and the voice acting by non-player characters is exceptional. However, the player characters' voices do sound slightly robotic, likely due to the pitch, but this did not significantly detract from my gameplay experience. The combat system is engaging, but I would have appreciated more variety in the enemies we encounter. The game's depiction of Hogwarts and the surrounding world is incredibly detailed, and I have found myself getting lost in exploring the castle multiple times.Unfortunately, I do have a few criticisms of the game that I hope will be addressed in the future. For example, the lack of a photo mode and certain animation issues with foes such as the trolls who sometimes lag in completing their animations. Additionally, there is a noticeable lack of enemy variety, and I would have liked more school-focused missions and student life activities, such as Quidditch and Wizards Chess, to make the game feel more immersive.Despite these minor criticisms, I believe that Avalanche has done an outstanding job of bringing the Harry Potter universe to life through this game. I look forward to future developments, including potential downloadable content (DLC) or similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world, such as Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang, or stories focused around the adults of the universe, such as Aurors or Unspeakables. I believe that many others would also enjoy playing these types of games."

The world itself is massive. Hogwarts is fun to explore and the studio did a good job conveying the scale of the castle. There are a few easter eggs regarding locations that we encounter in the novels with dialogues as well.All in all - A fun game to sink a lot of hours into.

It reminds me a lot of the 1st arc in Fable 1, where you are learning to be an adventurer in the Hero Academy. But with breath taking graphics and the powerful mythology of the HP series.Combat is really good. I follows the same template of the Batman Arkham francise utilizing auto-aim (which i am not a big fan). However, where it takes the challenge away with Auto-Aim, it gives with a really creative style of magic use during fights, including a parrying system.Attention to detail is another great point. You can clearly see that people took extra time to fit  seamlessly into the lore, honoring the books and at the same time expading it.I never take my time to write any reviews for the games i ow, but this one i think it trully deserves it.Recommend to anyone, for sure."

5918,<(^_^)>,https://steamcommunity.com/id/papadan88/,1,,1,31.8,February,17,183,0,1,"Excellent visuals, fun game play, good ambience overall. Runs perfect on both my computer and my Steam Deck, which it is an excellent use case for.  Right off the bat I love that every bit of equipment is cosmetically unlocked as you acquire it to apply at any time so unlike most RPG's, you don't spend the first half of the game looking like you're playing dress up with garbage.  Speaking of being an RPG, so far there is definitely a fair share of fetch quests.  Buuuuut, they're fetch quests in Hogwarts, and you use fun bits of magic to complete them so it's not really that much of an issue with me.  People have talked about the lack of diversity in choosing your house and it's minimal impact on the game.  I can see that affecting replay value for sure.  That being said, I grew up with first, the books, I remember the waiting list at the school library, then the movies.  At the point in my life I am, working full time, married, children, I don't have a massive amount of time for gaming, and if I did, I'd be doing other things.  The lack of pressure I feel knowing I can't break this game making a stupid or rushed decision, is refreshing actually.  I can change what I want on the surface, but ultimately, I just get to enjoy playing through a story I enjoy, the way I would like to.  After playing through Elden Ring (excellent game don't get me wrong) with it's 19841749817 endings, dark story and visuals, and completely unforgiving ""HAHA your playthrough is screwed now!"" game play, I can certainly handle something that's not another souls like.  Speaking of game play.  The spells you learn come along fairly regularly and all I have so far, have some kind of utility.  I look forward to unlocking the optional spells to see if they change any dynamic of the game.  I enjoy how flashy everything you do seems to be, along with the music for ambience.  It makes even those mundane tasks like the fetch quests I mentioned enjoyable.  The puzzles, mixed with combat, kind of makes me feel reminiscent of the old Zelda games in a way, has some similar vibes at least.  I can certainly say I will enjoy going through Hogwarts Legacy.  Exactly what I think a Harry Potter game should be."
5919,Reapdog,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DrReaperman_911/,1,,1,38.8,February,17,219,0,1,"When I saw the game, I was sceptical, as I was not sure if it was going to be a flop or not, nevertheless, I ended up getting the Ultimate edition, as it was only 10$ more than base. After spending the first 2 days of the Early Access playing this game, it ended up exceeding my expectation by a long shot.Pros-The Combat system is tight, and allows you to attack enemies with fluidly, making it feel incredibly smooth-The main story is well told, and does not feel like its rushing in content.-You can use the 3 unforgivable curses in the game, one of which is the killing curse-You are able to brew potions, grow your own potion ingredients, care for animals and upgrade equipment-The ability to customise your wand-The ability to fly with a Broom or a Hippogriff-Lots of secrets, optional missions, and collectablesCons-There is currently no inbuilt multiplayer functionality, however there is already a mod in production for it.-You can't play Quidich-You being rude in the game [Evil], does not really affect the main story much.-Regardless of what House your in, the story does not change much at all.-You can't brew potions, use grow boxes, or tend to animals until half way through the story-The voices in the game are currently bugged [The pitch shifting is broken, so it sound roboticy]-The face tracking is scuffed-Once you have customised your wand, you can not edit it, or change it-The story can be beaten in one sitting, if you completely ignore side missions.OverallThe game is not perfect, far from it, however it is still a really good game! Despite the attempt to cancel the game because people on the internet are saying its  'Transphobic' and 'Supports J.K.Rowling', both of which is bollocks, its a very strong start to the year of good games, I'm happy to say that its on the right track to being a masterpiece in gaming today."

It is polished, very polished.  I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but I enjoyed the movies.  If you're into the fantasy RPG genre, this game is a must.  I'm only 5 hours in, but so far I'd compare it to games like The Witcher or Dragon Age.  There hasn't been a lot of combat yet, but I feel like I'm getting the whole ""this is how to be a Wizard"" introduction to the game still.Highly recommended.  This is how $60 games should be."

Despite on Rowling's attempts to ruin this universe for the fanbase in the last few years, due to her extreme views that she constantly makes public, I hope people will focus instead on the team behind the game that actually put hundreds of hours to bring this universe alive in a virtual environment, and with great attention to detail. This game exceeded my expectations in more than one way.Of course there are some bugs and some visual issues, like with every other game out there. Don't let it get to you, just enjoy the game.

But this game is sold as a RPG and it has no RPG elements. You don't have choices in this game and you can't be a particular wizard either. Instead you're a wonderboy perfect, can do everything wizard that is always cheery and respectful.Oh, and how did they make learning new spells fun? Every time you're ready to learn a new spell you have to complete the most boring assignments to learn it. Either it is doing some combat feats or drinking multiple potions at the same time, throwing out some plants at the same time. It's so freaking tedious!And also what's up with the menu design? Navigate with a freaking pointer while its much faster to just press up or down. No sell all button while you have sell a LOT of gear.Yeah, they shower you with meaningless gear in this game, probably 99% of my play time was spent just changing gear for a green that is better then a legendary 4 drops later.There's more but ♥♥♥♥ listing everything.

I'm barely at 30% completion and there's still SO MUCH more content that this game has to offer. I highly recommend this game to both Harry Potter fans and non Harry Potter fans alike. If you love Fantasy-Science Fiction and Open-World, then you'll absolutely love this game. It's the Harry Potter game that we've all been waiting for.This game literally offers EVERYTHING that would be a MUST-HAVE in the perfect Harry Potter game: open-world exploration, immersive game-world environment, beautiful and highly detailed game graphics, gripping and immersive story, flawless combat mechanics, crafting, gathering, in-depth dialogue system, interactive NPCs, dynamic game-world environment, dungeon diving, and of course BROOM FLYING! One of the main things I absolutely LOVE about this game is that every piece of gear can be trans-mogged. So for example, if you want a cloak with better stats to look like a cloak that you really like, you can do that. You can do the same to every piece of gear except for Wand Handles. Also, if you sell a piece of gear, it's design is permanently saved in the game's transmog memory.The game definitely takes a lot of inspiration from the Dark Souls Games and The Witcher III: The Wild Hunt as far as control mechanics and combat mechanics go. It also takes a little bit of inspiration from Monster Hunter as well. I would personally rate this game 10.5/10. This game is absolutely amazing!"

5938,Driko,https://steamcommunity.com/id/drikoz/,1,,1,85.7,February,17,89,0,1,"Graphically the game is marvelous, but seems like the studio behind the game only put the artists/animators to work and forgot to put writers and programmers in the team.World interaction is minimal, NPC don't react to you throwing spells at them, nothing happens, not even screaming or falling in the ground, I mean games from ps1 have better npc reaction.If you cut down the collect-a-thon aspects, the total gameplay time would be reduced A LOT, alohomora is mostly used to collect some pieces of decorative furniture and clothing, but because the stats are usually poor, you could mostly skip this, unless you're want to have new skins.Chests feel unrewarding because the shops sell you legendary gear that would probably be better than anything you find.Wand designs are meh, but I could be ok with it, since I almost never notice them anyways because of how tiny their are in the third person view.It's called hogwarts legacy but you mostly are in the world flying around doing uninspired missions of fetch quests.The puzzles get old REAL fast, becoming tedious....I'm almost finished in the game...The world seems big but the majority of quests/pages/objetives are located in hogwarts/north of hogwarts and everything else  below hogwarts is mostly filler.There's not much interaction going on...potion making is just selecting the recipe, beast catching is cool the two or three times, but then becomes busy work, because you can only have 12 of them, while only being able to have 4 species. You unlock more vivariums later on but feels quite bad to unlock everything in the late game...it loses meaning.Combat is very good and fast paced, spell combinations are fun, the game really shines here.It seems to me that they cut A LOT of things in the game just to deliver the product faster, for example quests even if you select something that should be considered bad have NO CONSEQUENCES, with exception of a very few you receive the same rewards, etc.You can't kill innocent people...so there's not much sense in unforgivable curses except in the damage, or for the roleplay...But then again these have no consequences in the game.There's no quidditchThere's a bunch of delayed content for the sake of it (alohomora, broom access, mount access, beasts access)Classes in hogwarts are basically cutscenes and you just unlock a new spell, no interaction, no mini-games, nada.It's a fun game to chillax and collect things but it's not a RPG in the slighest way, there's not much progression, talents don't make that difference, choices don't matter.But credit where credit is due...graphics and combat are solid. Everything else just seems lazy.I recommend the game with a big discount and after they patched it to iron out the perfomance and bug issues (there's a lot of frame dips, stuttering and other bugs)"
5939,Matt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/phatmillips/,1,,1,46.0,February,17,"3,036",0,1,"Quick review because i really dont want to do write a lot.  All of the below will be written on the fly:Overall - It's a good game.  I have almost zero interest in Harry Potter and I enjoyed it.However the combat can get very spongy, the enemies get very tanky towards the end of the game on normal.  I found no matter what I did for gear most enemies would 2-3 shot me due to how squishy I was -and I was always squishy.There's items you can make/brew but I didnt like not being able to brew/craft on the field.The main story is objectively boring and poorly told - it's mostly in exposition dumps and flash backs.  However the side quests especially the three main side characters and their missions are awesome and much much better than the main quest.While we're at it, my personal order for the quality of the side characters and their mission quest lines are:1)  Sebastian2)  Poppy3)  Nattiewith the main quest line being a far/distant 4th.  1 and 2 are very good - I loved Poppys character and Sebastian's story is absolutely amazing and very well told.  Nattie is good too but the main villain in her quest line I did not connect with.I liked the combat, I liked how the spells their combos made sense.  I enjoyed discovering great spell combos like ice+slice or lift+slam, etc.  It does get a little repetitive over time so take the opportunity to go invisible with spells/potions when you can and stealth kill when you can to get through battles faster.The world map is large but not empty nor is it filled with too much to do.Performance wise I am using a nvidia 3800 with 3600x, running at 1440p.  The game ran fine but every now and then especially when you use Revelio or however it's spelled the came would drop frames for a few seconds...down to about 15-25fps.  Really annoying.  Game would constantly build/rebuild shaders on start up as well.I beat the game, 100% the side quests at around 40-45 hours.  I really dont know if Steam is correct (46 hours) or in game 37 is correct.  I dont know why there's a 10 hour game, i assume the game isnt closing or something weird - so let's meet in the middle at 40-45 hours.Final score is 4 out of 5.  If you're a Harry Potter nut I guess you can give it 4.5 or 5 out of 5.  The weakest aspect is the main quest-line.  The game also assumes you know what's going on Lore wise, it does a poor job in my opinion teaching me about the game world.4 out of 5"

Dont even try to deny it; we all want it. Hogwarts Mystery has it, so why not legacy?- Main story too short: I felt the main story was more of a side story and Sebastian story was more important. Although I absolutely loved this questline, I felt wronged that it was more meaningful, more depthful than the main story itself- Friendship. I only felt really bonding with Sebastian and Ominis. I did enjoy the company of Poppy and Natty, and Amit. But I feel only Sebastian got the depth we deserved. I wish there was more quests or little events here and there- Friendship2. On that note, why are we not allowed to bring friends in our adventure? It just feels odd that a (idk, 15yr old) would want to travel alone and face so many dangers alone.- Some events like halloween, christmas dance or parties/hangouts, etc. wouldve been immensely loved im sure. As well as quidditch (i dont really care for that part but its a bit odd its... not in the game)- NPCs felt empty. They dont talk, dont have names or schedules. Its nighttime and nobody is there, its like everyone vanished. I wanted to creep stalk people goddang it!- Speaking of night time... Since when, in HP, are we allowed to roam free in the castle or outside hm? Where are the prefects? Sure it couldve been annoying to finish collections, but again it just adds to the emptiness.- Honor? I did abuse the 3 unforgivable curses but why was there no consequences at all? No choices either except one at the end? :(- Classes: We are supposed to be a student but theres almost nothing tied to it. The system in place was good though, going to a class to unlock a spell and etc.- Potions/Ingredients: Became irrelevant very fast for me.If devs read the comments and come across here: You did an amazing job. I am being critical because it is my job to... Test video games for bugs and such so its in my nature. I really really loved the game. I know I seem to have a lot of negative points but... yeah. Since its open-world I tend to compare it to RDR2 or Skyrim, which both have about 150-200hrs of content even though the main story is short in Skyrim.I hope the mod community will pull through until you bring us DLCs or content. If not, I really hope you take care of those modders <3Pssst... dragon pets/mounts when?"

I warn you, I write his review toasted, but I have played a lot of video games; at least half as mush while toasted ( I know it's spelled wrong; shut the fust up). Look at the period AFTER the paren (like a gentlemen).I did not grow up with Harry Potter in my life. I was forced (asked kindly by my misses) to watch the movies on her birthday. It was OK. So, I bought this game because JK Rowling said she believes in something and all the people that said she believes in ""something"" + ""everything I believe she means when she says this"" got all pissey (and I was bored).But, honestly, I ended up having a really good time. Despite WB Games DELIBERATELY adding a little something, something to DELIBERATELY say F U to Ms. Rowling in it, early on. The game play is (relatively) solid, the story-telling is superb, the open-world element compliments the existing canon well. Again, only knowing that Harry Potter ""exists,"" I was still able to enjoy it, and yea, verily, even get invested in the universe.The combat is so-so. But, I will admit, the last game I played (literally, the day before I launched this game for the first time, was God of War 2018 (an EXCEPTIONAL game, if you're interested). My first response to my friends after playing the combat was ""This is Fragging EEEEEAAAASSSSYYYYY."" But, again, God. Of. Gorram. War.Portkey and WB Games made an honest effort here, to be original, while fitting into, I guess, I beloved universe. And given WB Games not-so-good, but super well-intentioned version of Batman Origins, I will give this a huge Plus 1. Buy it. Play it. Enjoy it. I did, I don't even give a rat;s bunghole about Wizard Jesus.. er... Harry Pot Her."

So many harry potter easter eggs in the game."
5980,ARGO,https://steamcommunity.com/id/argothewuffer/,1,,1,99.7,February,17,40,0,1,"Is it a perfect game? No.Does it have its own issues? Definitely.There's, however, a difference between simple cashgrabs and projects like these where you can clearly see that there was a lot of time and effort put into it. They certainly did. You may not like a particular element or two or perhaps this game is not for you all together, but overall I think it's a great product. So many people were hyped and since we never really had a wizarding game on a similiar scale, they could have easily put way less care into all this, and people still would have praised them for it. Instead, as cheesy as it may sound, looks like they've put enough effort and love into this game and it shows. It also leaves room for further improvements, DLCs and so on.VIsuals are very nice and I think I was lucky because on GTX 1080ti (well, I do have two in a SLI but I'm quite sure sli is long dead) I can play it fairly comfortably and smoothly on a high preset of 1080p and personally I haven't encountered many technical issues.Stories, quests, everything else you can do- there's plenty. Map is quite big, the castle is of course really well made, I really enjoyed it. I just hope people realize it's a wizarding world, not a typical fantasy where every dungeon has to have hordes of rats, skeletons and exploding magic all over the place- one example would be the random treasure vaults you can find. I do enjoy they way they approached it. Crypts are often empty, quiet and I really enjoyed exploring them.As for most other gameplay elements and the direction they've taken- I enjoy it. But below is what I think does not work that well.NPC students around the castle are often staring into the void, not reacting to what you do, they are there to occupy the space and while they do make castle feel more alive, there's definitely a room for improvement.I'd like to see few more interesting enemies, too. And, of course, spells. All that could come with DLCs, we'll see.My biggest concern, however, is the world not reacting enough to our choices, in fact they don't matter that much if any. Cast Avada on someone while proffessor's around? No problem. Put on some creepy robes and wander around the castle while everyone's talking about your recent feats- great, we all know what you did but hey, here's a young student, go find their enchanted pants or something.I'd also enjoy way more school activities and some more dialogue options- with not so clear good/bad responses most of the time, or rather- not just them.But the true magic happens when you are on your own, you put the robe on, the hood on, you either wander the castle and solve puzzles or go into this world. I must admit that it feels great, it's raining, you got your hood on, it's getting dark, you pull out a wand and pop Lumos and walk slowly or somethin- I think moments like these capture the magic in this release.And my last point is- I'd love a more mature, darker world, but I understand what they need to do so it sells well and reaches various age groups, too.I think there is magic in this title, plenty of it. If there is some in you, then you can combine both and have a really enjoyable, magical experience."

However, the lack of impact your choices have and consequently the replayability is severely lacking. I would recommend waiting to buy on sale, or waiting for modders to expand the game."

Explore Hogwarts like never before and become the wizard or witch you ever wanted to be (partially).Game needs better optimization. It runs good most of the time but there are several and critic frame drops during gameplay, specially during cutscenes or during usage of the lumus spell.Cons:1. You cannot play quidditch, wizard chess, gobstones but you do have a lot of things to do;2. No coop or multiplayer of any kind;3. Limited dialogue/actions choices, even though you can follow a darker path, your character won't be exactly evil since most of the time your character will act like a kind person;4.

I love the game's atmosphere, the graphics are very good and the gameplay is phenomenal and there are great puzzles in it, great characters and good voice acting and the open word is very well done. I started the game on the hardest difficulty because I play everything on hard and it was (small) mistake, my first fight with mages in the Forbidden Forest wasn't a pleasent experience, they kicked my a@@, I didn't expect that it will be a ""hard"" game, far from a Dark Souls experience but it was very surprising but after a little practice it became much easier. Of course nothing is perfect, the game could be very repetitive, the enemies are not too diverse and there are some collecting quests which are sometimes could be very boring. My biggest problem that the game could be very CPU limited in some areas and it causes stutters which is not immerson breaking but could be a little annoying. My PC: Ryzen 7 5800X3D, 32GB 3600mhz CL18 ram, RTX 3080 12GB, 2TB SSD in 1440p can handle the game on Ultra and I can enable Ray Tracing if I use DLSS and I can recommend to everyone to replace the DLSS file to version 2.5.1 or 3.1.1. 8/10"

Gameplay is great, yes there are some stuttering issues at time, but they are actively fixing them. The only gameplay downfalls I see are lack of wizards chess, Quidditch, and moral quest choices without a morality system that effects gameplay.

6025,Demy,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198371646311/,2,,1,160.4,February,17,233,0,1,"Now that I have played for more than 100+ hours of the game I feel like I can give a fair review. Please do not judge me for playing a game based on a series I absolutely enjoy written by a person who I absolutely loath. Pros- Attention to detail. The game is beautiful, and a lot of attention went into details most people wouldn't notice.- Flying! Its my favour way to travel if I don’t take the floo network. You can see major locations indicated from your broom/mount. It also shows the smaller things that are not related to quests such as treasure caves, activities, etc.- the size of the area/map is very open world. I love being able to explore at any time instead of being locked to just 1 quest. - Plenty of puzzles with the cave systems to get treasures and coin. Makes me think on how to solve them and gives me a little brain teaser.- I love the room of requirements as you can customize it to how you like AND you can keep your beasts that you rescue there.- Quest line is interactive and adventurous but not in your face as you have the option to complete it when you want. Its still a vary interesting plot line.- Field Guide, this is a live saver as it has everything you need to know, and it also helps you keep track of additional progress. Plus gives you the rewards you receive when you complete a challenge.- Side characters/ other students who provide quests are interesting and relatable. Partnering up with your fellow students make for interesting conversations during the quest. It also helps there is a backup wand with you when you really need it. - Random characters that you don’t interact with are well designed as well. They go about their daily lives and when they are grouped with other characters its fun to listen to their conversations. My favourite one was when - GENDER INCLUSIVE!!! I love this, when creating your character, even if you are a female, you can still be labeled a wizard or vice versa. They also use they/them pronouns instead of gender pronouns. – I FINALLY GOT MY HOGWARTS LETTER!!!! Pro and a Con- Magic in the game is fun and enjoyable to use, however, the button control for this game might get annoying. In the beginning magic is very simple to use and the buttons are easy to manage. Later on in the game you have to select which spells you will use since you have more spells then spell slots. It can be tedious if you are exploring since you must switch between spells you can use for puzzles, fighting, etc.- Flying beasts/mounts. They are fun to fly with and are very beautiful. However, landing, taking them out to fly or putting them back in your inventory are a pain. Its best to fly with them high in the sky while you are expanding your map range but after that its best to use your broom or just use the floo network.- Beasts are very detailed and fun to chase when trying to rescue them. Feeding them and playing with them is also a lot of fun.   Some beast can be difficult to find such as the graphon - clothing/gear are very beautifully detailed and I like that you can change the look even if you are wearing something completely different for the offence perks. I am not a fan of how they like to clip through characters, how a lot of the clothing doesn’t have a set so its kinda like miss and matching the items until you found a decent look that works for your character and some of them are just ugly.- The merlin trials are fun and very interactive. sometimes they can be a bit glitchy though. My least favourite one are Cons- I get the game is new but there are some major bugs (they are working to fix a lot of them). The quest regarding Save the Biscuit has a major bug at this time of the review.  - Graphics card heavy. I had to uninstall quite a few games and have the settings on low just to be able to play the game. I cannot run music or other applications in the background (discord) as the game will lag and stutter. - controls, I know there are the default control buttons but I have had to change most of them so that it is easier do magic and access my menu screens. Example: Inventory is L while I is Gear. I had to switch those around so I can access my inventory a bit better. (This is probably different from other users but this is what I had to do)– the loading screens can take quite a while to load so when I have to fast travel or enter a cave, or even load the game it can take a while before I can play again. (great if you need to hydrate or run to the washroom though). When the game is done loading there may be a lot of lag as the world reloads the new area you are in (this can also be very annoying since you just finished waiting and would like to continue to play).– items such as  money bags, or small things can clip beneath the ground and you can see the items when you use Revelio BUT  you cannot collect the items as they are unreachable.– Can’t sell potions or items collected from beasts. Hopefully this changes in the future.– once you have collected a lot of clothes, you typically try to sell the extra clothes to make room to collect more. I understand that the merlin trials help unlock more space but there should be additional slots.– instructions on how to use certain controls (did not find out you could change day from night or vise versa until I was 70% completed the game) or task Recommendations for the game (should the developers ever read my review)– better things to spend your coin with since once you buy all the major items you typically don’t buy things again unless they are clothes or a missing beast ingredient so you have coin sitting there– more beasts and space for said beasts like the Demiguise, Kelpie, Occamy, etc– a way to see if you are doing bad deeds or good deed (morality check)– space for additional spells and more spells like the Patronus charm (would be great to be able to use the Patronus you matched with), avis/Oppugno, Locomotor Mortis, Confundo– more variety of enemies to dual against, such as dementors, werewolves, Boggarts– underwater maps that you would need to use a spell to access since you would be underwater (bubblehead charm, gillyweed, etc)- make certain character dateable!!!!!!For those of you who have stuck around for my full review/recommendation, koodos. Thanks for reading! Hopefully this helps the developers and yourself if you are looking to buy the game. Please don’t boycott this game if you hate JK Rowling since she was not involved in this games creation/development. Even with some of the cons this game is still amazing to play and well worth the purchase."

The character dialogue felt a bit poor overall and despite having moral options within the character you create they mean little to nothing aside from learning a couple of spells.  Some of the exploration items in the game can feel a bit redundant and some of the quests are still broken if you accidentally do something out of order while playing.  I do love how big the world is and how charming it can really be.  The Beast quests were my favorite ones aside from the ""Dark Wizard"" Quests.  Selecting my house was also a lot of fun.  Hufflepuff for Life!!  Although, I half considered if I should be a Slytherin near the end of the story due to the amount of fun I had acting like a Dark Wizard.  All in all.  The game is fun, and despite the lack of optimization out the gate I'm really glad I picked this one up.  STEAM DECK:  The performance is hit or miss depending on your perspective.  IF you are like me and have a hard time playing anything under 45-60 FPS than you might get headaches off and on and have to sacrifice the graphics.  I highly recommend user FSR 2.0 once you get in the game and set it for ""Balanced"" or ""Performance"".  I still get frame rate dips however, and sometimes I would get a fog glitch that makes the fog of a zone follow you around.  All the same, the game is still enjoyable on the Steam Deck.  Just be understanding of the experience this will allow for."

Probably nothing you haven't seen in trailers already.Pros:* You can pet every cat!* I actually really like the field guide aspect, I think it fits in so well with our story of starting as a fifth year and needing to catch up, I also love filling it up and the rewards system.* It's incredibly faithful to the source material, Peeves is as annoying as we all hoped.* All the little touches in the game are amazing and always unexpected, there's a suit of armour interaction I find hilarious whenever I'm passing.* The character of Sebastian is so compelling I'm helping him even though I'd planned to avoid anything Dark Arts related entirely.* For everyone complaining about JK, the developers worked very hard to show Hogwarts is home for everyone.It's the most diverse game I've played and I'm a big fan of Sirona the trans barmaid, I think she could be someone teenagers look up to and I hope to see her more in DLC or future games.* I've spent an unnecessary amount of time in The Room of Requirement, I love it, I love all the customizable options and I love finding more when I'm out and about in the world.* It is the game we all always wanted even if I do have a few gripes, there is no doubt the developers love the world as much as us.Cons:* Merlin trials, 90+ tedious puzzles, wouldn't have minded about 30 of them but when there's so many and they are so easy to do, It's just a slog to finish them.* Very few lessons, plants, potions and beasts, would have preferred a smaller world to have had a more in depth experience as a student.* I feel like I get attacked every minute or so outside of Hogwarts, and then enemies seem to just keep appearing so these battles take ages, I end up staying in the sky most of the time just to get ♥♥♥♥ done.* Female starting characters for some reason just look super weird compared to male characters, no idea why.* The spiders really freak me out but I think that's just a me problem.* The world outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmead feels less magical and more generic RPG, not a bad thing for most just a little disappointing for me. * No reason to use the common rooms. Can't sit, sleep, decorate etc I haven't finished it just yet, if it has a rubbish ending I will update, if not assume the ending is acceptable."

6058,Weary,https://steamcommunity.com/id/1wearyboi/,1,,1,129.4,February,17,447,0,1,"The game is great, but I would wait for some serious updates before buying it. Below are a list of issues I have with the game. If you feel like this stuff wouldn't bother you to much, I highly recommend it.1) if you need help finding the place to buy combat seeds, it's north of Hogsmeade. The marker for the shop is conveniently blocked when you open the map. Scroll up a bit and you should find it. I had to look this up because shops don't appear until you zoom in on a town, and the default zoom has the marker blocked by the ""world map"" and ""Hogwarts map"" tabs at the top of the screen. Also, if you can't find the room of requirement on the hogwarts map, select the ""Secret rooms"" tab and it will show up. Not sure why it doesn't just show the floo. 2) The game does a terrible job of explaining things. The best example of this is the lock picking mini-game that should never have existed, and I wish you could turn off. You spin the wheels until the green and orange cogs start turning, then hold the position until the lock opens. Nowhere is this explained. It gives you the spell, throws you in the mini-game, then says ""spin the wheels to open the lock"" and that's it. I had to look it up since you can't exit the mini-game and there are no other indicators of what to do. Other stuff not explained listed below.- For the skeleton bridges, you have to stand on the marked platform for it to work. -If you hover over a quest, you can press F (Y on controller) to show it on the map-If you hover over an equipped item, you can press F (X on controller) to change the appearance of the item-There is a random chalkboard somewhere in Hogwarts that explains the triangular door puzzles-If you don't know how to do a combat challenge, look it up. There are a lot of interactions that are only explained through these such as trasfiguring an animagus back to a human or burring a spiders head in the dirt. These usually take huge chunks out of large enemies health bars and/or stun them and make them vulnerable.3)  the combat feels bad. It's not so bad when you have three of four enemies, but any more than that and you'll be spending more time dodging then casting. Not parrying by the way. The number of times a prompt hasn't shown and I lost half my health is absurd. It also wouldn't be so bad if spell switching wasn't so annoying. I'm playing on controller, so I have to hold RT and push a direction on the D-pad to change spells. Each direction has four spells slotted, and you swap between them. The problem is, RT is also basic cast AND held to spell cast. There have been COUNTLESS times when I'm try to change spells and accidentally cast something or vice versa. Then your stuck standing there staring at an enemy with a colored shield, who can't take damage until hit with a specific spell, while his friend comes in from off screen to chunk you for half your health bar. Because you know... missing prompts. 4) Summoners court is not fun, and it has more rounds than any of the other similar quests. Also, its faster to re-load your game than play it out if your going to lose. Something like this needs a re-start option for if you mess up. Especially when you can grab the wrong ball extremely easily if you aren't paying attention. I don't want to listen to npcs taunt me over and over on the worst thought out side quest in the game. I actively avoided this side quest until I had literally nothing left to do and still hated every minuet of it. Which was a lot of time because accio is not nearly accurate enough for this. Seriously take this side quest out. It will make the game better.Again, overall the game is fun, but I can't really recommend it since I've had situations where I've just had to put the game down in frustration and walk away due to stupid nonsense."

Exploring Hogwarts on your own is the best thing ever since 1997 - for anyone in love with this franchise. Even for people who don't much care for it or don't know it, I would say it's a great opportunity to get to know the Wizarding World. It's great when, even after countless hours of play, you stumble upon another detail and location you know, but haven't found or explored yet. The story is engaging, the side quests are fun and entertaining. Characters are well written and the overall exerpience is immersive.

The combat system is also one of the stronger aspects of this game I must say!

6079,ConCon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/concon19/,1,,1,61.8,February,16,141,0,1,"Story: The story had a massive build up and was really enjoyable, but it could not decide between daring drama or hilarity at each step, ultimately I found no major impact in the conclusion of the story. Especially since you only realize you're on the last major quest once you're already halfway through it. Albeit it was a enjoyable experience.Graphics: I liked the attention to detail in the world, the fact that you can experience all 4 seasons of it. I particularly loved Hogsmeade in winter snow, it was my favourite place to be during that time. The game looks fantastic and I could not fault it in a single way in that regard.Controls: Mostly this was okay, it was neither great and intuitive or lackluster. Flying on PC is not the easiest experience and running up and down stairs could be frustrating with camera angles and accidentally clipping the corner and bringing your character to an awkward halt. Combat controls however were very reactive and seemless feeling. I felt IN control with the battles I fought. The only mistakes were my own judgement in spell choice at certain times or opting to protego instead of dodge rolling. Gameplay: The gameplay loop consists of many narrative interactions with npcs in the world, puzzles scattered across the world to solve and lastly combat against a small variety of enemy types; dark wizards, goblins and then a odd assortment of beasts and monsters such as trolls, spiders, inferni and dugbogs. I do feel like the game presents you with your own choice of play, you could go off solving every puzzle or entirely ignore them, same with enemy groups, you can obliterate anyone in your path or actively avoid all combat and play stealthily. I liked having that choice and nonetheless I got lost in doing what every was thrown in my face next, because that will happen and you'll always have something to do until the very end of the game.Sound: I'm no sound expert and am probably a lot more easy going with these things but I found the sounds to be fitting and lively, though after a while I did turn the music down to 20%, though that may be personal preference. My only gripe is that sometimes you will hear certain lines from NPCs a little TOO much. Like from the floo flames lady.... ""you wouldn't believe how difficult travel was before I invented floo powder..."" can get a little overbearing. But in combat, sound was almost flawless. Overall it was immersive.Is the game fun?:Yes, I really enjoyed exploring the world and having collected everything in my challenges except for one bug blocking me out of the ""rescue biscuit"" quest. I had a wonderful experience. Once I figured out how to become powerful, I got lost in my absolute destruction of every enemy I encountered. I would recommend this game."

(7/10), no consequences for your actions, . Side quests are a bit mundane. And , you'd expect from the later books/films (think Deathly Hallows)Only a few 'dungeons' exist, which are all quest related. All scattered chests/caves are just: walk in > press to pick up 1 item > leave (No depth, no combat, no filler stories - compare to something like Skyrim/New Vegas where cave exploring feels a lot more rewarding)Combat could use more variety, but is still very enjoyable, visuals and attention to detail is very good. Puzzles are enjoyable as well.  - , unless later DLCs address described issues, to make the game more interesting."
6089,Parry Hotter,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984753160/,1,1,1,95.7,February,16,161,1,1,"The Good:Escapism - If you like the Harry Potter world this game is obviously for you.Music - The composers seemed to have studied John Williams style of music because the soundtrack is almost a perfect replica of that style. The music is absolutely wonderful and really gives this game a face-lift it needs to fill in the void.Combat - Surprisingly enjoyable and somewhat versatile.Detail - The developers put most of their work into the design of Hogwarts. The castle is massive and extremely detailedLore - If you're a fan of the books and/or movies there's quite a few homages and nods to the source material. A game made by fans for the fans.Side Quests - a mixed bag. Ideally doing the side quests helps to liven up what is, at this point, an empty world filled with people moving about in silence. The majority of NPC's won't interact with you (unless they are merchants, teachers or students). NPC personalities are mostly fleshed out, however, their involvement is temporary as some are merely catalysts in furthering the plot then before fading away among the backdrop of the school.Magical Creatures - Again, it's all about escapism and taking care of creatures can be fun for some while boring for others.Graphics - Atmospheric Ambience is what really makes the game shine. The vista are absolutely beautiful. When you get up and close to textures the fidelity begins to make the game look dated. Train tracks are, in some places, jagged as well as some tree branches. These simpler geometric shapes will probably help with fps performance. It's at this point one can tell that this is a console game first and foremost.Scripted Moments - They are fun to watch. Armored statues duking it out, ghosts having a spat, Peeves being Peeves, A student walking on a wall, etc. The only problem is that there needs to be more. As the year progresses we see the same scripted moments.The Bad:Story - The story starts out with a bang and then loses momentum. I'm not even half way through, however, so will have to refrain for judgement.Puzzles - If you're a completionist or like diving into the lore then some puzzles can be enjoyable. Puzzle difficulty is almost nonexistent. They serve more to have you explore the world in detail. Puzzle goals become repetitious. My only motivation for completing them was to help my character level up faster.The Ugly:Character - Your character is the least interesting thing in the game. The dialog is very basic (however, your nonverbal reactions to another character can look genuine). Your character has very little personality and his/her motivations are nonexistent. Your character's personal history is a complete mystery. The moment the game begins you're whisked off to adventure.As a 15 year old child/teenager you wield deadly power and can summon devastating spells butchering and torturing unsuspecting enemies (which are very one dimensional)... and yet those moral interactions/consequences have no weight in this world. By day you're a student at Hogwarts, attending classes with an uplifting montage of nostalgia. When you leave the school you're a deadly killing machine reminding yourself that ""all roads lead to Hogsmeade"" after having obliterated a group of poachers. It's such a stark contrast it breaks the immersion.Optimization - The game is still new as I write this so I can only imagine these issues get better. Currently It takes me many attempts to get the game to even work as it crashes constantly when the game boots up. For whatever reason I get better fps playing the game in native 4K than I do when I turn on DLSS. There's certainly plenty of room for improvement in performance.If you made it this far, thanks for reading."

A game to relax and clear the mind after hours of stressfull ""real-life"".It is not a hard game by any means, even in the Hard difficult. Can be challenging sometimes but that makes it fun.Of course I have some critics. Nothing is perfect. And talking only about gameplay here, not technical performance issues (witch it has and a LOT right now), sometimes the game feels empty. I think that the interaction with other students should be a must. Now nothing happens if you try to cast a spell on a student. Just pick up and play Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

The main story at least.First let's look at the way the game runs... It runs (for me) really well without any major game breaking issues. Yes I did experience frame drops on cut scenes, and on very rare occasions in combat (but frankly it was never a serious issue). Played the game on the recommended settings for my hardware, which was basically the Ultra setting. That said there were many graphical glitches. Places the glare from the sun was too bright, or shone through a stone wall, and so on. Though nothing I'd call serious. To be honest it has been a long time since I had so few issues on a game just launched. It seems the modern trend is to shove it out the door half broke, and fix it with patches. That isn't this game, or I got extremely lucky and it was optimized well for my hardware/computer. With that said there is some aspects I would change/fix...Continuity on the side quests for one. For example I did not learn nor use any of the Unforgivable Curses in my first play through. Learning the Unforgivable Curses is a side quest. Yet I was constantly told by enemies I'm the student that has been tinkering in dark magic. My teachers hinted they had heard the same rumors. Plus one of my dialog options was ""I regret I used Curcio on you."" When I never used the curse on anyone nor even learned it for that matter. Another example is a side quest where you are asked to steal a Venomous Tentacula from someone. I choose not to steal it and completed the quest by giving them one of my own that I grow. Yet nearly every time I walked by Sirona after that they comment that they heard the guy was burglarized. How they were going to ignore rumors of my connection to the heist, or something to that effect. Even though I never stole the plant from them. Plus I can go on with three or four other examples of inconsistency in the side stories. However these are minor issues overall. A more serious issue to my thinking is simply your decisions do not matter. You can literally be a ♥♥♥♥ to everyone. Use dark magic left and right. In front of anyone you want. Stab all your friends and teachers in the back. Extort extra money for your ""services"" from everyone. Yet you are still praised as the hero in the end. The only difference is the dialog. In other words everyone seems to know of your exploits through rumors, but still praise you in the end. I think there is literally only one side mission that changes anything in the final outcome. That is because you turn them in, and I assume they were expelled from the school because of it among other things. Yet another character quickly jumps in to fill the dialog for the missing character in the later scenes. Therefore even that quest had no real effect. Finally I think the scaling is off. I played the game on Normal for all my characters. Enough to get 100% of the achievements in Steam. Roughly 1-30 was fine. It was a decent challenge with a reasonable risk of death. However at some point after 30 that changed. By the time I was 39 everything was so ridiculously easy it was pathetic. Only the last boss which was level 40 (with me being 39 at the time) managed to get my health below 80%. Still I wasn't in any real damage for death. Maybe I just got too good at the combat style. However more then likely the scaling was off.Overall...I really enjoyed the puzzles inside of the gameplay. They were a decent balance of difficulty and game play. Some of those puzzles really stomped me hard. Others I breezed through. The best advice I can give you is listen. All the side conversations and those options that are optional in dialog give you a more full and complete story of pretty much every character you interact with in game. Plus that information you gleam is used later. One such use is in a quiz style side puzzle/game that will be presented to you. It had me really racking my brain trying to remember while resisting the urge to just look up the answers on the internet. It has been a long time since I experienced that in any game. Normally I'm not invested in the story enough to care if I look up the answers. Yet this time I actually was invested enough in the main story that wanted to avoid cheating. That is the biggest praise I can give any game."

It's a Ubisoft openworld game in a Harry Potter wrapper. The quests are the same and completely forgettable. Instead of collecting 5 books, you'll be collecting 5 stones for the next one. The biggest hindrance being lifeless NPCs. No seriously, NPCs do not respond to you at all. You walk up to them, nothing. You cast a spell on them, nothing. It's as if you are walking through a pensive.  The side characters have zero emotion, it's as if the voice actors are simply reading their lines. The castle is well designed however, lots of attention to detail. The combat has a bit of depth to it and is fun. If a childhood dream is to simply walk through the halls of hogwarts, you'll like it.

6156,Zoidberg,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zoidberg_/,1,,1,52.6,February,16,387,0,1,"Has the same kind of magical feel that The Witcher 3 did when you start to just explore for the sake of exploring, just with more magic. Interesting story so far as well with multiple endings I hear. Only downside is no Quidditch (yet). Combat is rather straightforward but difficult to master and extremely fun once you get in a rhythm. You feel like a complete badass blasting people with your hard-earned spells and working combos to sweep the floor."

This game exceeded my expectations. I won't lie, I was skeptical this game wasn't going to match up to the hype, like several other games in the past, but I find myself actually addicted to this game. All I want to do is drop out of college and play.I can't help myself but to explore and discover as many details as possible. As a fan of the books and movies, seeing all of the magic and the easter eggs in a fitting environment in a video game feels refreshing and exciting. I'm taking my time to appreciate everything the devs created to give gamers a memorable experience - one that lets gamers feel like they're truly part of the wizarding world. I also really enjoy petting the cats, but their meows are a bit off putting. I barely have any hours in this game so far and that makes me more excited to see the rest as the story goes on.What makes the experience better is that there are not many bugs, at least that I have experienced myself or that have not broken the game. I did experience an issue when I updated my gpu's drivers where the game would not load, or took several minutes to load, but I simply reverted back to the previous driver and things started working as expected."

Game runs just fine, storyline is good and you have plenty of things to do aside the main story. There's been a while since a game made me play so many hours. Graphics, gameplay and combat style reminds me of Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order so if you played that game and Harry Potter is a franchise you like this game might suit you for sure. I would have liked to play an online mode or coop mode, I think we will be seeing some story DLC later this year otherwise I don't think the game will make it as a possible GOTY at the end of the year"

6189,ML_ChadThunderC0ck,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059350783/,1,,1,18.1,February,16,186,0,1,"I'll preface this review by saying that before purchasing this game I had EXTREMELY low expectations for it, and am still not fully finished with the main quest. I've also enjoyed the HP series since I was a kid so a good Hogwarts game is something I've been wanting for quite some time now.Now for the review (organized in bullets because I'm lazy):- No Pausing for cut-scenes or dialogue. What the ACTUAL ****! You have no choice but to either skip these entirely or just let it play out. If I have to get up to go do something, I should at the very least be able to pause so I can choose whether to finish the dialogue or not. - World is lackluster. To be fair, there's a LOT of stuff to go do in the game. An overwhelming amount. I just wish there were more cool sights to see. After exploring the open world for a few hours at a time I find myself getting bored and playing something else for a bit.- Combat. Not too shabby, the effects are pretty good, and of course it feels pretty sweet being able to cast spells and what not. After a while everything feels a bit repetitive. After getting some levels, you do have the option of having different spell sets, even then I find myself only using one or two sets of the same spells over and over again.- Graphics are good. It isn't the most amazing looking game that I've seen come out of the recent years. It does look pretty great running it on maximum graphical settings but there's a MASSIVE caveat to this. This game is poorly optimized for AMD CPU architecture (at least I think that's what's happening). My PC should be able to steadily run this on Ultra at 1080p 60fps, however, in areas like Hogsmeade or Hogwarts itself, it absolutely CHUGS. I'm talking as low as 10fps in some instances. Now I understand this is loading an insane amount of textures almost seamlessly, but the magic of not having a loading screen behind doors is taken away almost completely with the massive valleys in performance.While I was expecting this game to release and be another AAA failure like CyberPunk, No Man's Sky, etc. It wasn't. There's plenty of things to do, as one of those people that run through the main questline as fast as possible and do the collectible stuff later, I still find myself getting distracted by side-missions and collectables. If you're looking for a good Harry Potter game, this is it. The world feels fairly developed for what it is, I just wish it didn' t have such a hefty price tag either. This review may end up getting edited as I continue my play through."
6190,Sleepy Rat Squad,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TotesFleisch/,1,,1,60.4,February,16,563,1,1,"8/10Overall I'm really enjoying the game, but some aspects are kind of meh. This is pretty much the game I've wished for since I was a kid reading the books. Just let me be a student at Hogwarts, and this game nails that and expands on it in great ways.THE WORLDAbsolutely perfect. Looks fantastic, is fund and beautiful to explore. The environment artists on this game knocked it out of the park. Seriously, they did an amazing job on the Castle and World.MAIN STORY LINEI am very much enjoying going through the main quests and side quests. There is decent storytelling and a good amount of variety in your quests. It's been very enjoyable going through these.PUZZLESMain gripes, there is not a lot of depth to the ""puzzles"" in the game. The tone of the game can lean on the more mature side, but the puzzles seem geared more towards kids. They are very basic to solve and often times I found myself overthinking something when trying to solve a puzzle. Often just missing a legend somewhere that tells you the missing info. They don't rely on clever ways to use your spells to solve something, it's more of just use this spell on everything to solve this puzzle. If you've played BOTW you'll know they take the abilities available to you and build elaborate puzzles around them. Not the case in this game. Most of the puzzle types you'll just end up doing the same thing over and over again to the point it gets boring and tedious.INTERFACEI have some issues with this. Potions and plants all require you to select them first, then deploy them. This leads to really clunky gameplay that is not fun. Most of the time I find myself avoiding using potions and plants as they are not smooth to use. Mounting your broom/flying mount should just be one button. I shouldn't have to bring up a menu to mount and dismount. This again leads to clunky gameplay that is frustrating at times when it doesn't need to be. These are really my only gripes, that and I need more spell hotbars - 4 is not enough. At least give me enough for every spell in my book so I'm not constantly switching out spells just to do one simple thing. Other than that, everything else is great.NAVIGATIONGreat so far. Running places, fast travel, flying mounts are all great. I found myself just sticking to the broom as it's quicker to mount/dismount/navigate  Granted I've only unlocked one flying upgrade for my broom so far, but I'm hoping the next ones improve on handling while flying. Flying on your broom kind of feels like a boat in the air. Turning, going up and down are kind of sluggish. I've just unlocked the flying creatures but I have found the broom more handy since it takes off, accelerates, and lands much smoother. This is a shame as the creatures should be an upgrade to using a broom in my opinion.COMBATCombat is pretty fun, it's great stringing together spell combos and blocking/dodging. It's a blast when you get the hang of it. My only gripe on combat is the limited spell hot bars leaves me using only two hot bars worth of spells for combat. This is not sufficient with the amount of spells in the game.CREATURES/CRAFTINGThese are areas in the game I really wish were expanded on. They're pretty basic when it comes to any kind of progression - it's very linear and not at all robust. Brewing potions is basic, there's only one version of potions, a huge missed opportunity to expand on that system in my opinion. Having plant quality, and potion quality levels would go a long way to help make this a more interesting system. Unlocking upgrades for stronger potions, etc. Same goes with the gear. It's pretty basic in that you get a new piece then upgrade it 4x. Most of the gear you come across you will sell immediately. It would be nice to have a more expanded system of upgrades and customization for your particular spell playstyle. Creatures are much the same way, only really scratch the surface of what should be possible with them. I feel like there is some depth there they can plumb to make that system more engaging and interesting. Catching them is also pretty disappointing. You use the same method for every type of creature you can craft. I would prefer having to use different methods for different creatures to add a bit more interest and challenge when it comes to catching them.Overall the game is solid and I'm glad I purchased it.EDIT: After finishing the main story and the bulk of the side quests, I'm kind of disappointed with the depth of things. I haven't even explored the map fully, and there's no real incentive to do so other than being a completionist. The ""puzzles"" and repetitive tasks you can do on the map get stale pretty quickly. And there's no real point in doing them once you've unlocked all the progression tasks. A real shame because it is a beautiful world to explore and be in, just need more interesting and rewarding things to do. A lot of the systems remained shallow with no real interesting mechanics. There are a ton of bandit camps on the map, that reward you with an item you can use to augment your gear. The problem with this system is 99% of those augments are useless. You can use the same augment on each piece of gear, which is nice, but it leads to really overpowered things like using the tier 3 plant upgrade, then throwing chomping cabbages everywhere. They melt everything. Really bland itemization at the end of the day."

6193,Harley K. (Lyskari),https://steamcommunity.com/id/HarleyKyn/,1,,1,57.5,February,16,225,0,1,"Though I've not yet completed the game, I have found that it keeps me coming back with the same level of excitement each and every day I get to play it. First I want to tackle the concerns about it being antisemetic. I know there has been allegations of anti-semetism, with specific focus on Goblins. The goblins feel like goblins, such as one would find in D&D or World of Warcraft. I know in the movies and books there have been problematic things, but so far I've not seen anything in this game that would be disrespectful, though as someone who is not Jewish, please do not take this to mean more than what it is. I cannot speak for a culture and people I do not belong to. (See also: I'm not saying it is antisemetic and I'm not saying it's not antisemetic. I'm just saying I, as someone outside the culture, do not see anything that makes me immediately think of the Jewish people when I interact or see the goblins.) Now for the gameplay! Perhaps one of my favourite things about this game is the fact it doesn't simply give me every tool right from the start. I like to complete what side-quests I can in between main story quests, just to ensure the pacing doesn't go too fast (and miss out on the fun of the side-quests). Even after hours of play I still don't have every single thing unlocked, and though I'm getting much closer with each set of quests, it feels brilliantly paced. The open world, though small according to the map size, still feels rather large because there are so many things to do and to enjoy. The controls feel very smooth and I don't find myself struggling to remember my keybinds as they were kind enough to provide little hints for those with their UI. Story wise it's very intriguing and it keeps me coming back because I want to know more, I want to know how it plays out which means I need to play it to know what happens! There is so much to do and it's so varied, and I feel they break things up really well. I'm also obsessed with the various puzzles. I find them just challenging enough to not be boring, but not so ridiculously challenging that I can't figure it out. With the exception being jump puzzles, so if you are weak at jump puzzles like me, those will suck a little but they definitely aren't the hardest ones I've come across. Just a bit frustrating. The voice acting is pretty strong, with my only complaint being that the player character with the feminine voice can sound a bit flat... not necessarily monotoned, just a bit too flat at times and a bit too calm considering the story the player character is going through. But it's a very mild gripe and it doesn't hinder my ability to enjoy the game at all. Mechanically, I love the combat system. I love it so much. There are so many ways you can mix and match your spells and there are other tools you can use as well that make it varied and fun to experiment with. It also feels relatively clean and smooth. It can get a little bit tricky when facing larger groups of combatants though, and the different shield types can be a little bit annoying to get used to fighting against. But once you figure it out, it can be reeeeaaaally smooth. Flying. Flying is pretty great. Smooth and simple to do. I hope that perhaps they'll release an expansion or something for quidditch, but I do see why they likely didn't include it in the game. Though the flying is fun and relatively smooth, I don't know how well it'd work with how quidditch plays. That said, they do have some activities you can use your flying for which makes it all the more enjoyable! There are some areas where they are a little too vague with their instruction but I find these to be very very very few and far between. Most times if you can't figure it out, if you just look around for some basic clues, you'll kind of piece things together. So needless to say if puzzles and riddles are not your thing, you maaaaaay hate some of the puzzles and riddles. But if puzzles and riddles are your thing, then this has a great selection of puzzles and riddles to enjoy! And lastly, the overall character designs. I really love how varied and diverse the side characters are! And that they actually play some important roles as side characters. It was cool to see. There is a lot of diversity in the game that I really appreciate (especially considering the issues with Rowling). So it was good to see the gaming company opting for that diversity and embracing it to the point that even the voice acting comes with a wealth of variety that seems to perfectly match the side character and where they come from. Now, don't mistake this to mean that everything is super authentic. I don't know if they are. I can't say. They aren't my cultures. But I do recognize the diversity they did bring and I applaud it and hope for even more in the future, with hopefully even more and more and more accuracy."

6208,OccamAsylum,https://steamcommunity.com/id/OccamAsylum/,1,,1,68.1,February,16,388,0,1,"When I first heard about this game I wasn't excited for it. My expectations were rather low and I figured I would probably end up waiting for a deep sale before attempting to play this game. Then the controversy happened and I paid more attention to the development around this game. My curiosity was piqued and my interest in actually playing the game confirmed after watching ACG's review of it. I decided to pay full price for this game and give it a chance.I am happy to say my doubts were proven wrong. The sound in this game between effects and music is incredible. However, my biggest complaint is my characters voice. It almost sounds tinny and robotic. Hopefully that gets corrected in a patch.The graphics are good! Not amazing but very good. The weirdest thing would really be the facial animations.The combat and exploration is the best part of this game bar none. The spell combat is what really surprised me. I expected it to be boring and repetitive and it is anything but that. You can get creative with your approach to enemies and the encounters can be challenging in a satisfying way. The exploration is self explanatory. Getting to explore the castle and this world yields many rewarding surprises. If you have the funds and are on the fence, I suggest diving in and having a good time. You will not regret it. At the time of writing this review I am still less than 50% of the way through the quests.Edit:After finishing the game I will add that the ending was underwhelming to me. I had more fun with the rest of the content that built up to the end."

6219,ZΣNAJ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/E-3046/,1,,1,70.3,February,16,231,1,1,"I Like the game, it is a true product of love for any Harry Potter fan. It has beautiful aesthetics, a large open world to explore far beyond the school grounds and a lot of secrets to discover alongside people that need help. It offers quite a lot of versatility with the way one would like to dress up, experience the game and the path to follow.However while these things are there to keep you busy, there are a few things I must point out that make the entire Harry Potter feeling a little bit ""off"". First of all the setting, everything is ""just a little bit different"", there are a few points and locations that make it feel like hogwarts; however, in the long run the gameplay felt more like a fusion of harry potter with a bit of elden ring. Apart from that, I think the game suffers from not having a morality system. This is especially shown with the fact that unforgiveable spells can be casted back and forth like normal spells with no repercussions whatsoever. On top of this, the ""friendships"" you aquire through the game feel...hollow, you talk with some people and get to know them a little bit and help them along their problems. But it never gives off the old Harry Potter feeling of having friends with you that help you get through different missions and grow close with them. The only one I remotely felt this with, was with Sebastian. Then of course to get the obvious out of the way (at least at the current moment) there is no quidditch or multiplayer, I think it would also compliment the game if cooperative gameplay would be an option. On the topic of storytelling, I found that the story again felt like more of a story out of Lord of the Rings instead of a Harry Potter universe related one.Apart from these things, I still think that HP fans can have a really fun time with this game, the duelling feels incredibly smooth. The fact that you can finally jump on your own broom or other mount and just fly wherever you please is a treat if I've ever seen one. Concluding, the game is really good but I still believe that it has potential for so much more."

Just got knocked to the ground 1 hit from death? Can use health pots while you can't move. Spells & fighting feels great but ends wayy too quickly, a simple combo kills most enemies. Main story is interesting but honestly kinda liked the side quests for unforgivable curses more. Good amount of content variety but not much depth to all of it, a lot of easy repetition for ""challenges"" to unlock things. Most challenges are entirely cosmetic rewards & don't look great.Overall like the game, even though very easy but I think that's mostly because it's Hogwarts.

It reminds me alot about the movies and the best part I can travel to hogsmeade at anytime to buy potion supplies or sell extra pieces of gear I dont need! Also another aspect I really happen to enjoy about this game is able to sneak about in some areas of the castle and be out past curfew without having to be on actual hogwarts grounds.A word about the boss fights as well I totally enjoy the mechanics they have came up with its a real challenge to block dodge and fire off spells to defeat enemies! a most unique combat system indeed!Second thing I have noticed within the steam community is the constant bashing of the performance, well let me just say I have cleared this issue up and the game runs like a dream for me I do not have the fps drop nor does the graphics look terrible for being on low. I had slow load times between travel but I disabled the ""full screen optimizations"" on the properties menu and i no longer have that problem and before you ask my game hasnt crashed on me at all since realese, overall I would recommend this game not only if your a harry potter fan but enjpy any type of game that has fantasy aspects."

This is one hell of a great game, i absolutely love every bit of it and im not biased towards it if some1 thinks i'm just saying it cause i might've been growing up alongside Harry Potter movies and books. It's beautiful, well made game with interesting story and characters, love the ""pokemon"" system and the fact that there are shiny beasts (i do hope we will get more beasts and actual Phoenix den/spawn in the future). Also love that fact that we can partially play the role of ""bad boy/girl"" through learning unforgivable curses while they don't impact the final story outcome but still makes us feel badass cause characters do acknowledge and feel caution towards us IF we choose to learn those curses. I have tons of praises for this game and i absolutely love it. By far the best SP game i played since Witcher 3!"

6268,EJHowell,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198297954896/,1,,1,80.6,February,16,66,1,1,"The game has a lot of good points and bad points, although I do believe that the good far out ways the bad.Visuals:The game looks amazing, even with me playing with a lot of settings on low and without ray-tracing enabled, although a brief look with ray-tracing was amazing. The world is largely interesting with places such as Hogwarts being magnificently well done, the castle is massive and sprawling and would take a long time to memorise your way around it. Spells/Combat:The selection of spells available is limited to around 26, though they do include all the spells that you'd actually want to use, in my time I never really thought of any other spell I'd like to have.This leads into the combat, which is good, if not a little repetitive, you need to use certain spells to break enemy shields, you can combo spells to juggle enemies and all the while you are building up a meter for some super strong attacks. The game does seemingly attempt to combat the repetitiveness by the inclusion of mini-challenges known as dueling feats. For example the game will say, hold enemies in the air for 10 seconds, or disarm an enemy and hit them with their own weapon. Little things that help to make each fight feel a tad more unique. The spells also see use outside of combat, be that for solving puzzles, destroying debris and spider webs or even allowing you to capture magical beasts.Story:The main story is good, not amazing but pretty good overall, I personally think it's better near the start and picks up again at the end. There are lots of interesting quests, such as sneaking into a castle and an illegal dog-fighting arena. Many of the side-quests are unique and interesting, some of the side characters, mainly Sebastian (a Slytherin student) has an excellent questline which to me is probably one of, if not the coolest and most interesting in the game. Overall, the character writing is very good and you really do come to like a lot of the cast. I will say, that the game often feels like you should be able to bring someone with you all the time, because sometimes on quests people, like Sebastian, will quip back and forth with you and make it more fun.The open world:The open world is a bit of a mixed bag, the game gives you relatively interesting ways to travel (by broom or on the back of flying creatures) so I never really got bored of the standard traversal. The world suffers from to much of the same thing, there are often so many random collectibles around that there is nearly always one on your minimap. These fall into a couple of categories, Merlin trials, which are a type of puzzle scattered throughout the world, there is various types of these which require different spells to solve and have a varyng level of difficulty. There are pages to be collected throughout, bandit camps to clear, catacombs to enter (though the catacombs are often very small), magical fragments to gather and more. There is almost too much in the world and none of it has a massive amount of depth to it, though they work well as distractions on your way from quest to quest.Gear:The gear system is probably one of the worst parts, you can apply appearances to make your gear look however you want but the gear itself consists of 6 items, head, face, hands, neck, back and outfit, all of these have offence and defence stats assigned to them. Gear can be upgraded to add offence or defence to it, as well as attaching enchantments to do things like increase spell damage or decrease damage from a given enemy type. Actually getting materials to upgrade is tedious and annoying as you harvest them from beasts you rescue, which then go on a timer that can be as long as 30 mins to get more.Customisation:You can choose from preset faces and hairstyles, altering colours etc, there are some scar options but they are limited to exact positions and colours. The clothing options for you character are pretty decent, though many of the facewear items I found to be rather poor, There are various unique clothing pieces that are unlocked through challenges, such as defeat 20 dark wizards.Overall:I'd recommend the game, and since I got it I've been struggling to put it down."

Side missions, collectables, and many things that are boring in other open world games, feel interesting and fit well. I'm constantly getting distracted by them because of curiosity for the world you're in. This will be one of the few games i 100% and i think it will be the most enjoyable one to do it in.I recommend playing on hard.Only downsides after 11 hours are:- Flying broomstick feels too easy, but makes sense as it's made for transportation.  I'd love to be able to crash though.- Just released so optimisation isn't there yet.- Can't change characters name or appearance.- Changing outfit is annoying as the robe covers it so have to take it off and put it back on. A hide robe button would be niceQuidditch DLC and Quidditch multiplayer please."

For the 3 other houses I stopped after the jackdaws mission. All 4 houses got a different story line at least till than. In my perspective they can easily make a book or film of this game.I enjoyed it very much and even I paid 49 euro for the presale deluxe edition it was worth every penny.The developers put in a lot of love in the game. Which you can see in the details.Furthermore, a flawless release for me for a AA game is ages ago.Though I have a minor bug for the saving Biscuit mission which results in not getting 100% completion or reaching level 40. I can live with that minor bug on release. In meanwhile there is a bug fix for the PC version. Although the characters can feel sometimes robotic the graphics where astonishing as is the story line. Combat system is a bit refreshing for me. Though drinking and creating potion is like The witcher 3.You wont regret it purchasing it at full price."

Yes, I realize that saying that is tainting the pudding by starting off with such a subjective statement such as I did, but I truly mean that in every definable definition of the word. Beautiful. The first thing that truly excited me, beyond the very premise of the game, was when I was asked to link my account with my old Pottermore account. Now I am not a stranger to every single online presence asking me to link accounts, and because of that I was already decidedly against doing such a thing, but the game promised me “special rewards” for doing so. I am glad I did.The story of the game revolves around the idea that there is an Ancient Magic that exists, but has been mostly forgotten. There are a select few Wizards that can see and use it, and you happen to be one of them. Because of this special trait, your professor and current escort to Hogwarts, Professor Fig takes notice, and you and he set off on an adventure trying to discover the secrets of this Ancient Magic. According to Steam I have played Hogwarts Legacy for 16 hours as of the writing of this post. I have discovered a rather sizable portion of what the castle has to offer, and some of the surrounding grounds, but I know I have barely scratched the surface of the game, and I am nowhere close to revealing all of it’s secrets. I am over level 20, but the story quests I am on are labeled as level 8 quests. This is not a problem however because all of the enemies scale with your gear and level. I think this is a great feature and promotes playing the game at your own pace. It is hard not to sing the praises of this game, as I had initially hoped that it would be good, but seeing as it was a game tied to a license, I wasn’t holding my breath. The depth and breadth of this game blow me away, and I cant wait to play more and continue my fifth year at Hogwarts!Read my full thoughts in my blog:"

I can't even get past the initial disclaimer.  So as of right now, I can't recommend it in spite of the good time I've had.-UPDATE-It's not longer unplayable for me thankfully and it runs much much better after the updates but it's still not perfect.  With that being said I don't think the occasional lag is enough to bog down the experience as a whole even though Hogsmeade is still extremely annoying to walk through for a long period of time because of it."

I believe core game is a 9/10 for me, i pick it up and struggle to put it down; and keep hoping for it to not end. The main quests are engaging with multiple plot points and endings, while side quests add the extra bit of lore; for the avid fans.Don't get me wrong the game has its flaws, it took me an hour or so to tweak the game on launch day to get it running with no stutter or FPS drops. I do not believe this is something we should have to do but it seems like all AAA games these days have some form of performance issues on release.In conclusion if you just want to sit back and immerse yourself in the world of witches,,, pick it up you wont regret it. Its just what i needed for a single player fantasy game."

The world is charming and immersive, and a host of RPG elements, such as talent points and options to customise your character, add to the complexity of Hogwarts Legacy. Only the lack of a morality system that would influence the gameplay through choices of good or evil and the absence of a romantic relationship feature tarnish the gameplay experience somewhat. I sorely miss the latter in particular, as I immediately felt an attraction to some of the wonderfully animated magical creatures and could hardly wait to pursue this curiosity as the game progressed. Unfortunately, however, ""Hogwarts Legacy"" prevents me from kissing Deek on his hot lips, therefore 8/10."

The development team who made this game were really committed to making something great. They have done a great job in adhering to the lore and ambiance of the fantastical world of Harry Potter and opening up our understanding of Hogwarts and the world around it. When first getting into a Hogwarts house you can tell the attention to detail straight away. When finally  getting on to later parts of the story and you are free to roam all over Hogwarts and the land about It left me with the feeling that my fever dreams of a good Harry potter game, that I believed I had played as a child, being able to see and interact with all the things that made the world so interesting.This game has  stunning visuals, a decant story and a wonderful world that I believe most of us have been curious about exploring at least a little bit. If you like, or are at least somewhat interested in, the Harry Potter world I would give this game a go(at least for the story and ambiance.)(SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT)Now If you are here for the gameplay and so on it is not all sunshine and rainbows. For at least the first 3-4 hours of the game, if you are not just always going straight for the main story quests, you will be just running all around Hogwarts and are unable to truly be free to explore the grounds around with your broom and griffin.(combat)The combat is a bit interesting with how it tries to “soft” auto lock onto enemies and so you will find yourself firing your spells at unintended targets. You can somewhat stun lock yourself in a “you can't do that right now” action in combat allowing enemies to get some hits in on you even when you do hit the deflect, or dodge at a perfect timing. This makes “hard” difficulty not only hard but near impossible in the beginning of the game when you only have one set of spells and no way to truly know when the cool down is done. This will make you unable to finish main quests to give you more spells and spell pools to begin with.I Would recommend easy or normal for the best experience in having a challenge but not an impossibility in combat.(story)Not going to actually go much into the story but there are many many cut scenes and some do go on for some time. Most of the interesting ones like seeing what actually goes on in class seem to be skipped over via a montage of how the class was going. There is a special quest for each Hogwarts house and you will need to play the game multiple times (or play and look it up later) to see all the game has to offer in this aspect.(side quests)So. Many. Side quests. The number one resource for experience to level up is the main story quests and side quests as the story will only progress with the main story quests there will also be an abundance of side quests that will pop up all over the map and just show up in your quest menu out of nowhere. If you are a completionist be very careful considering taking up the challenge. there it a 70+ hour investment in finding and completing everything.In short it is a passion project that we all could have used years ago and I'm glad we finally got it."

I have no shame in playing in 'story mode' as I'm mostly a cosy gamer and adore RP- but I have never experienced a game like this that truly reminds me of what it felt like to be a child. It is so incredibly alive and, even in the darkest times, there is a lighthearted atmosphere and sense of camaraderie that keeps you motivated to explore, learn and listen. (Mind you I am a lecturer and the least competitive gamer).Being a Huffelpuff with ADHD, it is in my nature to get distracted and immerse myself completely in the surroundings, getting blissfully lost in the magical world, where everything responds to my presence. There is whimsy and mystery around every corner, and it seems vast and endless- without the player feeling lonely or bored. Yes there are many things that can improve- the impact of your choices, potential co-op, some stale story plot points and pacing, some graphics performance stuff-  but so far this is the best game I have played...ever, I think?

The mechanics and puzzles are challenging but not impossible or overwhelming. The Hogwarts professors are lovely, the details and complexity of the whole game map is amazing. The features and equipment are paced well - there's so much and even after over 40 hours in I know there's still more things to unlock! This is probably my new favorite game of all time. <3"

Additionally it causes a black screen after the seizure warning prompt and doesn't work after. Hopefully this issue gets addressed soon because when I could play the game it was pretty fun."

Exploration is wonderful, combat is brilliant, quests are fun. Anyone saying there are performance issues should get a better PC. I have not yet experienced a single bug, error, crash, stutter, or ...anything negative!!! For that ALONE, it is unique among the hordes of half-finished games that get pushed out by AAA companies (Looking at you, Electronic Arts and Activision), not to mention the clear effort and love put into this game.I had the same feelings playing this as when I played the original Starcraft on release day. I'm not used to having feelings anymore. Easily worth the price just for that! This is the first game I've paid $60 for that I felt actually deserved that and more!To the devs: I love you. If I ever meet you, I'm buying you drinks."

My initial review was based on having played much faster paced games more recently. HL does have a 'hold your hand' feel to it, and plenty of mechanics to help you solve riddles/puzzles, and couple take a little longer than others, but that is okay. The fight mechanics are great. While  I didn't really get into using all the mechanics available to you (e.g. herbology, potions) I still was able to complete every major task presented, and then some. Some of the recurring trials, Merlin, got a little old, same task different location. But all in all a good game for 113 hours of play."
6451,DonnMa,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198134524142/,1,,1,36.4,February,15,146,0,1,"Juego de mundo abierto que trae unas cuantas cosas innovadoras al mercado, al tratarse e inspirarse en la saga de Harry Potter, pero deja bastante que desear. Principales críticas que puedo hacer son las siguientes:-Como la gran mayoría de los juegos de mundo abierto, las misiones se vuelven muy repetitivas. -Carencia de especies y bestias para atrapar y ""salvar""-Escaso uso de animaciones del personaje principal y NPC.-Sistema de batalla bastante entretenido pero muy sencillo-Economía muerta, es fácil hacer dinero pero tiene utilidad solo en early game-Sistema de pociones sin sentido, realmente no influye en gran medida usarlas o no en batalla y son muy pocas-No está disponible el ""Quidditch"" (hasta el momento)-Sistema de armaduras y vestimentas mal aplicadas. Es muy fácil obtenerlas y no supone un reto el ""armar"" tu personaje y conseguir así mejores estadísticas.A pesar de las críticas, aun así lo recomiendo. El mapa es medianamente grande, bonitos gráficos y ese toque mágico y misterioso propio de Hogwarts te atrapa. La historia es entretenida y hay un sinfín de misiones secundarias. El hecho de poder volar en una escoba merece jugarlo."
6452,Taco Cat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/datacocat/,1,,1,95.9,February,15,452,0,1,"Everything aside, this is a great game and it's totally worth buying at full price (after today's update, I'm getting a consistent 60 FPS, see specs below)The game is great - Combat is fun and sometimes challenging, the exploration pulls you in to a point that you almost forget you're not actually in Hogwarts. It's a solid game, besides the rocky PC launch.The story, I thought, was fantastic and really captured the atmosphere and vibe of the franchise. My only real complaint is the lack of consequences. I was really hoping this wouldn't be a fully linear story, and for the most part, it is. It would have been really cool if I really could create my adventure thru the decisions I made and spells I chose to use. Don't let that sway you tho, buy the game, enjoy the game - and don't forget to care for your magical creatures. SPECS: Ryzen 5 3600 with a 2070 Super and 16GB of RAM. I'm running the game on high settings with RTX off, and DLSS set to quality mode. I can run it on Ultra, but that starts to create some slight stuttering. I figure it's just my hardware but running on performance mode fixes it - I just don't like how performance looks."

Anything from magical beasts to killing curses.In this review i'm gonna touch on multiple points where the game falls short and where it absolutely destroys the competition, so strap your seat belts! Let's start with pros and cons! Hogwarts legacy is a fantastic game if you're a pre-established gamer that is already a fan of the Harry potter universe!I'd also recommend this to anyone who enjoyed shadow of war/mordor, or loves collectables!

6479,Dux Imperius,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DuxImperius112/,1,,1,83.0,February,15,51,0,1,"Right off the bat- I need to address that I am in way too deep looking through the nostalgia glasses. I am incredibly biased, so just keep that in mind.Controversy- In my opinion, the game's backlash is incredibly shallow. I agree that JKR is incredibly bigoted, and that it's a huge shame she is so blind to a lot of important issues nowadays. But, that being said- the game developers have made something really special here. They have distanced themselves from her in every way possible. She had 0 input on the game- all she did was give a green light. They included a trans character (even though the setting is 1800's) in order to help fight the hate. Everyone that is hating on the game- is hating just to hate. They are blinded by it and are just grossly misled. I understand they are fighting for something important, but a lot of people are going about it in such a wrong way and it's incredibly discouraging. Tying a very real issue to something that has virtually no connection with the problematic person is daft. Incredibly dumb- but unfortunately it is how a lot of the world works today. The game is good- let it be good. JKR is problematic- let he be problematic away from Hogwarts Legacy. The developers have jumped through so many hoops in order to separate themselves from her- and their effort isn't being appreciated enough.Story telling- 7/10. Overall- I think the way this game tells stories is very good. It's not groundbreaking in any way, and absolutely not the best I've ever seen. But I will say there are a couple missions (side missions mind you) that pushed me to tears. Dialogue- 6/10. Paired with some of the animations, I think this is one of the games biggest weaknesses. The first word that comes to mind is basic. It tells the story, and gives you a basis to understand what's going on- and that's great. But more often than not, you find yourself rolling your eyes or knowing exactly how the conversation is going to play out as soon as they say the first few words- which means that even as a die hard Harry Potter fan- I found myself skipping dialogue on my first play through.Visuals- 7/10 overall.         -Performance: 3/10. On my mid level PC- not the best. Every single time I play, Loading new areas is incredibly difficult. I turned all graphics to the lowest setting, and still there are some pretty major stutters and loading times. For reference- I can run Cyberpunk on almost max graphics with zero stuttering issues- Yet it happens in this game around every 15 minutes.        -Graphics: 9/10. Due to performance issues, I'm having to run my game on the lowest possible graphics. Even with this- the game still looks great. I still have over 100 screenshots of the game enjoying how the game looks. I've seen gameplay of the highest graphics, and all of the praise in that aspect is completely deserved.        -Animations: 9/10. Spells, Running, Idle, Interactions... all of them are completely stellar. The spells feel fresh and satisfying to use. Seeing an enemy being flipped in the air by Flipendo, Seeing an enemy stiffen and fall like a statue instead of rag dolling due to Petrificus Totalus, The flames of Confringo or Incendio.... All of the spells in this game are beautiful and feel like home. The spells in the world of HP are fantastic and so great to see come to life with you as the caster. My only gripe on animations- Faces. Particularly NPC facial expressions are pretty outdated. basic rigging instead of motion capture. The rigging is still phenomenal- don't get me wrong. But rigging will never come close to motion capture and the age of Avalanche's technology on that front are beginning to show in this aspect.Completionist- This game is a very rich world to explore. I am always a sucker for open world games- and this one delivers on that front- even more than some of the greatest in my opinion. You constantly get pulled in so many different directions when playing. You could have a marker for a quest, you head for it- and see 15-20 other things in the way that catch your eye and before you know it, an hour passes and you forgot all about that quest. Some people see this as a gripe- But to me its a sign of a truly rich world. A place that feels alive. No matter how much you know about Harry Potter and the lore that went into every inch of the world and the game- If you enjoy open world RPG's, this is absolutely a must play. Loyal fans- This game is undoubtedly a love child of passion for every single developer that worked hard to give us this masterpiece. If you know ANYTHING about HP before playing, you will recognize it being represented in the game. Hundreds of references- coming from fantastic environmental storytelling. The more you enjoy HP and love the franchise- the more nostalgic you will feel playing the game. I promise if you even mildly enjoyed the movies/books- This game is a dream come true.Nostalgia- I am a die hard HP fan. I have been my entire life- My parents allowed me to go see midnight showings in middle school as long as I read the books beforehand. Harry Potter will always be very dear to me, I grew up with it. This game is undoubtedly an ode to that world. A beautiful experience I will cherish for the rest of my life, and show my kids when they can hold controllers. The more you enjoy HP- the more you will enjoy this game. I promise. It is a work of art and in my book, it is already one of my favorite games of all time.Replayability- The story is at least a little different with each house. Not to mention different dialogue options that give your character a different feel. I think it is definitely replayable, but not as much as some other open world games like Elden Ring or Shadow of War/Mordor. Room of Requirement/Vivarium- I really love what they did with this space in game. It is a very clever use of some basic gameplay mechanics in order to create a 'base' feeling area. With almost limitless potential, the game has for the most part delivered. You are rewarded for exploring the world with decorations and other fun bits to place around the RoR with almost complete freedom. It feels satisfying to see, and for me- is absolutely going to add an additional 100 hours of gameplay. It makes me want to find everything out in the overworld, in order to truly deck out my RoR.   The Vivarium is undoubtedly my most anticipated aspect of the game. Personally, I have always loved the beasts of the HP world and in the first gameplay trailer where they revealed the Vivarium and how it worked- I preordered the game before the video could end. I was incredibly hyped for what was possible. Being able to interact with these creatures is 100% a dream come true for me. All of that being said- I did find the vivarium to be at least a little disappointing. You are only allowed to have 4 different species in a space at a time. Granted you do unlock more spaces- still it feels bad to have to move between spaces in order to place down my creatures. I wanted to create a zoo. I imagined a walkway where I could look and see my creatures in little pens. I'd be satisfied with a way to connect the spaces eventually even. (I haven't completed the game- maybe that is a possibility but I doubt it.)Unlocking- I feel you unlock things very slowly. Having 43 hours in the game as I'm writing this- I unlocked my flying mount at around 40 hours in. A minor gripe- But unlocking most important convenience items would have been welcomed sooner into the story.There are only a few minor gripes I had about the game, and over 1000 great things I could say about it. If you're considering buying it- Do it. You will not regret it, I promise."

This is the kind of Harry Potter game that I have waited for since I was a kid first reading the books.The world is so keenly detailed and looks so damn amazing. The combat is fun and can really keep you on your toes. The broom flight is fantastic. The characters are really well done, the three main students all have really well made story lines. The story itself is pretty good, the villians are decent. Didn't have really any issues running the game either, only a couple frame drops in Hogwarts and one crash which never happened again. I do wish the optimized the spell wheels for the Room of Requirement section as that tended to get a bit annoying having to keep changing out the spells for it.10/10, this game exceeded my expectations and then some."

I'm also debating if I should buy a copy for every gender that exists.  The toxic transgender people* activists convinced me to to buy it now. I have my own, I'll buy the other for my friend.But, on a more serious note... It's crazy how well respecting the fans & source material along with avoiding pandering for woke points actually works. Who would've thought?Optimization wise, whew, it's quite rough... This game, unfortunately, isn't killing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... it's killing my graphics card. At moments the game just decides to follow the path of 51% of a certain minority and straight up commit suicide for a few seconds especially when loading new areas in the castle thus causing stutters. The game is very playable on my rig with DLSS but turning on Ray Tracing makes everything choppy and unplayable on video cards that aren't ranked at the top of the enthusiast price point...Graphics look pretty good and the atmosphere achieves what it intended. The OST is what it needs to be too. The story looks decent so far, a bit heavy on the dialogue but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you need to, you don't really have to pay attention to what's being said as the game is showing you most answers anyway. What I mean by that, though, is that the game likes to hold your hand and spoon-feed you the answer to every quest in the game through and through without the ability to turn off the way too generous hints.If you're a Harry Potter fan and the universe then this game is probably exactly what you've been looking for. Even for people like me that yes, I am not a hardcore harry potter fan but that doesn't make Hogwarts Legacy any less enjoyable, just make sure that your rig can run it alright..Also, YOU CAN PET CATS!Thumbs up as the LGBT Mafia copes & seethes;*really stretching the definition of the word ""people"""

Instead of giving you the option to add more spells to that selection, you have to unlock additional selections of 4 spells to switch between during combat, because that's all a console controller can handle. That's the only criticism I can come up with after +20h of gameplay.If you enjoy Harry Potter: play this gameIf you enjoy single player game: play this game.If you enjoy a mix of exploration with sidequests, combat, crafting and challenges: play this game.Really, this game is a  for me and it has my fullest recommendation!"

I am truly bored with it now, its difficult for me to step back in after knowing that once you complete the main story line, the game is just a big bore.

Just Hogwarts is super big, but there is so much more than it.- The game just keeps on giving: whenever you decide you've seen what the game is about and it's gonna just be playing the story, it introduces more and more game modules, places, spells, classes, etc.- It captures the Harry Potter magic feeling. It does make you feel like a student at Hogwarts.Highly recommend!- Bonus points: you can link it with your Wizarding World account and it will use the result of your quzzes for which house do you belong to and what wand you have."

6515,Crazeddonkey,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DonkSquad/,1,,1,85.3,February,15,482,0,1,I just finished this game and i want to give an honest opinion! This world was one of the most intricately crafted and beautiful set pieces that could ask for in an open world experience. The story being set hundreds of years before one of my favorite novels is a added bonus. I loved every second playing through side quests and meeting new characters! I am one for 100% every game i see though and that is where i ran into my first issue. I consistently ran into issues where quests would disappear from my list and after my first play through i was left at 99%... Super aggravating nothing game breaking but still having a single side quest that never adds to your log because you wanted to explore early seems like a disservice to anyone that knows how to craft an open world game. The game has great controls on the xbox controller. I will say other than Elden ring this is 1 of 3 games that i will replay to explore the world further. Is it worth the money? I'll answer that by saying have you ever played fable again after a year or so? Every person involved with this game deserves a huge round of applause on the execution of the launch. I hope yall add markers for every quest npc character since its sometimes seasonal then people are left frantically looking for things etc. THIS GAME IS VERY GOOD DONT LISTEN TO YOUR TV YOU SHEEP

I dislike grinding games and unnecessary side missions. The first time I played this game, I really didn't want to do any side missions. I tried one side mission and I found the story behind it quite intriguing. So I decided to do more side missions and don't know why I have been enjoying them LOL. the challenges of the side missions are mostly repetitive but the story or plot is not. each side mission has its own mysteries and other interesting facts about some people, hogwarts and the wizarding world. Every time there is a main mission, I always complete the side missions first. Honestly, this game is highly addictive and fascinating. I never feel bored playing this game for hours. I also realized that each house, such as Slytherin or Hufflepuff, has different and unique side missions.After I finished the game as Slytherin, I honestly wanted to try all the houses and replay the game from the beginning to experience all the different content in the game.The game mechanics are fairly straightforward and we get clues every time we encounter various enemies about their weaknesses and strengths in the menu.Mini games in the form of puzzles and such are also easy to do.

The game world is absolutely beautiful and you will want to stop and take screenshots at every corner. The performance is quite demanding, but I found that DLSS does a great job at giving you 20-30 more fps while keeping the graphics almost as good as regular.9/10 Even if you don't care about magic, the combat system is very well done and super fluid - in fact I can't remember a game that feels as fluid as this one. But if you are also a magic nerd, then the combat system is a real treat that finally makes you feel like a powerful wizard!10/10 Quite intriguing and well paced, however is drops a bit towards the end where it feels a bit rushed (though most games feel this way to be fair). Overall it's full of mystery and feels well suited for this universe and lore. 8/10 This game has some of the most memorable characters I've ever seen, with the highlight being the professors. Each has a distinct personality and they actually feel like a real person.10/10 While the open world is not up to the scale of games like Witcher 3, it's still pretty vast and full of places to discover. I liked how it felt ""alive"" - people live normal lives and are not static, you meet travelers on the roads or even see magical carts going around to trade goods. It feels like a cohesive living world.9/10 Some of the most gorgeous soundtracks, even from the game opening menu. There's times when I would just sit and listen to the music, and I am very picky when it comes to music! Really well done!Sound is crisp and on point, matching every magic spell accordingly. Audio cues are well spaced and you can always tell where something or someone is.10/10 9/10"

There's a lot of wonderful bits and pieces to devour and it's taking me longer to go thru the main quest line because of those. The drama of the NPCs are beyond the usual (if an npc lost her son, she will really give a cry), which further more sucks you into the world.This would have been great if they added an MMO feature as well --- Hopefully in the future, there's something like coop.

6545,Xorik,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xoriktu/,1,,1,31.0,February,15,149,0,1,"Even though I grew up with the Harry Potter book and film series, these weren't what drew me into the game, strangely enough. In terms of gameplay, I'm more for weapons or hand-to-hand combat person. I had to watch my friends play for the first few hours of the game to decide whether or not to buy the game. I bought this after deciding the combat was engaging enough for me.The Wizarding World definitely stays as true as it can to the original concept. All the spells, Hogwarts, magical creatures, etc. This game feels somewhat like how I feel towards Star Wars. Where lightsaber fighting in games are depicted in ways that are typically limited for live-action, this game makes the live-action films for Harry Potter pale in comparison when it comes to depictions of spell usage, potions, and magical creatures.There are plenty of activities in the game to do. Although you won't actually live the school life (which wasn't of interest to me), there are puzzles and trials throughout the game with some variety in what spells are needed to complete them. The mandatory puzzles along the storyline are completely doable with hints dropped if it takes you long to figure them out, and the option to choose combat difficulty makes the story accessible to those who wish to focus less on combat and more on story or character relations or vice versa. There is initial exposure to many of activities or quests, but you are mostly not required to engage in them. This pertains to players like myself who wish to focus on story and/or combat.Combat reminds me of Ghost of Tsushima. You have multiple options to approach these fights.Though the battles in Hogwarts Legacy don't give the same exhilaration I felt in GoT with its battle music, the enemies feel more threatening and less robotic, making combat satisfying.Overall, if you are looking for a fantasy magic-focused game with decent combat, puzzles, or story, I'd say this game has it all."

The atmosphere, which is most crucial part for anyone old enough to have watched the movies in theatre and/or read the books when they were released, is near damn perfect. I felt pulled into the Wizarding World from the moment I first started the game. Everything felt alive, lived in with a rich history reaching centuries if not millenia back.This is underlined by a beautiful musical score, that pulls you straight back into memories of the movies.The dialogues are well written and voiced, if anything the player character at times feels a bit thought- or emotionless and I wish we had a lot more choices overall and choices of real consequences specifically throughout the game.The main story is well written and has a few plot twists and surprises. Even the side quests feel engaging and make sense within the world. Sure, some of the sidequests are a bit predictable in their outcome, but it's difficult to write everything with an unexpected twist.The combat is gorgeous and feels intuitive and well balanced from the first moment. It just flows naturally and makes you plan ahead and think about tactics to counter certain enemies and situations.The world is full of things to do and while some of it feels a bit grindy (treasure vaults, Merlin trials, Demiurge moons, the field guide pages), they still gave it sense within the story and many aspects are very engaging.I absolutely adore the magical creatures and wish we had more ways to interact with them. Herbology and Potion making is no big hurdle and doesn't take much involvement to master quickly. I just wish there had been more interactive classes, as these really nailed the feeling of being a student at Hogwarts.So in summary: I am hoping from the deepest of my heart, that we will see Hogwarts Legacy to find a great, resounding success and a multitude of DLCs, expansions and sequels to be released.Yes, there are minor bugs. Yes, the performance at times is abysmal on anything that isn't the most current gen build. But the atmosphere is near damn perfect, their attention to detail astonishing, their closeness to the world palpable from the first moment you start the game. I wish a lot more mainstream developers would take their work as serious and put their everything into it, to make it a through and through enjoyable experience with it's minor ups and downs, like Avalanche did for Hogwarts Legacy.An absolute highlight and contender for game of the year 2023 already and a clear sign, that there are still AAA games of great quality, without weird money grab micro-transactions and other such nonsense."
6559,5Andysalive,https://steamcommunity.com/id/5Andysalive/,1,,1,81.7,February,15,"1,246",0,1,"___It is still good and i still recommend it even to non HP fans. But it's not perfect.  The spell UI. Having only 4 sets of 4 spells is endlessly annoying! I know it's a dpad  thing but there must be a better way. Let alone on a Keyboard. Switching the sets when there are 6 (six) more number keys is tupid already. But there are too many spells you regularly need for even the 4x4 limit. You HAVE to constantly shuffle them around manually. It is plain . And there is not yet a mod that really fixes that. There are some Auto Hotkey script work arounds to avoid the switching but they don't raise the number.  While it is a good Harry Potter esk story with not too much open world filler, the writing is weird. People talk in what the writers probably thought like a 19th century way. It just isn't. It's some weird cumbersome variant of modern english (read some Dickens or Twain to compare)  Also voice acting  is agressively friendly making it highly unimmersive and weird for Slytherin players.Play Hugfflepuff or Gryffindor for the writing CLEARLY is aimed at that.   Biggest one is timers. Like long potion brewing and plant growing timers with very little yield.  It is way too tedious and pace killing. It's busywork that is also slowed down. Then too long spell cooldowns (worse  for the 4x4 switching problem). . Self tips all 2 secs  while doing puzzles are absolutely You feel treated like an absolute  idiot.  Puzzles are not so hard you need them. Deek constantly talking to you. The fast travel lady constantly talking to you....   (mods: NoPuzzleHints, BeQuiet, Deek Silencio)The UI looks suspiciously like AC Oddyssey. And the open world gameplay does of course the ususal things.  But everything about  the game is just much better. You can tell they don't try to sell you XP/Ressource microtransactions because even the level system and the looting/crafting are ok. Much less of it, much less grindy, the world is not spammed with nonsensical xp/loot grind spots, and the level system even make sense in the context, given you are literally learning in a school.  The level system is also much less brickwally.  Fights become more challenging but managable. not: easy. While AC Odyssey: Enemy up to 3 levels above you=Easy. 4 levels above Immortal one hitting god.Tbf AC Valhalla fixed at least that problem too. In HPL you have a hard fight but a chance against high level enemies.  The story takes a much more important role over the open world stuff and isn't an afterthought.Not every side quest is a masterpiece but also no lazy xp grinders.  Or mega lazy ""liberate 10 areas-the end"" crap.   Also the details were more important than plain world size. And finally, no Ubisoft launcher, mod support (No-spider mod available), no forced online crap (+ EAC spyware)...."

If you want a full breakdown of my reasons for each, please view the gdoc.8/10. Overall, surprisingly good. Tastes quite a lot like Horizon: Zero Dawn on the palette.10/10. A tasteful mashup of DMC aerial juggling and CC chaining with a parry-and-dodge system reminiscent of H:ZD and Dark Souls, with the power variety and flexibility of Dishonored.6/10. Predictable, but not boring. Some story beats are poorly followed up on, namely traumatic events that the PC barely acknowledges as even having happened.4/10. Barely saved by the static environment. Textures and area design are fantastic, and Hogwarts is rendered beautifully. The art direction of this game is flawless and deserves the chef's kiss. The dynamic environment, that correlating to AI, Interactables and Immersion, is verging on being beyond subpar. This area of the review is what turns the game from a dynamic, enjoyable Hogwarts experience into a spectator sport. Read the GDoc for a detailed breakdown of what goes wrong where (and there is a lot of going wrong).Overall, Hogwarts Legacy is a game. It is one of the games of all time. It is a  game, but it is still a game. 6/10, the game itself is good, but the little things that would make it brilliant are missing.If you were looking for an immersive Hogwarts simulator, this is not the game for you. If you're looking for a H:ZD half-sibling with a well-rounded combat system, you'll like this a fair bit. If you're a screenarcher, you'll only like the game environments (this game lacking a photo mode is bloody criminal btw)."

The game pushes you to explore a lot before completing main story quests, so I became  very over leveled for a majority of the story content. I finished the game at level 32 when the recommended level for the story was 26 or 28 (This isn't a bad thing, the story scales enemy levels with your own, but not the loot you get). The end game IN MY OPINION feels very unsatisfying due to having no reason to  collect gear outside of selling it, no  reason to collect additional inventory space or a reason to collect ancient magic traces since there isn't any real challenges that I have found left that cant be solved with the resources you gain from just doing about half of the content that can be done easily alongside the story. HOWEVER, IF YOU ENJOY EXPLORING ENVIRONMENTS AND LIKE COLLECTATHONS, BUY THE GAME. I would still recommend the game, its very fun, the combat is fun, most of the puzzles aren't infuriating and the story is interesting for someone whos only experience with this lore is the movies excluding the fantastic beasts movies.8/10"

Sin embargo es muy denso, a cada paso que das tenes algo para hacer.El juego es más lineal de lo que me hubiera gustado pero tiene misiones principales, secundarias (que son entretenidas y no muy repetitivas).No hay Quidditch pero tengo esperanzas que llegue en formato DLC.Si sos fan de Harry Potter no lo dudes y jugalo ya.

There is also another instance where the game broke for a second and I was able to see the X Y Z axis of the spell luminos and the radius of the spell itself. Overall it is worth the 80$ CAD"

The graphics are absolutely stunning, with a beautiful atmosphere that truly immerses you in the wizarding world. The attention to detail in the game is incredible, from the intricate designs of the Hogwarts castle to the lush landscapes surrounding it.One of the standout features of the game is the beautiful music and great sound effects, which create an amazing ambiance that transports you to a magical world. The voice acting is also very good, adding depth and personality to the various characters you encounter throughout the game.Although the performance of the game was initially poor, it has been improved with patches. However, some players still experience issues with ray tracing performance, even with high-end graphics cards like the RTX 3070 Ti.The gameplay in Hogwarts Legacy is excellent, with a wide variety of gear to collect and upgrades to do. The game features 26 spells, including three curses, and the main combat spells are categorized as control, force, and damage. The game also offers a range of side quests and activities to explore, though some of these can become repetitive, particularly the Merlin trials and treasure vaults.Exploring in Hogwarts Legacy can be very rewarding, as you unlock challenges that reward you with combat traits or even gear. The game also boasts a variety of enemies, each with their own vulnerabilities and weaknesses.Overall, Hogwarts Legacy is a beautiful and immersive game that offers a lot of variety and depth. If you're a fan of RPG or action games, you're sure to enjoy this exciting journey through the wizarding world. While it has some performance issues and repetitive activities, the great graphics, music, and gameplay make it a must-play for Harry Potter fans and gamers alike."

I'm only 15hrs in and it's incredible with so much to see and do. My only issue is that they didn't think to add Co-Op....the option for Single Player or Co-Op for those who want it would have made this game 10/10. The Wizarding World is to be experienced together, just like in the movies and books.....so massive let down for them not to give the OPTION. For the Co-Op ""nay sayers"" out there - some of us prefer to play games with people and this game would have been amazing to experience with a friend."
6618,Naico,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034153661/,2,,1,39.6,February,15,170,0,0,"Hogwarts Legacy is a superb blend of world building, story telling and action combat.The pacing of the game feels amazing. It constantly adds new layers of depth to every part of the game as you progress through the story, even though it's already been 22 hours for me.Exploration feels interresting because of the shift between the school and the open world exploration and the content of the world can be both cosy, intense, nostalgic and fresh.Combat adds new ways of handling your enemies if you feel like exploring combo meters and jugling.Your spells can be upgraded to variations that looks over powered on paper but during combat your multitasking skills are still tested."
6619,DEEPBLUE,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102094533/,2,,0,21.5,February,15,21,0,1,"My opinion of this game is it is decent.  It is not amazing and leaves a lot to be desired but it is subjectively fun.  The combat is neat and feels satisfying to fight several enemies.  In other words, your character feels powerful.  Exploring the Hogwarts castle, grounds, and surrounding areas is by far the best part.  Being able to explore a movie set come-to-life is a surreal experience.However, this game lacks a unique character/identity.  Aside from exploration and combat, this game is just like any other RPG you can think of (Assassin's Creed, The Witcher, Shadow of Mordor, etc.) just re-skinned for the Harry Potter franchise.  Reusing a tried and true RPG model of quests, exploration, and combat is perfectly fine.  However, the game needs a compelling story if it is to be a true masterpiece.  The story of this game is mediocre at best.  For as powerful as your in-game character feels, the stakes of the story just are not high enough.  The general storyline feels trivial and a lot of the quests seem pointless.  The root of this problem is the main character (the player character) has no backstory or motivations.  The character's motivations are the player's motivations.  This leads to a story where the player makes seemingly meaningless choices because they do not know what the character cares about.  Not to mention, the main story is exceedingly short and can easily be completed in 15-20 hours (if that).  For an $80 game, I expect more.Take any great story, AC Odyssey for instance.  The main character (whichever you choose) has strong family ties and is given a compelling backstory to make his/her actions in the game seem motivated by some other purpose.  Or The Witcher for that matter; Geralt's actions matter to the player and makes the player choose wisely causing the player to be immersed in the story.  With Hogwarts Legacy, none of your choices seem to matter and each potential choice results in the same milquetoast narrative development.  After 15 hours of gameplay, I found myself not really caring to progress the story anymore because it is downright boring.My other big qualm with this game is the art style and graphics.  The art and graphics feel dated at best.  There is no depth to the characters in cutscenes and all of the character models look far to soft and featureless.  They feel like expressionless bots that just exist to fulfill a narrative ark.  The graphics in general need a lot of work and optimization.  For being a 2023 game, it looks and plays like the Witcher III with Shadow of War-style combat.In short, I really wanted to love this game.  Hogwarts Legacy is fun if you enjoy seeing a piece of the wizarding world come to life in a very cookie-cutter RPG format.  However, its boring narrative and lack-luster graphics make the game seem altogether dull and uninspiring.  A better story and much better graphics would make this game look and feel much more immersive."
6620,Based Matt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thankyoubasedmatt/,2,,1,81.6,February,15,118,0,1,"I cannot contain my happiness knowing that a full, complete, non-alpha/beta, no micro-transactions game of triple A quality exists in a gaming world plagued with so many. It's also a bonus that it is a Harry Potter Game. The game is very well polished, and is extremely responsive. Combat is extremely satisfying once you get into the groove of things, and mount travel just feels right. The story of the game itself feels like another book/movie. It is incredibly immersive and draws you into the game before you even arrive at Hogwarts! Having completed the main story and the vast majority of the side content already, I can 100% say that this is the best game I have played in the last 5 years. I only encountered two bugs, neither of which were game breaking. They got it right the first time, and that is a testament to them choosing to delay their release. I'd much rather play a complete game if it means waiting a bit longer. If you haven't played it yet, you need to."

It's so repetitive that by halfway into the game, after completing the upper half of the map, the character is too strong, so combat is trivial and uninteresting and items and chests only give inferior items, which means that, as we continue to clear the rest of the map, in order to finish our challenges, all the items we get are useless and we must keep selling them. Problem is, there is absolutely nothing to do with money late game, so you just keep gathering more gold, for no good reason.After the first half of the game, you start to feel more like a camera, running around beautiful landscapes, instead of a character that interacts with a real, living world.There is also this weird thing where different groups of NPC consist of the exact same NPC, copy pasted multiple times.Like this one group of three guys, consisted of three copies of the same guy. This happens quite alot.In conclusion, the game is a pleasant experience of exploring Hoghwards and the movies as an open world, however it is far from a master piece, as it requires more finesse in terms of game pace and character progression.It reminds me of Witcher III, which looked amazing at first, but became boring very fast after i had cleared too many camps and too many monsters, and the game became trivial and repetitive even before i finished it.I recommend the devs go away from this console game type of world building, where it feels like you have cleared the same camp of bad guys, and chest, and map puzzle for the 99999th time.It's repetitive, it's immersion breaking and it just hides lack of imagination and diversity behind a wall of quantity, instead of quality. To me, this game feels incomplete, it feels like it could truly be one of the greatest games ever, if it was less repetitive and copy-pasted and more slowly and completely developed, in order to have a longer, more cohesive experience.It shows promise and passion, but ultimately, it fell short for me, as it feels like the development was cut short at some point, for some reason i can't understand."

I would recommend the game, but not at full price as it is right now unless you are a Harry Potter fan and really want to play the game or don't mind the price. Maybe if they release some DLC in the future adding more replayability I could recommend at full price but not as is at release. My save file says I have 56 hours, which I've 100% everything possible to give an idea of game's duration.- Great story.- The map has stuff a bit everywhere, you don't have to travel for minutes before finding enemies or something to do.- Great side quests with the 3 companions.- You are a wizard/witch.- You can tame animal.- You have a personal room you can customise.- Little to no replayability once you 100% the game unless you like redoing the same thing over and over.- Performance. It will probably be patched in near future, but for now I had significant frame drops in certain areas playing in medium with DLSS Performance. My spec: GPU: RTX 3070, CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3800x, RAM: 32gb (though outside those specific areas the game was running smoothly at 140fps, but it was painful having frame drops to like 20fps during intense combat)- Choices does not really matter, there's like 2 story choices that slightly change cutscenes depending on choice anddepending on if you do companion quest before or after certain main quest you might have slightly different dialogue, but otherwise no choice matters.- There's only 3 companions. One from Gryffindor, one from Slytherin and one from Hufflepuff. Sadly no companion from Ravenclaw.- On some aspect (like missing Ravenclaw companion, no quidditch, no wizard chess...) you can tell the devs probably went through development hell and were probably rushed to release a game.- Even though I've put this point in positives for the game, the taming is kinda lacking... You go in every 30 minutes, pet, feed and collect material then leave to come back 30 minutes after to repeat (or ignore completely). Can't really play with the beasts or do anything with them other than this, probably related to previous point.- Same as previous point, but for the room of requirement (your personal room), you don't have much space to customise.- Lack of puzzles. You have tons of Treasure Vaults around the map, but half have no puzzle you just go in and collect treasure chest, the other half are the same 4 - 5 puzzles rehashed over and over and over.- I personally wish classes were a more important part of the game. You get like 2 classes of each subject. First class, you participate because it's teaching you a new mechanic of the game. Second class is a short cutscene which ends with you speaking with teacher after class so you can learn a new spell. I kinda wish it was like in the game Bully, where you have to be present for classes and participate throughout the scholar year as mini-games with rewards for taking all the classes.- Obviously that there was more mini-game in the game, like Quidditch and Wizard Chess, or more puzzles.- That choices had more impact and there was some sort of karma, because there is 0 impact for using forbidden curses."

As for the gameplay, there is really a lot of stuff to do for exploring, questing (please do consider that ""Relationship quests"" are in other category than Side quests). The game took around 40 hours to finish if you rush relationship and main quest. There is still a LOT of side quests and unexplored areas on the map.Regarding the combat, it gives you creativity. You can go full offensive and explode your enemies with sheer power, you can throw them of cliffs, you can go on the dark arts path which is cool. With powerful foes that usually are not affected by what I call utility spells (levioso, flipendo, accio, descendo...) there is a tricky catch, like throwing the troll boulder back at him or flip his club. That is at least interesting for some foes that we thought be tough than the others and a lot harder to kill.Anyway, I knot that I have to beat the game 3 times as a student from each house, and should be more considerate to the side quests to enjoy more parts of the game while at it.PS: Can you imagine living near the castle grounds, getting home after a hard day working, you have dinner, you take a bath and get cozy in your home, then in the middle of the night you hear an teenager whisper Alohomora, enters your house, start walking through chests and then say ""Mine now, Demiguise""?"

But experiencing the school is only one reason why this game is so amazing with the beautiful scenery it shows time and time again to the action and combat it puts you in. Using spells in this game gives you the same feeling as web swinging in the latest Spider-Man game, you feel truly immersed in this world. The story throws you straight into the action and lets you experience your favourite places outside of Hogwarts whilst constantly one upping itself in almost every mission.So many of the negative reviews for this game come from people saying how its in support of JK, when she couldn't be anymore far removed from this adaptation. This game was made by game devs who truly just love the Wizarding World and when you play, it becomes clear just how much care they put into making it enjoyable for everyone."

When I’m introduced to Unforgivable Curses, I’m told that it’s a dark practice that I should never utilize. Moments later, I’m using it to paralyze random wolves prowling the world with no consequence. Even beyond that, I’m never fully able to get over the fact that I’m a young kid wandering into poacher camps, burning human beings alive with magic as they scream in agony, and continuing on with my journey while whimsical children’s music plays.With the said though. The base game itself is fine for a hary potter fan. Around 25 hours in I was starting to feel the burn out with the story. Having no moral code in this game was a poor choice as well."

In most open world games the NPC's blindly walk about on their pathing saying random things that have no context what'so'ever.  Well, you'll see very little of that here.  25 hours in and I'm still seeing fun things from the NPC's such as a couple of students practicing ""walking on walls"" magic and others ""dog fighting"" their enchanted flying books.  Additionally, every inch of the game is pilled high with stuff to see, every shelf is overflowing with trinkets, bits and bobs. Every table is covered in candles, papers, scrolls, coins, etc. Barely any copy pasta if any at all.  All rooms are unique and all places are unique. It's an absolutely gorgeous game.The world is absolutely huge with plenty to explore, complete with dungeons, puzzles and loot.Another great aspect of this game is its progression.  I'm 25 hours in and still unlocking new spells and features.  Unlike most games you unlock skills and abilities through quests that make it make sense as to why you have the new skill instead of just picking it from a menu of abilities. That being said, there is a talent tree as well but those only enhance what you already know and you don't unlock it for quite some time.Fighting is satisfying and the animations are awesome. Flying is intuitive and satisfying. Boatloads of loot to be found and there are a bunch of ways to customize your appearance.All around I'm loving the game and again, unlike most games, I think it's going to hold my interest long enough for me to actually finish it.It's another warner brothers title that hits the spot.  These guys keep churning out gold nuggets.  I'm loving it."

Combat is just so satisfying, the spells and combos you can do are very flashy but combat can still be a challenge if you become complacent. Enemies level up with you as you progress so you'll always have something to fight. You get a modest list of special spells such as Levioso, Accio, Expelliarmus  etc etc to assist with combat, puzzles and traversing dungeons which can be upgraded via a talent tree as you advance with a bonus effect.You can design your own little personal space inside the school if you're into that with decorations, tables, crafting stations, etc. You can also look after animals and breed them like a Wizardy version of animal crossing in your little personal space which in turn give you material. This seems to be a massive feature of the game as you get multiple side missions to go rescue 'rare' animals but sadly I don't think it's utilised fully, maybe in later DLC it'll become worth more investing time to it. Mainly used for upgrading clothing, making potions and plants for battles but the game does give you option to buy your material with in game gold if you can't be bothered doing animal crossing: Hogwarts.Only some minor issues I can think of such as the EN voice acting is a little poor in places and facial animations of your character can sometimes be a little out of place like: ""My father died for me"" Me: SMILES, however, the friends/relations you make are all very wholesome and great experiences. The main story starts off nice and strong with twists and so on but I feel like the shocks and surprises fall off towards the end. Some really good missions though kept me coming back for more. Feel like there could of been more of a house based story line personally along side the main story to make you feel more associated with your house you get sorted into. There is also the odd glitch here and there but usually funny such as ragdolls/item physics doing zoomies into the distance, only game breaking bug I had was I stunned a major enemy during a transition to the final phase which required a reload of the last auto save but the game regularly auto saves so no real biggie. Otherwise the best Wizarding game I've played in a long time. Not sure if I'll ever replay it fully but mods will definitely make me want to revisit the game in future I reckon,I might go visit Professor Garlic again.  All in all, I got 67 hours out of this game so I'd say I've easy got my money's worth."

The only thing that I didn’t like in the game so far: 1. so looooong stairs (I already imagined how students spend 2 hours to get to the cabinet) and a long staircase to the divination cabinet (although this explains why Trelawney rarely left her cabinet) but it's probably cool for guys to climb 10 meters behind girls in skirts... 2. are too obvious secrets of the castle, I would like more searches and puzzles, and not direct highlighting of the same type of secrets (could leave the idea with symbols that do not glow, but hint that spells can be used on them; cracks in the wall; gargoyles that remove some walls for a while (as it was in the very first HP games)3. mechanics of alohomora, here it was either necessary to make more puzzles with complication depending on the level of the castle or not to shove them at all. very boring occupation - pick locks4. obvious looting, going from house to house and robbing in a conditional TES, I approve, but in HP... but okay, I searched everything)I love this game, but I really hope for a dlc with the addition of real secrets in hogwarts without highlighting. less chests possible, but with cooler loot)to those who read this: sorry for my English, this is all a translator! :3"

At first the controls were a little difficult for someone who doesn't really play controller games, but the tutorials and guides helped a lot.

6694,The Cosmic Sausage,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thecosmicsausage/,3,,0,12.4,February,14,131,0,1,"So this review might be different from what other people think but here it goes:This game is relatively good in terms of quality vs what I've seen in other AAA titles.They got Hogwarts right, exploring it was super fun.Gameplay is enjoyable, though repetitive after some time (combat, sidequests). The story is 'meh' (a wizard/witch transferring in the 5th year of Hogwarts? Ancient magic? Kinda reminds me of the type of non-canon stories that I see in Sword Art Online games that are mediocre at best).Lots of content, though some sidequests feel more like chores.Characters feel like they lack depth.Alohomora minigame (seriously? and then there's 3 levels to open different locks and to reach each level I have to look for collectibles that only appear at night?)Basically, after I played the game for a bit, and the rose-tinted glasses were off, I'd say I give it a 6/10. It is good, but I don't think it is a masterpiece, and definitely not worth 60 bucks (or 70 if you got the deluxe edition)."

We all know how HP universe works and this game pretends to be realistic in that way. None of it really makes sense though. Characteristics of your wand - means nothing. Your teachers teach you random spells (like professor Snape... sorry, Sharp, teaches you depulso. Why? Same with others) and all the classes are 30 second montages of ""happy children learning"". We are also KILLING people for poaching???? We can use crucio (and other unforgiving curses) on people with NO CONSEQUENCES whatsoever. So... i guess those were the times, right!?

The only thing that really makes me sad is the performance. I'm sure they'll address these issues in the future but it's a real bummer that almost every big game that comes out these days will be a performance nightmare in the first few months. At the bottom line my recommendation here is that if you are willing to wait a bit longer to do so because other than the missing optimization for pc this is a great game.
6717,Goblin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/OilGoat/,1,,1,16.0,February,14,"1,889",0,1,This game has all the usual problems of the open world genre. Most of the content is brain dead and the actual RPG elements of the game are mediocre at best. But I think this one is a step above the usual Ubisoft tier garbage because of two unique factors. Those being the setting of Hogwarts and the wizard gameplay elements (Spells and Magic Combat). This was enough to win me over but if you don't like these types of games this one is unlikely to change your mind. I hope open world game design progresses beyond it's primordial soup sometime before I die.
6718,NeoWS,https://steamcommunity.com/id/neows/,1,,1,70.7,February,14,90,0,1,"(Basically Spoiler Free & Post-Game Finish)A rather extensive overview on this well anticipated review. Allow me to begin this review by saying that I was in fact very skeptical initially due to the nature and scale of this game, but eventually got it gifted to me by a good friend.--Specs & Gameplay Specifics-GPU: 3060Ti-MONITOR: 144hz/-GRAPHICS: Ultra-DIFFICULTY: Hard-TIME TO FINISH: 25 hours (logged in-game)-OVERALL %: 100% main & side quests, not 100% collectibles.--Hogwarts Legacy (HL) is an insanely ambitious project and tons of passion, dedication and effort has been put into it, and it truly shows and so this review will be segmented accordingly.1) Character Creation & CustomizationHL starts you off rather strong in its character creation, allowing you to pick between character gender, dormitory, hair, scars, voice etc. There is definitely not a huge pool of options, and no sliders for detailed changes, instead opting for a build-your-lego style. Still, the options provided are all great looking, save for the one or two times you may run into an NPC with a striking resemblance to your own character, but it is negligible at worst.You may choose between two voices, one female and one male and then you are allowed a 'Pitch' option to modify it slightly. I get the intent behind this option but cannot recommend anyone use it due to its frankly buggy results. If you care about immersion, then consider leaving it at default to save on the many moments your character will get that slight ""robotic"" tone that comes from pitching.And trust me, your character speaks ALOT.Sooner than later, as anyone could've guessed, you are sorted into a House. The result will be random, or pick the quiz-result option if you link your HP account after taking their sorting quiz. Nonetheless, you are also free to do as Harry himself and disregard the hat, picking your own house.Much to my surprise, the Houses do have some substance to them with different characters and explorable common rooms. The differences aren't huge, and much of the later game remains exactly the same, but it is a nice touch.Do note, you are NOT able to enter other houses' common rooms at any point in the game so if you are an achievement hunter then you will need to create multiple characters.After your initial creation, you can customize your character throughout the game with gear you collect much like any RPG, but they do have a lovely transmog system similar to World of Warcraft that allows you to equip any gear whilst keeping the look you   desire. You can even put up/put down the hood on your robe/cape, should you wish.My only con is that you cannot change or dye any clothes you come across.-----------------2) Combat & Spell-CastingThis is the topic that I find the most discussed second only to the story when it comes to HL. As a nerd of similar games such as Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor & Shadow of War, the combat is simply terrific. Rivaling even those games in certain regards.You unlock spells throughout the game, most are mandatory, some are optional depending on your choices. (These moments are clear, so you won't *miss* the chance)The spells can then be upgraded with gear-enchantments and the usage of ""Talent Points"". Finally, they combine excellently with eachother to allow for insane combo-moves and they end up feeling really smooth to use.If you play on Hard difficulty, certain enemies have shields that need to be matched by a ""Spell-Type"", and along with spell-cooldowns, end up forcing you to use some variation.Combat *can* get a bit repetitive at times but I never found myself rolling my eyes at another battle due to their often quick-pace and difficulty. Do be wary though, should you play on Hard, that multi-wave combat encounters restart ENTIRELY if you die.Outside of Combat, the game provides a million different puzzles and secrets that unlock levels, more gear slots, stronger variants of certain spells and more. It is definitely a much needed breather and makes the world feel more alive, although for those going for 100%, it *will* be a nightmare simply due to the amount of them and how scattered they can be.The variation of spells and their uses kept me intrigued for long, and although certain puzzles get repetitive before you finish all the quests, it kept me pondering throughout all of the main story.Post-game, I eventually gave up 100% as I got bored of fast-traveling through the world to do 2 or 3 puzzles in each and every corner of it.-----------------3) The Story (Spoiler-Free)The MAIN story behind HL is rather straightforward and carries few, if any, truly unexpected twists or turns. It is a straight-forward ""Hero of the Land"" story, where you end up being a main character due to special circumstances in a murky and mysterious plot that aims to end the world you know and love.If you are a fan of the movies, then you can definitely see yourself as ""The Harry Potter"" of this timeline. The side-stories, however, intrigued me more. Many of the side-quests are one-offs, or two-offs, and have a very simple beginning and end, but throughout the game you get acquainted with and get to know a handful of other students at Hogwarts.A few of these students have their own quest-line, and their stories range from ""pretty good"" to ""very interesting"". They are optional for the most part, but I highly recommend chasing after their quests whenever they send for you. They also provide their own unique rewards.Without any spoilers, a big speculation people had was that using the ""Dark Arts"" would have consequences on the story, and this is aided by NPCs (both friendly & hostile) reacting to your usage of it in-combat. Story-wise? It does not. Barely at all. Aside from a few unique sequences of dialogue, I am a bit disappointed to say that there is no apparent consequence to going full dark wizard on the goblins and trolls. That actually brings me well to my next to final point;-----------------4) The QuestsQuests in HL seem never-ending at first. The main story is always given to you, and gradually over the game you are neatly introduced to characters & recurring side-plots. The pace is smooth and well made, and the quests are segmented into quick 20-ish minute adventures with most side-quests being slightly shorter, around 15.They never overwhelm you with things, and the quests rarely ever feel tedious or slow. They can, however, be quite challenging (which in my opinion is a welcome change).Come to think of it, there is only ONE quest that sucked to do and felt reaaallly fetch-questy. But it is, as many things, not mandatory unless you are looking to 100%. (For those who have played the game and are curious, the hint is ""Moon"")Outside of that one quest, never have I to this extent felt as motivated to finish ALL my quests as I did whilst playing through HL. It was simply remarkable! Fun, quick-paced, challenging and intriguing.And just to quickly denote; (!to fit this into the max word limits!)-----------------5) The WorldYou have ""3"" distinct ""sections"" to talk about here.1) Hogwarts ItselfThe castle is ENORMOUS and is LITTERED with secrets, collectibles, interesting rooms, unique furniture, moving paintings, ghosts and just a whole heap of exploration.Many people I know, including myself, opted to not use the fast-travel system anywhere in the castle just so we could use the extra running-time to look around and see all there was to see.2) HogsmeadeA charming village filled with NPCs, shops, quests, the lots. 3) The HighlandsThe rest of the HUGE world map filled with smaller towns, the forbidden forest, ruins, castles, NPCs etc.All in all, the world felt truly boundless for my first 14-ish hours, with changing seasons and amazing lighting/wind/snow effects.-----------------This is by far my one true GOTY for 2023."

Exploring is one of the best things you can do with so many options of activities within the map. It is addictive and gives you the feeling of magic that you expect from such a game. The story is just ok, nothing special, created to simply introduce you to the world of magic. The only downside so far is the major performance issues which I hope will be resolved with a driver update in the near future."

6746,Larcorba,https://steamcommunity.com/id/larcorba/,1,,0,22.1,February,14,317,0,1,"I was kind of excited to play this, even bought an RTX 3080 which I had been eying for a while to experience it with Ray Tracing on.The game world looks absolutely stunning. especially on Ultra with Raytracing. I get around 60-90fps with a drop here and there to 50 while loading an area. This is on 1440p with DLSS set to quality.  Amazing game world and graphics out of the way, let's talk combat.The combat system is also a highlight of this game, it feels fast paces and intuitive. Bit easy at points once you progress, but fun!So, why the negative recommendation? The game does not feel like an RPG at all... Every single choice you make in the game has literally zero effect on the overall world around you. It feels very much like playing an early 2000 game, with the quests being basic and the dialogue being just plain awful. Honestly, it makes for you to have a complete disconnect from the world and your character. Nothing close to how Skyrim, The Witcher or RDR2 makes you feel a connection to the world.I mean, this is an RPG. World connection and feeling the impact you have on it should be number 1 on the list and it's unfortunate. Meanwhile I'm casting Crucio left and right. Right next to my... Teacher? Feels odd that there's no real dark/light wizard kind of system in place to impact what you do and who you do it with.Either way, 15 year old student mass murdering everyone with the dark arts and still everyone around you celebrating you as a hero! Not my cup of tea.Get it on discount for ~20 euro and it's a fun experience. But I can't recommend it for a full price AA RPG as it is advertised."
6747,UsedCashew,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Usedcashew/,1,1,0,36.3,February,14,221,0,1,"Rant below aside. Here is why I negatively reviewed it.This is not a Fable Harry Potter game like the ""Hype"" and information developers talked about, lead people to believe.You are stuck on a path in the story and you cannot deviate from it. There is no dark wizardy. There is just dumb hero has special powers and has to save the day.The story is mid-tier at best. You quickly lose interest 5 hours in when you see the predictability in the plot.A lot of things just don't make sense in the game. This is definitely not ""Student at hogwarts"" simulator by any means. It is very clear that the world around you doesn't react at all to you in terms of choices / actions like going into the dark forest. Teachers are completely oblivious to the kind of wizard you're being and the students in the castle are just there. They exist to provide you a school atmosphere but they are no different than the paintings on the wall.Everything is aesthetics and aesthetics alone. The enemies you fight are the same at level 1 as they are at level 30 so combat gets old really quick.Spells are locked behind side quests and extremely long winded treasure hunting for objects designed to waste your time. This entire game is a time wasting simulator. A lot of forced slow walking, a lot of dialogue that gets dried out because its taking from stories you've heard many times before in other games. ""Go help this person, oh I wonder where the butterflies go, oh you found a chest? So cool, you can keep what's in it, I just wanted to know what was there."" You essentially waste most of your time doing things for people who just wanted to know what was at the end of the rainbow out of curiosity. I feel like this entire game is a troll.Rant Below if you want to laugh.Game robs you of challenging combat if you lose too much. It holds your hand like a little baby with a hidden difficulty tailoring system.Example. Died to 2 spiders 4 times, was having fun, it was my first hard fight in the game. What did Warner Brothers decide was best for me here? They gave me the ability now to 1 shot both spiders and end the encounter in 3 seconds because they didn't want me to get frustrated like a little baby.I'm an adult. F you for doing that #$%! to me. I have since had a bad taste in my mouth continuing your game. I am just trying to blow through all this crap and finish the story.Will not buy another ""Oh don't lose too much and feel bad little baby, we will make the game easier for you now because you died!"" game like this again.A lot of treasure hunting just to be able to unlock the unlock spell, very time consuming and irritating to experience.There is just so many things that treat you like a child and waste your time that build up over time and really rob you of playing the game the way you want to play. Not at all new or inspiring. I'm at 40 hours now and spend most of my time just petting my animals, tired of going out and doing the main story quest. Not sure if I even want to finish it because something tells me, I can't even get the ending I want since I am forced to be the chosen hero who saves the day."

Great visuals, good performance if you use your head a bit, good voice acting, decent face animations.  GREAT COMBAT.  Addicting exploration.Performance:  I run an RTX 3060ti and 11600k system with 3600mhz cl16 ram (16gb)  I can't say i've had any problem that i couldnt directly just call ""running out of steam"".  With RT on at 1440p, everything maxed (dumb idea regardless of what gpu you have btw) i sit at roughly 48 fps with highs up in the 60's and lows down to the mid 30's.  I can't call that bad by any means given it is a mid range gpu from last generation.  Turn off RT and it shoots to above 100 and is smooth as butter. You can tell they really used RT in development to ""bake"" most of the lighting for non RT mode and it shows well.  I truly do with RT reflections were the only function and that they were a bit more polished.  Calling this game optimised is not exactly what i'd call accurate.  Mostly just people being let down by their hardware configurations not playing nicely for one reason or another.Story: I'm just about to get my broom, but i'm already almost lvl 20 due to that addicting ping while looking for pages.  The voice acting has seemed great so far aside from one fact...DO NOT CHANGE YOUR VOICE PITCH.  You cannot change it later and it DOES sound quite modulated even at 1 level off the normal.  I fell in love with professor Garlik, take from that what you will, the woman is fine.All in all i'd say definitely worth looking into if you are at all a fan of the HP universe.  As far as controversy goes...please at least do yourself the favour of googling the whole story before just jumping on the bandwagon for one side or another.  Do a little critical thinking and be rational.  Stay off posts if you truly care about people spoiling the ending, but i will likely forget about it long before i ever reach that point in the game.  No one ever mentions the lady for the first Merlin quest having a wife. *shrug* this whole thing seemed like people waiting with foam bullets for their time to strike and it fell short.   Do something productive rather than propagating negativity with negativity.  Two wrongs have always made the second person look worse."
6758,The Minted Lady,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037517236/,1,,1,85.3,February,14,348,0,1,"Hogwarts Legacy is every bit as magical as it is described in the store page. Speaking as someone who is not actually into Harry Potter, the game has surpassed my expectations on how it emulates the experience of being a student at a prestigious school for wizardry.I bought this game because the promotional material made it look like something that might interest me. The world itself is very open, and there are plenty of side missions and collectibles to keep you occupied. However, you will find your progress blocked by the need for certain spells that can only be obtained by completing the main quest line. That shouldn't discourage you from exploring the world the first chance you get, just be mindful that some areas may not be accessible until a certain part of the story.Combat is simplistic enough to make you feel like a powerful spellcaster, but also challenging enough to keep you on your toes. As you learn more offensive and defensive spells, you can make all your combat encounters seem like a graceful ballet of defeat for your foes.My particular favorite part of the game is the clothing customization. Whenever you pick up a new garment, its visual appearance is stored in a menu that lets you customize the look of any equipment you're wearing. They definitely knew what they were doing when they made that, because there is a huge list of high fashion items in this world.The story itself is typical: You are THE person who can do something no one else can do, so you're sent to Hogwarts to hone your skills and figure out what's up with some angry faction who also happens to be on the lookout for the MacGuffin that only you can deal with. That said, this version of the story is custom to the wizarding world and fits the overall theme of the game. You will definitely feel like a student with the various classes to attend and students to talk to.Thankfully, the main and side quests can be done at your own pace. Even though there is a day/night cycle, you won't get in trouble for not attending a class on a specific date, or being out of your dorm past curfew.I've barely run into any bugs, and certainly none that were game-breaking. The one thing I would caution against, however, is using the pitch option to try and change the tone of your main character's voice. As of writing this, whatever program they use for that makes the voice sound horribly robotic. It's best just to leave it on default for now.Sadly, an otherwise great game is currently the topic of controversy because the creator of the franchise it comes from has some ongoing controversy of her own. Do know that if you purchase this game, that person will get royalties from its sales. If that bothers you, then you probably shouldn't buy it. But it is a quality game with a lot of open world RPG elements and stunning graphics."

First thing i noticed was that there were little to no bugs. Didn't encounter a single bug until my 3rd day playing it; about 25 hours in, and it was a simple loading error of an asset during a mission. Just had to reload. Game plays solid, it looks beautiful, it's such an adventure. However, i will have to agree with others on how disappointing it is that whether you're good or bad, there's no positive/negative outcome. Regardless of your decisions, everything turns out the same. Therefore, I encourage you to extort everyone you help to get that money to buy those spellcrafts you desire so bladly ;) This is one of those games that makes me want to be a completionist and find get every single achievement that I can."

There is so much room for growth here.  So many different ways they can go with this.  I can't wait to see what more they have in store for us.

I enjoy the beautiful layout and I am enjoying the story a nice bit I think it is well worth your purchase should you want to get the game, however, there are some negatives that you should know about there are spoilers so if you don't want to be spoiled don't read after number 31st The game doesn't have the real Hogwarts feel to it without spoilers I can't say much but it really doesn't give the Hogwarts feel even though it is Hogwarts.2nd The game removes a lot of the funnier aspects you would of like to play and gets rid of the wonder that it could have had.3rd there is a lot of wasted potential.  I am going to touch a bit on the top parts with spoilers now1st A) you don't get the experience of properly going to Hogwarts as a new student since you start in the 5th year. (this is due to the story but it does take away from the feel of Hogwarts.)1st B) You don't get the experience of having a connection with the world by them letting you outright choose or forcing choices early game. ex. It would be cool for you to have done a quiz or a mission with multiple ways to beat/answer to choose in order to get your wand and house assigned Instead you outright choose both also the fact you can't choose a pet is pretty upsetting since it is a part of being a student they just give you an owl.2 A) there is no quidditch which I found in the older games to be one of the most fun aspects. on top of that the world and the classes feel empty, I wish they would have used the fact it is a school to better uses for content a nice bit of the spell learning is just handed to you and is way too easy to obtain and is not rewarding to obtain this is also sort of the cover for number 3 as well since it shows aspect of how things are under used.Overall this game is a 6.5/10 its pretty good but its not close to perfect they really could of done a much better job with it but i due enjoy the product they put out."

6779,Jazrael,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jazrael/,1,,1,85.9,February,14,219,0,1,"As with many PC releases, you will get numerous graphical glitches and performance issues. Hogwarts Legacy has its share of these. These are minor in comparison, though, and extremely easy to look past. There are many workarounds for stuttering and performance issues. I was lucky not to suffer any of this on my laptop and base station and enjoyed extremely smooth experiences. What surprised me was how impressive the game looked in places, even with lower graphical settings in use. From a visual standpoint, from spell effects, scenery, character models and overall ambience, I couldn't fault it. Combat is where the game shone for me. It's fluid, responsive, smooth and visceral. The spells felt impactful on hit and carried weight with them. Not once did I find myself getting bored with the combat. The one area of advice I have about this - make sure you get the spell slot upgrades early on. As expected, the music changed pace with the game, lending to the immersion and capturing the nostalgia. When the main story finishes, the game doesn't end. There is much more to be explored and other stories to delve into.  The game keeps you compelled by intrigue in the story and the world's details."

Shag-all to the shenanigans going on about this game, it's fun. That's the point and the only hope we can give to vidya as a collective whole. Anyway here's a three hour review of mostly wandering aimlessly and just enjoying the immediate world.The parallels to the 'Shadow Of' series are really nice, lending to fluid gameplay. I must say it is indeed a YMMV moment as far as if KB/M is more or less comfort than a Controller so play whichever you prefer.Do you like collectibles and puzzles? We gotchu boo~. Mirror puzzles that encourage exploration too, so there's no need to feel bad about sidetracking for all the shinies before the main quests! Just... remember to come on back eventually because some of those will be locked behind progression.Plenty of loot for the looter, of which you can apparently find high-tier items from quite literally the first chance you get to play, and plenty of glamour for the true end game of all; Fashion.The minor irk that I did find is the Protag voice. Voice pitches are a bit odd? I don't quite enjoy them in other games and I *half* tolerate this one? Cutscenes have a habit of making our Protag sound terribly warped if the ambient sounds or voice effecting properties of the room are just right. But hey there's even some good news! Voice pitch is something you can alter whenever, so y'know~"

6785,Leon_Lover94,https://steamcommunity.com/id/brevlada/,1,,1,116.0,February,14,677,0,1,"This review may contain spoilers - read with caution~ooo~I'm currently sitting on just over 30 hours of actual gameplay and I think I'm about 4-5 quests away from completing the main storyline of the game. Now, I could wait till I have finished the main quest line before writing this review, but I doubt my opinions are going to change so why wait.To start, overall I've really enjoyed my experience thus far playing this game. It's not often I sink so many hours so quickly into a game. I've always been a massive fan of Harry Potter and the Wizarding world, so finally having the opportunity to fully immerse myself into that world felt like a dream. But unfortunately, the immersion I was hoping for just doesn't exist within Hogwarts Legacy...let me explain.Aesthetically, the game is beautiful; the castle is exciting to explore, the main village of Hogsmead feels just like it did in the books and movies, and the areas outside of the school feel fully fleshed out and interesting to explore. The characters of the main story feel interesting enough to hold the story together, although they did fall flat in some areas; in personality and motivational drive. The story itself is overwhelmingly short for a game that costs as much as it does, even if the game is inflated in other areas. The story should be able to hold down the price, not be boosted by the aesthetics and extra content in the game. I would expect at least another 10-15 hours of main quest game play for how much I paid for the game; which was just over $100 NZD for the deluxe edition.This game needed a morality system in my opinion because nothing that you do impacts the world and story at all. No decision you make, nor dialogue option you choose has a huge impact on the story and world around you; which was something that was promised in early trailers and teasers for the game. It was actually something I was looking forward to the most. But in Hogwarts Legacy, whether you make a good or a bad decision, the outcome is tragically the same. This means that the developers really only wanted to give you the facade that your decisions mattered when in reality you were just playing their story, and your decisions meant nothing at all.Outside of shop keepers and quests lines, you are unable to interact with the other npc's, teachers or your companions. This makes the world feel boring, empty and lifeless. Most of the npc's and students you walk past don't even talk to one another; you might see their mouth moving but no words are coming out. Instead the developers gave us the guise of ""companions"" that are dangled in front of our faces but then locked behind the main quest line or side quests. What is the point of pretending that we can have companions when they cannot accompany us on missions? And it's such a shame because a lot of the characters I've met while playing the game I really liked and wanted to know more about them, but simply wasn't able to. Characters like Ominis, Lenora, Sebastian and Poppy. It just feels like wasted potential.One thing I do enjoy about the game is the combat, I think they did a wonderful job translating the well known spells from the franchise into the game. I think they're easy to use, like most other RPG games tied to a button; and you can do a multitude of different combinations to find something that works well for you. I do think some spells like Alohamora shouldn't be locked behind a mandatory puzzle. It makes sense to do the puzzle the first time, but having to do it every time after that feels boring and repetitive. Not to mention that you then have to level it up twice more, putting in a lot of effort for very very little reward.To conclude, I do love this game, truly I do. It really brought the wizarding world to life (mostly), but it just falls flat where immersion and interaction is concerned. I'm hopeful that maybe things can be tweaked with future updates and DLC, which I have no doubt we can expect with how successful the game has been. If you enjoy open world RPG style games, even if you don't like Harry Potter I think you'll love this game.8.5/10"

Highly recommend, even at full price. Read more for breakdown.===== What I liked =====- The Combat: So much damn fun, it's got a very unique feel.- Lovable Characters: All of the characters I've run into are awesome!- Slytherin Side Quest: You must complete this quest! It was fantastic.  - Music: It's really good, even the little jingles when you find something are amazing! - Room of Requirement: I love this concept, I hope they expand on it in coming games.  - The Sights: This game has a lot of breath taking moments and scenery.===== Things you should know =====- Limited Side Quests: Once you complete the main quest, there isn't much you can do. It's not packed with quality like TW3, DAI, or Skyrim. Not a bad thing tbh, means I can get my life back faster haha.- Weird Movement: When out of combat, jumping, running on uneven ground, and flying feel a bit unnatural. It's not a big deal. ===== What I didn't like ===== - Horrible Identical Side Quests: Most of the side quests given from random NPC's are shallow, repetitive, and brain numbing. This is not like TW3 where we are graced with side quests like ""Wild at Heart"". - Merlin Trials: Super boring, repetitive, and mind numbing. I can't believe we need to complete Merlin quests for more inventory.- Lock Picking: God I hate lock picking in this game. It's the worst of any game by FAR.- Extremely Linear: While the story was good, I won't be playing it six or seven times through like DAI or Skyrim. There is little to no change in the story regardless of what you do. - Slow: Damn, this game is so SLOW! Loading up, or fast travelling, it's so much slower than modern Assassin's Creed games. - Visual Glitches: Unloaded textures, wonky animations, broken side quests, nothing completely game breaking, but still a bit of a let down.- Restrictive Exploration: You can't explore nearly as much as you'd want, or at least, I couldn't.   - No Quidditch: What the heck is wrong with the dev team? ===== OVERALL ===== Solid game - 7.5/10 Unlike TW3 or DAI, your kids can play this! It's a fantastic game, and I can't wait for more content!P.S.: I don't even like Harry Potter, this game was just so much fun!"

Makes me kinda feel like a kid in their imagination too with all the random magic around. Like there's empty suits of armor all around, but they move around when you go near them because they're magic. And there's these two suits of armor I walk by a lot and they always punch each other or something. I get a laugh out of it every time."

I literally can run Cyberpunk 2077 with raytracing on, but this game, on low with no raytracing, just does not run well. I know that it runs well for other people, but I've also been doing research and I'm not the only one with this issue. The game is borderline unplayable.It's a shame.Update : 2-1-23 - It got an update that seemed to fix all the issues I was having, then a tiny update seems to have undone all of it, and is unplayable once again, all in the span of one week. Within the time I had to play it, it seemed fun, but not worth the issues that I'm having with it."

Story 9/10 (takes a while to get going, but good once it does, beginning is different based on house, so maybe Ravenclaw is not as fun at the beginning, my daughter played Hufflepuff and had a much cooler opening questline)Graphics 9/10 (looks great, some lip sync issues in dialogue, but overall really good)Combat 9/10 (casting spells is great, limited to 4 per set and 4 sets total kind of stinks as switching in big fights is a little wonky IMO)Meta Games 10/10 (love the room of requirement, beats, all the random things to do is really fun)Overall 9.5/10, honestly if it had quidditch I probably would give it 10/10"

Unless you have a very weak tolerance, nothing is game breaking.Played half the game using my steam deck while on was on vacation and while I had to accept that it will dip in frames sometimes, I honestly didn't even notice it when things got going.

As far as I know you can visit ALL the rooms you can imagine from the books/films. Most iconic rooms are identical to the ones from the movies. You cant even imagine how big and detailed Hogwarts is. You meet familiar names, ancestors from well known characters. the sidequests are amazing, maybe more so than the mainstory :/. If you are a HP-fan, you HAVE to play this game. You wont be disapointed."
6838,BrandyDerg,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BrandyDerg/,1,,1,22.9,February,14,118,0,1,"By far one of the best AAA launches from the last years. F There's just something about the game. Awesome value for the money I'm having loads of fun, and it's mostly with exploration and finding secrets.  This game basically did what ubisoft has been trying to do, having a map saturated with similar quests/collectables but actually managed to make it fun."
6839,Not Max,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxLH44/,1,,1,9.7,February,14,66,0,1,"Graphics:The graphics are amazing and true to the Harry Potter universe. The attention to detail is mind-blowing, from the castle of Hogwarts to the beautiful forests surrounding it. The characters are well designed and have a unique look to them. The creatures and creatures, like the dragons, centaurs and house elves, are also well designed and give a sense of wonder to the world.However, the graphics optimization is not the best. There have been reports of frame rate drops and some graphical glitches during play. This can be distracting and take away from the immersive experience of the game. Hopefully, future updates will address these issues.Music and Sound:The music in this game is fantastic and brings the world of Harry Potter to life. It captures the magic and wonder of the world and sets the tone for each scene. The sound effects are also well done and add to the immersion of the game. The spell casting sounds powerful and the creatures sound like they should.Verdict:Overall, despite its flaws with graphics optimization, Hogwarts Legacy is a fantastic game for fans of the Harry Potter universe. The story is well crafted and the world is beautifully designed. The gameplay is engaging and there are plenty of things to do and explore. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series, this game is definitely worth checking out. However, if you are not a fan, it might not be for you. The game is also not without its issues it has quite bad fps optimizing and some few bugs (as expected on a new game), but the overall experience is still enjoyable."

You can also design your own room with all kinds of things, grow your own plants and make cool potions. The only thing this game is lacking really, is the unforgivably horrible dialogues. I would call myself a very casual gamer, so I can enjoy any story whether it's good or bad. But the problem with this one, is that the dialogue world feels so extremely unnatural. Everyone just acts like robots when you interact with them. This means that all these extra dialogue options you can choose aren't really there to get more invested emotionally to these characters, but are more there for just extra information, which ultimately leaves a kinda whacky story tbh.Other than that, they just need to optimize this game a bit better, and it should be just fineI'd give this game a 10 if the dialogue world was more natural spoken like uncharted or red dead redemption 2, but I guess nobody can make good quality anymore..7/10"

6858,HFC Steel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hfcsteel/,1,,1,19.4,February,14,99,0,1,"I barely recommend this game because it's fun, has a cool story, and because I love the world of Harry Potter. That's about it.The combat is unimaginative. Other than the graphical portion of combat, it's all very elementary.There is little to no engagement other than combat. The spell learning sequences and beast interactions are laughably pointless, to the point where it seems like someone said ""wait, all this game is is 70% cut scenes and 30% repetitive combat. Let's make them move their mouse a bit so it's full immersion!""On that note, the cut scenes are gorgeous...but if you're strictly following the campaign with only some side questing, it feels like you're playing through an interactive movie. Maybe not so much of a complaint on my end, but many people don't enjoy that gameplay so I feel like it was worth mentioning.Somehow, someway, you're a 15 year old kid with 2 months of magic experience and you're able to take on groups of up to a dozen 30 year old witches and wizards with decades of experience. Why?This game is riddled with American politically motivated decisions. I don't even have to mention exactly what these decisions are, because every single person playing this game, no matter what ""side"" you're on, feels how unnatural these decisions feel when experiencing the game. I have no side...one side refuses to acknowledge that JK Rowling made awfully rude and disrespectfully remarks, and one side has become worse bullies than the ones they swore to fight against. This turmoil is on full display in the mess of rushed and forced development decisions littered throughout the game.Hogwarts Legacy is fun, in an arcadey way, but still entertaining in a movie sort of way. Take that for what you will, and I recommend a play due to those factors, but I believe it has still missed the mark on pleasing a good amount of gamers."

I know the 60 dollar price point is a bit high but trust me its worth every penny. I've spent hours roaming the halls of the school as well as the grounds around and at 60 hours in i still haven't fully filled out my map nor have i completed even 50% of the challenges page the game has to offer.  The devs that made this game smashed it out of the park and really deserve to be praised for what they've done.

Phenomenal graphics. Engaging story. Tonnes of side quests to get lost doing. But 99% of my time has just been exploring, adventuring, flying and just finding my way around this insanely detailed universe. The lore is based on the books as apposed to be the movies such as the staircase etc, the paintings moving and talking as you pass, the knights in armour fighting sometimes. The devs deserve big kudos for putting this all together with such attention to detail and love for the HP universe. Each time the game introduces a new features I'm blown away amazed at how much content the game has already. [Slight spoiler] but the game throughout the story hints at qudditch so many times I wouldn't be surprised if it was a DLC down the line. Overall going to sync ♥♥♥♥ tonnes of hours in playing as every house, being a goody two shoes to being an evil wizard."

I will say though I have encountered issues with frame rate drops and the game randomly crashing so as of now it's okay I will say I would rate it higher if it included some things like new game plus and the ability to unlock all talents as It bugs me having all these things that will forever remain incomplete. so I would personally rate it like a 7/10 because the world is beautiful.

It's an endless world, full of opportunities for countless stories.

SAVES ARE NOT ACCURATE, e.g. 5 minutes ago save reloads into a save 10 seconds ago. Items we collected are not saved correctly.These 3 problems happen very, very often. Also clothes are displaced sometimes on a npc. Like their cloak literally becomes an apron, we see the back of their pants inside their cloak. That's weird, but really funny.

The graphics and atmosphere are amazing and really capture the feel of Hogwarts from both the movies and books. There is a periodic issue with rendering though I have the graphics higher then then the recommended settings. The game also has an interesting and engaging story/side quests that build up the world and the characters within it. Last but not least the game has a flowing and well executed combat system. This is the Harry Potter game I always wanted when I was young, and its wonderful to play as an adult."

It has it all, character creation, action, fight, tactics, upgrades, different path's to take as a character, and the game looks so good.  It pushes my 2080 to it's max on 1440p but that is expected.  If you have a newer system with 3070 or higher, and decent CPU you'll be fine.  At 60fps I've a had a great experience.  Some lag, not much at all, turn down settings to medium and DLSS to help out and you are right at 60 almost always.  That's a 2080 and a 9700K.  Don't judge me lol.  Anyway, great game."

Also lags like hell on 3080 unless  you are willing to turn down settings, and still it manages to lag often. You can have perfect 60 fps one second, and drop to 10 the next one, especially in castle. Otherwise it's a great game, I'm sad I finished it, I hope there will be some dlcs soon.P.S.

I've played every single version that had previously come out for PC, but you really can't compare.Although the game is still new and experiencing some issues (mine started randomly crashing when I go to Hogsmead), this is to be expected at this point and I am choosing to have faith that the devs will release updates to correct and optimize the game as it grows.The scenery is amazing, the castle is stunning and everything you could imagine Hogwarts would be. The world is vast and has plenty of exploration available as well as puzzles to crack. At the beginning it may feel slightly boring, but, as you progress through the story, you'll see that there's a lot to do.I am just happy I finally got my letter and can be a true part of Hufflepuff 🦡💛I hope that the future of the game won't stop here and we get to explore even more through DLC, and, who knows?

The world is fantastic and it's all we HP fans wanted and more.The game may not run that fine on your computer, your mileage may vary on that tho."
6959,Pqliar,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960420054/,1,,0,10.9,February,13,144,0,1,"IMO the game is overrated. First off, I had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out technical issues with the game. Even though the game utilizes about 50% of an RTX 3080 GPU the game still manages to completely destroy the VRAM forcing to tune down the texture settings to medium. Feels like there is some poor texture optimization going on with the game.However, this is not why I would negitively  rate a game. The whole game feels like a half baked open world RPG game.  Yes it is detailed but there are some elements that are just well, wrong. Character development for example. You create a character and bang, you are in the game, clueless who the f*** you are, what your background is. You just feel like some random character in a game. Then, in the prologue, they pretty much spoiler the s*** out of the game by revealing the final enemy. I just hate it when games do that.  The story feels blend and the characters extremely forgettable.The facial mocap feels like it is something from pre source engine. It is static, emotionless, and pretty much completely destroys the experience in wanting to explore this game any further.  On the surface, the game looks good but if you look a bit deeper the lightning feels off, there is this weird day & night cycle that doesn't add up, the collecting gear that doesn't make any sense whatsover. Potion crafting that requires you to wait endlessly.The guide book and menu is slow and sluggage due to the amount of animations they have put in. You have to access it a lot if you want to know where you are going or if you want to access your inventory. I would score this game 6 out of 10 at best because the developers did do a decent job at capturing the visual atmosphere of the harry potter movies. but everything else seems a forgettable and irritating experience. I severely regret paying full price for this and letting myself being led by the positive reviews that have been put on steam."

6962,Naberius,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075382117/,1,,1,65.1,February,13,176,0,1,"Honestly, it doesn't matter if you're a fan of the universe the game takes place in or not. The lore, the characters, and the rather nicely sized open world map feel nice to explore in, the combat is fun, and for once we have the rare and exquisite quality of having NPCs that match your movement speed. Plus, being able to deck yourself out in whatever cool clothes you want as collected cosmetics and still keep the stats of the better gear is a wonderful addition that more games need to replicate. For fans of the franchise, it's a lovely delve into a world you're already familiar with and getting to see different sides of wizarding life like you haven't gotten to before. For those people who are just buying it to try it because of the hype, you will not be disappointed. Go out, explore the Forbidden Forest, jump into the Black Lake, and soar through the skies to your hearts content while blasting people apart with your favorite spells. The devs and everyone behind the scenes creating the game and storyboard for it have put together a fantastic experience."

Regarding the gameplay, the devs have taken a very interesting approach. The fact that it's an open world where you're free to visit any corner of Hogwarts and it's surroundings adds a huge depth to the immersive side of the game and the story. All the details are there and even more. The fighting mechanics are really cool so far but I feel them a bit stiff and repetitive at times. The combo mechanics give some Devil May Cry vibes - you either like it or not. Weird enough, there are some staircase that you'd like to jump from in order to take shortcuts and the character gets blocked by invisible walls. Meanwhile others staircases that are much higher will let you fall through and let you die.Adding the Dark Arts path was a great addition to the game.The flying mechanics on the broom are nice but they do feel a bit off at times. Also I really do hope they add Quidditch in a future DLC.Graphics 10/10Sounds effects 10/10Atmosphere & Music 10/10Storyline 10/10Gameplay 9/10So far the game is a masterpiece and I can't wait to dive even deeper and unravel all the mysteries that it has to offer.Highly recommended"

It does not require much learning the mechanic of the game if you have previously played game like this before; e.g. The Witcher 3, Shadow of Mordor, etc. However, this is a wizardry game so you will have to remember well where you put the shortcut for each spells to make combat go smoothly.The puzzles also required a bit of getting an understanding for each type, but once you are used to them you will not have a hard time solving them. I would say that you should stick to the main story quests until you nearly have all the core spells to start exploring and solving puzzles. This way you don't have to spend too much time trying to solve a puzzle that you might not have the spell for it just yet.Overall, I have not felt playing a game that I just get lost track of time since The Witcher 3 until I picked Hogwarts Legacy. I am not a hardcore fan of Harry Potter (I do enjoyed the movies a lot), but I could get into the lore and history of this franchise easily with so much information provided while exploring. I would recommend this game for those who can enjoy game without rushing to finish. There are so much to do beside the main story. However, make sure that you have a capable enough hardware to run this game smoothly before buying. At the moment (February 2023), this game still has not been optimized well to run on older hardware. I am running this game on Ryzen 7 7700x, 32 GB DDR5 (5600 mhz), Radeon RX 6800 XT 16 GB at 1440p on ultra setting without any real problem. Although, I have tried running this game on a portable gaming device with Ryzen 7 5800U, 16 GB LPDDR4 (4233 mhz), Radeon Vega 8 APU 3 GB on low setting at 900p, and it can struggle to keep 30 FPS sometimes."

6970,Simp4Ghostface<3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZakRs1/,1,,1,35.7,February,13,82,0,1,"Overall 8/10The game is an amazing game as a standalone, but as part of the Harry Potter franchise, for any fans, this is one of the biggest services to a fandom I've seen. From the music, to Hogwarts itself, to the way you learn spells like in the past games, this game is MAGICAL. So much work has been added to the small details of the game, as well as the game as a whole. Full voice acting throughout the entire game, even for your main character (which I don't know any other game that actually voice acts the main character that you play). This game is a love song to the Wizarding World.The only downside is the very poor optimisation that I seem to experience on PC. Playing on an Nvidia 3080 with a strong processor and 32gb of 3200ddr4 ram, its shocking that I experience the issues that I do. I cannot make full use of my Odyssey G9 monitor, and even playing on windowed, if I try to run YouTube or other streaming sites, even sometimes just general browsing, it hates me switching windows and often crashes. Heavy FPS drops are also quite common. Once these issues are patched out the game is a solid 12/10, but these have made my experience in playing the game quite regrettable at times."

6974,Retrific,https://steamcommunity.com/id/retrific/,1,,1,42.1,February,13,355,0,1,Finally a AAA game worth playing.But don't expect your choices to matter. Also don't expect to be able to avada kedavra just anyone. Also no quidditch or any famous places you know from the Harry Potter universe (except for hogwarts and hogsmeade). I wouldve preferred a more present time universe so I can visit those places but whatever. The combat controls are also not that great. I got dozens of perfectly fine keys here on my keyboard. Sucks to be forced to scroll through sets of 4 spells at a time.8/10

Plus it's a really cool game!  There are only 3 genders - man, woman and ♥♥♥♥!_____________________________Если вы считаете, что транс женщины не женщины, если вы супер натурал, если вы нормальный мужик или женщина, если вы за традиционные ценности - покупайте! К тому же это очень классная игра! Есть только 3 гендера - мужчина, женщина и ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!"

Well, except the Depulso ones which can be more tricky.Definitely one for the achievement hunters as there are so many things to find outside of the main story."

Combat is nice, only issue i have is that some enemies are stuck especially near corners and they keep running around themselves. But overall i am impressed, hope Quidditch was part of the game as well."
6979,D4RK XCVIII,https://steamcommunity.com/id/D4RK_XCVIII/,2,,1,48.5,February,13,30,0,1,This game honestly surprised me as I wasn't hyped about it one bit. I thought it was going to have a rather empty world very similar to what the AC franchise/etc seem to think is alright to release. But to my surprise this game offers an incredible detailed world and there's always something to look at/do/fight around every corner or field. The story and side quests feel fun play and I'm excited to start multiple new games with each of the houses!
